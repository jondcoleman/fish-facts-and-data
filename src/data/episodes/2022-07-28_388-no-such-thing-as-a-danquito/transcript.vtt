00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.600
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show we have an

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.580
 announcement to make. It's a bit of a serious one. It's that for a while we are not going to be able to

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.280
 record our podcast from our spiritual home, our Covent Garden office anymore and there's a simple reason for that and

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.140
 the reason is that we are going on

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.200
 on tour. That's right. I tricked you all. It wasn't bad news. It's good news. You thought someone had died. Quite the reverse

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.680
 we're going to be on tour live and amplified across the entirety of the UK and Ireland.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.700
 We're going to be going all over the shop. Are we going to Barnstable? You bet your bum we're going to Barnstable.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.540
 Are we going to pool? As a rule, we're going to pool and 25 other places across the UK and of course not to forget Dublin.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.000
 I know what you're thinking. What's the show going to involve? Well, I'll tell you it's going to be a live

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.640
 new fresh podcast right for your ears in the second half every single night. All the bits

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.600
 they're actually too funny to put out in the edited version of the show and the first half is going to be an

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.000
 extraordinary cavalcade of different things. So much different stuff is going to happen in the first half.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.320
 Elephants, dancing girls, dancing boys, fireworks, dance famous avocado trick and a number of other things that I really probably shouldn't actually be promising to you.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.480
 But Andy, Andy, Andy, how do we get our tickets? It's very simple everybody.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.500
 All you have to do is go to knowsuchthingasafish.com, find the nearest one and click book. That's it.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.520
 Knowsuchthingasafish.com. That's it. It's going to be so much fun.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 We cannot wait to see you there. If you're not there, we'll talk about you behind your back. All right, that's it on with the show.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:02:02.720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.160
 I am sitting at a ginormous distance from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:33.800
 OK, my fact this week is that Nate Mercerow, who produced the most recent album of Grammy winning R&B star Leon Bridges, has now started collaborating with actual Bridges.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 When you're onto a winner, right? Just stick with it.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.480
 How many elements of your fact had you heard of before discovering this, James? Be honest.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.480
 I'd heard of Bridges.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.320
 That's what I suspected.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.120
 Grammys. You must have heard of the Grammys.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.560
 You must have heard of the Grammys, R&B stars.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.880
 I was reading an article in The Guardian about the Golden Gate Bridge, which started making this weird sort of humming noise.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.200
 But a local musician made some singles where he does a duet with the bridge.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.560
 And when I say local musician, I mean extremely famous record producer, Nate Mercerow.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.440
 But I'd never heard of him, so I googled him and it turned out that he's worked with people like Jay-Z and with Lizzo, who I have heard of.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.760
 And also a guy called Leon Bridges, who I hadn't heard of, but he has got the word Bridges in his name.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.760
 And he's won a bunch of awards, so he's obviously very famous and I think that's my problem, not his.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 Did they call it Bridges Over Troubled Water, this new collaboration with the bridge?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.680
 They don't call it that. No, I think he went for more of that artistic than the punny.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.600
 I think Simon and Garfunkel are quite, I imagine they're quite litigious.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.640
 I wouldn't want to get up in their face with that.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200
 And Simon and Garfunkel are still alive?

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.960
 Yeah, both.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.440
 Both?

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.960
 Yeah.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.520
 Not both of them, surely.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.200
 Both still alive.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.640
 If you've seen them before on stage, you wouldn't know, but.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.160
 Wow.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.160
 Ouch.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.000
 You know what? I'm thinking of Paul Newman, not Paul Simon, who's still alive.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880
 Well, yeah, Newman and Garfunkel is a very...

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.320
 Interesting call.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.240
 So this Golden Gate Bridge collaboration, I listen to it, it's really good.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.360
 So you see the bridge in the background and it's just making this weird noise.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.720
 And then Nate Mercerow kind of shambles on after a minute, where the bridge is, frankly, holding the stage very well.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.400
 And he starts, but he starts adding some guitar sound over the top of it to kind of match it and move around it.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.000
 And it sounds really eerie and great.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.240
 Yeah, it is spooky.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.320
 He likened it to Tibetan singing bowls, didn't he?

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.480
 Which those things that...

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.560
 I just got one of those.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560
 Did you?

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.680
 I've seen it, yes.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
 Nice.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.880
 Why did you buy one of those?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.160
 I mean, I have one, but I went to Tibet.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.600
 Well, the guy in the shop who sold it to me said it's either from Tibet or it's from Wales.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.720
 And he wouldn't confirm either way where it was from.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.680
 Dan sent me to a witchcraft shop to buy it.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 It was great.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.280
 I bought mine in Tibet, in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, from a guy called Alan Jones.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.320
 Interesting, because they don't actually have anything to do with Tibet.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.920
 So that Tibetans just ripping you off.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.040
 Why did they get the Tibet name then?

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.640
 I think it's just one of those Western, let's make it sound cool and spiritual and it's from somewhere over there.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.120
 But yeah, India or Nepal.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.480
 But apparently I was reading about the dangers of singing bowls and I wonder if the bridge has the same dangers.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.680
 You can get a headache from them.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 So Andy, be careful.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.440
 Oh, gosh.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.560
 Yeah, and if you're pregnant, which I don't know if you are, then they don't know if it will affect it,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.440
 but they advise not to risk it.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.000
 But who?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.640
 This was just a website listing the risks of Tibetan singing bowls.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.920
 Pregnant women can't listen to Tibetan singing bowls.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.840
 Just don't risk it.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.760
 We don't know that it would do any damage.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.760
 But that's, could we virtually say we don't know anything that will risk pregnancy if we haven't tested it?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.920
 Like presumably no doctor's gone.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.040
 Do you know what I'm going to focus on this week?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.520
 Seeing how this affects pregnancy, Tibetan singing bowls.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.280
 Yeah, that's correct.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.400
 I think this website is leaning heavily on the safe side and yeah, don't risk moving, listening to anything.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.560
 But look, that's my advice.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.560
 Very strange.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:05.560
 So this, it was quite hard to get the recording of the Golden Gate Bridge because basically the reason it's humming is that the wind is going through it.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.120
 They put some new slats on the bridge's railings, which is supposed to stop it from getting in trouble in high winds.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.160
 But all it's done is means that when the wind goes through it and makes this kind of eerie sound.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.560
 But also it means that when you try and record it, necessarily it's going to be a windy day.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.920
 And so it's really hard to get the sound of the bridge as well as this and kind of get rid of the sound of the wind.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.320
 But good old Nate Merceral managed it.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.200
 Yeah, he found the cove, didn't he?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.720
 He had to go down this cove, which was partially blocked by the wind.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.080
 And then in order to get all the equipment working, they had to bring a car battery down to power it all.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.080
 And so yeah, it was a proper process.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.040
 The wind supposedly plays in the note of A.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.640
 So if you want to go and collaborate with it, that's your note to go with, which is what, yeah.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.240
 I thought it had a range, does it not?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.320
 Well, it emits a 440 Hertz hum.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.040
 And so, yeah, it probably oscillates, but it will around a bit within, yeah.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.200
 So one person said you could tune your oboe to it, because that's what your oboe is.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.640
 What a difficult and pointless way of tuning an oboe.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.440
 If you live in San Francisco, though, and you're an oboe, it's an opening window.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.400
 It's tuning.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.840
 It's nice because Strauss, who was the guy who built the bridge, who engineered the bridge, said...

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.880
 Not Richard Strauss.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.400
 We've got not Richard Strauss, no, Joseph Strauss.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.920
 He's been trying to build a massive oboe.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:27.120
 He described it as saying, "As harps for the winds of heaven, my web-like cables are spun."

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.800
 So he imagined his bridge as a harp that could be played by the heavens.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.880
 That's really romantic for a bridge maker, isn't it?

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.560
 That's very poetic, yeah.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.960
 It's an amazing bridge.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.720
 I'd never really read about it before or learned anything about it,

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.240
 because I've not been to San Francisco.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.400
 But it's 1.7 miles long, and it's across the Golden Gate Strait.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.680
 Obviously, it's not a golden bridge.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.000
 It is red.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.600
 No, it's orange, sorry.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600
 International orange.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.600
 International orange has its own paint colour.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.360
 But it could so nearly have been a no-such-thing-as-a-fish-themed bridge.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.600
 Did you guys find this?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.680
 The US Navy wanted to paint it in black and yellow stripes.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.280
 In honour of no-such-thing-as-a-fish?

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.920
 80 years, I've won a lecture, but yeah, yeah.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.760
 It could have been so cool.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.280
 And it arrived, didn't it, in the colour that it is now, close to the orange.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.760
 And when they saw that, they went, actually, that aesthetically would work

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.200
 for incoming ships as well.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.400
 And it looks much better than this weird giant warning sign across the bay.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.000
 Although I'm sceptical about that.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.200
 So yeah, they said, I think the Navy wanted that,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.960
 and the Army Air Corps wanted a red and white colour scheme,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.240
 so it's visible from the air.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.040
 And yeah, everyone says, oh, we saw the base layer,

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.800
 which was this orange colour, and we thought that's perfect.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.760
 But I think what they thought was, we've got a fucking massive bridge here.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.000
 Do we really want to bother painting the whole thing again?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.360
 Yeah, that's in two colours.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.800
 Yeah, in two colours, yeah.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.720
 Nightmare.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.800
 There's a great story.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.760
 So it had two openings, didn't it, the bridge?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.200
 It had a pedestrian opening.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.520
 In and out, isn't it?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.040
 So yeah, there's four openings in total.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.760
 In and out, and then when they actually opened it,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.240
 they did one day for pedestrians,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.880
 and then they did another day for the actual automobiles going across.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.720
 And on the day that it opened to pedestrians, 18,000 people crossed it.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.680
 And many of the 18,000 wanted to set a record of being the first to do something on it.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.000
 So the first person to get across it was a sprinter called Donald Bryant.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.240
 So he was the first man to run across it.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.040
 There were Esther and Anne Bullard, who were the first recorded twins.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.840
 Carmen and Minnie Perez were the first skaters.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.560
 Florentine Caligari was the first on stilts.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.600
 There was a Scotty, which was the first dog.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.320
 Police rushed to aid one woman who was staggering along with her tongue out.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.520
 And it turns out she was just trying to become the first woman

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.240
 to cross it with her tongue out.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.680
 Why was she staggering?

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.520
 She had a very heavy tongue or something.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.960
 She was, it's a long walk, as you said.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.560
 It's a long bridge.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.600
 Has anyone gone across it while doing a podcast?

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.080
 Oh, great shout.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.880
 Not in, not in 1937, anyway.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.000
 The first rope to be taken across,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.400
 which was taken across by Boy Scout Trout,

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.760
 number five of San El Salmo by their club master.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.680
 I had a slim picking at that stage.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.640
 Do you think it's someone who's got to the end with their tongue out?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.000
 If someone's gone, someone's already done this.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.440
 And they've looked in their pockets, they're like,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.200
 "Well, I've got a bit of rope here, is anyone taking a rope over?"

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.760
 There's a brilliant book called Building the Golden Gate Bridge

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.640
 and Workers' Oral History by Schwartz Harvey,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.480
 where he spoke to all the different people who worked on it.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.640
 I think we said before that when they built it,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.840
 they put a massive net underneath the bridge,

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.400
 so that if anyone fell down, they fell into that giant net.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.960
 But people who actually fell in there and survived

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.960
 joined a supposed club called the Halfway to Hell Club.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.520
 There was someone there who worked on it,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.480
 who said it was the coldest place they ever worked.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.120
 You had to put on all the clothes you owned

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.480
 and you had to carry on working,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.040
 otherwise you would just freeze while you were doing it.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.120
 And there was no women working on the bridge,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.880
 but there was a woman called Dewey's Bowen,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.480
 who was working as a nurse for all the men who were working on the bridge.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.640
 And she said that what would happen is that their wives would come and visit them

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.000
 and they would always bring them some bread or salami or some wine,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.400
 and then the men would always give it to the nurses.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.240
 And so they would always say to the nurse,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.800
 "Make sure you wear a cape tomorrow."

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.600
 And what they would do is they would take their cape

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600
 and they would hide all the goodies under their cape

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.560
 and then have a midnight snack.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.520
 - Nice! - It's kind of cool, isn't it?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.120
 But it was really, really dangerous.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.560
 But the people who worked on it really needed the work.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.920
 And so there were out-of-work men who would routinely line the sites

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.160
 of the Golden Gate Bridge,

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.040
 and they were waiting for someone to either quit or fall off the bridge

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.640
 so they could start work, honestly.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.360
 But it was actually safer than other construction projects

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.720
 because Joseph Strauss, a bit ahead of his time in health and safety terms,

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720
 was really into things like hard hats.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.640
 It was the first time hard hats were compulsory.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.480
 He put this big net under it.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.120
 It had a lower death rate than most construction projects,

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.320
 although some people still died, obviously.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.920
 But it still does sound terrifying.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.680
 I think I was reading in the same book an account by a guy

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.480
 who was describing how he was employed to work on it.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.600
 And you took an elevator up through one of the towers right up to the top.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.160
 So it's 710 feet.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.560
 You go up in this elevator,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.880
 and he remembers going up for the first time with two painters

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.680
 who were employed to paint it.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.240
 And the elevator opened at the top,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.200
 and it opened onto a two-foot-wide wooden plank,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.240
 which you had to walk across to get onto the scaffolding.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.480
 And the two painters said to the elevator operator,

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.840
 "Well, what are we supposed to do now?"

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.760
 And the operator said, "Well, you walk across that."

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.720
 So they immediately quit and asked to be taken back down again.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.440
 And then for this guy went for it.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.520
 So stressful, especially if you've got a row of people shouting at you

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.600
 in the hope that you will fall off standing on the side.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.840
 "Oh, you missed a bit, mate. Just go a bit further."

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.120
 "Bit further out on the plank."

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.520
 I think still, like, if you're a maintenance worker on there,

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.680
 you have to do this thing.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.480
 On the second day, they make you walk on a cable,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.800
 which is 36 inches in diameter,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.800
 but with only a 12-inch strip down the middle

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.320
 that you have to stay on because the rest of it's really slippy,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.200
 and that bit isn't slippy.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.680
 So that's your test to get the job right.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.680
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.840
 There's a guy called Greg Montareno,

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.120
 and he said, "If you can't walk the cable, there's no day three."

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.280
 God!

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.760
 How is that interview process when you go in?

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.240
 How are you not falling off bridges?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.840
 This hum, by the way,

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.840
 is as a result of them trying to make the bridge safer as well.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.840
 So they spent ages trying to work out what was causing this hum

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.520
 because it came out of nowhere,

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.920
 and they worked out that it was these new thinner slats

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.640
 that were put on the bridge

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.440
 that were meant to help it withstand wind,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.160
 because the wind is so great in that area,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.720
 and the bridge at the moment can stand

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.040
 something in the vicinity of 69.34 miles per hour.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.040
 That's sort of what it's built.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.320
 Something in the vicinity of 69.4.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.120
 So can it do 69.35 miles an hour?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.920
 Something in that vicinity.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:50.760
 Yeah, but not that.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.440
 That's too high, 5.01.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.360
 It's around 69 miles per hour, and it has gone beyond that.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.280
 It's gone up to 75 miles per hour, and it's managed to stay up.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.080
 But they are worried that if it went higher than that,

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.280
 the whole bridge could collapse.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.320
 So these new slats are designed to allow it

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:07.400
 to withstand 100 mile per hour winds.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.760
 But that's what caused the hums in the end,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.920
 and they're going to try and fix it now.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.800
 So this might be the only collaboration

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.680
 that the bridge does, unfortunately.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.200
 Well, bridges do tend to make noises anyway.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.720
 I was reading about a musician called Jodie Rose,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.520
 who is really obsessed with the sound of bridges.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.760
 And she has released albums of bridge noises called...

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.800
 I think there's one called "Singing Bridges."

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.280
 I was listening to one. It's kind of nice.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.600
 Don't listen if you're pregnant to a singing bridge.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.040
 If it's Tibetan, you can't listen to it.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.400
 Actually, it's a myth that singing bridges are originally Tibetan.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.200
 Yeah, it's great.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.040
 She's recorded bridges like the Millennium Bridge,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.240
 the Batman Bridge in Tasmania, in Finland, Rotterdam, Vietnam.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.200
 She's traveled all over the world on the profits

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.560
 that she makes from selling her bridge-based sound albums.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.400
 She's listening to.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.960
 Is it people on the bridge, or is it these bridges that...

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.120
 Can I just say, I've walked across the Millennium Bridge

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.560
 on many, many occasions and never noticed the sound.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.240
 She puts a microphone on the actual cables,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.560
 so you catch the creaking.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.800
 And I guess when you walk across it,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.840
 maybe your ears are pinned to the cables themselves.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.600
 Well, it is, because I'm trying to be the first person

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.880
 to cross it with my ear pinned to the ground.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.240
 So, there are mysterious hums around the world,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.960
 around the universe, in fact.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.040
 Voyager 1 spacecraft has just managed to detect

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.560
 the background hum of interstellar space for the first time.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.480
 Apparently, the universe hums.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.600
 That's so good that the universes are going, "Hmm."

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.280
 Yeah. Do you think it's skeptical?

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.040
 Yeah, not sure. I think disapproving.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.400
 Yeah, not sure.

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.640
 Yeah.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.720
 There is a constant hum of interstellar plasma, apparently,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.480
 and it's caused when a star, such as a sun,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.320
 sends out a coronal mass ejection,

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.240
 which is something we discussed the other day with Robinance,

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.160
 then it will fire into this plasma

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.000
 and kind of make the electrons sort of vibrate a little bit,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.600
 and you can measure that.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.920
 It's going to be a whole Grammy category for this one day,

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.520
 isn't it, from collaborations.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.320
 You know, a horse's ears sometimes hum.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.800
 Really? Yeah.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.560
 Yeah, that's right.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.320
 This was...

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.680
 Can't believe you guys didn't know that.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.000
 You said that like you had to convince yourself.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.520
 I am looking at my nose and thinking, "Can this be true?"

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:15.200
 But yeah, in 1995, vets at Newmarket

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.000
 were doing some surgery on a horse's lip,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.320
 and they noticed that his ear was emitting a sound,

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.200
 a bit like the sound you hear when you've got a bit of tinnitus,

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.120
 like a beeping sound, and they didn't know why,

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.120
 but I went on horse and hound forum

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.000
 and other people have had this problem.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.840
 I think humans have it sometimes.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.480
 Yes, humans do get it, objective tinnitus.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:37.000
 Extremely rare, much more rare than subjective tinnitus.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.400
 It's making a ringing note. Your ear makes a ringing note.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.120
 Exactly. Whoa.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.680
 So, you know, if you have tinnitus, go to the ENT surgeon,

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.120
 just in case they have a listen and go, "Yeah, you're right."

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:47.760
 No, it's not in your head.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.960
 Well, it is in your head, but...

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.560
 It's going to be annoying if Nate Mercerell

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.400
 follows you around with his guitar and just try to make songs.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:17:02.760
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.720
 My fact this week is that dragonflies used to be the same size

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.800
 as modern-day pigeons.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.400
 - Wow. - Terrifying.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.480
 - Yeah. - With frightening facts.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.400
 So bad. No, 'cause dragonflies are beautiful and cool.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.880
 That's true, and pigeons are not. You're right.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.320
 - I don't know, they're scary. - If you could...

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.200
 All right, James, if you could replace every pigeon in the world

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.200
 with a dragonfly of equivalent size, would you?

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.200
 100%.

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.600
 - Really? - Everyone would, wouldn't they?

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.200
 - I love pigeons. - Actually, I would, too.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.320
 - What? - Yeah.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.680
 We found the real fault line in a fish after seven years.

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.880
 Oh, the dragonflies.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.560
 Well, dragonflies, prior to reading this,

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.680
 I would have been fine with it, having now read what they're like.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.880
 I think they're terrifying creatures.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.400
 What would they like? They weren't that bad.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.360
 OK, so they were larger than your average dragonfly,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.360
 and they were, in fact, the largest insect ever, probably.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:48.800
 This was about 300 million years ago in the Paleozoic era,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.080
 and they're called mega-neura.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.480
 Sometimes they're referred to as griffinflies,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.120
 and they had a 70-centimeter wingspan, about 40-centimeters long,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.440
 and, yeah, they're the grandparents of the modern dragonfly.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.640
 They would be able to hunt larger things

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.720
 than they can hunt today, I guess.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.600
 But, yeah, they were the biggest flying things, basically,

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:06.800
 until reptiles started flying.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.320
 They were the biggest things you'd ever see in the sky.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.600
 Amazing. Wow.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.280
 And so cool. They're really interesting things.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.760
 And they were allowed to get this big

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.560
 because the oxygen levels in the air were so high at the time.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.320
 There were 40% oxygen in the air as well as to 21 now,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.680
 so they just had a lot more potential power

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.760
 in the air around them.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.640
 How big would we have been, though, if we were around then?

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.240
 Huge. I always say this. I think this is ridiculous.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.640
 You always find these fossils of, like, giant dragonflies,

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.520
 giant millipedes, like, giant reptiles.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.320
 Yeah. Where are the giant humans?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.560
 Mm, yeah. Where are they?

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.240
 You've blown this shit wide open.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.960
 Darwin is turning in his grave.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.200
 The answer is we would not necessarily have been that much bigger

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.800
 because they were large, because they breathe in a different way to us.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.200
 So, they don't have any lungs, insects.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.800
 They essentially breathe through little holes,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.680
 -spiracles. -Spiracles. Exactly.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.960
 In their skin.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.760
 And actually, scientists don't really know

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.000
 how they get enough oxygen to themselves at all

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.600
 because, and I learned this fact,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.680
 which I found amazing while researching this,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.840
 each oxygen molecule, if it was moving through empty air,

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.120
 it could move at about half a kilometer per second.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.200
 But because it crashes into other molecules so often,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.400
 it goes one centimeter a second.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.080
 So, every second, it has 10 billion collisions.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.360
 So, that's basically like, imagine you're an insect,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.760
 and you've just got these holes which are waiting for an oxygen molecule to drift in,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.920
 and there's an oxygen molecule, you know, 10 centimeters away.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.200
 It's making billions and billions and billions of collisions.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.840
 -It's never going to get to you. -Okay, yeah.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.440
 So, this is why, in the olden days, when oxygen was more concentrated,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.360
 they could get more oxygen inside their bigger bodies,

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.320
 but now they can only really get them on the surface of their bodies.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.720
 So, as soon as they get too fat, they can't breathe anymore.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.040
 If they've got too much meat in their body,

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.640
 the oxygen molecules can't go in.

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.400
 Whereas we suck oxygen in, we, you know, use our diaphragm.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.040
 Question, because they eat a lot, and they eat a lot quite quickly.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:59.280
 So, if, let's say, imagine we were the thing they were eating,

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.360
 how much oxygen is inside us, at this moment inside me?

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.920
 Are we talking about the big dragonflies from the past at the moment?

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.720
 Well, shrink me down, no, to a modern day dragonfly.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.720
 You've been shrunk down in some kind of weird "Honey, I shrunk the kids" movie

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.960
 to the size of a dragonfly.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.400
 -No, I'm the... -To the size of a dragonfly's prey.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.600
 -Pray, exactly. -I like a mosquito.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.200
 -Like a mosquito. -Dankito, right?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.680
 -Yeah. -We're going to need...

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.480
 So, does the dankito right now, do I have oxygen inside my body?

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.960
 -Yes. -So, here's the question.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.600
 If it's that big an eater, and it's eating all these things,

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.520
 can you eat oxygen?

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.640
 Are you eating, is the dragonfly eating my oxygen

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.520
 as well as the food that brings in the oxygen?

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:41.480
 I think that you would utilize your oxygen relatively quickly, I think.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.080
 And also, there wouldn't be much oxygen in you

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.720
 compared to the amount of your body.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.280
 -You know what I mean? You're not like a balloon. -I'm not a balloon.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.120
 -You're completely full of oxygen. -Yeah.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.360
 You've got many dankito lungs, which have got a bit of oxygen in them.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.760
 But that's not a terrible question, I have to say.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.320
 -Because they don't have... -Part of it was quite terrible.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.160
 I thought I think it's quite a good question.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.160
 They don't have lungs, so they can't breathe it in.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160
 So, what are you going to do? You're going to eat it in.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.600
 -You're going to eat the oxygen. -What do you eat?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.320
 You eat other things that breathe, and yeah, they don't have much oxygen in them,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.520
 but it's a bit, isn't it?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.200
 Also, the question is whether your stomach can dissolve the oxygen

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.480
 as well as your lungs or spiracles can.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.440
 I don't really understand the premise of Dan's question,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.960
 but I've just got Dan as a mosquito in my head now.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.480
 Quite irritating, aren't they, mosquitoes?

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.640
 -Um, dragonflies? -Yeah.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:35.800
 They're misnamed, I would say. They're not...

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.880
 -Dragons or flies? -Exactly.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.880
 And they don't spend most of their life flying.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:45.080
 They spend years of their life as larvae living in water,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.480
 moving around, eating away, breathing through their bottoms.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.520
 -That's the majority of their life. -Breathing through their bottoms, you say?

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.720
 Yeah, they do.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.080
 If they were to shove something up their bum, which had oxygen in it,

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.760
 -would they be able to... -Like Dan in Mosquito form.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.320
 -Like the Dan Keto, yeah. -Put me up the bum.

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:03.160
 I don't think this reboot of "Honey, I shrunk the kid" is going to work, guys.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:09.440
 Yeah, I find that amazing that so many animals live in eternal youth,

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.040
 and then there's a very brief adulthood.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.240
 How cool is that? Lucky buggers.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.240
 Why shouldn't you just bring a teenager forever?

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.240
 And then at the very end, you've got this crappy adulthood there.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.880
 No, you don't want the teenager. You want to be a child forever.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680
 Yeah, okay, you're right, yeah.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.400
 They have terrifying childhoods as well,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.040
 or terrifying for everything around them, because they're amazing hunters

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:28.800
 as adults, but also in the water.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.560
 So they have this extendable jaw called a labium,

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.800
 and it looks like the thing in "Alien", the alien.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.920
 -Which... -Which...

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.400
 It's sort of... It's folded up, it's got this arm on a spring under its jaw,

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.960
 and when it sees prey passing by, that jaw shoots out and grabs it.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.480
 Some species have pincers, some don't, but it's all terrifying.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.080
 -Really? -And they're amazing hunters, yeah.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.600
 And the way that the arm comes out of their mouth is it's hydraulic, isn't it?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.120
 And they suck in water through their anus,

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.440
 and they use that water hydraulically to fire out the arm from their mouth.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.400
 -Oh, cool. It's incredible. -Really? That's amazing.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.640
 -It genuinely is, but... -Do we have any system like that on us?

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.520
 -No, Dan. -We know that.

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.880
 Do you think that you could have got this far in life,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.520
 and then suddenly someone tells you,

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.240
 "Oh, Dan, by the way, no one's told you this so far,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.840
 but if you suck water through your bum, I'll have to come back."

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.960
 -I'm just... My ears can hub. That is new information to me. -Next time you're in the bath, Dan,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.360
 just give it a go. Try and grab the soap from across the bathtub.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.160
 [laughter]

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.320
 -But purposefully don't use my arms. -Yeah.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.040
 -Just suck through my anus. -Suck through your anus and see if it draws you down.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.360
 But it's really weird, because, yeah, as James says, they blast it out,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.720
 and they can use that...

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.880
 It sort of creates this massive pressure wave inside them, this water that they've sucked in,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.920
 and then it generates a pound of pressure,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.520
 which is quite a lot for a tiny dragonfly nymph,

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.880
 but they can also use it another way.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.800
 They can use it as an escape mechanism,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.600
 because they can unclench, blast the water out, and then jet themselves away through the water.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.520
 -So don't do that in the bath. [laughter]

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.640
 -I'm going through the window into my neighbor's backyard.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.440
 -They've also got an amazing... This is when they're adults.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.480
 Their ability to hunt food is pretty spectacular,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.640
 so they've been put in laboratories and scientists have watched the sort of rate of catch

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:22.280
 against the prey that they're going for, and it's a 95% of the time they can catch what they're aiming to catch.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.480
 They're just absolute mega predators.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.720
 -This is one of those experiments.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.360
 The way they looked at how they do this is one of those experiments where I think,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.120
 "How did scientists manage it?"

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.840
 So they made a backpack for them, and they strap it on,

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:40.000
 but then they, in order to look at what's happening in their neurons when they're hunting

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.680
 to find out how their brain is doing this,

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.840
 they connect wires to the equivalent of their spinal cord.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.080
 And you read the articles, and it's just like they say this casually.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.080
 -Yeah, it's insane. -How's someone doing that?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.720
 -Well, they've got Dan in the lab, in mosquito form.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.880
 -Dan, Gito, to the rescue.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.080
 Anyway, they discovered that they don't just react really quickly, they can predict where insects go.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.960
 So they watch their neurons like firing, and they watch an insect trajectory,

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:06.160
 and they can see which direction it's going.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.480
 -It's really clever. -That's incredible.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.840
 -Although, like this morning, I opened a cupboard in my house, and some sugar fell out.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.480
 And without even thinking, I caught it.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.960
 -So... -Wow.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.200
 -You're the dragonfly of this podcast, basically.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.880
 -Rather than the mosquito of this podcast. -I'm not.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.920
 I mean, if anything, this means I get to hang out with Timothy C. Weingard,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.320
 author of "The Mosquito, A Human History of Our Dead Leaves,"

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.040
 but if I find out...

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:31.920
 Wait till he hears about the Dan Kito.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.080
 Do you guys know what doesn't get enough airtime in all this chat about dragonflies?

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.040
 -Ooh, tell us. -No.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.320
 -Dams or flies? -Dams or flies?

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.280
 -I've got a guess. -That was unsurprised.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.720
 -Andy, we are on the same page here.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.160
 I'm so glad you agree. They're basically dragonflies, but a bit smaller,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.680
 and people don't know as much about them.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.040
 So, the way you can tell the difference between a damsel and a dragon

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.880
 is that damsel flies hold their wings back against their body,

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.520
 whereas dragonflies can't do that.

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.000
 And also, dragonflies have their two eyes kind of, like,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.040
 merged together at the front of their face,

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.120
 whereas damsel flies have them on either side.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.080
 But damsel flies can climb underwater, even when they're adults,

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.960
 which dragonflies can't, so...

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.880
 -Dragonflies lay their eggs. -How do you climb on your water?

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.120
 Well, good question. They climb backwards down a plant.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.280
 -Like getting into a swimming pool with the ladder? -It's exactly like that.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.880
 Yeah, certain damsel flies, they have to lay their eggs underwater.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.840
 It's usually inside plant matter.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.960
 And they, like, you climb down a ladder of a pool,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.920
 climb backwards down the stem of a plant,

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.200
 and they can be underwater for about half an hour,

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.040
 -and they turn their wings into... -Half an hour?

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.800
 -Yeah. -So, what's their oxygen intake like?

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.800
 Here we go again. Dankito to the rescue.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.480
 You can't do it, Dan. I'm just gonna tell you now.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.640
 They turn their wings into a kind of snorkel.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.120
 Dan, are you alright?

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.640
 I'm just trying to be a damsel fly.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:56.160
 If you can work out how to trap an air bubble between your wings,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.800
 and then use that to breathe half an hour.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.360
 -Oh, wow. -You don't do that.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.880
 God, that's so cool.

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.240
 That's a human thing that I think we should nail, trapping an air bubble.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.960
 Well, we have scuba equipment.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.960
 We do. Okay, that's solved.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.840
 Forget my hand bubble I wanted to invent.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.840
 This massive, massive dragonfly,

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.840
 the first one was discovered by a guy called Frank Carpenter,

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.840
 who's in America, and he got into fossilized insects at the age of 14,

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.840
 and he was really, really into them.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.840
 Like, you know, wasn't into girls and football and stuff.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.840
 He was just, "All I want to do is look at fossilized insects."

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.840
 -Nice. -But he was, like, in a little town in Oklahoma,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:35.840
 and what's he gonna do?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.840
 Well, luckily, the local neighborhood postman called Waldo Dodge

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.840
 was also an amateur entomologist,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.840
 and he'd noticed that this young kid was getting loads of books

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:49.840
 about fossilized insects sent to his house,

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.840
 and he said, "Mate, I can help you,"

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.840
 and he got him invited to the Cambridge Entomological Club nearby.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.840
 -Whoa. -And then, eventually,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.840
 he became a Harvard professor of entomology,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.840
 and in 1992, just after his 90th birthday,

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.840
 he published his classification of fossil insects.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.840
 -Wow. -That's a happy story.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.840
 Isn't it? Starting at 14 and knowing what you want to do

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.840
 with your life all the way till 90, it's...

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.840
 -That's really... -Be nice.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.840
 To have job satisfaction like that. Dream of it.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.840
 When he got the big dragonfly in the first place,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.840
 it was part of a hunting trip where he and a colleague

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.840
 in 10 weeks managed to collect more than 5,000 fossil insects.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.840
 -Wow. -Nice.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.840
 Wow. What's that? 500 a week.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:40.840
 -So, that's about how many a day? -Let's say 80.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.840
 -Yeah. -Pretty good.

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.840
 -That's pretty damn good. -For waking hours, 16 hours.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.840
 -That's five an hour every hour. -They're gonna have breaks.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.840
 Yeah, you're right. It's more like 20 an hour

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.840
 if you have a lunch break and maybe a little evening break

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.840
 to talk about all the fossilized insects.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.840
 "Where is this gold mine?" They're looking for all their fossilized insects in.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.840
 -That's incredible. -I guess no one's looking for them.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.840
 -There must have been a big pile somewhere. -Exactly.

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.840
 -And then they took the rest of the week off or something. -Yeah.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.840
 I love that postman's name, Waldo Dodge.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.840
 I know. So good.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.840
 It's so much harder to find Waldo when he's got Dodge capacities.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.840
 I have a little sideline where I collect the names of people

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.840
 which double as short sentences, and Waldo Dodge is going on the list.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.840
 Very cool. Who else is on the list?

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.840
 Nancy Drew, who I know is a fictional character, but Wesley Snipes.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.840
 Cheryl Strayed is an author.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.840
 Are you counting Waldo Dodge as an imperative sentence?

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.840
 That is a B-list I have created within my main list.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.840
 If you put a comma after Waldo and an exclamation mark after Dodge,

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.840
 -it works as an imperative. -Yeah, exactly.

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.840
 The imperatives are a lower category.

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.840
 -I agree. -Punctuation is allowed.

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:43.840
 -They're not a proper sentence. -There's no main verb.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.840
 Randy's literally brought the list up on his phone.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.840
 Rosa Parks, Jeremy Irons, Eric Pickles.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.840
 You know, they're just Sean Combs.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.840
 -No, he Cooms. -I pick Cooms, yeah.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.840
 -Oh, is it? -Sean Combs is Hoorer.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 But then it could be an imperative. Puff, Daddy.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:05.840
 There it goes, back on the list.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.840
 Or Pee, did he?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:17.840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.840
 My fact this week is that Germany's parliament has 709 real politicians

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.840
 and one fictional one.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.840
 -That's cool. -How do they tell the difference?

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.840
 Satire.

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.840
 Is that Satire?

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.840
 -It's as close as I get. -What are we saying?

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.840
 They're all, it's like they're all fake.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.840
 No, is Angela Merkel actually made up?

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.840
 It's not Angela Merkel, so this is the story of Jakob Maria Mierscheid.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.840
 He is a father of four.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.840
 He's a widower. He trained as a tailor.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.840
 He's an expert on columbopalumbus, which is a species of pigeon.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.840
 He's someone who tried to make it so that the official transcripts

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.840
 of every final sentence from members' speech were banned from the record

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.840
 since they always ended in the exact same thing, and thus I conclude.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.840
 And most notably of all, he is not real.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.840
 He's completely made up and he has been recognized by all the members of their parliament

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.840
 over 40 years now, and he is a person that was on the official website.

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.840
 He had his own profile. He has his own Twitter account, but he doesn't exist.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.840
 What's going on?

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.840
 He's a fictional composite member to replace a guy who was called Carlo Schmidt,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.840
 who was a founding father of Germany's constitution,

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.840
 and the name came from one form and member of parliament and the date of birth from another,

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.840
 and they just created him as this character to be a part of this little town.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.840
 Just a joke, right? Just a typical German gag. No particular reason.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.840
 Little gag.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:45.840
 They like Carlo Schmidt.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.840
 But everyone seemed to just like him as a character,

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.840
 and so he gets mentioned occasionally in the actual parliament.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.840
 But does he ever swing a vote?

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.840
 The Bundestag's website has a description of Mierscheid,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:00.840
 and it says, "I am neither an invention nor a patent. I am a solution."

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.840
 So he's denying it.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.840
 He says, "Like constitutional lawyer Friedrich Nagelman

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.840
 and professional diplomat Edmund F. Dracker,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.840
 my colleagues in the judiciary and the executive with whom I enjoy working,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.840
 I belong to the pillars of our state."

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.840
 These two people, Friedrich Nagelman and Edmund F. Dracker, are also fictional.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.840
 It's very weird, and there seems to be a German thing, these kind of in-jokes.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.840
 There's that town in Germany called Bielefeld, which is sort of the opposite.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.840
 It's got a population of 350,000 people, all real.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.840
 But there's a running joke that it doesn't exist.

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.840
 And so all Germans know of it as not existing.

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.840
 It's the 18th largest city in Germany.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.840
 But even Angela Merkel last time she went there made a speech there,

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.840
 and then the next day she went somewhere else and said,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.840
 "You know, I've just been to Bielefeld, or have I? Is it even real?"

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.840
 Who knows?

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 And then if you say, "Well, I've actually been to Bielefeld."

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.840
 So I know it's there, they go, "Oh, you're part of the conspiracy I use."

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840
 Exactly.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.840
 Yeah, the aliens are in your brain.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.840
 That's so funny.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:01.840
 I did find out a place that is in Germany, and it's not fictional,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:07.840
 but it existed as a weird quasi-real entity just after the end of the Second World War.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840
 This is really bizarre.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.840
 It's a town called Schwarzenberg.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.840
 It's near the border with what was Czechoslovakia.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:24.840
 And during the end of the war, both the Soviets and the American forces stopped outside,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.840
 which is really strange, because they had possibly miscommunicated about

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.840
 where everyone was going to stop their advance.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.840
 So it seems to have been the last independent bit of German territory

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.840
 that wasn't occupied by the Allied powers,

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.840
 and they sort of denazified.

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.840
 The mayor had been an enthusiastic member of the party.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.840
 They issued new stamps, new train schedules,

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.840
 and they imagined they were going to be a kind of Hong Kong territory.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.840
 Like independent from the rest of Germany.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.840
 From the mainland, if you like, from mainland Germany.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.840
 And then after seven weeks, the Soviets heard there were uranium deposits there and invaded.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.840
 But it was a brief dream.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.840
 You've got to hide those.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840
 Why had they stopped on either side?

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.840
 Is that like they couldn't agree who was going to come to meet who?

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.840
 Like you meet a friend, it's like you come to me.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840
 No, you come to me.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840
 It is really weird.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.840
 I think they both agreed they were going to stop at a certain river,

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.840
 where the river has a weird shape.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.840
 Or maybe the river has two bits.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.840
 Maybe the river bisects.

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.840
 I don't know the exact geography of Schratzenberg.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.840
 I'm sorry, I haven't done that yet.

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.840
 But there was some miscommunication.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.840
 Damn, that uranium.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.840
 I found some other fake people, not necessarily German.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.840
 Walter Plinge.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.840
 Is that another one of your pervy names?

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.840
 What is the verb to plinge?

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.840
 It's like a small plunge.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.840
 That's what a damselflye does into the water.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.840
 Walter Plinge is basically, we know the term Alan Smithy for movies,

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.840
 where you would put that name down if you didn't want to be credited,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840
 because something had gone wrong.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.840
 Walter Plinge is kind of similar territory,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:55.840
 in that he can be used as that for British theatre, in that case.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.840
 But also, it's when a part hasn't been cast,

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840
 it will be said to be played by Walter Plinge.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.840
 Or if an actor is playing two roles in the theatre,

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:07.840
 one will be Benedict Cumberbatch, the other Walter Plinge.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840
 I don't know if he's done that.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.840
 Well, he has done that, because he did Frankenstein.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.840
 Except there was someone playing the other role, which was...

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840
 Johnny Lee Miller.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840
 Yes.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840
 But they spot roles each night.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.840
 So there was never a chance for Plinge to get in there, I see.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840
 If Johnny Lee Miller had been ill,

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.840
 and Benedict Cumberbatch had to play both Frankenstein and the monster,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.840
 that would have been a good chance to have Plinge.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.840
 Plinge would have been right in there, yeah.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:33.840
 There was a member of the J-pop band, AKB48, called Aguchi Aimi.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:34.840
 But she was completely fictitious.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.840
 She was computer-generated, so they took bits from all of the members

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.840
 of AKB48, because there's 48, or there used to be 48 members of them.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.840
 They took all the different bits and put them all together

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840
 to make this new member.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.840
 And it turned out that she was a publicity stump for Glyco Ice No Me,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.840
 which are grape-flavoured ice balls.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840
 Grape-flavoured ice balls.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.840
 They need all the publicity they can get, don't they?

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:57.840
 They sound good to me.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.840
 They sound good to me.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.840
 Grape-flavoured ice balls.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.840
 Yeah, lovely.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840
 Because if you...

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.840
 Like, any glass of water can become a glass of wine,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.840
 if you just add some of this and let it melt.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.840
 No.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.840
 No?

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.840
 What?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:10.840
 It's not wine ice balls.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840
 Grapes made.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.840
 But it's grape juice.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.840
 But it's grapes made out of grapes.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.840
 Yeah, but there's no...

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.840
 They haven't fermented it, have they?

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840
 There's a process.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.840
 If you give me grape juice and say it's basically the same as wine,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.840
 I am going to be pissed off by that.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:21.840
 Yeah.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.840
 Imagine if you ordered an AK47 and you accidentally got AKB48 turning up.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.840
 You'd be so disappointed.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.840
 That's a real mix-up in the Amazon warehouse.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.840
 I can't eat grapes because they're too cold for my teeth anyway.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.840
 Really?

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.840
 So this would be a nightmare.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.840
 Wait, you have to cut them open and then to lick them to warm them up.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.840
 Anna, you're a pretty hard person in lots of ways.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.840
 That is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.840
 I've got sense to teeth again.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.840
 Wow, we found Anna's weakness after all these years.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.840
 That's it.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.840
 It's my cryptonite.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.840
 Grape-tonite.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840
 Gosh.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.840
 Has anyone heard of Avril Lavigne?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.840
 Oh, this feels like a trick question.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.840
 Completely fake person, doesn't exist.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840
 No.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840
 No, I'm joking.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840
 Of course.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.840
 I may not know who Leon Bridges is, but I do know who Avril Lavigne is.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 But what's this?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.840
 She recorded a song called Dolphins that if you go on these websites which give you lyrics

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.840
 to music, they give you the lyrics to this song, Dolphins.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.840
 The lyrics go, "Dolphins live in the ocean, dolphins live in the sea.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.840
 Dolphins live in nice, clear blue sea.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.840
 They are accompanied by lots of sea animals.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.840
 We love them.

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840
 You love them.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.840
 Who doesn't like them?"

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.840
 So, this is the amazing lyrics to Avril Lavigne's Dolphins.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.840
 Turns out, doesn't exist.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.840
 It's a completely made-up song that someone put into one of these lyrics websites, and

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.840
 all the other lyrics websites kind of took them on as well.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.840
 Right.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.840
 This was in an article for Fusion online magazine.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:51.840
 It's really, really good.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.840
 I highly recommend you read it.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.840
 Yeah, and there are two cover versions online of this song that doesn't exist.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.840
 No music for it, so people have had to guess what the melody is.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.840
 So, is it to expose these lyric websites for their copycatery?

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:07.840
 I genuinely think someone just did it for a laugh.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.840
 I don't think there's anything behind it.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.840
 Maybe to expose Avril Lavigne for her quite basic lyrics.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.840
 Excuse me.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.840
 I would say complicated.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.840
 Well, okay.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.840
 You can't just name your song complicated and claim.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.840
 What can we do about the massive simplicity of these lyrics?

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840
 I don't know.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.840
 Call it complex?

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.840
 Wait, so do people think that she'd actually released it?

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:30.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.840
 Definitely.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.840
 Lots of people thought.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.840
 Because if you go on the lyrics website, you search all of Avril Lavigne's songs, you

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840
 see it.

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.840
 Unless you've got every single record that Avril Lavigne's ever released like I do.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.840
 You're not going to think, well, this is one I've never heard of.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.840
 Yeah.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.840
 Bragging there about your Lavigne discography.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840
 Nice.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.840
 I don't normally go on lyrics websites and search for an artist and then look through

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.840
 what they've got.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.840
 What I normally do is I type in big blue shoe lyric misheard and then that'll take me straight

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840
 there.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.560
 But it's annoying when the lyric websites copy each other.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.560
 I do grab you that.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.560
 It's really annoying.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.840
 I like it when a lyric website is handcrafted by one person listening to a song, having

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.840
 a pun to the lyrics.

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840
 Is that a thing?

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.840
 Yeah.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.840
 Maybe I've just been believing them and singing the wrong lyrics to, you know, Dunbummy Love.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.840
 Which?

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.840
 Dunbummy Love is what I thought that was for a long time.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840
 Dunbummy Love.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840
 That's a very different song.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840
 That's a very different song.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840
 Wow.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840
 Okay.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:37.460
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.460
 That is Andy.

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:43.440
 My fact is that before it was somewhere to go to powder your nose, a powder room was a

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.840
 room where you stuck your head through the wall to get your wig powdered.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.840
 Okay.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:53.120
 So is there a hole for you to put your head in or do you have to smash your head through

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.120
 the wall?

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.120
 That's what I'm currently thinking.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:00.340
 In classy establishments, the hole is pre-provided for you and you just pop your head through.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:04.520
 So there aren't many of these places around, obviously, because no one wears the big grey

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.920
 wigs anymore, except lawyers, I guess, if you bearish to still wear them.

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:11.320
 But there are a few places left historical buildings where they survive.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.680
 Southside House is a manor house in Wimbledon in south-west London.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.800
 And it's got a lot of beautiful historical features.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:22.480
 And one of them is this weird cupboard-y room, which has a hole in the wall, and you would

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.760
 stick your head through the wall and a servant in there would powder the wig for you.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760
 Right.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760
 And while you wait.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760
 I couldn't work out.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.280
 Is the servant, which I think was a young boy usually, do they live there the whole

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.280
 time?

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.280
 I couldn't work that out.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:35.280
 I don't.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.280
 I'm sure.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.280
 It must be there, right?

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.280
 It depends.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.280
 Maybe if there's a regular wig powdering time, or if you're having a party.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.280
 Must be parties, right?

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.280
 Party.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.280
 If you want to quickly get your wig repowed.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280
 Yeah.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.180
 So how does it have to be a separate room?

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.200
 Are the wig wearers pretending it's like magic?

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.200
 No.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.200
 You just put your head in.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.200
 I mean, why do they need to be locking themselves in this cupboard?

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.400
 Have you read the process about how much powder goes into, like the collateral powder of powder

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.400
 in your wig?

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.400
 It goes everywhere.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400
 It's an extraordinary.

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:04.000
 I mean, the opposite version of that is they used to have rooms.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.480
 They found this in one case where you would sit inside in a barber's chair, basically,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.880
 and through the hole in the wall would be your powderer, effectively your hairdresser,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.160
 in a different room, applying the powder just through the hole and just smashing your face

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160
 with it.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:23.520
 And in order to not get it all over your clothes or all over your face, you would wear gowns

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.800
 like you would in a salon, and you would wear a weird cone over your face to stop the powder

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800
 from...

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800
 Yeah, powder cone.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.800
 Which makes you look like a really terrifying medieval doctor, doesn't it?

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800
 Yeah, the plague mask.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800
 The plague mask.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800
 Yeah.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800
 They're very strange.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.120
 But presumably the poor servant in the cupboard is absolutely covered.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.080
 He's choking on powder by the end of the day.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.080
 You'd guess so, yeah.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.560
 The Peruc powder page, which is what they were called.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.560
 Really?

00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:48.560
 Cripple pea.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:50.920
 Peruc, old name for a wig.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920
 Kind of interesting, actually.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.600
 Like, the word "Peruc" meant a wig by the 1560s, but in the 1540s it meant a natural

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.400
 head of hair.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.800
 So in 20 years that changed.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.520
 And that word came from the Italian word "Peruca," which means wig.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.520
 Yeah.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.360
 But the wigs were made of real heads of hair.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.920
 Because there were people selling their hair, but also it was standard in much of society.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.760
 Not just high society, in lots of society, for men to be wearing these big wigs.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.760
 Hmm.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.240
 Not just the big wigs, rather.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.040
 No, exactly.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:27.040
 Medium-sized wig, men.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.440
 More big wigs.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.360
 But yeah, human hair being sold for wigs was big business throughout this time.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.200
 And I was reading an account in 1840 written by a British writer.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.440
 And this was when wig-wearing had really gone out of fashion in most places.

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.960
 But there were parts of France where it was still quite fashionable.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.320
 So this British writer went to Brittany and it was like the most extraordinary thing about

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.360
 being in France is the peasant hair auctions.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:57.040
 And what would happen is you'd have a marketplace in the middle of a town or a village and there'd

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.760
 be a whole queue of girls wanting to sell their hair.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:05.000
 And the young girls would mount in turn, mount this platform in the middle, and people would

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
 shout out bits.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
 Oh my goodness.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
 Wow.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.200
 And the girl is shorn on the spot, apparently.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.520
 Like a sheep.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.520
 Like a sheep.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.960
 How much would the hair go for, as in, would it be more affordable for you to shave your

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:20.640
 head, sell your hair, and then use that money to buy a wig?

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.640
 With the selling of the hair.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.640
 Someone's taking money there.

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.640
 There's a middle man.

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.640
 Yeah.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:25.640
 Which is what you don't want in business.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.360
 But if the amount that your hair sells for greatly is outnumbered is the amount you buy

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.360
 a wig for.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.680
 I mean, if that's possible, the Nobel Prize in Economics is going to you.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.600
 It's a way of making money from nowhere.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:38.600
 Well, look at these auctions.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.960
 I mean, you know, they could go up and up.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960
 No.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.120
 It doesn't work economically unless you had much better quality hair than the wig you

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.120
 wanted to buy.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.120
 Exactly.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.600
 You could sell your good hair and buy some shitty hair and you would make money that

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.600
 way.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.480
 But what you're proposing is the wig equivalent of a perpetual motion machine.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:57.880
 It was partly expensive because it was hard to harvest, so it's not like a crop which

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:02.160
 grows really fast and you can cut it down every year for hair to grow to the ideal length.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.360
 You sort of need two to four years growth, depending on how much you want.

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:09.120
 And so people would offer women advanced payments because you've got to make sure you get that

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.440
 head of hair in four years' time when it's lush.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:15.280
 So you'd pay in advance and say in four years I'll be back to chop that off.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.960
 But you'd have to keep an eye on your investment the whole time, right, to make sure that there's

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.960
 not anything.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.440
 I would sell my hair to multiple different people, take all the down payments and then

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.440
 scarpa.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.440
 And that would be my fraud.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
 Yeah.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.560
 And the good thing is if you shaved your head, no one would recognize you.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.080
 The Romans used to get hair from peasants, didn't they?

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.080
 Oh.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:39.760
 They vogue the blonde hair in Roman times and they went to the conquered sort of Germanic

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.600
 tribes and people even further north than that and they would take the blonde hair from

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.800
 there and then the expensive wigs would be made from them, yeah.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.880
 And in the 16th century in Italy, blonde hair was really popular but it was very hard to

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.640
 get hold of blonde wigs.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.800
 So what women would do is they would sit on the top of buildings in huge hats, they were

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.200
 called Salanas.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.960
 So there was a massive brim but there was no top of the hat.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.320
 No, the sun could bleach their hair.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320
 Oh.

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.640
 Isn't that interesting.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.480
 Why did they have the massive hat?

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.720
 To stop you from getting tanned skin.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.280
 But also you can lay out, if you've got long hair, you'd lay it out across the brim, can't

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.280
 you?

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.280
 Yes.

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.280
 So you're bleaching all your hair at the same time.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280
 Yeah.

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280
 The suntan thing as well might have been quite interesting.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.200
 Well, for a suntan you don't need a massive hat.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.720
 You just need a hat that's got a brim but massive.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.000
 I'm picturing sort of an umbrella sized.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
 Yeah.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
 I like Andy's theory.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.520
 They used to be made of metal in the - Metal wigs.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520
 The wig era.

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.520
 Yeah, weird, right?

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.680
 Sort of long strands of tin or steel, I think.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.920
 Not many but it wasn't a big fashion but there are accounts, aren't there, of iron wigs?

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.440
 Yes, iron wigs, yeah.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.920
 Edward Waterley Montague was an author and traveller.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.400
 He had an iron wig and there was an advertiser who said it could withstand rain, wind and

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:58.160
 hail and all without causing discomfort to the wearer which feels like a bit of a stretch

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160
 because...

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:01.080
 The practical wig, though.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.800
 And then they went out of fashion, didn't they?

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.800
 For various reasons.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.200
 One, there was a wig tax.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.440
 Wig powder tax even.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.440
 Sorry, that's what I mean.

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:08.440
 Yeah.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440
 Yeah.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.440
 It was pit the younger, wasn't it?

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440
 Yeah.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.440
 And there was a licensing system, like a TV license.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:16.840
 I tell you what, if Pit was a bit older he wouldn't bother about wigs so much.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.880
 It's alright for those young people to say no one should have wigs.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.520
 But it was roughly the cost of a modern TV license, I think.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:25.520
 Right.

00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.640
 And then a year, which I had read...

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:28.640
 A lot of TV licenses.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.200
 Well, about 150 quid in modern money.

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.720
 And so, I mean, there are obviously different ways of calculating it, but yeah, that's roughly

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:35.720
 it.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.800
 Well, the hope was that they were going to sort of use that money to fight Napoleon.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.800
 Yeah.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.800
 It was crazy.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800
 It worked.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.800
 Did it, did they?

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.800
 Yeah, it made a lot of money.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.200
 Because I thought people just stopped doing it as a result.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.640
 In the first year it raised £200,000, which was a lot.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.760
 But then by 1869 it was only raising £1,000 a year as wigs had gone out.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.960
 And then you were exempt if you were royal or if you were a clergyman on less than £100

00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.960
 a year.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.960
 There were various exemptions and...

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.000
 Yeah, the royals need the help, don't they, poor guys?

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.480
 And also it allowed them to create a funny nickname, guinea pigs, because pigtails were

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:09.480
 all the rage.

00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.160
 Men used to wear them and it cost a guinea for the wig tax.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.680
 I mean, it's perfect.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.280
 So was that the origin of guinea pigs in terms of...

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:17.280
 The animal?

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.280
 No, not the animal.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.280
 Just in terms of that phrase, or is that a completely separate phase?

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.280
 No.

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280
 Wait, what do you mean in terms of that phrase?

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.640
 It's the phrase to describe someone being like a lab rat.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.320
 That came from the fact that people experimented on guinea pigs.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320
 Okay, yeah.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.360
 But were people already experimenting on guinea pigs?

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:36.880
 Guys, where do you think that meaning of guinea pig would have come from the people who paid

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.880
 a wig tax?

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:41.560
 Because they were the first people with the guinea pigs, they were testing the tax on

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:42.560
 them.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560
 It was human guinea pig.

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.640
 No, no, it's from people testing drugs on guinea pigs.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.360
 Dan, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with you on this.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360
 I'm not saying I'm with me.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.440
 I was just asking whether or not it was the worst place to be is with Dan, but he's not

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.440
 on board.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.440
 I'm not with myself.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.520
 There's about a dozen early Nobel Prizes that were won by experiments on guinea pigs

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520
 specifically.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.520
 Right, okay.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.520
 But this phrase is from the...

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.960
 Yeah, but that's not what it meant, though.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:04.960
 Right, sorry, yeah.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:05.960
 Here's the question.

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.840
 Where does pigs come in into your phrase of guinea pigs?

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.840
 Pig tails.

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:09.840
 People call them pig tails.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.840
 Great.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.840
 Are you back on board with yourself, Dan?

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840
 No, I'm just learning.

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840
 I'm just learning.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:16.560
 What we're not 100% sure of, and maybe we should go back and check the sources, is that

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.920
 in all those early 20th century medical sources when they were referred to testing on guinea

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.660
 pigs, maybe they actually were testing on these overprivileged wig-wearing tops.

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.660
 I haven't checked.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.800
 All I'm saying is, was it a phrase that evolved and evolved to a new meaning, kind of like

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.680
 the wig, but turns out it's not.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.680
 So Andy, you're wrong.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.180
 Wow, this is a sick bird.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:39.560
 You're alone on the ship that Dan's built, then judge.

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.560
 No!

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.480
 But they went out of fashion.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.960
 We know that by about the 1820s.

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.680
 But these weird little holdouts happened, didn't they, across society.

00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:51.320
 So coachmen kept going until the 1820s.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.760
 Bishops stopped in 1832 by royal permission.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.680
 They said, "We don't want to wear these anymore."

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.400
 Cool people who live in the Hackney today, for instance, like myself, were always wearing

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400
 periwigs.

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.400
 Right.

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.400
 Well, it's you guys and barristers, James, because--

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.400
 Barristers and barristers.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.560
 Very, very strong, nice.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:14.040
 But from the mid-1840s onwards, it sort of had a resurgence in court, and in court you

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.360
 were technically invisible unless you were wearing a wig.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.400
 I don't mean technically invisible.

00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.040
 You would be, in quotes, not seen or heard.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.600
 The judge would not recognize you.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.600
 Wow.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.160
 So it's a way of being invisible, basically.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.240
 Oh, I don't know.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240
 Where is Lord Plinge?

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240
 I can't see him anywhere.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:30.240
 Is it like that?

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.240
 Basically that.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240
 Amazing.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.240
 He's going, "Objection!

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.240
 Objection!"

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240
 But he's not going his way on.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:39.200
 Some barristers still wear wigs today, and I read a great piece in the legal magazine

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:45.920
 called "Council," which is a great magazine, and I recommend you all order, order it.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.120
 God, I just-- this is brilliant.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.640
 But I just-- I'm remembering the thing about the Sellafield magazine a few weeks ago, and

00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.000
 I think this could be Addy's magazine, Carter, for me, I think.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
 100%.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.120
 Sellafield magazine suddenly sounds like an agricultural kind of auction mag, doesn't

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.120
 it?

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.680
 Oh, God, another huge AK-47, AKB-48 thing.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.480
 Oh, I'm just trying to sell a field, but you've delivered uranium to me.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.160
 Now the Soviets are coming.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.520
 Put it with the unwanted gun in your pantry.

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:24.600
 Oh, look, anyway, Council magazine wrote all about how wigs were nearly got rid of

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.600
 in court, right?

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.440
 So in 1940s, Parliament debated this clause, which was going to ban wigs and gowns in court.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.920
 It said, "This is ridiculous," so they went out 100 years ago in the rest of society,

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.320
 and it prompted this huge backlash, and lots of MPs, who are obviously very traditionalist

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.760
 as well, objected.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.240
 One MP asked whether the clause would also deprive admirals of their three-cornered hats

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.200
 or deprive generals of their epaulettes or clergymen of their distinctive attire.

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.720
 He said nothing about nurses, the person who had proposed this clause.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.360
 He said nothing about nurses, although I think we all agree that they look very pretty in

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:58.360
 their distinctive attire.

00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.360
 Oh, my God.

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360
 I know.

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360
 That has a common stuff.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.360
 Jesus Christ.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.360
 Wow.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:08.320
 But there was a fear that judges would not look majestic if they took their wigs off,

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.520
 and that if a judge was seen in his wig, he was embodying the law and very powerful.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:15.880
 But if seen with that one, he might look like a wizened-up gargoyle.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.880
 So, problem.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.280
 That's really rough on judges.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.160
 Wigs are a big role in the civil rights movement in America.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:32.040
 That is because during desegregation in the '60s, there are a lot of jobs where they kind

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.880
 of banned African-American hairstyles, and they kind of said you had to comply with

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.480
 a certain hairstyle.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.800
 And so a lot of people had to wear wigs to kind of cover that up.

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.000
 But then there were activists such as Marcus Garvey who said, "Look, this is ridiculous.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.360
 We can't be doing this.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.520
 One, we need to stop people discriminating against hairstyles, but two, we need to kind

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:55.560
 of reclaim our hairstyle and kind of be proud of it."

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:57.680
 And he said, "Don't remove the kinks from your hair.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.640
 Remove them from your brain."

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:04.720
 And then in the 1970s, there was kind of a resurgence of people reclaiming the African-American

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.160
 hairstyle.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:12.040
 And then all the way to the present day in 2019, New York became the second state to

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.760
 ban discrimination on the hairstyles.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.160
 So in California and New York right now, you're not allowed to discriminate on anyone due

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.760
 to their hairstyle, and that is going back to the civil rights movement and all that

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.760
 stuff.

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:24.760
 Right.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.760
 I didn't know we were allowed to do that before.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.760
 You would think so, wouldn't you?

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:28.760
 No, wouldn't you?

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:32.360
 You would piss out people with pigtails left, right, and centre.

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:33.880
 Do you guys know about the Wig Club?

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.880
 No.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.880
 No.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.080
 It was founded in 1775 in Edinburgh, and there was a really cool investigation into it by

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:44.760
 an author called David Stevenson, and it was a gentleman's sex club.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.560
 And I mean, no, I haven't heard of it now, and I don't know.

00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560
 Yeah.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:49.560
 It was a good test, and well done.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560
 You all passed.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:55.720
 It was named after a wig that they had as their kind of relic, their club relic that

00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.960
 was made from the pubic hair of Charles II's mistresses that had apparently been worn

00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:01.960
 by Charles II.

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.840
 And when you joined the Wig Club as part of your initiation, you had to provide locks

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:12.560
 of pubic hair suitably harvested to be added to the wig as proof of having triumph sexually.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.240
 So you had to, after triumphing sexually, I guess, say to the woman, "Sorry, do you

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:21.680
 mind if I snip off a curl of your pubic hair because I'm hoping to join a sex club?"

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:26.960
 To definitely do that afterwards, I would say.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.600
 And yeah, they just met and talked about how much sex they were having and drank a lot.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.160
 These guys sound great.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.160
 Yeah.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.740
 So no actual sex happened at the Wig Club.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:43.240
 It was just a bunch of virgins getting together, bringing cut locks from their dogs.

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.240
 Exactly.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.520
 Yeah, I just shagged hard last night, man.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:47.520
 Is that what it was?

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:48.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:49.520
 It's a really cool club to be a member of.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.520
 Yeah.

00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.520
 I would have applied.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.760
 I'm not going to lie.

00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:58.100
 Some wigs were made of duck's tail feathers.

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:03.440
 Wigs specifically for Parsons and Vickers, because it was to fight off the wet, because

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:04.600
 obviously water off a duck's back.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600
 Oh, clever.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:09.160
 They literally had a duck's ass at the front of their head, looking so stupid.

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160
 That'd be amazing.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.160
 Yeah.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.400
 It is quite clever though, isn't it?

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.400
 Yeah.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:17.680
 What animals hair would you have as a wig if you could have any?

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.400
 Peacock and just let it go.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400
 Yeah.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.400
 For long peacocks.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.400
 That's a good idea.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.000
 Is it a peacock's tail that you've got?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
 No.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
 I've missed that bit.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.520
 Oh, you just want the ordinary cleavage, but okay, okay.

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.520
 That's cool.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:36.520
 Would that be whenever you clench your teeth?

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.520
 It fans out.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.520
 Whenever you tense your head.

00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:39.520
 Yeah, so that's a good idea.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:43.120
 I would have thought like you'd come in from the cold, take your hat off, and it kind of

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120
 comes out.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.120
 Yes.

00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.120
 Yes, it fans.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.120
 Jack in a box.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120
 Yeah.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120
 I'd probably get an orangutan.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120
 Orangutan.

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120
 They do, don't they?

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.120
 Yeah.

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120
 Always wanted to be a ginger.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.120
 Don't know.

00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.120
 Very wiry orangutan hair.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120
 It looks wiry.

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.120
 How do you know?

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.120
 It looks wiry.

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.120
 From a distance.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:01.120
 It's got a pubic quality about it.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.120
 You could bring it to your wig party.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.560
 I was just thinking yak, just because it's so long and luscious.

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:08.560
 Lovely.

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.560
 Yeah.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.560
 And wise.

00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560
 Wise.

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.560
 Just the yak.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:13.560
 Wise like a yak.

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.560
 Not saying.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.560
 It is now.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:22.620
 OK, that's it.

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:23.620
 That is all of our facts.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.080
