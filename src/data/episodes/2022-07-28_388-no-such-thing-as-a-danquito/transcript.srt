00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,600
 Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show we have an

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,580
 announcement to make. It's a bit of a serious one. It's that for a while we are not going to be able to

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:21,280
 record our podcast from our spiritual home, our Covent Garden office anymore and there's a simple reason for that and

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,140
 the reason is that we are going on

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,200
 on tour. That's right. I tricked you all. It wasn't bad news. It's good news. You thought someone had died. Quite the reverse

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
 we're going to be on tour live and amplified across the entirety of the UK and Ireland.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,700
 We're going to be going all over the shop. Are we going to Barnstable? You bet your bum we're going to Barnstable.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,540
 Are we going to pool? As a rule, we're going to pool and 25 other places across the UK and of course not to forget Dublin.

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,000
 I know what you're thinking. What's the show going to involve? Well, I'll tell you it's going to be a live

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,640
 new fresh podcast right for your ears in the second half every single night. All the bits

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,600
 they're actually too funny to put out in the edited version of the show and the first half is going to be an

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,000
 extraordinary cavalcade of different things. So much different stuff is going to happen in the first half.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,320
 Elephants, dancing girls, dancing boys, fireworks, dance famous avocado trick and a number of other things that I really probably shouldn't actually be promising to you.

14
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,480
 But Andy, Andy, Andy, how do we get our tickets? It's very simple everybody.

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,500
 All you have to do is go to knowsuchthingasafish.com, find the nearest one and click book. That's it.

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,520
 Knowsuchthingasafish.com. That's it. It's going to be so much fun.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,200
 We cannot wait to see you there. If you're not there, we'll talk about you behind your back. All right, that's it on with the show.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:02:02,720
 Hello and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,160
 I am sitting at a ginormous distance from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:18,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go.

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,800
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:33,800
 OK, my fact this week is that Nate Mercerow, who produced the most recent album of Grammy winning R&B star Leon Bridges, has now started collaborating with actual Bridges.

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
 When you're onto a winner, right? Just stick with it.

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,480
 How many elements of your fact had you heard of before discovering this, James? Be honest.

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,480
 I'd heard of Bridges.

27
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,320
 That's what I suspected.

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
 Grammys. You must have heard of the Grammys.

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
 You must have heard of the Grammys, R&B stars.

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,880
 I was reading an article in The Guardian about the Golden Gate Bridge, which started making this weird sort of humming noise.

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,200
 But a local musician made some singles where he does a duet with the bridge.

32
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:06,560
 And when I say local musician, I mean extremely famous record producer, Nate Mercerow.

33
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:14,440
 But I'd never heard of him, so I googled him and it turned out that he's worked with people like Jay-Z and with Lizzo, who I have heard of.

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,760
 And also a guy called Leon Bridges, who I hadn't heard of, but he has got the word Bridges in his name.

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,760
 And he's won a bunch of awards, so he's obviously very famous and I think that's my problem, not his.

36
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,760
 Did they call it Bridges Over Troubled Water, this new collaboration with the bridge?

37
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,680
 They don't call it that. No, I think he went for more of that artistic than the punny.

38
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,600
 I think Simon and Garfunkel are quite, I imagine they're quite litigious.

39
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,640
 I wouldn't want to get up in their face with that.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
 And Simon and Garfunkel are still alive?

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,960
 Yeah, both.

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,440
 Both?

43
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,960
 Yeah.

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,520
 Not both of them, surely.

45
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,200
 Both still alive.

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,640
 If you've seen them before on stage, you wouldn't know, but.

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,160
 Wow.

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,160
 Ouch.

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,000
 You know what? I'm thinking of Paul Newman, not Paul Simon, who's still alive.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,880
 Well, yeah, Newman and Garfunkel is a very...

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,320
 Interesting call.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,240
 So this Golden Gate Bridge collaboration, I listen to it, it's really good.

53
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,360
 So you see the bridge in the background and it's just making this weird noise.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,720
 And then Nate Mercerow kind of shambles on after a minute, where the bridge is, frankly, holding the stage very well.

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,400
 And he starts, but he starts adding some guitar sound over the top of it to kind of match it and move around it.

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,000
 And it sounds really eerie and great.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
 Yeah, it is spooky.

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,320
 He likened it to Tibetan singing bowls, didn't he?

59
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,480
 Which those things that...

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,560
 I just got one of those.

61
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
 Did you?

62
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
 I've seen it, yes.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
 Nice.

64
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,880
 Why did you buy one of those?

65
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,160
 I mean, I have one, but I went to Tibet.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,600
 Well, the guy in the shop who sold it to me said it's either from Tibet or it's from Wales.

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,720
 And he wouldn't confirm either way where it was from.

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,680
 Dan sent me to a witchcraft shop to buy it.

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
 It was great.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,280
 I bought mine in Tibet, in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, from a guy called Alan Jones.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,320
 Interesting, because they don't actually have anything to do with Tibet.

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,920
 So that Tibetans just ripping you off.

73
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,040
 Why did they get the Tibet name then?

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,640
 I think it's just one of those Western, let's make it sound cool and spiritual and it's from somewhere over there.

75
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,120
 But yeah, India or Nepal.

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,480
 But apparently I was reading about the dangers of singing bowls and I wonder if the bridge has the same dangers.

77
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,680
 You can get a headache from them.

78
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,680
 So Andy, be careful.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,440
 Oh, gosh.

80
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,560
 Yeah, and if you're pregnant, which I don't know if you are, then they don't know if it will affect it,

81
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,440
 but they advise not to risk it.

82
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,000
 But who?

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,640
 This was just a website listing the risks of Tibetan singing bowls.

84
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,920
 Pregnant women can't listen to Tibetan singing bowls.

85
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
 Just don't risk it.

86
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,760
 We don't know that it would do any damage.

87
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,760
 But that's, could we virtually say we don't know anything that will risk pregnancy if we haven't tested it?

88
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,920
 Like presumably no doctor's gone.

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
 Do you know what I'm going to focus on this week?

90
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,520
 Seeing how this affects pregnancy, Tibetan singing bowls.

91
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,280
 Yeah, that's correct.

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,400
 I think this website is leaning heavily on the safe side and yeah, don't risk moving, listening to anything.

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,560
 But look, that's my advice.

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
 Very strange.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:05,560
 So this, it was quite hard to get the recording of the Golden Gate Bridge because basically the reason it's humming is that the wind is going through it.

96
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,120
 They put some new slats on the bridge's railings, which is supposed to stop it from getting in trouble in high winds.

97
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,160
 But all it's done is means that when the wind goes through it and makes this kind of eerie sound.

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,560
 But also it means that when you try and record it, necessarily it's going to be a windy day.

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,920
 And so it's really hard to get the sound of the bridge as well as this and kind of get rid of the sound of the wind.

100
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,320
 But good old Nate Merceral managed it.

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,200
 Yeah, he found the cove, didn't he?

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,720
 He had to go down this cove, which was partially blocked by the wind.

103
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,080
 And then in order to get all the equipment working, they had to bring a car battery down to power it all.

104
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
 And so yeah, it was a proper process.

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,040
 The wind supposedly plays in the note of A.

106
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,640
 So if you want to go and collaborate with it, that's your note to go with, which is what, yeah.

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
 I thought it had a range, does it not?

108
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,320
 Well, it emits a 440 Hertz hum.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,040
 And so, yeah, it probably oscillates, but it will around a bit within, yeah.

110
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,200
 So one person said you could tune your oboe to it, because that's what your oboe is.

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,640
 What a difficult and pointless way of tuning an oboe.

112
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,440
 If you live in San Francisco, though, and you're an oboe, it's an opening window.

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,400
 It's tuning.

114
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,840
 It's nice because Strauss, who was the guy who built the bridge, who engineered the bridge, said...

115
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
 Not Richard Strauss.

116
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,400
 We've got not Richard Strauss, no, Joseph Strauss.

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,920
 He's been trying to build a massive oboe.

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,120
 He described it as saying, "As harps for the winds of heaven, my web-like cables are spun."

119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
 So he imagined his bridge as a harp that could be played by the heavens.

120
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,880
 That's really romantic for a bridge maker, isn't it?

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
 That's very poetic, yeah.

122
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,960
 It's an amazing bridge.

123
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,720
 I'd never really read about it before or learned anything about it,

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
 because I've not been to San Francisco.

125
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,400
 But it's 1.7 miles long, and it's across the Golden Gate Strait.

126
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,680
 Obviously, it's not a golden bridge.

127
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,000
 It is red.

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,600
 No, it's orange, sorry.

129
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
 International orange.

130
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 International orange has its own paint colour.

131
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,360
 But it could so nearly have been a no-such-thing-as-a-fish-themed bridge.

132
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,600
 Did you guys find this?

133
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,680
 The US Navy wanted to paint it in black and yellow stripes.

134
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,280
 In honour of no-such-thing-as-a-fish?

135
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,920
 80 years, I've won a lecture, but yeah, yeah.

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,760
 It could have been so cool.

137
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,280
 And it arrived, didn't it, in the colour that it is now, close to the orange.

138
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,760
 And when they saw that, they went, actually, that aesthetically would work

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
 for incoming ships as well.

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,400
 And it looks much better than this weird giant warning sign across the bay.

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
 Although I'm sceptical about that.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,200
 So yeah, they said, I think the Navy wanted that,

143
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,960
 and the Army Air Corps wanted a red and white colour scheme,

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,240
 so it's visible from the air.

145
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,040
 And yeah, everyone says, oh, we saw the base layer,

146
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,800
 which was this orange colour, and we thought that's perfect.

147
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,760
 But I think what they thought was, we've got a fucking massive bridge here.

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,000
 Do we really want to bother painting the whole thing again?

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,360
 Yeah, that's in two colours.

150
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,800
 Yeah, in two colours, yeah.

151
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,720
 Nightmare.

152
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,800
 There's a great story.

153
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,760
 So it had two openings, didn't it, the bridge?

154
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,200
 It had a pedestrian opening.

155
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,520
 In and out, isn't it?

156
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,040
 So yeah, there's four openings in total.

157
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
 In and out, and then when they actually opened it,

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,240
 they did one day for pedestrians,

159
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,880
 and then they did another day for the actual automobiles going across.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,720
 And on the day that it opened to pedestrians, 18,000 people crossed it.

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,680
 And many of the 18,000 wanted to set a record of being the first to do something on it.

162
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,000
 So the first person to get across it was a sprinter called Donald Bryant.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,240
 So he was the first man to run across it.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,040
 There were Esther and Anne Bullard, who were the first recorded twins.

165
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,840
 Carmen and Minnie Perez were the first skaters.

166
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,560
 Florentine Caligari was the first on stilts.

167
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,600
 There was a Scotty, which was the first dog.

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,320
 Police rushed to aid one woman who was staggering along with her tongue out.

169
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,520
 And it turns out she was just trying to become the first woman

170
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,240
 to cross it with her tongue out.

171
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,680
 Why was she staggering?

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,520
 She had a very heavy tongue or something.

173
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,960
 She was, it's a long walk, as you said.

174
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,560
 It's a long bridge.

175
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,600
 Has anyone gone across it while doing a podcast?

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,080
 Oh, great shout.

177
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,880
 Not in, not in 1937, anyway.

178
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,000
 The first rope to be taken across,

179
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,400
 which was taken across by Boy Scout Trout,

180
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,760
 number five of San El Salmo by their club master.

181
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
 I had a slim picking at that stage.

182
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
 Do you think it's someone who's got to the end with their tongue out?

183
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,000
 If someone's gone, someone's already done this.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,440
 And they've looked in their pockets, they're like,

185
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,200
 "Well, I've got a bit of rope here, is anyone taking a rope over?"

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,760
 There's a brilliant book called Building the Golden Gate Bridge

187
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,640
 and Workers' Oral History by Schwartz Harvey,

188
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,480
 where he spoke to all the different people who worked on it.

189
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
 I think we said before that when they built it,

190
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,840
 they put a massive net underneath the bridge,

191
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,400
 so that if anyone fell down, they fell into that giant net.

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,960
 But people who actually fell in there and survived

193
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,960
 joined a supposed club called the Halfway to Hell Club.

194
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,520
 There was someone there who worked on it,

195
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,480
 who said it was the coldest place they ever worked.

196
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,120
 You had to put on all the clothes you owned

197
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,480
 and you had to carry on working,

198
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,040
 otherwise you would just freeze while you were doing it.

199
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,120
 And there was no women working on the bridge,

200
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,880
 but there was a woman called Dewey's Bowen,

201
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
 who was working as a nurse for all the men who were working on the bridge.

202
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,640
 And she said that what would happen is that their wives would come and visit them

203
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,000
 and they would always bring them some bread or salami or some wine,

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
 and then the men would always give it to the nurses.

205
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
 And so they would always say to the nurse,

206
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,800
 "Make sure you wear a cape tomorrow."

207
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
 And what they would do is they would take their cape

208
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
 and they would hide all the goodies under their cape

209
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,560
 and then have a midnight snack.

210
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,520
 - Nice! - It's kind of cool, isn't it?

211
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,120
 But it was really, really dangerous.

212
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,560
 But the people who worked on it really needed the work.

213
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,920
 And so there were out-of-work men who would routinely line the sites

214
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,160
 of the Golden Gate Bridge,

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,040
 and they were waiting for someone to either quit or fall off the bridge

216
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,640
 so they could start work, honestly.

217
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,360
 But it was actually safer than other construction projects

218
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,720
 because Joseph Strauss, a bit ahead of his time in health and safety terms,

219
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 was really into things like hard hats.

220
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,640
 It was the first time hard hats were compulsory.

221
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,480
 He put this big net under it.

222
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,120
 It had a lower death rate than most construction projects,

223
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,320
 although some people still died, obviously.

224
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,920
 But it still does sound terrifying.

225
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,680
 I think I was reading in the same book an account by a guy

226
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,480
 who was describing how he was employed to work on it.

227
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,600
 And you took an elevator up through one of the towers right up to the top.

228
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,160
 So it's 710 feet.

229
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,560
 You go up in this elevator,

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,880
 and he remembers going up for the first time with two painters

231
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,680
 who were employed to paint it.

232
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,240
 And the elevator opened at the top,

233
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,200
 and it opened onto a two-foot-wide wooden plank,

234
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
 which you had to walk across to get onto the scaffolding.

235
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,480
 And the two painters said to the elevator operator,

236
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,840
 "Well, what are we supposed to do now?"

237
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,760
 And the operator said, "Well, you walk across that."

238
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,720
 So they immediately quit and asked to be taken back down again.

239
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,440
 And then for this guy went for it.

240
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,520
 So stressful, especially if you've got a row of people shouting at you

241
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,600
 in the hope that you will fall off standing on the side.

242
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,840
 "Oh, you missed a bit, mate. Just go a bit further."

243
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,120
 "Bit further out on the plank."

244
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,520
 I think still, like, if you're a maintenance worker on there,

245
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,680
 you have to do this thing.

246
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
 On the second day, they make you walk on a cable,

247
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,800
 which is 36 inches in diameter,

248
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,800
 but with only a 12-inch strip down the middle

249
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,320
 that you have to stay on because the rest of it's really slippy,

250
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,200
 and that bit isn't slippy.

251
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,680
 So that's your test to get the job right.

252
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,680
 Pretty much, yeah.

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,840
 There's a guy called Greg Montareno,

254
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,120
 and he said, "If you can't walk the cable, there's no day three."

255
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
 God!

256
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,760
 How is that interview process when you go in?

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,240
 How are you not falling off bridges?

258
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,840
 This hum, by the way,

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,840
 is as a result of them trying to make the bridge safer as well.

260
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
 So they spent ages trying to work out what was causing this hum

261
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,520
 because it came out of nowhere,

262
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,920
 and they worked out that it was these new thinner slats

263
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,640
 that were put on the bridge

264
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,440
 that were meant to help it withstand wind,

265
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,160
 because the wind is so great in that area,

266
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,720
 and the bridge at the moment can stand

267
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,040
 something in the vicinity of 69.34 miles per hour.

268
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
 That's sort of what it's built.

269
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,320
 Something in the vicinity of 69.4.

270
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,120
 So can it do 69.35 miles an hour?

271
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,920
 Something in that vicinity.

272
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,760
 Yeah, but not that.

273
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,440
 That's too high, 5.01.

274
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,360
 It's around 69 miles per hour, and it has gone beyond that.

275
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,280
 It's gone up to 75 miles per hour, and it's managed to stay up.

276
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,080
 But they are worried that if it went higher than that,

277
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
 the whole bridge could collapse.

278
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,320
 So these new slats are designed to allow it

279
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,400
 to withstand 100 mile per hour winds.

280
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,760
 But that's what caused the hums in the end,

281
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,920
 and they're going to try and fix it now.

282
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,800
 So this might be the only collaboration

283
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,680
 that the bridge does, unfortunately.

284
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,200
 Well, bridges do tend to make noises anyway.

285
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,720
 I was reading about a musician called Jodie Rose,

286
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,520
 who is really obsessed with the sound of bridges.

287
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,760
 And she has released albums of bridge noises called...

288
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,800
 I think there's one called "Singing Bridges."

289
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,280
 I was listening to one. It's kind of nice.

290
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,600
 Don't listen if you're pregnant to a singing bridge.

291
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,040
 If it's Tibetan, you can't listen to it.

292
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,400
 Actually, it's a myth that singing bridges are originally Tibetan.

293
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,200
 Yeah, it's great.

294
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
 She's recorded bridges like the Millennium Bridge,

295
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,240
 the Batman Bridge in Tasmania, in Finland, Rotterdam, Vietnam.

296
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,200
 She's traveled all over the world on the profits

297
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,560
 that she makes from selling her bridge-based sound albums.

298
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,400
 She's listening to.

299
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,960
 Is it people on the bridge, or is it these bridges that...

300
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,120
 Can I just say, I've walked across the Millennium Bridge

301
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,560
 on many, many occasions and never noticed the sound.

302
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,240
 She puts a microphone on the actual cables,

303
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,560
 so you catch the creaking.

304
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,800
 And I guess when you walk across it,

305
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,840
 maybe your ears are pinned to the cables themselves.

306
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,600
 Well, it is, because I'm trying to be the first person

307
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,880
 to cross it with my ear pinned to the ground.

308
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,240
 So, there are mysterious hums around the world,

309
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,960
 around the universe, in fact.

310
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,040
 Voyager 1 spacecraft has just managed to detect

311
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,560
 the background hum of interstellar space for the first time.

312
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,480
 Apparently, the universe hums.

313
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,600
 That's so good that the universes are going, "Hmm."

314
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,280
 Yeah. Do you think it's skeptical?

315
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,040
 Yeah, not sure. I think disapproving.

316
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,400
 Yeah, not sure.

317
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,640
 Yeah.

318
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,720
 There is a constant hum of interstellar plasma, apparently,

319
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,480
 and it's caused when a star, such as a sun,

320
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,320
 sends out a coronal mass ejection,

321
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
 which is something we discussed the other day with Robinance,

322
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
 then it will fire into this plasma

323
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,000
 and kind of make the electrons sort of vibrate a little bit,

324
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,600
 and you can measure that.

325
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
 It's going to be a whole Grammy category for this one day,

326
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,520
 isn't it, from collaborations.

327
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,320
 You know, a horse's ears sometimes hum.

328
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,800
 Really? Yeah.

329
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
 Yeah, that's right.

330
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
 This was...

331
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,680
 Can't believe you guys didn't know that.

332
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,000
 You said that like you had to convince yourself.

333
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,520
 I am looking at my nose and thinking, "Can this be true?"

334
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,200
 But yeah, in 1995, vets at Newmarket

335
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
 were doing some surgery on a horse's lip,

336
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
 and they noticed that his ear was emitting a sound,

337
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,200
 a bit like the sound you hear when you've got a bit of tinnitus,

338
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,120
 like a beeping sound, and they didn't know why,

339
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
 but I went on horse and hound forum

340
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,000
 and other people have had this problem.

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,840
 I think humans have it sometimes.

342
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,480
 Yes, humans do get it, objective tinnitus.

343
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,000
 Extremely rare, much more rare than subjective tinnitus.

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
 It's making a ringing note. Your ear makes a ringing note.

345
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,120
 Exactly. Whoa.

346
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,680
 So, you know, if you have tinnitus, go to the ENT surgeon,

347
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,120
 just in case they have a listen and go, "Yeah, you're right."

348
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,760
 No, it's not in your head.

349
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,960
 Well, it is in your head, but...

350
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,560
 It's going to be annoying if Nate Mercerell

351
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,400
 follows you around with his guitar and just try to make songs.

352
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:02,760
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna.

353
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,720
 My fact this week is that dragonflies used to be the same size

354
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,800
 as modern-day pigeons.

355
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,400
 - Wow. - Terrifying.

356
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,480
 - Yeah. - With frightening facts.

357
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,400
 So bad. No, 'cause dragonflies are beautiful and cool.

358
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,880
 That's true, and pigeons are not. You're right.

359
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,320
 - I don't know, they're scary. - If you could...

360
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,200
 All right, James, if you could replace every pigeon in the world

361
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
 with a dragonfly of equivalent size, would you?

362
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
 100%.

363
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,600
 - Really? - Everyone would, wouldn't they?

364
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,200
 - I love pigeons. - Actually, I would, too.

365
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,320
 - What? - Yeah.

366
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,680
 We found the real fault line in a fish after seven years.

367
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,880
 Oh, the dragonflies.

368
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,560
 Well, dragonflies, prior to reading this,

369
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,680
 I would have been fine with it, having now read what they're like.

370
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,880
 I think they're terrifying creatures.

371
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,400
 What would they like? They weren't that bad.

372
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,360
 OK, so they were larger than your average dragonfly,

373
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 and they were, in fact, the largest insect ever, probably.

374
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,800
 This was about 300 million years ago in the Paleozoic era,

375
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,080
 and they're called mega-neura.

376
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,480
 Sometimes they're referred to as griffinflies,

377
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,120
 and they had a 70-centimeter wingspan, about 40-centimeters long,

378
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
 and, yeah, they're the grandparents of the modern dragonfly.

379
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,640
 They would be able to hunt larger things

380
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,720
 than they can hunt today, I guess.

381
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,600
 But, yeah, they were the biggest flying things, basically,

382
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,800
 until reptiles started flying.

383
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,320
 They were the biggest things you'd ever see in the sky.

384
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,600
 Amazing. Wow.

385
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
 And so cool. They're really interesting things.

386
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
 And they were allowed to get this big

387
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,560
 because the oxygen levels in the air were so high at the time.

388
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,320
 There were 40% oxygen in the air as well as to 21 now,

389
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,680
 so they just had a lot more potential power

390
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,760
 in the air around them.

391
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,640
 How big would we have been, though, if we were around then?

392
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,240
 Huge. I always say this. I think this is ridiculous.

393
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,640
 You always find these fossils of, like, giant dragonflies,

394
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,520
 giant millipedes, like, giant reptiles.

395
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,320
 Yeah. Where are the giant humans?

396
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,560
 Mm, yeah. Where are they?

397
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,240
 You've blown this shit wide open.

398
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,960
 Darwin is turning in his grave.

399
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,200
 The answer is we would not necessarily have been that much bigger

400
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,800
 because they were large, because they breathe in a different way to us.

401
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,200
 So, they don't have any lungs, insects.

402
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,800
 They essentially breathe through little holes,

403
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,680
 -spiracles. -Spiracles. Exactly.

404
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,960
 In their skin.

405
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,760
 And actually, scientists don't really know

406
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,000
 how they get enough oxygen to themselves at all

407
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,600
 because, and I learned this fact,

408
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,680
 which I found amazing while researching this,

409
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,840
 each oxygen molecule, if it was moving through empty air,

410
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,120
 it could move at about half a kilometer per second.

411
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,200
 But because it crashes into other molecules so often,

412
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
 it goes one centimeter a second.

413
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,080
 So, every second, it has 10 billion collisions.

414
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,360
 So, that's basically like, imagine you're an insect,

415
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,760
 and you've just got these holes which are waiting for an oxygen molecule to drift in,

416
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,920
 and there's an oxygen molecule, you know, 10 centimeters away.

417
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,200
 It's making billions and billions and billions of collisions.

418
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,840
 -It's never going to get to you. -Okay, yeah.

419
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,440
 So, this is why, in the olden days, when oxygen was more concentrated,

420
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,360
 they could get more oxygen inside their bigger bodies,

421
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,320
 but now they can only really get them on the surface of their bodies.

422
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
 So, as soon as they get too fat, they can't breathe anymore.

423
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,040
 If they've got too much meat in their body,

424
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,640
 the oxygen molecules can't go in.

425
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
 Whereas we suck oxygen in, we, you know, use our diaphragm.

426
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,040
 Question, because they eat a lot, and they eat a lot quite quickly.

427
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,280
 So, if, let's say, imagine we were the thing they were eating,

428
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,360
 how much oxygen is inside us, at this moment inside me?

429
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,920
 Are we talking about the big dragonflies from the past at the moment?

430
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,720
 Well, shrink me down, no, to a modern day dragonfly.

431
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 You've been shrunk down in some kind of weird "Honey, I shrunk the kids" movie

432
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,960
 to the size of a dragonfly.

433
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,400
 -No, I'm the... -To the size of a dragonfly's prey.

434
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,600
 -Pray, exactly. -I like a mosquito.

435
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,200
 -Like a mosquito. -Dankito, right?

436
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,680
 -Yeah. -We're going to need...

437
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,480
 So, does the dankito right now, do I have oxygen inside my body?

438
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,960
 -Yes. -So, here's the question.

439
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,600
 If it's that big an eater, and it's eating all these things,

440
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,520
 can you eat oxygen?

441
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,640
 Are you eating, is the dragonfly eating my oxygen

442
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,520
 as well as the food that brings in the oxygen?

443
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,480
 I think that you would utilize your oxygen relatively quickly, I think.

444
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,080
 And also, there wouldn't be much oxygen in you

445
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,720
 compared to the amount of your body.

446
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,280
 -You know what I mean? You're not like a balloon. -I'm not a balloon.

447
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,120
 -You're completely full of oxygen. -Yeah.

448
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,360
 You've got many dankito lungs, which have got a bit of oxygen in them.

449
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,760
 But that's not a terrible question, I have to say.

450
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,320
 -Because they don't have... -Part of it was quite terrible.

451
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,160
 I thought I think it's quite a good question.

452
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,160
 They don't have lungs, so they can't breathe it in.

453
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 So, what are you going to do? You're going to eat it in.

454
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,600
 -You're going to eat the oxygen. -What do you eat?

455
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,320
 You eat other things that breathe, and yeah, they don't have much oxygen in them,

456
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,520
 but it's a bit, isn't it?

457
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,200
 Also, the question is whether your stomach can dissolve the oxygen

458
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,480
 as well as your lungs or spiracles can.

459
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,040
 Yeah, yeah.

460
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,440
 I don't really understand the premise of Dan's question,

461
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
 but I've just got Dan as a mosquito in my head now.

462
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,480
 Quite irritating, aren't they, mosquitoes?

463
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,640
 -Um, dragonflies? -Yeah.

464
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,800
 They're misnamed, I would say. They're not...

465
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,880
 -Dragons or flies? -Exactly.

466
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,880
 And they don't spend most of their life flying.

467
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,080
 They spend years of their life as larvae living in water,

468
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,480
 moving around, eating away, breathing through their bottoms.

469
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,520
 -That's the majority of their life. -Breathing through their bottoms, you say?

470
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,720
 Yeah, they do.

471
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,080
 If they were to shove something up their bum, which had oxygen in it,

472
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,760
 -would they be able to... -Like Dan in Mosquito form.

473
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,320
 -Like the Dan Keto, yeah. -Put me up the bum.

474
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,160
 I don't think this reboot of "Honey, I shrunk the kid" is going to work, guys.

475
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:09,440
 Yeah, I find that amazing that so many animals live in eternal youth,

476
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,040
 and then there's a very brief adulthood.

477
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,240
 How cool is that? Lucky buggers.

478
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
 Why shouldn't you just bring a teenager forever?

479
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
 And then at the very end, you've got this crappy adulthood there.

480
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,880
 No, you don't want the teenager. You want to be a child forever.

481
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,680
 Yeah, okay, you're right, yeah.

482
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,400
 They have terrifying childhoods as well,

483
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,040
 or terrifying for everything around them, because they're amazing hunters

484
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,800
 as adults, but also in the water.

485
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,560
 So they have this extendable jaw called a labium,

486
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,800
 and it looks like the thing in "Alien", the alien.

487
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,920
 -Which... -Which...

488
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,400
 It's sort of... It's folded up, it's got this arm on a spring under its jaw,

489
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,960
 and when it sees prey passing by, that jaw shoots out and grabs it.

490
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
 Some species have pincers, some don't, but it's all terrifying.

491
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,080
 -Really? -And they're amazing hunters, yeah.

492
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,600
 And the way that the arm comes out of their mouth is it's hydraulic, isn't it?

493
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,120
 And they suck in water through their anus,

494
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,440
 and they use that water hydraulically to fire out the arm from their mouth.

495
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,400
 -Oh, cool. It's incredible. -Really? That's amazing.

496
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,640
 -It genuinely is, but... -Do we have any system like that on us?

497
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,520
 -No, Dan. -We know that.

498
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,880
 Do you think that you could have got this far in life,

499
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,520
 and then suddenly someone tells you,

500
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,240
 "Oh, Dan, by the way, no one's told you this so far,

501
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,840
 but if you suck water through your bum, I'll have to come back."

502
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,960
 -I'm just... My ears can hub. That is new information to me. -Next time you're in the bath, Dan,

503
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,360
 just give it a go. Try and grab the soap from across the bathtub.

504
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,160
 [laughter]

505
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,320
 -But purposefully don't use my arms. -Yeah.

506
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,040
 -Just suck through my anus. -Suck through your anus and see if it draws you down.

507
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,360
 But it's really weird, because, yeah, as James says, they blast it out,

508
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,720
 and they can use that...

509
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,880
 It sort of creates this massive pressure wave inside them, this water that they've sucked in,

510
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,920
 and then it generates a pound of pressure,

511
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,520
 which is quite a lot for a tiny dragonfly nymph,

512
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,880
 but they can also use it another way.

513
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,800
 They can use it as an escape mechanism,

514
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,600
 because they can unclench, blast the water out, and then jet themselves away through the water.

515
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,520
 -So don't do that in the bath. [laughter]

516
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,640
 -I'm going through the window into my neighbor's backyard.

517
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,440
 -They've also got an amazing... This is when they're adults.

518
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,480
 Their ability to hunt food is pretty spectacular,

519
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,640
 so they've been put in laboratories and scientists have watched the sort of rate of catch

520
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,280
 against the prey that they're going for, and it's a 95% of the time they can catch what they're aiming to catch.

521
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,480
 They're just absolute mega predators.

522
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,720
 -This is one of those experiments.

523
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,360
 The way they looked at how they do this is one of those experiments where I think,

524
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,120
 "How did scientists manage it?"

525
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,840
 So they made a backpack for them, and they strap it on,

526
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,000
 but then they, in order to look at what's happening in their neurons when they're hunting

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,680
 to find out how their brain is doing this,

528
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,840
 they connect wires to the equivalent of their spinal cord.

529
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,080
 And you read the articles, and it's just like they say this casually.

530
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
 -Yeah, it's insane. -How's someone doing that?

531
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,720
 -Well, they've got Dan in the lab, in mosquito form.

532
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,880
 -Dan, Gito, to the rescue.

533
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,080
 Anyway, they discovered that they don't just react really quickly, they can predict where insects go.

534
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,960
 So they watch their neurons like firing, and they watch an insect trajectory,

535
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
 and they can see which direction it's going.

536
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,480
 -It's really clever. -That's incredible.

537
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,840
 -Although, like this morning, I opened a cupboard in my house, and some sugar fell out.

538
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,480
 And without even thinking, I caught it.

539
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,960
 -So... -Wow.

540
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
 -You're the dragonfly of this podcast, basically.

541
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
 -Rather than the mosquito of this podcast. -I'm not.

542
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,920
 I mean, if anything, this means I get to hang out with Timothy C. Weingard,

543
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,320
 author of "The Mosquito, A Human History of Our Dead Leaves,"

544
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,040
 but if I find out...

545
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,920
 Wait till he hears about the Dan Kito.

546
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,080
 Do you guys know what doesn't get enough airtime in all this chat about dragonflies?

547
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,040
 -Ooh, tell us. -No.

548
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,320
 -Dams or flies? -Dams or flies?

549
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
 -I've got a guess. -That was unsurprised.

550
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,720
 -Andy, we are on the same page here.

551
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,160
 I'm so glad you agree. They're basically dragonflies, but a bit smaller,

552
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,680
 and people don't know as much about them.

553
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,040
 So, the way you can tell the difference between a damsel and a dragon

554
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,880
 is that damsel flies hold their wings back against their body,

555
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,520
 whereas dragonflies can't do that.

556
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,000
 And also, dragonflies have their two eyes kind of, like,

557
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,040
 merged together at the front of their face,

558
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,120
 whereas damsel flies have them on either side.

559
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,080
 But damsel flies can climb underwater, even when they're adults,

560
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,960
 which dragonflies can't, so...

561
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,880
 -Dragonflies lay their eggs. -How do you climb on your water?

562
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,120
 Well, good question. They climb backwards down a plant.

563
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,280
 -Like getting into a swimming pool with the ladder? -It's exactly like that.

564
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,880
 Yeah, certain damsel flies, they have to lay their eggs underwater.

565
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,840
 It's usually inside plant matter.

566
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,960
 And they, like, you climb down a ladder of a pool,

567
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,920
 climb backwards down the stem of a plant,

568
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,200
 and they can be underwater for about half an hour,

569
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,040
 -and they turn their wings into... -Half an hour?

570
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,800
 -Yeah. -So, what's their oxygen intake like?

571
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 Here we go again. Dankito to the rescue.

572
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,480
 You can't do it, Dan. I'm just gonna tell you now.

573
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,640
 They turn their wings into a kind of snorkel.

574
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,120
 Dan, are you alright?

575
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,640
 I'm just trying to be a damsel fly.

576
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,160
 If you can work out how to trap an air bubble between your wings,

577
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,800
 and then use that to breathe half an hour.

578
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,360
 -Oh, wow. -You don't do that.

579
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,880
 God, that's so cool.

580
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,240
 That's a human thing that I think we should nail, trapping an air bubble.

581
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,960
 Well, we have scuba equipment.

582
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,960
 We do. Okay, that's solved.

583
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,840
 Forget my hand bubble I wanted to invent.

584
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,840
 This massive, massive dragonfly,

585
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
 the first one was discovered by a guy called Frank Carpenter,

586
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 who's in America, and he got into fossilized insects at the age of 14,

587
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
 and he was really, really into them.

588
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,840
 Like, you know, wasn't into girls and football and stuff.

589
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,840
 He was just, "All I want to do is look at fossilized insects."

590
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,840
 -Nice. -But he was, like, in a little town in Oklahoma,

591
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,840
 and what's he gonna do?

592
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,840
 Well, luckily, the local neighborhood postman called Waldo Dodge

593
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,840
 was also an amateur entomologist,

594
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,840
 and he'd noticed that this young kid was getting loads of books

595
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
 about fossilized insects sent to his house,

596
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
 and he said, "Mate, I can help you,"

597
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,840
 and he got him invited to the Cambridge Entomological Club nearby.

598
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
 -Whoa. -And then, eventually,

599
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,840
 he became a Harvard professor of entomology,

600
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,840
 and in 1992, just after his 90th birthday,

601
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,840
 he published his classification of fossil insects.

602
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
 -Wow. -That's a happy story.

603
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,840
 Isn't it? Starting at 14 and knowing what you want to do

604
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
 with your life all the way till 90, it's...

605
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
 -That's really... -Be nice.

606
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,840
 To have job satisfaction like that. Dream of it.

607
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
 When he got the big dragonfly in the first place,

608
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,840
 it was part of a hunting trip where he and a colleague

609
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,840
 in 10 weeks managed to collect more than 5,000 fossil insects.

610
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,840
 -Wow. -Nice.

611
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
 Wow. What's that? 500 a week.

612
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,840
 -So, that's about how many a day? -Let's say 80.

613
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
 -Yeah. -Pretty good.

614
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
 -That's pretty damn good. -For waking hours, 16 hours.

615
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
 -That's five an hour every hour. -They're gonna have breaks.

616
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 Yeah, you're right. It's more like 20 an hour

617
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
 if you have a lunch break and maybe a little evening break

618
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,840
 to talk about all the fossilized insects.

619
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,840
 "Where is this gold mine?" They're looking for all their fossilized insects in.

620
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
 -That's incredible. -I guess no one's looking for them.

621
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
 -There must have been a big pile somewhere. -Exactly.

622
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
 -And then they took the rest of the week off or something. -Yeah.

623
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
 I love that postman's name, Waldo Dodge.

624
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
 I know. So good.

625
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,840
 It's so much harder to find Waldo when he's got Dodge capacities.

626
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,840
 I have a little sideline where I collect the names of people

627
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,840
 which double as short sentences, and Waldo Dodge is going on the list.

628
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
 Very cool. Who else is on the list?

629
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,840
 Nancy Drew, who I know is a fictional character, but Wesley Snipes.

630
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
 Cheryl Strayed is an author.

631
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
 Are you counting Waldo Dodge as an imperative sentence?

632
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 That is a B-list I have created within my main list.

633
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,840
 If you put a comma after Waldo and an exclamation mark after Dodge,

634
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,840
 -it works as an imperative. -Yeah, exactly.

635
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,840
 The imperatives are a lower category.

636
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
 -I agree. -Punctuation is allowed.

637
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:43,840
 -They're not a proper sentence. -There's no main verb.

638
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,840
 Randy's literally brought the list up on his phone.

639
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,840
 Rosa Parks, Jeremy Irons, Eric Pickles.

640
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,840
 You know, they're just Sean Combs.

641
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,840
 -No, he Cooms. -I pick Cooms, yeah.

642
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
 -Oh, is it? -Sean Combs is Hoorer.

643
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,840
 But then it could be an imperative. Puff, Daddy.

644
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,840
 There it goes, back on the list.

645
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,840
 Or Pee, did he?

646
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:17,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

647
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,840
 My fact this week is that Germany's parliament has 709 real politicians

648
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,840
 and one fictional one.

649
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
 -That's cool. -How do they tell the difference?

650
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
 Satire.

651
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
 Is that Satire?

652
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,840
 -It's as close as I get. -What are we saying?

653
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
 They're all, it's like they're all fake.

654
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
 No, is Angela Merkel actually made up?

655
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
 It's not Angela Merkel, so this is the story of Jakob Maria Mierscheid.

656
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
 He is a father of four.

657
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
 He's a widower. He trained as a tailor.

658
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,840
 He's an expert on columbopalumbus, which is a species of pigeon.

659
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,840
 He's someone who tried to make it so that the official transcripts

660
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,840
 of every final sentence from members' speech were banned from the record

661
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,840
 since they always ended in the exact same thing, and thus I conclude.

662
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,840
 And most notably of all, he is not real.

663
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,840
 He's completely made up and he has been recognized by all the members of their parliament

664
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,840
 over 40 years now, and he is a person that was on the official website.

665
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,840
 He had his own profile. He has his own Twitter account, but he doesn't exist.

666
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,840
 What's going on?

667
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,840
 He's a fictional composite member to replace a guy who was called Carlo Schmidt,

668
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,840
 who was a founding father of Germany's constitution,

669
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,840
 and the name came from one form and member of parliament and the date of birth from another,

670
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,840
 and they just created him as this character to be a part of this little town.

671
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,840
 Just a joke, right? Just a typical German gag. No particular reason.

672
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,840
 Little gag.

673
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,840
 They like Carlo Schmidt.

674
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
 But everyone seemed to just like him as a character,

675
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,840
 and so he gets mentioned occasionally in the actual parliament.

676
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,840
 But does he ever swing a vote?

677
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,840
 The Bundestag's website has a description of Mierscheid,

678
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,840
 and it says, "I am neither an invention nor a patent. I am a solution."

679
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
 So he's denying it.

680
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,840
 He says, "Like constitutional lawyer Friedrich Nagelman

681
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,840
 and professional diplomat Edmund F. Dracker,

682
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,840
 my colleagues in the judiciary and the executive with whom I enjoy working,

683
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
 I belong to the pillars of our state."

684
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,840
 These two people, Friedrich Nagelman and Edmund F. Dracker, are also fictional.

685
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,840
 It's very weird, and there seems to be a German thing, these kind of in-jokes.

686
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,840
 There's that town in Germany called Bielefeld, which is sort of the opposite.

687
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,840
 It's got a population of 350,000 people, all real.

688
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
 But there's a running joke that it doesn't exist.

689
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,840
 And so all Germans know of it as not existing.

690
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,840
 It's the 18th largest city in Germany.

691
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,840
 But even Angela Merkel last time she went there made a speech there,

692
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,840
 and then the next day she went somewhere else and said,

693
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,840
 "You know, I've just been to Bielefeld, or have I? Is it even real?"

694
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
 Who knows?

695
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 And then if you say, "Well, I've actually been to Bielefeld."

696
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,840
 So I know it's there, they go, "Oh, you're part of the conspiracy I use."

697
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,840
 Exactly.

698
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
 Yeah, the aliens are in your brain.

699
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
 That's so funny.

700
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,840
 I did find out a place that is in Germany, and it's not fictional,

701
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,840
 but it existed as a weird quasi-real entity just after the end of the Second World War.

702
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
 This is really bizarre.

703
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
 It's a town called Schwarzenberg.

704
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,840
 It's near the border with what was Czechoslovakia.

705
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:24,840
 And during the end of the war, both the Soviets and the American forces stopped outside,

706
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,840
 which is really strange, because they had possibly miscommunicated about

707
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
 where everyone was going to stop their advance.

708
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,840
 So it seems to have been the last independent bit of German territory

709
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
 that wasn't occupied by the Allied powers,

710
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
 and they sort of denazified.

711
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
 The mayor had been an enthusiastic member of the party.

712
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,840
 They issued new stamps, new train schedules,

713
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,840
 and they imagined they were going to be a kind of Hong Kong territory.

714
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
 Like independent from the rest of Germany.

715
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,840
 From the mainland, if you like, from mainland Germany.

716
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,840
 And then after seven weeks, the Soviets heard there were uranium deposits there and invaded.

717
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
 But it was a brief dream.

718
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,840
 You've got to hide those.

719
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
 Why had they stopped on either side?

720
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,840
 Is that like they couldn't agree who was going to come to meet who?

721
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
 Like you meet a friend, it's like you come to me.

722
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,840
 No, you come to me.

723
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
 It is really weird.

724
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,840
 I think they both agreed they were going to stop at a certain river,

725
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
 where the river has a weird shape.

726
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
 Or maybe the river has two bits.

727
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
 Maybe the river bisects.

728
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
 I don't know the exact geography of Schratzenberg.

729
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
 I'm sorry, I haven't done that yet.

730
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
 But there was some miscommunication.

731
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
 Damn, that uranium.

732
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,840
 I found some other fake people, not necessarily German.

733
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
 Walter Plinge.

734
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
 Is that another one of your pervy names?

735
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
 What is the verb to plinge?

736
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
 It's like a small plunge.

737
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:39,840
 That's what a damselflye does into the water.

738
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 Walter Plinge is basically, we know the term Alan Smithy for movies,

739
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,840
 where you would put that name down if you didn't want to be credited,

740
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,840
 because something had gone wrong.

741
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,840
 Walter Plinge is kind of similar territory,

742
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,840
 in that he can be used as that for British theatre, in that case.

743
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,840
 But also, it's when a part hasn't been cast,

744
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,840
 it will be said to be played by Walter Plinge.

745
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,840
 Or if an actor is playing two roles in the theatre,

746
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,840
 one will be Benedict Cumberbatch, the other Walter Plinge.

747
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
 I don't know if he's done that.

748
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
 Well, he has done that, because he did Frankenstein.

749
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
 Except there was someone playing the other role, which was...

750
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,840
 Johnny Lee Miller.

751
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,840
 Yes.

752
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
 But they spot roles each night.

753
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
 So there was never a chance for Plinge to get in there, I see.

754
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
 If Johnny Lee Miller had been ill,

755
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,840
 and Benedict Cumberbatch had to play both Frankenstein and the monster,

756
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
 that would have been a good chance to have Plinge.

757
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
 Plinge would have been right in there, yeah.

758
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:33,840
 There was a member of the J-pop band, AKB48, called Aguchi Aimi.

759
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,840
 But she was completely fictitious.

760
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,840
 She was computer-generated, so they took bits from all of the members

761
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,840
 of AKB48, because there's 48, or there used to be 48 members of them.

762
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
 They took all the different bits and put them all together

763
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,840
 to make this new member.

764
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:51,840
 And it turned out that she was a publicity stump for Glyco Ice No Me,

765
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
 which are grape-flavoured ice balls.

766
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,840
 Grape-flavoured ice balls.

767
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
 They need all the publicity they can get, don't they?

768
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,840
 They sound good to me.

769
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
 They sound good to me.

770
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
 Grape-flavoured ice balls.

771
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
 Yeah, lovely.

772
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,840
 Because if you...

773
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
 Like, any glass of water can become a glass of wine,

774
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,840
 if you just add some of this and let it melt.

775
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
 No.

776
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,840
 No?

777
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
 What?

778
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,840
 It's not wine ice balls.

779
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
 Grapes made.

780
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,840
 But it's grape juice.

781
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
 But it's grapes made out of grapes.

782
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,840
 Yeah, but there's no...

783
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
 They haven't fermented it, have they?

784
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
 There's a process.

785
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
 If you give me grape juice and say it's basically the same as wine,

786
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
 I am going to be pissed off by that.

787
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 Yeah.

788
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:27,840
 Imagine if you ordered an AK47 and you accidentally got AKB48 turning up.

789
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
 You'd be so disappointed.

790
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:34,840
 That's a real mix-up in the Amazon warehouse.

791
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,840
 I can't eat grapes because they're too cold for my teeth anyway.

792
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
 Really?

793
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
 So this would be a nightmare.

794
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,840
 Wait, you have to cut them open and then to lick them to warm them up.

795
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,840
 Anna, you're a pretty hard person in lots of ways.

796
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
 That is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.

797
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
 I've got sense to teeth again.

798
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,840
 Wow, we found Anna's weakness after all these years.

799
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
 That's it.

800
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
 It's my cryptonite.

801
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,840
 Grape-tonite.

802
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:58,840
 Gosh.

803
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,840
 Has anyone heard of Avril Lavigne?

804
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,840
 Oh, this feels like a trick question.

805
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
 Completely fake person, doesn't exist.

806
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
 No.

807
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,840
 No, I'm joking.

808
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
 Of course.

809
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,840
 I may not know who Leon Bridges is, but I do know who Avril Lavigne is.

810
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
 But what's this?

811
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,840
 She recorded a song called Dolphins that if you go on these websites which give you lyrics

812
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
 to music, they give you the lyrics to this song, Dolphins.

813
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,840
 The lyrics go, "Dolphins live in the ocean, dolphins live in the sea.

814
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
 Dolphins live in nice, clear blue sea.

815
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
 They are accompanied by lots of sea animals.

816
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
 We love them.

817
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
 You love them.

818
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
 Who doesn't like them?"

819
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,840
 So, this is the amazing lyrics to Avril Lavigne's Dolphins.

820
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
 Turns out, doesn't exist.

821
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,840
 It's a completely made-up song that someone put into one of these lyrics websites, and

822
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,840
 all the other lyrics websites kind of took them on as well.

823
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
 Right.

824
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 This was in an article for Fusion online magazine.

825
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,840
 It's really, really good.

826
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
 I highly recommend you read it.

827
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:58,840
 Yeah, and there are two cover versions online of this song that doesn't exist.

828
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,840
 No music for it, so people have had to guess what the melody is.

829
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,840
 So, is it to expose these lyric websites for their copycatery?

830
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
 I genuinely think someone just did it for a laugh.

831
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
 I don't think there's anything behind it.

832
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,840
 Maybe to expose Avril Lavigne for her quite basic lyrics.

833
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
 Excuse me.

834
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
 I would say complicated.

835
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
 Well, okay.

836
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,840
 You can't just name your song complicated and claim.

837
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,840
 What can we do about the massive simplicity of these lyrics?

838
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,840
 I don't know.

839
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,840
 Call it complex?

840
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,840
 Wait, so do people think that she'd actually released it?

841
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,840
 Yeah, yeah.

842
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,840
 Definitely.

843
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,840
 Lots of people thought.

844
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,840
 Because if you go on the lyrics website, you search all of Avril Lavigne's songs, you

845
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
 see it.

846
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,840
 Unless you've got every single record that Avril Lavigne's ever released like I do.

847
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,840
 You're not going to think, well, this is one I've never heard of.

848
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
 Yeah.

849
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
 Bragging there about your Lavigne discography.

850
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,840
 Nice.

851
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:51,840
 I don't normally go on lyrics websites and search for an artist and then look through

852
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
 what they've got.

853
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,840
 What I normally do is I type in big blue shoe lyric misheard and then that'll take me straight

854
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,840
 there.

855
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,560
 But it's annoying when the lyric websites copy each other.

856
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,560
 I do grab you that.

857
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
 It's really annoying.

858
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,840
 I like it when a lyric website is handcrafted by one person listening to a song, having

859
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
 a pun to the lyrics.

860
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
 Is that a thing?

861
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
 Yeah.

862
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,840
 Maybe I've just been believing them and singing the wrong lyrics to, you know, Dunbummy Love.

863
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
 Which?

864
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
 Dunbummy Love.

865
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
 Dunbummy Love is what I thought that was for a long time.

866
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
 Dunbummy Love.

867
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
 Dunbummy Love.

868
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
 Dunbummy Love.

869
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
 Dunbummy Love.

870
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
 Dunbummy Love.

871
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
 That's a very different song.

872
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
 That's a very different song.

873
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
 Wow.

874
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
 Okay.

875
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:37,460
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

876
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,460
 That is Andy.

877
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,440
 My fact is that before it was somewhere to go to powder your nose, a powder room was a

878
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,840
 room where you stuck your head through the wall to get your wig powdered.

879
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,840
 Okay.

880
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,120
 So is there a hole for you to put your head in or do you have to smash your head through

881
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
 the wall?

882
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,120
 That's what I'm currently thinking.

883
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,340
 In classy establishments, the hole is pre-provided for you and you just pop your head through.

884
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,520
 So there aren't many of these places around, obviously, because no one wears the big grey

885
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,920
 wigs anymore, except lawyers, I guess, if you bearish to still wear them.

886
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,320
 But there are a few places left historical buildings where they survive.

887
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,680
 Southside House is a manor house in Wimbledon in south-west London.

888
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,800
 And it's got a lot of beautiful historical features.

889
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,480
 And one of them is this weird cupboard-y room, which has a hole in the wall, and you would

890
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,760
 stick your head through the wall and a servant in there would powder the wig for you.

891
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
 Right.

892
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
 And while you wait.

893
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
 I couldn't work out.

894
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,280
 Is the servant, which I think was a young boy usually, do they live there the whole

895
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
 time?

896
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
 I couldn't work that out.

897
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
 I don't.

898
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
 I'm sure.

899
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
 It must be there, right?

900
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
 It depends.

901
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,280
 Maybe if there's a regular wig powdering time, or if you're having a party.

902
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,280
 Must be parties, right?

903
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
 Party.

904
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
 If you want to quickly get your wig repowed.

905
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
 Yeah.

906
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,180
 So how does it have to be a separate room?

907
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:49,200
 Are the wig wearers pretending it's like magic?

908
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
 No.

909
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
 You just put your head in.

910
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
 I mean, why do they need to be locking themselves in this cupboard?

911
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,400
 Have you read the process about how much powder goes into, like the collateral powder of powder

912
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,400
 in your wig?

913
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,400
 It goes everywhere.

914
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,400
 It's an extraordinary.

915
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,000
 I mean, the opposite version of that is they used to have rooms.

916
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,480
 They found this in one case where you would sit inside in a barber's chair, basically,

917
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,880
 and through the hole in the wall would be your powderer, effectively your hairdresser,

918
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,160
 in a different room, applying the powder just through the hole and just smashing your face

919
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,160
 with it.

920
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,520
 And in order to not get it all over your clothes or all over your face, you would wear gowns

921
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,800
 like you would in a salon, and you would wear a weird cone over your face to stop the powder

922
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 from...

923
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,800
 Yeah, powder cone.

924
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,800
 Yeah, exactly.

925
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 Which makes you look like a really terrifying medieval doctor, doesn't it?

926
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
 Yeah, the plague mask.

927
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 The plague mask.

928
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
 Yeah.

929
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
 They're very strange.

930
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,120
 But presumably the poor servant in the cupboard is absolutely covered.

931
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,080
 He's choking on powder by the end of the day.

932
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,080
 You'd guess so, yeah.

933
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,560
 The Peruc powder page, which is what they were called.

934
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,560
 Really?

935
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,560
 Cripple pea.

936
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,920
 Peruc, old name for a wig.

937
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
 Kind of interesting, actually.

938
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,600
 Like, the word "Peruc" meant a wig by the 1560s, but in the 1540s it meant a natural

939
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,400
 head of hair.

940
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
 So in 20 years that changed.

941
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,520
 And that word came from the Italian word "Peruca," which means wig.

942
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,520
 Yeah.

943
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,360
 But the wigs were made of real heads of hair.

944
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,920
 Because there were people selling their hair, but also it was standard in much of society.

945
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,760
 Not just high society, in lots of society, for men to be wearing these big wigs.

946
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,760
 Hmm.

947
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,240
 Not just the big wigs, rather.

948
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,040
 No, exactly.

949
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,040
 Medium-sized wig, men.

950
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,440
 More big wigs.

951
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,360
 But yeah, human hair being sold for wigs was big business throughout this time.

952
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,200
 And I was reading an account in 1840 written by a British writer.

953
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,440
 And this was when wig-wearing had really gone out of fashion in most places.

954
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,960
 But there were parts of France where it was still quite fashionable.

955
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,320
 So this British writer went to Brittany and it was like the most extraordinary thing about

956
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,360
 being in France is the peasant hair auctions.

957
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:57,040
 And what would happen is you'd have a marketplace in the middle of a town or a village and there'd

958
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,760
 be a whole queue of girls wanting to sell their hair.

959
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,000
 And the young girls would mount in turn, mount this platform in the middle, and people would

960
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
 shout out bits.

961
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 Oh my goodness.

962
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Wow.

963
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,200
 And the girl is shorn on the spot, apparently.

964
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,520
 Like a sheep.

965
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,520
 Like a sheep.

966
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,960
 How much would the hair go for, as in, would it be more affordable for you to shave your

967
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,640
 head, sell your hair, and then use that money to buy a wig?

968
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,640
 With the selling of the hair.

969
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,640
 Someone's taking money there.

970
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,640
 There's a middle man.

971
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,640
 Yeah.

972
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
 Which is what you don't want in business.

973
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,360
 But if the amount that your hair sells for greatly is outnumbered is the amount you buy

974
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
 a wig for.

975
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,680
 I mean, if that's possible, the Nobel Prize in Economics is going to you.

976
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,600
 It's a way of making money from nowhere.

977
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
 Well, look at these auctions.

978
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,960
 I mean, you know, they could go up and up.

979
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:40,960
 No.

980
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,120
 It doesn't work economically unless you had much better quality hair than the wig you

981
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,120
 wanted to buy.

982
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,120
 Exactly.

983
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,600
 You could sell your good hair and buy some shitty hair and you would make money that

984
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,600
 way.

985
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,480
 But what you're proposing is the wig equivalent of a perpetual motion machine.

986
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,880
 It was partly expensive because it was hard to harvest, so it's not like a crop which

987
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,160
 grows really fast and you can cut it down every year for hair to grow to the ideal length.

988
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,360
 You sort of need two to four years growth, depending on how much you want.

989
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,120
 And so people would offer women advanced payments because you've got to make sure you get that

990
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,440
 head of hair in four years' time when it's lush.

991
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,280
 So you'd pay in advance and say in four years I'll be back to chop that off.

992
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,960
 But you'd have to keep an eye on your investment the whole time, right, to make sure that there's

993
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,960
 not anything.

994
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:23,440
 I would sell my hair to multiple different people, take all the down payments and then

995
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,440
 scarpa.

996
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,440
 And that would be my fraud.

997
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,440
 Yeah.

998
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,560
 And the good thing is if you shaved your head, no one would recognize you.

999
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,080
 The Romans used to get hair from peasants, didn't they?

1000
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
 Oh.

1001
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,760
 They vogue the blonde hair in Roman times and they went to the conquered sort of Germanic

1002
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,600
 tribes and people even further north than that and they would take the blonde hair from

1003
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,800
 there and then the expensive wigs would be made from them, yeah.

1004
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,880
 And in the 16th century in Italy, blonde hair was really popular but it was very hard to

1005
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,640
 get hold of blonde wigs.

1006
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,800
 So what women would do is they would sit on the top of buildings in huge hats, they were

1007
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,200
 called Salanas.

1008
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,960
 So there was a massive brim but there was no top of the hat.

1009
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,320
 No, the sun could bleach their hair.

1010
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
 Oh.

1011
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,640
 Isn't that interesting.

1012
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:09,480
 Why did they have the massive hat?

1013
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,720
 To stop you from getting tanned skin.

1014
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,280
 But also you can lay out, if you've got long hair, you'd lay it out across the brim, can't

1015
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,280
 you?

1016
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,280
 Yes.

1017
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
 So you're bleaching all your hair at the same time.

1018
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,280
 Yeah.

1019
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,280
 The suntan thing as well might have been quite interesting.

1020
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,200
 Well, for a suntan you don't need a massive hat.

1021
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,720
 You just need a hat that's got a brim but massive.

1022
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,000
 I'm picturing sort of an umbrella sized.

1023
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 Yeah.

1024
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
 I like Andy's theory.

1025
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,520
 They used to be made of metal in the - Metal wigs.

1026
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:34,520
 The wig era.

1027
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,520
 Yeah, weird, right?

1028
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,680
 Sort of long strands of tin or steel, I think.

1029
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,920
 Not many but it wasn't a big fashion but there are accounts, aren't there, of iron wigs?

1030
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,440
 Yes, iron wigs, yeah.

1031
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,920
 Edward Waterley Montague was an author and traveller.

1032
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,400
 He had an iron wig and there was an advertiser who said it could withstand rain, wind and

1033
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,160
 hail and all without causing discomfort to the wearer which feels like a bit of a stretch

1034
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
 because...

1035
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,080
 The practical wig, though.

1036
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,800
 And then they went out of fashion, didn't they?

1037
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,800
 For various reasons.

1038
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,200
 One, there was a wig tax.

1039
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,440
 Wig powder tax even.

1040
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,440
 Sorry, that's what I mean.

1041
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,440
 Yeah.

1042
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,440
 Yeah.

1043
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,440
 It was pit the younger, wasn't it?

1044
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
 Yeah.

1045
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,440
 And there was a licensing system, like a TV license.

1046
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,840
 I tell you what, if Pit was a bit older he wouldn't bother about wigs so much.

1047
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,880
 It's alright for those young people to say no one should have wigs.

1048
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,520
 But it was roughly the cost of a modern TV license, I think.

1049
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
 Right.

1050
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,640
 And then a year, which I had read...

1051
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:28,640
 A lot of TV licenses.

1052
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,200
 Well, about 150 quid in modern money.

1053
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,720
 And so, I mean, there are obviously different ways of calculating it, but yeah, that's roughly

1054
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,720
 it.

1055
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,800
 Well, the hope was that they were going to sort of use that money to fight Napoleon.

1056
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,800
 Yeah.

1057
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,800
 It was crazy.

1058
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
 It worked.

1059
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
 Did it, did they?

1060
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 Yeah, it made a lot of money.

1061
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,200
 Because I thought people just stopped doing it as a result.

1062
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:49,640
 In the first year it raised £200,000, which was a lot.

1063
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,760
 But then by 1869 it was only raising £1,000 a year as wigs had gone out.

1064
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,960
 And then you were exempt if you were royal or if you were a clergyman on less than £100

1065
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
 a year.

1066
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
 There were various exemptions and...

1067
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,000
 Yeah, the royals need the help, don't they, poor guys?

1068
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,480
 And also it allowed them to create a funny nickname, guinea pigs, because pigtails were

1069
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
 all the rage.

1070
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,160
 Men used to wear them and it cost a guinea for the wig tax.

1071
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,680
 I mean, it's perfect.

1072
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,280
 So was that the origin of guinea pigs in terms of...

1073
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,280
 The animal?

1074
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,280
 No, not the animal.

1075
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,280
 Just in terms of that phrase, or is that a completely separate phase?

1076
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,280
 No.

1077
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,280
 Wait, what do you mean in terms of that phrase?

1078
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,640
 It's the phrase to describe someone being like a lab rat.

1079
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,320
 That came from the fact that people experimented on guinea pigs.

1080
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
 Okay, yeah.

1081
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,360
 But were people already experimenting on guinea pigs?

1082
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:36,880
 Guys, where do you think that meaning of guinea pig would have come from the people who paid

1083
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
 a wig tax?

1084
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,560
 Because they were the first people with the guinea pigs, they were testing the tax on

1085
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,560
 them.

1086
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,560
 It was human guinea pig.

1087
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,640
 No, no, it's from people testing drugs on guinea pigs.

1088
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,360
 Dan, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with you on this.

1089
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
 I'm not saying I'm with me.

1090
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,440
 I was just asking whether or not it was the worst place to be is with Dan, but he's not

1091
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
 on board.

1092
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
 I'm not with myself.

1093
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,520
 There's about a dozen early Nobel Prizes that were won by experiments on guinea pigs

1094
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
 specifically.

1095
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,520
 Right, okay.

1096
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
 But this phrase is from the...

1097
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,960
 Yeah, but that's not what it meant, though.

1098
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:04,960
 Right, sorry, yeah.

1099
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
 Here's the question.

1100
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,840
 Where does pigs come in into your phrase of guinea pigs?

1101
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
 Pig tails.

1102
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
 People call them pig tails.

1103
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
 Great.

1104
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
 Are you back on board with yourself, Dan?

1105
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
 No, I'm just learning.

1106
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
 I'm just learning.

1107
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,560
 What we're not 100% sure of, and maybe we should go back and check the sources, is that

1108
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,920
 in all those early 20th century medical sources when they were referred to testing on guinea

1109
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,660
 pigs, maybe they actually were testing on these overprivileged wig-wearing tops.

1110
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,660
 I haven't checked.

1111
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:30,800
 All I'm saying is, was it a phrase that evolved and evolved to a new meaning, kind of like

1112
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,680
 the wig, but turns out it's not.

1113
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,680
 So Andy, you're wrong.

1114
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,180
 Wow, this is a sick bird.

1115
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,560
 You're alone on the ship that Dan's built, then judge.

1116
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,560
 No!

1117
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,480
 But they went out of fashion.

1118
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,960
 We know that by about the 1820s.

1119
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,680
 But these weird little holdouts happened, didn't they, across society.

1120
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:51,320
 So coachmen kept going until the 1820s.

1121
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,760
 Bishops stopped in 1832 by royal permission.

1122
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,680
 They said, "We don't want to wear these anymore."

1123
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,400
 Cool people who live in the Hackney today, for instance, like myself, were always wearing

1124
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,400
 periwigs.

1125
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,400
 Right.

1126
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,400
 Well, it's you guys and barristers, James, because--

1127
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
 Barristers and barristers.

1128
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,560
 Very, very strong, nice.

1129
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,040
 But from the mid-1840s onwards, it sort of had a resurgence in court, and in court you

1130
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,360
 were technically invisible unless you were wearing a wig.

1131
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,400
 I don't mean technically invisible.

1132
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,040
 You would be, in quotes, not seen or heard.

1133
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,600
 The judge would not recognize you.

1134
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
 Wow.

1135
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,160
 So it's a way of being invisible, basically.

1136
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,240
 Oh, I don't know.

1137
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
 Where is Lord Plinge?

1138
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,240
 I can't see him anywhere.

1139
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,240
 Is it like that?

1140
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,240
 Basically that.

1141
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,240
 Amazing.

1142
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,240
 He's going, "Objection!

1143
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,240
 Objection!"

1144
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,240
 But he's not going his way on.

1145
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:39,200
 Some barristers still wear wigs today, and I read a great piece in the legal magazine

1146
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:45,920
 called "Council," which is a great magazine, and I recommend you all order, order it.

1147
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,120
 God, I just-- this is brilliant.

1148
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,640
 But I just-- I'm remembering the thing about the Sellafield magazine a few weeks ago, and

1149
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,000
 I think this could be Addy's magazine, Carter, for me, I think.

1150
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
 100%.

1151
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,120
 Sellafield magazine suddenly sounds like an agricultural kind of auction mag, doesn't

1152
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
 it?

1153
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,680
 Oh, God, another huge AK-47, AKB-48 thing.

1154
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,480
 Oh, I'm just trying to sell a field, but you've delivered uranium to me.

1155
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,160
 Now the Soviets are coming.

1156
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,520
 Put it with the unwanted gun in your pantry.

1157
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,600
 Oh, look, anyway, Council magazine wrote all about how wigs were nearly got rid of

1158
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,600
 in court, right?

1159
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,440
 So in 1940s, Parliament debated this clause, which was going to ban wigs and gowns in court.

1160
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,920
 It said, "This is ridiculous," so they went out 100 years ago in the rest of society,

1161
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,320
 and it prompted this huge backlash, and lots of MPs, who are obviously very traditionalist

1162
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,760
 as well, objected.

1163
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,240
 One MP asked whether the clause would also deprive admirals of their three-cornered hats

1164
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,200
 or deprive generals of their epaulettes or clergymen of their distinctive attire.

1165
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,720
 He said nothing about nurses, the person who had proposed this clause.

1166
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,360
 He said nothing about nurses, although I think we all agree that they look very pretty in

1167
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,360
 their distinctive attire.

1168
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
 Oh, my God.

1169
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
 I know.

1170
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
 That has a common stuff.

1171
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,360
 Jesus Christ.

1172
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,360
 Wow.

1173
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,320
 But there was a fear that judges would not look majestic if they took their wigs off,

1174
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,520
 and that if a judge was seen in his wig, he was embodying the law and very powerful.

1175
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,880
 But if seen with that one, he might look like a wizened-up gargoyle.

1176
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:16,880
 So, problem.

1177
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,280
 That's really rough on judges.

1178
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,160
 Wigs are a big role in the civil rights movement in America.

1179
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,040
 That is because during desegregation in the '60s, there are a lot of jobs where they kind

1180
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,880
 of banned African-American hairstyles, and they kind of said you had to comply with

1181
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,480
 a certain hairstyle.

1182
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,800
 And so a lot of people had to wear wigs to kind of cover that up.

1183
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,000
 But then there were activists such as Marcus Garvey who said, "Look, this is ridiculous.

1184
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,360
 We can't be doing this.

1185
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:52,520
 One, we need to stop people discriminating against hairstyles, but two, we need to kind

1186
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,560
 of reclaim our hairstyle and kind of be proud of it."

1187
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,680
 And he said, "Don't remove the kinks from your hair.

1188
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,640
 Remove them from your brain."

1189
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:04,720
 And then in the 1970s, there was kind of a resurgence of people reclaiming the African-American

1190
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,160
 hairstyle.

1191
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:12,040
 And then all the way to the present day in 2019, New York became the second state to

1192
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,760
 ban discrimination on the hairstyles.

1193
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,160
 So in California and New York right now, you're not allowed to discriminate on anyone due

1194
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,760
 to their hairstyle, and that is going back to the civil rights movement and all that

1195
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,760
 stuff.

1196
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,760
 Right.

1197
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,760
 I didn't know we were allowed to do that before.

1198
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
 You would think so, wouldn't you?

1199
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:28,760
 No, wouldn't you?

1200
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,360
 You would piss out people with pigtails left, right, and centre.

1201
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,880
 Do you guys know about the Wig Club?

1202
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,880
 No.

1203
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:35,880
 No.

1204
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,080
 It was founded in 1775 in Edinburgh, and there was a really cool investigation into it by

1205
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,760
 an author called David Stevenson, and it was a gentleman's sex club.

1206
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:47,560
 And I mean, no, I haven't heard of it now, and I don't know.

1207
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,560
 Yeah.

1208
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,560
 It was a good test, and well done.

1209
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
 You all passed.

1210
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:55,720
 It was named after a wig that they had as their kind of relic, their club relic that

1211
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,960
 was made from the pubic hair of Charles II's mistresses that had apparently been worn

1212
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,960
 by Charles II.

1213
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:06,840
 And when you joined the Wig Club as part of your initiation, you had to provide locks

1214
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:12,560
 of pubic hair suitably harvested to be added to the wig as proof of having triumph sexually.

1215
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,240
 So you had to, after triumphing sexually, I guess, say to the woman, "Sorry, do you

1216
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,680
 mind if I snip off a curl of your pubic hair because I'm hoping to join a sex club?"

1217
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,960
 To definitely do that afterwards, I would say.

1218
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,600
 And yeah, they just met and talked about how much sex they were having and drank a lot.

1219
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,160
 These guys sound great.

1220
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,160
 Yeah.

1221
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,740
 So no actual sex happened at the Wig Club.

1222
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:43,240
 It was just a bunch of virgins getting together, bringing cut locks from their dogs.

1223
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:44,240
 Exactly.

1224
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,520
 Yeah, I just shagged hard last night, man.

1225
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,520
 Is that what it was?

1226
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,520
 Yeah, yeah.

1227
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:49,520
 It's a really cool club to be a member of.

1228
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,520
 Yeah.

1229
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,520
 I would have applied.

1230
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,760
 I'm not going to lie.

1231
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,100
 Some wigs were made of duck's tail feathers.

1232
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,440
 Wigs specifically for Parsons and Vickers, because it was to fight off the wet, because

1233
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,600
 obviously water off a duck's back.

1234
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
 Oh, clever.

1235
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,160
 They literally had a duck's ass at the front of their head, looking so stupid.

1236
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,160
 That'd be amazing.

1237
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,160
 Yeah.

1238
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,400
 It is quite clever though, isn't it?

1239
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,400
 Yeah.

1240
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,680
 What animals hair would you have as a wig if you could have any?

1241
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,400
 Peacock and just let it go.

1242
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,400
 Yeah.

1243
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
 For long peacocks.

1244
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,400
 That's a good idea.

1245
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,000
 Is it a peacock's tail that you've got?

1246
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
 No.

1247
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
 I've missed that bit.

1248
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,520
 Oh, you just want the ordinary cleavage, but okay, okay.

1249
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,520
 That's cool.

1250
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,520
 Would that be whenever you clench your teeth?

1251
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,520
 It fans out.

1252
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,520
 Whenever you tense your head.

1253
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,520
 Yeah, so that's a good idea.

1254
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,120
 I would have thought like you'd come in from the cold, take your hat off, and it kind of

1255
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
 comes out.

1256
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
 Yes.

1257
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,120
 Yes, it fans.

1258
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,120
 Jack in a box.

1259
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
 Yeah.

1260
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,120
 I'd probably get an orangutan.

1261
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,120
 Oh, yeah.

1262
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,120
 Orangutan.

1263
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,120
 They do, don't they?

1264
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,120
 Yeah.

1265
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
 Always wanted to be a ginger.

1266
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,120
 Don't know.

1267
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,120
 Very wiry orangutan hair.

1268
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
 It looks wiry.

1269
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:58,120
 How do you know?

1270
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,120
 It looks wiry.

1271
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
 From a distance.

1272
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
 It's got a pubic quality about it.

1273
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,120
 You could bring it to your wig party.

1274
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,560
 I was just thinking yak, just because it's so long and luscious.

1275
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,560
 Lovely.

1276
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,560
 Yeah.

1277
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,560
 And wise.

1278
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:11,560
 Wise.

1279
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
 Just the yak.

1280
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
 Wise like a yak.

1281
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
 Not saying.

1282
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,560
 It is now.

1283
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:22,620
 OK, that's it.

1284
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,620
