00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, Andy here. Just before we start this week's show we have an"
00:00:06,00:00:13,announcement to make. It's a bit of a serious one. It's that for a while we are not going to be able to
00:00:13,00:00:21,"record our podcast from our spiritual home, our Covent Garden office anymore and there's a simple reason for that and"
00:00:21,00:00:25,the reason is that we are going on
00:00:25,00:00:33,on tour. That's right. I tricked you all. It wasn't bad news. It's good news. You thought someone had died. Quite the reverse
00:00:33,00:00:37,we're going to be on tour live and amplified across the entirety of the UK and Ireland.
00:00:37,00:00:42,We're going to be going all over the shop. Are we going to Barnstable? You bet your bum we're going to Barnstable.
00:00:42,00:00:49,"Are we going to pool? As a rule, we're going to pool and 25 other places across the UK and of course not to forget Dublin."
00:00:49,00:00:54,"I know what you're thinking. What's the show going to involve? Well, I'll tell you it's going to be a live"
00:00:54,00:00:58,new fresh podcast right for your ears in the second half every single night. All the bits
00:00:58,00:01:02,they're actually too funny to put out in the edited version of the show and the first half is going to be an
00:01:02,00:01:07,extraordinary cavalcade of different things. So much different stuff is going to happen in the first half.
00:01:07,00:01:16,"Elephants, dancing girls, dancing boys, fireworks, dance famous avocado trick and a number of other things that I really probably shouldn't actually be promising to you."
00:01:16,00:01:20,"But Andy, Andy, Andy, how do we get our tickets? It's very simple everybody."
00:01:20,00:01:26,"All you have to do is go to knowsuchthingasafish.com, find the nearest one and click book. That's it."
00:01:26,00:01:31,Knowsuchthingasafish.com. That's it. It's going to be so much fun.
00:01:31,00:01:38,"We cannot wait to see you there. If you're not there, we'll talk about you behind your back. All right, that's it on with the show."
00:01:38,00:02:02,"Hello and welcome to another episode of Knowsuchthingasafish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden."
00:02:02,00:02:04,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:02:04,00:02:10,"I am sitting at a ginormous distance from Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski."
00:02:10,00:02:18,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go."
00:02:18,00:02:21,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:02:21,00:02:33,"OK, my fact this week is that Nate Mercerow, who produced the most recent album of Grammy winning R&B star Leon Bridges, has now started collaborating with actual Bridges."
00:02:34,00:02:37,"When you're onto a winner, right? Just stick with it."
00:02:37,00:02:42,"How many elements of your fact had you heard of before discovering this, James? Be honest."
00:02:42,00:02:43,I'd heard of Bridges.
00:02:43,00:02:45,That's what I suspected.
00:02:45,00:02:47,Grammys. You must have heard of the Grammys.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"You must have heard of the Grammys, R&B stars."
00:02:48,00:02:54,"I was reading an article in The Guardian about the Golden Gate Bridge, which started making this weird sort of humming noise."
00:02:54,00:03:00,But a local musician made some singles where he does a duet with the bridge.
00:03:00,00:03:06,"And when I say local musician, I mean extremely famous record producer, Nate Mercerow."
00:03:06,00:03:14,"But I'd never heard of him, so I googled him and it turned out that he's worked with people like Jay-Z and with Lizzo, who I have heard of."
00:03:14,00:03:19,"And also a guy called Leon Bridges, who I hadn't heard of, but he has got the word Bridges in his name."
00:03:19,00:03:25,"And he's won a bunch of awards, so he's obviously very famous and I think that's my problem, not his."
00:03:28,00:03:32,"Did they call it Bridges Over Troubled Water, this new collaboration with the bridge?"
00:03:32,00:03:36,"They don't call it that. No, I think he went for more of that artistic than the punny."
00:03:36,00:03:40,"I think Simon and Garfunkel are quite, I imagine they're quite litigious."
00:03:40,00:03:42,I wouldn't want to get up in their face with that.
00:03:42,00:03:44,And Simon and Garfunkel are still alive?
00:03:44,00:03:44,"Yeah, both."
00:03:44,00:03:45,Both?
00:03:45,00:03:45,Yeah.
00:03:45,00:03:46,"Not both of them, surely."
00:03:46,00:03:47,Both still alive.
00:03:47,00:03:49,"If you've seen them before on stage, you wouldn't know, but."
00:03:49,00:03:50,Wow.
00:03:50,00:03:51,Ouch.
00:03:51,00:03:55,"You know what? I'm thinking of Paul Newman, not Paul Simon, who's still alive."
00:03:55,00:03:56,"Well, yeah, Newman and Garfunkel is a very..."
00:03:57,00:03:59,Interesting call.
00:03:59,00:04:05,"So this Golden Gate Bridge collaboration, I listen to it, it's really good."
00:04:05,00:04:09,So you see the bridge in the background and it's just making this weird noise.
00:04:09,00:04:14,"And then Nate Mercerow kind of shambles on after a minute, where the bridge is, frankly, holding the stage very well."
00:04:14,00:04:20,"And he starts, but he starts adding some guitar sound over the top of it to kind of match it and move around it."
00:04:20,00:04:22,And it sounds really eerie and great.
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Yeah, it is spooky."
00:04:23,00:04:26,"He likened it to Tibetan singing bowls, didn't he?"
00:04:26,00:04:28,Which those things that...
00:04:28,00:04:29,I just got one of those.
00:04:29,00:04:30,Did you?
00:04:30,00:04:31,"I've seen it, yes."
00:04:31,00:04:32,Nice.
00:04:32,00:04:33,Why did you buy one of those?
00:04:33,00:04:36,"I mean, I have one, but I went to Tibet."
00:04:36,00:04:40,"Well, the guy in the shop who sold it to me said it's either from Tibet or it's from Wales."
00:04:40,00:04:43,And he wouldn't confirm either way where it was from.
00:04:43,00:04:45,Dan sent me to a witchcraft shop to buy it.
00:04:45,00:04:46,It was great.
00:04:46,00:04:51,"I bought mine in Tibet, in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, from a guy called Alan Jones."
00:04:51,00:04:55,"Interesting, because they don't actually have anything to do with Tibet."
00:04:55,00:04:57,So that Tibetans just ripping you off.
00:04:57,00:05:00,Why did they get the Tibet name then?
00:05:00,00:05:05,"I think it's just one of those Western, let's make it sound cool and spiritual and it's from somewhere over there."
00:05:05,00:05:07,"But yeah, India or Nepal."
00:05:07,00:05:12,But apparently I was reading about the dangers of singing bowls and I wonder if the bridge has the same dangers.
00:05:12,00:05:15,You can get a headache from them.
00:05:15,00:05:16,"So Andy, be careful."
00:05:16,00:05:17,"Oh, gosh."
00:05:17,00:05:22,"Yeah, and if you're pregnant, which I don't know if you are, then they don't know if it will affect it,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,but they advise not to risk it.
00:05:24,00:05:27,But who?
00:05:27,00:05:30,This was just a website listing the risks of Tibetan singing bowls.
00:05:30,00:05:32,Pregnant women can't listen to Tibetan singing bowls.
00:05:32,00:05:33,Just don't risk it.
00:05:33,00:05:35,We don't know that it would do any damage.
00:05:35,00:05:41,"But that's, could we virtually say we don't know anything that will risk pregnancy if we haven't tested it?"
00:05:41,00:05:43,Like presumably no doctor's gone.
00:05:43,00:05:46,Do you know what I'm going to focus on this week?
00:05:46,00:05:48,"Seeing how this affects pregnancy, Tibetan singing bowls."
00:05:48,00:05:49,"Yeah, that's correct."
00:05:49,00:05:54,"I think this website is leaning heavily on the safe side and yeah, don't risk moving, listening to anything."
00:05:54,00:05:55,"But look, that's my advice."
00:05:55,00:05:56,Very strange.
00:05:56,00:06:05,"So this, it was quite hard to get the recording of the Golden Gate Bridge because basically the reason it's humming is that the wind is going through it."
00:06:05,00:06:12,"They put some new slats on the bridge's railings, which is supposed to stop it from getting in trouble in high winds."
00:06:12,00:06:17,But all it's done is means that when the wind goes through it and makes this kind of eerie sound.
00:06:17,00:06:21,"But also it means that when you try and record it, necessarily it's going to be a windy day."
00:06:21,00:06:26,And so it's really hard to get the sound of the bridge as well as this and kind of get rid of the sound of the wind.
00:06:26,00:06:29,But good old Nate Merceral managed it.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"Yeah, he found the cove, didn't he?"
00:06:31,00:06:34,"He had to go down this cove, which was partially blocked by the wind."
00:06:34,00:06:40,"And then in order to get all the equipment working, they had to bring a car battery down to power it all."
00:06:40,00:06:42,"And so yeah, it was a proper process."
00:06:42,00:06:45,The wind supposedly plays in the note of A.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"So if you want to go and collaborate with it, that's your note to go with, which is what, yeah."
00:06:49,00:06:51,"I thought it had a range, does it not?"
00:06:51,00:06:54,"Well, it emits a 440 Hertz hum."
00:06:54,00:06:58,"And so, yeah, it probably oscillates, but it will around a bit within, yeah."
00:06:58,00:07:01,"So one person said you could tune your oboe to it, because that's what your oboe is."
00:07:01,00:07:03,What a difficult and pointless way of tuning an oboe.
00:07:03,00:07:09,"If you live in San Francisco, though, and you're an oboe, it's an opening window."
00:07:09,00:07:10,It's tuning.
00:07:10,00:07:14,"It's nice because Strauss, who was the guy who built the bridge, who engineered the bridge, said..."
00:07:14,00:07:15,Not Richard Strauss.
00:07:15,00:07:18,"We've got not Richard Strauss, no, Joseph Strauss."
00:07:18,00:07:19,He's been trying to build a massive oboe.
00:07:19,00:07:27,"He described it as saying, ""As harps for the winds of heaven, my web-like cables are spun."""
00:07:27,00:07:30,So he imagined his bridge as a harp that could be played by the heavens.
00:07:30,00:07:32,"That's really romantic for a bridge maker, isn't it?"
00:07:32,00:07:34,"That's very poetic, yeah."
00:07:34,00:07:35,It's an amazing bridge.
00:07:35,00:07:38,"I'd never really read about it before or learned anything about it,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,because I've not been to San Francisco.
00:07:40,00:07:45,"But it's 1.7 miles long, and it's across the Golden Gate Strait."
00:07:45,00:07:47,"Obviously, it's not a golden bridge."
00:07:47,00:07:49,It is red.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"No, it's orange, sorry."
00:07:50,00:07:51,International orange.
00:07:51,00:07:54,International orange has its own paint colour.
00:07:54,00:07:59,But it could so nearly have been a no-such-thing-as-a-fish-themed bridge.
00:07:59,00:08:00,Did you guys find this?
00:08:00,00:08:03,The US Navy wanted to paint it in black and yellow stripes.
00:08:03,00:08:06,In honour of no-such-thing-as-a-fish?
00:08:06,00:08:08,"80 years, I've won a lecture, but yeah, yeah."
00:08:08,00:08:09,It could have been so cool.
00:08:09,00:08:14,"And it arrived, didn't it, in the colour that it is now, close to the orange."
00:08:14,00:08:17,"And when they saw that, they went, actually, that aesthetically would work"
00:08:17,00:08:19,for incoming ships as well.
00:08:19,00:08:24,And it looks much better than this weird giant warning sign across the bay.
00:08:24,00:08:26,Although I'm sceptical about that.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"So yeah, they said, I think the Navy wanted that,"
00:08:28,00:08:30,"and the Army Air Corps wanted a red and white colour scheme,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,so it's visible from the air.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"And yeah, everyone says, oh, we saw the base layer,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,"which was this orange colour, and we thought that's perfect."
00:08:37,00:08:40,"But I think what they thought was, we've got a fucking massive bridge here."
00:08:40,00:08:43,Do we really want to bother painting the whole thing again?
00:08:43,00:08:45,"Yeah, that's in two colours."
00:08:45,00:08:46,"Yeah, in two colours, yeah."
00:08:46,00:08:47,Nightmare.
00:08:47,00:08:48,There's a great story.
00:08:48,00:08:50,"So it had two openings, didn't it, the bridge?"
00:08:50,00:08:52,It had a pedestrian opening.
00:08:52,00:08:53,"In and out, isn't it?"
00:08:53,00:08:57,"So yeah, there's four openings in total."
00:08:57,00:08:59,"In and out, and then when they actually opened it,"
00:08:59,00:09:01,"they did one day for pedestrians,"
00:09:01,00:09:04,and then they did another day for the actual automobiles going across.
00:09:04,00:09:09,"And on the day that it opened to pedestrians, 18,000 people crossed it."
00:09:09,00:09:14,"And many of the 18,000 wanted to set a record of being the first to do something on it."
00:09:14,00:09:19,So the first person to get across it was a sprinter called Donald Bryant.
00:09:19,00:09:21,So he was the first man to run across it.
00:09:21,00:09:25,"There were Esther and Anne Bullard, who were the first recorded twins."
00:09:25,00:09:27,Carmen and Minnie Perez were the first skaters.
00:09:27,00:09:31,Florentine Caligari was the first on stilts.
00:09:31,00:09:34,"There was a Scotty, which was the first dog."
00:09:34,00:09:38,Police rushed to aid one woman who was staggering along with her tongue out.
00:09:38,00:09:40,And it turns out she was just trying to become the first woman
00:09:40,00:09:42,to cross it with her tongue out.
00:09:42,00:09:43,Why was she staggering?
00:09:43,00:09:45,She had a very heavy tongue or something.
00:09:45,00:09:47,"She was, it's a long walk, as you said."
00:09:47,00:09:49,It's a long bridge.
00:09:49,00:09:52,Has anyone gone across it while doing a podcast?
00:09:52,00:09:55,"Oh, great shout."
00:09:55,00:09:58,"Not in, not in 1937, anyway."
00:09:58,00:10:01,"The first rope to be taken across,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,"which was taken across by Boy Scout Trout,"
00:10:03,00:10:07,number five of San El Salmo by their club master.
00:10:07,00:10:09,I had a slim picking at that stage.
00:10:09,00:10:12,Do you think it's someone who's got to the end with their tongue out?
00:10:12,00:10:15,"If someone's gone, someone's already done this."
00:10:15,00:10:16,"And they've looked in their pockets, they're like,"
00:10:16,00:10:20,"""Well, I've got a bit of rope here, is anyone taking a rope over?"""
00:10:20,00:10:22,There's a brilliant book called Building the Golden Gate Bridge
00:10:22,00:10:25,"and Workers' Oral History by Schwartz Harvey,"
00:10:25,00:10:28,where he spoke to all the different people who worked on it.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"I think we said before that when they built it,"
00:10:30,00:10:32,"they put a massive net underneath the bridge,"
00:10:32,00:10:36,"so that if anyone fell down, they fell into that giant net."
00:10:36,00:10:38,But people who actually fell in there and survived
00:10:38,00:10:42,joined a supposed club called the Halfway to Hell Club.
00:10:42,00:10:44,"There was someone there who worked on it,"
00:10:44,00:10:47,who said it was the coldest place they ever worked.
00:10:47,00:10:50,You had to put on all the clothes you owned
00:10:50,00:10:51,"and you had to carry on working,"
00:10:51,00:10:54,otherwise you would just freeze while you were doing it.
00:10:54,00:10:56,"And there was no women working on the bridge,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"but there was a woman called Dewey's Bowen,"
00:10:59,00:11:03,who was working as a nurse for all the men who were working on the bridge.
00:11:03,00:11:07,And she said that what would happen is that their wives would come and visit them
00:11:07,00:11:11,"and they would always bring them some bread or salami or some wine,"
00:11:11,00:11:13,and then the men would always give it to the nurses.
00:11:13,00:11:15,"And so they would always say to the nurse,"
00:11:15,00:11:17,"""Make sure you wear a cape tomorrow."""
00:11:17,00:11:19,And what they would do is they would take their cape
00:11:19,00:11:21,and they would hide all the goodies under their cape
00:11:21,00:11:23,and then have a midnight snack.
00:11:23,00:11:25,"- Nice! - It's kind of cool, isn't it?"
00:11:25,00:11:27,"But it was really, really dangerous."
00:11:27,00:11:29,But the people who worked on it really needed the work.
00:11:29,00:11:32,And so there were out-of-work men who would routinely line the sites
00:11:32,00:11:34,"of the Golden Gate Bridge,"
00:11:34,00:11:37,and they were waiting for someone to either quit or fall off the bridge
00:11:37,00:11:39,"so they could start work, honestly."
00:11:39,00:11:42,But it was actually safer than other construction projects
00:11:42,00:11:45,"because Joseph Strauss, a bit ahead of his time in health and safety terms,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,was really into things like hard hats.
00:11:47,00:11:49,It was the first time hard hats were compulsory.
00:11:49,00:11:51,He put this big net under it.
00:11:51,00:11:55,"It had a lower death rate than most construction projects,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"although some people still died, obviously."
00:11:57,00:11:58,But it still does sound terrifying.
00:11:58,00:12:01,I think I was reading in the same book an account by a guy
00:12:01,00:12:04,who was describing how he was employed to work on it.
00:12:04,00:12:08,And you took an elevator up through one of the towers right up to the top.
00:12:08,00:12:10,So it's 710 feet.
00:12:10,00:12:11,"You go up in this elevator,"
00:12:11,00:12:13,and he remembers going up for the first time with two painters
00:12:13,00:12:15,who were employed to paint it.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"And the elevator opened at the top,"
00:12:18,00:12:21,"and it opened onto a two-foot-wide wooden plank,"
00:12:21,00:12:24,which you had to walk across to get onto the scaffolding.
00:12:24,00:12:26,"And the two painters said to the elevator operator,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,"""Well, what are we supposed to do now?"""
00:12:27,00:12:29,"And the operator said, ""Well, you walk across that."""
00:12:29,00:12:32,So they immediately quit and asked to be taken back down again.
00:12:32,00:12:34,And then for this guy went for it.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"So stressful, especially if you've got a row of people shouting at you"
00:12:37,00:12:40,in the hope that you will fall off standing on the side.
00:12:40,00:12:42,"""Oh, you missed a bit, mate. Just go a bit further."""
00:12:42,00:12:44,"""Bit further out on the plank."""
00:12:44,00:12:46,"I think still, like, if you're a maintenance worker on there,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,you have to do this thing.
00:12:47,00:12:50,"On the second day, they make you walk on a cable,"
00:12:50,00:12:52,"which is 36 inches in diameter,"
00:12:52,00:12:55,but with only a 12-inch strip down the middle
00:12:55,00:12:58,"that you have to stay on because the rest of it's really slippy,"
00:12:58,00:13:00,and that bit isn't slippy.
00:13:00,00:13:01,So that's your test to get the job right.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:13:02,00:13:04,"There's a guy called Greg Montareno,"
00:13:04,00:13:08,"and he said, ""If you can't walk the cable, there's no day three."""
00:13:08,00:13:09,God!
00:13:09,00:13:11,How is that interview process when you go in?
00:13:11,00:13:15,How are you not falling off bridges?
00:13:15,00:13:16,"This hum, by the way,"
00:13:16,00:13:19,is as a result of them trying to make the bridge safer as well.
00:13:19,00:13:23,So they spent ages trying to work out what was causing this hum
00:13:23,00:13:25,"because it came out of nowhere,"
00:13:25,00:13:27,and they worked out that it was these new thinner slats
00:13:27,00:13:29,that were put on the bridge
00:13:29,00:13:32,"that were meant to help it withstand wind,"
00:13:32,00:13:35,"because the wind is so great in that area,"
00:13:35,00:13:37,and the bridge at the moment can stand
00:13:37,00:13:41,something in the vicinity of 69.34 miles per hour.
00:13:41,00:13:42,That's sort of what it's built.
00:13:42,00:13:44,Something in the vicinity of 69.4.
00:13:44,00:13:47,So can it do 69.35 miles an hour?
00:13:47,00:13:48,Something in that vicinity.
00:13:48,00:13:50,"Yeah, but not that."
00:13:50,00:13:54,"That's too high, 5.01."
00:13:54,00:13:57,"It's around 69 miles per hour, and it has gone beyond that."
00:13:57,00:14:00,"It's gone up to 75 miles per hour, and it's managed to stay up."
00:14:00,00:14:02,"But they are worried that if it went higher than that,"
00:14:02,00:14:03,the whole bridge could collapse.
00:14:03,00:14:05,So these new slats are designed to allow it
00:14:05,00:14:07,to withstand 100 mile per hour winds.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"But that's what caused the hums in the end,"
00:14:09,00:14:10,and they're going to try and fix it now.
00:14:10,00:14:12,So this might be the only collaboration
00:14:12,00:14:15,"that the bridge does, unfortunately."
00:14:15,00:14:18,"Well, bridges do tend to make noises anyway."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"I was reading about a musician called Jodie Rose,"
00:14:20,00:14:23,who is really obsessed with the sound of bridges.
00:14:23,00:14:26,And she has released albums of bridge noises called...
00:14:26,00:14:28,"I think there's one called ""Singing Bridges."""
00:14:28,00:14:31,I was listening to one. It's kind of nice.
00:14:31,00:14:33,Don't listen if you're pregnant to a singing bridge.
00:14:33,00:14:36,"If it's Tibetan, you can't listen to it."
00:14:36,00:14:40,"Actually, it's a myth that singing bridges are originally Tibetan."
00:14:40,00:14:41,"Yeah, it's great."
00:14:41,00:14:44,"She's recorded bridges like the Millennium Bridge,"
00:14:44,00:14:48,"the Batman Bridge in Tasmania, in Finland, Rotterdam, Vietnam."
00:14:48,00:14:50,She's traveled all over the world on the profits
00:14:50,00:14:52,that she makes from selling her bridge-based sound albums.
00:14:52,00:14:53,She's listening to.
00:14:53,00:14:54,"Is it people on the bridge, or is it these bridges that..."
00:14:54,00:14:57,"Can I just say, I've walked across the Millennium Bridge"
00:14:57,00:14:59,"on many, many occasions and never noticed the sound."
00:14:59,00:15:02,"She puts a microphone on the actual cables,"
00:15:02,00:15:03,so you catch the creaking.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"And I guess when you walk across it,"
00:15:04,00:15:07,maybe your ears are pinned to the cables themselves.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"Well, it is, because I'm trying to be the first person"
00:15:09,00:15:11,to cross it with my ear pinned to the ground.
00:15:11,00:15:16,"So, there are mysterious hums around the world,"
00:15:16,00:15:17,"around the universe, in fact."
00:15:17,00:15:21,Voyager 1 spacecraft has just managed to detect
00:15:21,00:15:24,the background hum of interstellar space for the first time.
00:15:24,00:15:27,"Apparently, the universe hums."
00:15:27,00:15:30,"That's so good that the universes are going, ""Hmm."""
00:15:30,00:15:32,Yeah. Do you think it's skeptical?
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Yeah, not sure. I think disapproving."
00:15:34,00:15:35,"Yeah, not sure."
00:15:35,00:15:36,Yeah.
00:15:36,00:15:39,"There is a constant hum of interstellar plasma, apparently,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"and it's caused when a star, such as a sun,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,"sends out a coronal mass ejection,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"which is something we discussed the other day with Robinance,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,then it will fire into this plasma
00:15:48,00:15:52,"and kind of make the electrons sort of vibrate a little bit,"
00:15:52,00:15:53,and you can measure that.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"It's going to be a whole Grammy category for this one day,"
00:15:55,00:15:58,"isn't it, from collaborations."
00:15:58,00:16:01,"You know, a horse's ears sometimes hum."
00:16:01,00:16:02,Really? Yeah.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"Yeah, that's right."
00:16:04,00:16:06,This was...
00:16:06,00:16:07,Can't believe you guys didn't know that.
00:16:07,00:16:10,You said that like you had to convince yourself.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"I am looking at my nose and thinking, ""Can this be true?"""
00:16:12,00:16:15,"But yeah, in 1995, vets at Newmarket"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"were doing some surgery on a horse's lip,"
00:16:18,00:16:20,"and they noticed that his ear was emitting a sound,"
00:16:20,00:16:22,"a bit like the sound you hear when you've got a bit of tinnitus,"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"like a beeping sound, and they didn't know why,"
00:16:25,00:16:27,but I went on horse and hound forum
00:16:27,00:16:29,and other people have had this problem.
00:16:29,00:16:30,I think humans have it sometimes.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Yes, humans do get it, objective tinnitus."
00:16:33,00:16:37,"Extremely rare, much more rare than subjective tinnitus."
00:16:37,00:16:39,It's making a ringing note. Your ear makes a ringing note.
00:16:39,00:16:41,Exactly. Whoa.
00:16:41,00:16:43,"So, you know, if you have tinnitus, go to the ENT surgeon,"
00:16:43,00:16:46,"just in case they have a listen and go, ""Yeah, you're right."""
00:16:46,00:16:47,"No, it's not in your head."
00:16:47,00:16:48,"Well, it is in your head, but..."
00:16:48,00:16:50,It's going to be annoying if Nate Mercerell
00:16:50,00:16:53,follows you around with his guitar and just try to make songs.
00:16:53,00:17:02,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Anna."
00:17:02,00:17:05,My fact this week is that dragonflies used to be the same size
00:17:05,00:17:07,as modern-day pigeons.
00:17:07,00:17:09,- Wow. - Terrifying.
00:17:09,00:17:11,- Yeah. - With frightening facts.
00:17:11,00:17:14,"So bad. No, 'cause dragonflies are beautiful and cool."
00:17:14,00:17:15,"That's true, and pigeons are not. You're right."
00:17:15,00:17:17,"- I don't know, they're scary. - If you could..."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"All right, James, if you could replace every pigeon in the world"
00:17:20,00:17:22,"with a dragonfly of equivalent size, would you?"
00:17:22,00:17:23,100%.
00:17:23,00:17:25,"- Really? - Everyone would, wouldn't they?"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"- I love pigeons. - Actually, I would, too."
00:17:27,00:17:28,- What? - Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:30,We found the real fault line in a fish after seven years.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"Oh, the dragonflies."
00:17:31,00:17:33,"Well, dragonflies, prior to reading this,"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"I would have been fine with it, having now read what they're like."
00:17:35,00:17:37,I think they're terrifying creatures.
00:17:37,00:17:39,What would they like? They weren't that bad.
00:17:39,00:17:42,"OK, so they were larger than your average dragonfly,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,"and they were, in fact, the largest insect ever, probably."
00:17:45,00:17:48,"This was about 300 million years ago in the Paleozoic era,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,and they're called mega-neura.
00:17:51,00:17:53,"Sometimes they're referred to as griffinflies,"
00:17:53,00:17:57,"and they had a 70-centimeter wingspan, about 40-centimeters long,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,"and, yeah, they're the grandparents of the modern dragonfly."
00:17:59,00:18:01,They would be able to hunt larger things
00:18:01,00:18:03,"than they can hunt today, I guess."
00:18:03,00:18:05,"But, yeah, they were the biggest flying things, basically,"
00:18:05,00:18:06,until reptiles started flying.
00:18:06,00:18:08,They were the biggest things you'd ever see in the sky.
00:18:08,00:18:09,Amazing. Wow.
00:18:09,00:18:11,And so cool. They're really interesting things.
00:18:11,00:18:13,And they were allowed to get this big
00:18:13,00:18:16,because the oxygen levels in the air were so high at the time.
00:18:16,00:18:20,"There were 40% oxygen in the air as well as to 21 now,"
00:18:20,00:18:22,so they just had a lot more potential power
00:18:22,00:18:23,in the air around them.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"How big would we have been, though, if we were around then?"
00:18:25,00:18:28,Huge. I always say this. I think this is ridiculous.
00:18:28,00:18:31,"You always find these fossils of, like, giant dragonflies,"
00:18:31,00:18:34,"giant millipedes, like, giant reptiles."
00:18:34,00:18:36,Yeah. Where are the giant humans?
00:18:36,00:18:37,"Mm, yeah. Where are they?"
00:18:37,00:18:39,You've blown this shit wide open.
00:18:39,00:18:41,Darwin is turning in his grave.
00:18:41,00:18:44,The answer is we would not necessarily have been that much bigger
00:18:44,00:18:47,"because they were large, because they breathe in a different way to us."
00:18:47,00:18:50,"So, they don't have any lungs, insects."
00:18:50,00:18:51,"They essentially breathe through little holes,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,-spiracles. -Spiracles. Exactly.
00:18:53,00:18:54,In their skin.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"And actually, scientists don't really know"
00:18:56,00:18:59,how they get enough oxygen to themselves at all
00:18:59,00:19:00,"because, and I learned this fact,"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"which I found amazing while researching this,"
00:19:02,00:19:05,"each oxygen molecule, if it was moving through empty air,"
00:19:05,00:19:09,it could move at about half a kilometer per second.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"But because it crashes into other molecules so often,"
00:19:12,00:19:14,it goes one centimeter a second.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"So, every second, it has 10 billion collisions."
00:19:18,00:19:20,"So, that's basically like, imagine you're an insect,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,"and you've just got these holes which are waiting for an oxygen molecule to drift in,"
00:19:23,00:19:26,"and there's an oxygen molecule, you know, 10 centimeters away."
00:19:26,00:19:29,It's making billions and billions and billions of collisions.
00:19:29,00:19:30,"-It's never going to get to you. -Okay, yeah."
00:19:30,00:19:34,"So, this is why, in the olden days, when oxygen was more concentrated,"
00:19:34,00:19:37,"they could get more oxygen inside their bigger bodies,"
00:19:37,00:19:40,but now they can only really get them on the surface of their bodies.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"So, as soon as they get too fat, they can't breathe anymore."
00:19:42,00:19:45,"If they've got too much meat in their body,"
00:19:45,00:19:46,the oxygen molecules can't go in.
00:19:46,00:19:50,"Whereas we suck oxygen in, we, you know, use our diaphragm."
00:19:50,00:19:54,"Question, because they eat a lot, and they eat a lot quite quickly."
00:19:54,00:19:59,"So, if, let's say, imagine we were the thing they were eating,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,"how much oxygen is inside us, at this moment inside me?"
00:20:02,00:20:05,Are we talking about the big dragonflies from the past at the moment?
00:20:05,00:20:08,"Well, shrink me down, no, to a modern day dragonfly."
00:20:08,00:20:12,"You've been shrunk down in some kind of weird ""Honey, I shrunk the kids"" movie"
00:20:12,00:20:13,to the size of a dragonfly.
00:20:13,00:20:16,"-No, I'm the... -To the size of a dragonfly's prey."
00:20:16,00:20:17,"-Pray, exactly. -I like a mosquito."
00:20:17,00:20:20,"-Like a mosquito. -Dankito, right?"
00:20:20,00:20:21,-Yeah. -We're going to need...
00:20:21,00:20:25,"So, does the dankito right now, do I have oxygen inside my body?"
00:20:25,00:20:26,"-Yes. -So, here's the question."
00:20:26,00:20:29,"If it's that big an eater, and it's eating all these things,"
00:20:29,00:20:31,can you eat oxygen?
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Are you eating, is the dragonfly eating my oxygen"
00:20:34,00:20:36,as well as the food that brings in the oxygen?
00:20:36,00:20:41,"I think that you would utilize your oxygen relatively quickly, I think."
00:20:41,00:20:44,"And also, there wouldn't be much oxygen in you"
00:20:44,00:20:46,compared to the amount of your body.
00:20:46,00:20:49,-You know what I mean? You're not like a balloon. -I'm not a balloon.
00:20:49,00:20:51,-You're completely full of oxygen. -Yeah.
00:20:51,00:20:55,"You've got many dankito lungs, which have got a bit of oxygen in them."
00:20:55,00:20:58,"But that's not a terrible question, I have to say."
00:20:58,00:21:01,-Because they don't have... -Part of it was quite terrible.
00:21:01,00:21:03,I thought I think it's quite a good question.
00:21:03,00:21:05,"They don't have lungs, so they can't breathe it in."
00:21:05,00:21:07,"So, what are you going to do? You're going to eat it in."
00:21:07,00:21:08,-You're going to eat the oxygen. -What do you eat?
00:21:08,00:21:11,"You eat other things that breathe, and yeah, they don't have much oxygen in them,"
00:21:11,00:21:12,"but it's a bit, isn't it?"
00:21:12,00:21:16,"Also, the question is whether your stomach can dissolve the oxygen"
00:21:16,00:21:18,as well as your lungs or spiracles can.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"Yeah, yeah."
00:21:20,00:21:23,"I don't really understand the premise of Dan's question,"
00:21:23,00:21:26,but I've just got Dan as a mosquito in my head now.
00:21:26,00:21:30,"Quite irritating, aren't they, mosquitoes?"
00:21:30,00:21:32,"-Um, dragonflies? -Yeah."
00:21:32,00:21:35,"They're misnamed, I would say. They're not..."
00:21:35,00:21:37,-Dragons or flies? -Exactly.
00:21:37,00:21:39,And they don't spend most of their life flying.
00:21:39,00:21:45,"They spend years of their life as larvae living in water,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,"moving around, eating away, breathing through their bottoms."
00:21:47,00:21:50,"-That's the majority of their life. -Breathing through their bottoms, you say?"
00:21:50,00:21:52,"Yeah, they do."
00:21:52,00:21:56,"If they were to shove something up their bum, which had oxygen in it,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,-would they be able to... -Like Dan in Mosquito form.
00:21:58,00:22:00,"-Like the Dan Keto, yeah. -Put me up the bum."
00:22:00,00:22:03,"I don't think this reboot of ""Honey, I shrunk the kid"" is going to work, guys."
00:22:03,00:22:09,"Yeah, I find that amazing that so many animals live in eternal youth,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,and then there's a very brief adulthood.
00:22:11,00:22:14,How cool is that? Lucky buggers.
00:22:14,00:22:16,Why shouldn't you just bring a teenager forever?
00:22:16,00:22:18,"And then at the very end, you've got this crappy adulthood there."
00:22:18,00:22:20,"No, you don't want the teenager. You want to be a child forever."
00:22:20,00:22:22,"Yeah, okay, you're right, yeah."
00:22:22,00:22:24,"They have terrifying childhoods as well,"
00:22:24,00:22:27,"or terrifying for everything around them, because they're amazing hunters"
00:22:27,00:22:28,"as adults, but also in the water."
00:22:28,00:22:32,"So they have this extendable jaw called a labium,"
00:22:32,00:22:35,"and it looks like the thing in ""Alien"", the alien."
00:22:35,00:22:37,-Which... -Which...
00:22:37,00:22:43,"It's sort of... It's folded up, it's got this arm on a spring under its jaw,"
00:22:43,00:22:46,"and when it sees prey passing by, that jaw shoots out and grabs it."
00:22:46,00:22:50,"Some species have pincers, some don't, but it's all terrifying."
00:22:50,00:22:52,"-Really? -And they're amazing hunters, yeah."
00:22:52,00:22:56,"And the way that the arm comes out of their mouth is it's hydraulic, isn't it?"
00:22:56,00:22:59,"And they suck in water through their anus,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,and they use that water hydraulically to fire out the arm from their mouth.
00:23:02,00:23:05,"-Oh, cool. It's incredible. -Really? That's amazing."
00:23:05,00:23:08,"-It genuinely is, but... -Do we have any system like that on us?"
00:23:08,00:23:10,"-No, Dan. -We know that."
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Do you think that you could have got this far in life,"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"and then suddenly someone tells you,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"""Oh, Dan, by the way, no one's told you this so far,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"but if you suck water through your bum, I'll have to come back."""
00:23:19,00:23:24,"-I'm just... My ears can hub. That is new information to me. -Next time you're in the bath, Dan,"
00:23:24,00:23:28,just give it a go. Try and grab the soap from across the bathtub.
00:23:28,00:23:30,[laughter]
00:23:30,00:23:32,-But purposefully don't use my arms. -Yeah.
00:23:32,00:23:36,-Just suck through my anus. -Suck through your anus and see if it draws you down.
00:23:36,00:23:39,"But it's really weird, because, yeah, as James says, they blast it out,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,and they can use that...
00:23:40,00:23:44,"It sort of creates this massive pressure wave inside them, this water that they've sucked in,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"and then it generates a pound of pressure,"
00:23:46,00:23:50,"which is quite a lot for a tiny dragonfly nymph,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,but they can also use it another way.
00:23:51,00:23:53,"They can use it as an escape mechanism,"
00:23:53,00:23:58,"because they can unclench, blast the water out, and then jet themselves away through the water."
00:23:58,00:24:01,-So don't do that in the bath. [laughter]
00:24:01,00:24:04,-I'm going through the window into my neighbor's backyard.
00:24:04,00:24:07,-They've also got an amazing... This is when they're adults.
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Their ability to hunt food is pretty spectacular,"
00:24:11,00:24:16,so they've been put in laboratories and scientists have watched the sort of rate of catch
00:24:16,00:24:22,"against the prey that they're going for, and it's a 95% of the time they can catch what they're aiming to catch."
00:24:22,00:24:24,They're just absolute mega predators.
00:24:24,00:24:25,-This is one of those experiments.
00:24:25,00:24:30,"The way they looked at how they do this is one of those experiments where I think,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"""How did scientists manage it?"""
00:24:32,00:24:35,"So they made a backpack for them, and they strap it on,"
00:24:35,00:24:40,"but then they, in order to look at what's happening in their neurons when they're hunting"
00:24:40,00:24:41,"to find out how their brain is doing this,"
00:24:41,00:24:45,they connect wires to the equivalent of their spinal cord.
00:24:45,00:24:48,"And you read the articles, and it's just like they say this casually."
00:24:48,00:24:50,"-Yeah, it's insane. -How's someone doing that?"
00:24:50,00:24:53,"-Well, they've got Dan in the lab, in mosquito form."
00:24:53,00:24:56,"-Dan, Gito, to the rescue."
00:24:56,00:25:01,"Anyway, they discovered that they don't just react really quickly, they can predict where insects go."
00:25:01,00:25:04,"So they watch their neurons like firing, and they watch an insect trajectory,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,and they can see which direction it's going.
00:25:06,00:25:07,-It's really clever. -That's incredible.
00:25:07,00:25:11,"-Although, like this morning, I opened a cupboard in my house, and some sugar fell out."
00:25:11,00:25:13,"And without even thinking, I caught it."
00:25:13,00:25:14,-So... -Wow.
00:25:14,00:25:17,"-You're the dragonfly of this podcast, basically."
00:25:17,00:25:20,-Rather than the mosquito of this podcast. -I'm not.
00:25:20,00:25:23,"I mean, if anything, this means I get to hang out with Timothy C. Weingard,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"author of ""The Mosquito, A Human History of Our Dead Leaves,"""
00:25:26,00:25:29,but if I find out...
00:25:29,00:25:31,Wait till he hears about the Dan Kito.
00:25:31,00:25:36,Do you guys know what doesn't get enough airtime in all this chat about dragonflies?
00:25:36,00:25:38,"-Ooh, tell us. -No."
00:25:38,00:25:40,-Dams or flies? -Dams or flies?
00:25:40,00:25:42,-I've got a guess. -That was unsurprised.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"-Andy, we are on the same page here."
00:25:44,00:25:48,"I'm so glad you agree. They're basically dragonflies, but a bit smaller,"
00:25:48,00:25:50,and people don't know as much about them.
00:25:50,00:25:54,"So, the way you can tell the difference between a damsel and a dragon"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"is that damsel flies hold their wings back against their body,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,whereas dragonflies can't do that.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"And also, dragonflies have their two eyes kind of, like,"
00:26:01,00:26:03,"merged together at the front of their face,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,whereas damsel flies have them on either side.
00:26:06,00:26:10,"But damsel flies can climb underwater, even when they're adults,"
00:26:10,00:26:11,"which dragonflies can't, so..."
00:26:11,00:26:13,-Dragonflies lay their eggs. -How do you climb on your water?
00:26:13,00:26:17,"Well, good question. They climb backwards down a plant."
00:26:17,00:26:20,-Like getting into a swimming pool with the ladder? -It's exactly like that.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Yeah, certain damsel flies, they have to lay their eggs underwater."
00:26:22,00:26:24,It's usually inside plant matter.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"And they, like, you climb down a ladder of a pool,"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"climb backwards down the stem of a plant,"
00:26:28,00:26:31,"and they can be underwater for about half an hour,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,-and they turn their wings into... -Half an hour?
00:26:33,00:26:35,"-Yeah. -So, what's their oxygen intake like?"
00:26:35,00:26:38,Here we go again. Dankito to the rescue.
00:26:38,00:26:43,"You can't do it, Dan. I'm just gonna tell you now."
00:26:43,00:26:45,They turn their wings into a kind of snorkel.
00:26:45,00:26:48,"Dan, are you alright?"
00:26:48,00:26:50,I'm just trying to be a damsel fly.
00:26:50,00:26:56,"If you can work out how to trap an air bubble between your wings,"
00:26:56,00:26:57,and then use that to breathe half an hour.
00:26:57,00:26:59,"-Oh, wow. -You don't do that."
00:26:59,00:27:00,"God, that's so cool."
00:27:00,00:27:04,"That's a human thing that I think we should nail, trapping an air bubble."
00:27:04,00:27:05,"Well, we have scuba equipment."
00:27:05,00:27:08,"We do. Okay, that's solved."
00:27:08,00:27:11,Forget my hand bubble I wanted to invent.
00:27:12,00:27:15,"This massive, massive dragonfly,"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"the first one was discovered by a guy called Frank Carpenter,"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"who's in America, and he got into fossilized insects at the age of 14,"
00:27:23,00:27:25,"and he was really, really into them."
00:27:25,00:27:28,"Like, you know, wasn't into girls and football and stuff."
00:27:28,00:27:31,"He was just, ""All I want to do is look at fossilized insects."""
00:27:31,00:27:34,"-Nice. -But he was, like, in a little town in Oklahoma,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,and what's he gonna do?
00:27:35,00:27:40,"Well, luckily, the local neighborhood postman called Waldo Dodge"
00:27:40,00:27:43,"was also an amateur entomologist,"
00:27:43,00:27:46,and he'd noticed that this young kid was getting loads of books
00:27:46,00:27:49,"about fossilized insects sent to his house,"
00:27:49,00:27:52,"and he said, ""Mate, I can help you,"""
00:27:52,00:27:56,and he got him invited to the Cambridge Entomological Club nearby.
00:27:56,00:27:58,"-Whoa. -And then, eventually,"
00:27:58,00:28:01,"he became a Harvard professor of entomology,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"and in 1992, just after his 90th birthday,"
00:28:04,00:28:08,he published his classification of fossil insects.
00:28:08,00:28:10,-Wow. -That's a happy story.
00:28:10,00:28:13,Isn't it? Starting at 14 and knowing what you want to do
00:28:13,00:28:15,"with your life all the way till 90, it's..."
00:28:15,00:28:17,-That's really... -Be nice.
00:28:17,00:28:20,To have job satisfaction like that. Dream of it.
00:28:20,00:28:23,"When he got the big dragonfly in the first place,"
00:28:23,00:28:27,it was part of a hunting trip where he and a colleague
00:28:27,00:28:32,"in 10 weeks managed to collect more than 5,000 fossil insects."
00:28:32,00:28:34,-Wow. -Nice.
00:28:34,00:28:36,Wow. What's that? 500 a week.
00:28:36,00:28:40,"-So, that's about how many a day? -Let's say 80."
00:28:40,00:28:42,-Yeah. -Pretty good.
00:28:42,00:28:44,"-That's pretty damn good. -For waking hours, 16 hours."
00:28:44,00:28:46,-That's five an hour every hour. -They're gonna have breaks.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"Yeah, you're right. It's more like 20 an hour"
00:28:48,00:28:50,if you have a lunch break and maybe a little evening break
00:28:50,00:28:52,to talk about all the fossilized insects.
00:28:52,00:28:54,"""Where is this gold mine?"" They're looking for all their fossilized insects in."
00:28:54,00:28:56,-That's incredible. -I guess no one's looking for them.
00:28:56,00:28:58,-There must have been a big pile somewhere. -Exactly.
00:28:58,00:29:00,-And then they took the rest of the week off or something. -Yeah.
00:29:00,00:29:02,"I love that postman's name, Waldo Dodge."
00:29:02,00:29:04,I know. So good.
00:29:04,00:29:08,It's so much harder to find Waldo when he's got Dodge capacities.
00:29:08,00:29:12,I have a little sideline where I collect the names of people
00:29:12,00:29:15,"which double as short sentences, and Waldo Dodge is going on the list."
00:29:15,00:29:17,Very cool. Who else is on the list?
00:29:17,00:29:21,"Nancy Drew, who I know is a fictional character, but Wesley Snipes."
00:29:21,00:29:24,Cheryl Strayed is an author.
00:29:24,00:29:27,Are you counting Waldo Dodge as an imperative sentence?
00:29:27,00:29:30,That is a B-list I have created within my main list.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"If you put a comma after Waldo and an exclamation mark after Dodge,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,"-it works as an imperative. -Yeah, exactly."
00:29:35,00:29:38,The imperatives are a lower category.
00:29:38,00:29:40,-I agree. -Punctuation is allowed.
00:29:40,00:29:43,-They're not a proper sentence. -There's no main verb.
00:29:43,00:29:46,Randy's literally brought the list up on his phone.
00:29:46,00:29:50,"Rosa Parks, Jeremy Irons, Eric Pickles."
00:29:50,00:29:53,"You know, they're just Sean Combs."
00:29:53,00:29:56,"-No, he Cooms. -I pick Cooms, yeah."
00:29:56,00:29:59,"-Oh, is it? -Sean Combs is Hoorer."
00:29:59,00:30:02,"But then it could be an imperative. Puff, Daddy."
00:30:02,00:30:05,"There it goes, back on the list."
00:30:05,00:30:08,"Or Pee, did he?"
00:30:08,00:30:17,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:30:17,00:30:22,My fact this week is that Germany's parliament has 709 real politicians
00:30:22,00:30:25,and one fictional one.
00:30:25,00:30:28,-That's cool. -How do they tell the difference?
00:30:28,00:30:30,Satire.
00:30:30,00:30:32,Is that Satire?
00:30:32,00:30:35,-It's as close as I get. -What are we saying?
00:30:35,00:30:37,"They're all, it's like they're all fake."
00:30:37,00:30:39,"No, is Angela Merkel actually made up?"
00:30:39,00:30:43,"It's not Angela Merkel, so this is the story of Jakob Maria Mierscheid."
00:30:43,00:30:45,He is a father of four.
00:30:45,00:30:47,He's a widower. He trained as a tailor.
00:30:47,00:30:53,"He's an expert on columbopalumbus, which is a species of pigeon."
00:30:53,00:30:57,He's someone who tried to make it so that the official transcripts
00:30:57,00:31:01,of every final sentence from members' speech were banned from the record
00:31:01,00:31:04,"since they always ended in the exact same thing, and thus I conclude."
00:31:04,00:31:07,"And most notably of all, he is not real."
00:31:07,00:31:12,He's completely made up and he has been recognized by all the members of their parliament
00:31:12,00:31:17,"over 40 years now, and he is a person that was on the official website."
00:31:17,00:31:21,"He had his own profile. He has his own Twitter account, but he doesn't exist."
00:31:21,00:31:23,What's going on?
00:31:23,00:31:27,"He's a fictional composite member to replace a guy who was called Carlo Schmidt,"
00:31:27,00:31:29,"who was a founding father of Germany's constitution,"
00:31:29,00:31:34,"and the name came from one form and member of parliament and the date of birth from another,"
00:31:34,00:31:39,and they just created him as this character to be a part of this little town.
00:31:39,00:31:43,"Just a joke, right? Just a typical German gag. No particular reason."
00:31:43,00:31:44,Little gag.
00:31:44,00:31:45,They like Carlo Schmidt.
00:31:45,00:31:47,"But everyone seemed to just like him as a character,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,and so he gets mentioned occasionally in the actual parliament.
00:31:50,00:31:52,But does he ever swing a vote?
00:31:52,00:31:55,"The Bundestag's website has a description of Mierscheid,"
00:31:55,00:32:00,"and it says, ""I am neither an invention nor a patent. I am a solution."""
00:32:00,00:32:02,So he's denying it.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"He says, ""Like constitutional lawyer Friedrich Nagelman"
00:32:05,00:32:08,"and professional diplomat Edmund F. Dracker,"
00:32:08,00:32:12,"my colleagues in the judiciary and the executive with whom I enjoy working,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"I belong to the pillars of our state."""
00:32:14,00:32:19,"These two people, Friedrich Nagelman and Edmund F. Dracker, are also fictional."
00:32:19,00:32:23,"It's very weird, and there seems to be a German thing, these kind of in-jokes."
00:32:23,00:32:27,"There's that town in Germany called Bielefeld, which is sort of the opposite."
00:32:27,00:32:30,"It's got a population of 350,000 people, all real."
00:32:30,00:32:33,But there's a running joke that it doesn't exist.
00:32:33,00:32:35,And so all Germans know of it as not existing.
00:32:35,00:32:37,It's the 18th largest city in Germany.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"But even Angela Merkel last time she went there made a speech there,"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"and then the next day she went somewhere else and said,"
00:32:43,00:32:46,"""You know, I've just been to Bielefeld, or have I? Is it even real?"""
00:32:46,00:32:47,Who knows?
00:32:47,00:32:50,"And then if you say, ""Well, I've actually been to Bielefeld."""
00:32:50,00:32:53,"So I know it's there, they go, ""Oh, you're part of the conspiracy I use."""
00:32:53,00:32:54,Exactly.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"Yeah, the aliens are in your brain."
00:32:56,00:32:57,That's so funny.
00:32:57,00:33:01,"I did find out a place that is in Germany, and it's not fictional,"
00:33:01,00:33:07,but it existed as a weird quasi-real entity just after the end of the Second World War.
00:33:07,00:33:08,This is really bizarre.
00:33:08,00:33:10,It's a town called Schwarzenberg.
00:33:10,00:33:14,It's near the border with what was Czechoslovakia.
00:33:14,00:33:24,"And during the end of the war, both the Soviets and the American forces stopped outside,"
00:33:24,00:33:27,"which is really strange, because they had possibly miscommunicated about"
00:33:27,00:33:29,where everyone was going to stop their advance.
00:33:29,00:33:32,So it seems to have been the last independent bit of German territory
00:33:32,00:33:34,"that wasn't occupied by the Allied powers,"
00:33:34,00:33:36,and they sort of denazified.
00:33:36,00:33:39,The mayor had been an enthusiastic member of the party.
00:33:39,00:33:41,"They issued new stamps, new train schedules,"
00:33:41,00:33:46,and they imagined they were going to be a kind of Hong Kong territory.
00:33:46,00:33:48,Like independent from the rest of Germany.
00:33:48,00:33:51,"From the mainland, if you like, from mainland Germany."
00:33:51,00:33:55,"And then after seven weeks, the Soviets heard there were uranium deposits there and invaded."
00:33:55,00:33:57,But it was a brief dream.
00:33:57,00:33:59,You've got to hide those.
00:33:59,00:34:00,Why had they stopped on either side?
00:34:00,00:34:03,Is that like they couldn't agree who was going to come to meet who?
00:34:03,00:34:05,"Like you meet a friend, it's like you come to me."
00:34:05,00:34:06,"No, you come to me."
00:34:06,00:34:07,It is really weird.
00:34:07,00:34:10,"I think they both agreed they were going to stop at a certain river,"
00:34:10,00:34:11,where the river has a weird shape.
00:34:11,00:34:13,Or maybe the river has two bits.
00:34:13,00:34:14,Maybe the river bisects.
00:34:14,00:34:16,I don't know the exact geography of Schratzenberg.
00:34:16,00:34:18,"I'm sorry, I haven't done that yet."
00:34:18,00:34:20,But there was some miscommunication.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"Damn, that uranium."
00:34:22,00:34:25,"I found some other fake people, not necessarily German."
00:34:25,00:34:27,Walter Plinge.
00:34:27,00:34:29,Is that another one of your pervy names?
00:34:29,00:34:31,What is the verb to plinge?
00:34:31,00:34:34,It's like a small plunge.
00:34:34,00:34:39,That's what a damselflye does into the water.
00:34:39,00:34:44,"Walter Plinge is basically, we know the term Alan Smithy for movies,"
00:34:44,00:34:48,"where you would put that name down if you didn't want to be credited,"
00:34:48,00:34:49,because something had gone wrong.
00:34:49,00:34:52,"Walter Plinge is kind of similar territory,"
00:34:52,00:34:55,"in that he can be used as that for British theatre, in that case."
00:34:55,00:34:58,"But also, it's when a part hasn't been cast,"
00:34:58,00:35:00,it will be said to be played by Walter Plinge.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"Or if an actor is playing two roles in the theatre,"
00:35:03,00:35:07,"one will be Benedict Cumberbatch, the other Walter Plinge."
00:35:07,00:35:08,I don't know if he's done that.
00:35:08,00:35:10,"Well, he has done that, because he did Frankenstein."
00:35:10,00:35:12,"Except there was someone playing the other role, which was..."
00:35:12,00:35:13,Johnny Lee Miller.
00:35:13,00:35:14,Yes.
00:35:14,00:35:15,But they spot roles each night.
00:35:15,00:35:18,"So there was never a chance for Plinge to get in there, I see."
00:35:18,00:35:19,"If Johnny Lee Miller had been ill,"
00:35:19,00:35:23,"and Benedict Cumberbatch had to play both Frankenstein and the monster,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,that would have been a good chance to have Plinge.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"Plinge would have been right in there, yeah."
00:35:26,00:35:33,"There was a member of the J-pop band, AKB48, called Aguchi Aimi."
00:35:33,00:35:34,But she was completely fictitious.
00:35:34,00:35:37,"She was computer-generated, so they took bits from all of the members"
00:35:37,00:35:42,"of AKB48, because there's 48, or there used to be 48 members of them."
00:35:42,00:35:44,They took all the different bits and put them all together
00:35:44,00:35:45,to make this new member.
00:35:45,00:35:51,"And it turned out that she was a publicity stump for Glyco Ice No Me,"
00:35:51,00:35:53,which are grape-flavoured ice balls.
00:35:53,00:35:54,Grape-flavoured ice balls.
00:35:54,00:35:56,"They need all the publicity they can get, don't they?"
00:35:56,00:35:57,They sound good to me.
00:35:57,00:35:58,They sound good to me.
00:35:58,00:35:59,Grape-flavoured ice balls.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"Yeah, lovely."
00:36:00,00:36:01,Because if you...
00:36:01,00:36:03,"Like, any glass of water can become a glass of wine,"
00:36:03,00:36:06,if you just add some of this and let it melt.
00:36:06,00:36:07,No.
00:36:07,00:36:08,No?
00:36:08,00:36:09,What?
00:36:09,00:36:10,It's not wine ice balls.
00:36:10,00:36:11,Grapes made.
00:36:11,00:36:12,But it's grape juice.
00:36:12,00:36:13,But it's grapes made out of grapes.
00:36:13,00:36:14,"Yeah, but there's no..."
00:36:14,00:36:15,"They haven't fermented it, have they?"
00:36:15,00:36:16,There's a process.
00:36:16,00:36:18,"If you give me grape juice and say it's basically the same as wine,"
00:36:18,00:36:20,I am going to be pissed off by that.
00:36:20,00:36:21,Yeah.
00:36:21,00:36:27,Imagine if you ordered an AK47 and you accidentally got AKB48 turning up.
00:36:27,00:36:29,You'd be so disappointed.
00:36:29,00:36:34,That's a real mix-up in the Amazon warehouse.
00:36:34,00:36:37,I can't eat grapes because they're too cold for my teeth anyway.
00:36:37,00:36:38,Really?
00:36:38,00:36:40,So this would be a nightmare.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"Wait, you have to cut them open and then to lick them to warm them up."
00:36:44,00:36:47,"Anna, you're a pretty hard person in lots of ways."
00:36:47,00:36:49,That is the most pathetic thing I've ever heard.
00:36:49,00:36:51,I've got sense to teeth again.
00:36:51,00:36:54,"Wow, we found Anna's weakness after all these years."
00:36:54,00:36:55,That's it.
00:36:55,00:36:56,It's my cryptonite.
00:36:56,00:36:57,Grape-tonite.
00:36:57,00:36:58,Gosh.
00:36:58,00:37:00,Has anyone heard of Avril Lavigne?
00:37:00,00:37:02,"Oh, this feels like a trick question."
00:37:02,00:37:04,"Completely fake person, doesn't exist."
00:37:04,00:37:05,No.
00:37:05,00:37:06,"No, I'm joking."
00:37:06,00:37:07,Of course.
00:37:07,00:37:11,"I may not know who Leon Bridges is, but I do know who Avril Lavigne is."
00:37:11,00:37:12,But what's this?
00:37:12,00:37:17,She recorded a song called Dolphins that if you go on these websites which give you lyrics
00:37:17,00:37:20,"to music, they give you the lyrics to this song, Dolphins."
00:37:20,00:37:24,"The lyrics go, ""Dolphins live in the ocean, dolphins live in the sea."
00:37:24,00:37:26,"Dolphins live in nice, clear blue sea."
00:37:26,00:37:29,They are accompanied by lots of sea animals.
00:37:29,00:37:30,We love them.
00:37:30,00:37:31,You love them.
00:37:31,00:37:32,"Who doesn't like them?"""
00:37:32,00:37:35,"So, this is the amazing lyrics to Avril Lavigne's Dolphins."
00:37:35,00:37:37,"Turns out, doesn't exist."
00:37:37,00:37:43,"It's a completely made-up song that someone put into one of these lyrics websites, and"
00:37:43,00:37:46,all the other lyrics websites kind of took them on as well.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Right.
00:37:47,00:37:50,This was in an article for Fusion online magazine.
00:37:50,00:37:51,"It's really, really good."
00:37:51,00:37:53,I highly recommend you read it.
00:37:53,00:37:58,"Yeah, and there are two cover versions online of this song that doesn't exist."
00:37:58,00:38:02,"No music for it, so people have had to guess what the melody is."
00:38:02,00:38:05,"So, is it to expose these lyric websites for their copycatery?"
00:38:05,00:38:07,I genuinely think someone just did it for a laugh.
00:38:07,00:38:09,I don't think there's anything behind it.
00:38:09,00:38:12,Maybe to expose Avril Lavigne for her quite basic lyrics.
00:38:12,00:38:13,Excuse me.
00:38:13,00:38:15,I would say complicated.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"Well, okay."
00:38:16,00:38:21,You can't just name your song complicated and claim.
00:38:21,00:38:24,What can we do about the massive simplicity of these lyrics?
00:38:24,00:38:25,I don't know.
00:38:25,00:38:26,Call it complex?
00:38:26,00:38:29,"Wait, so do people think that she'd actually released it?"
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:38:30,00:38:31,Definitely.
00:38:31,00:38:32,Lots of people thought.
00:38:32,00:38:35,"Because if you go on the lyrics website, you search all of Avril Lavigne's songs, you"
00:38:35,00:38:36,see it.
00:38:36,00:38:40,Unless you've got every single record that Avril Lavigne's ever released like I do.
00:38:40,00:38:43,"You're not going to think, well, this is one I've never heard of."
00:38:43,00:38:44,Yeah.
00:38:44,00:38:46,Bragging there about your Lavigne discography.
00:38:46,00:38:47,Nice.
00:38:47,00:38:51,I don't normally go on lyrics websites and search for an artist and then look through
00:38:51,00:38:52,what they've got.
00:38:52,00:38:58,What I normally do is I type in big blue shoe lyric misheard and then that'll take me straight
00:38:58,00:38:59,there.
00:38:59,00:39:02,But it's annoying when the lyric websites copy each other.
00:39:02,00:39:03,I do grab you that.
00:39:03,00:39:04,It's really annoying.
00:39:04,00:39:08,"I like it when a lyric website is handcrafted by one person listening to a song, having"
00:39:08,00:39:09,a pun to the lyrics.
00:39:09,00:39:10,Is that a thing?
00:39:10,00:39:11,Yeah.
00:39:11,00:39:16,"Maybe I've just been believing them and singing the wrong lyrics to, you know, Dunbummy Love."
00:39:16,00:39:17,Which?
00:39:17,00:39:18,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:18,00:39:20,Dunbummy Love is what I thought that was for a long time.
00:39:20,00:39:21,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:21,00:39:22,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:22,00:39:23,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:23,00:39:24,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:24,00:39:25,Dunbummy Love.
00:39:25,00:39:26,That's a very different song.
00:39:26,00:39:27,That's a very different song.
00:39:27,00:39:28,Wow.
00:39:28,00:39:29,Okay.
00:39:29,00:39:37,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:39:37,00:39:38,That is Andy.
00:39:38,00:39:43,"My fact is that before it was somewhere to go to powder your nose, a powder room was a"
00:39:43,00:39:47,room where you stuck your head through the wall to get your wig powdered.
00:39:47,00:39:48,Okay.
00:39:48,00:39:53,So is there a hole for you to put your head in or do you have to smash your head through
00:39:53,00:39:54,the wall?
00:39:54,00:39:55,That's what I'm currently thinking.
00:39:55,00:40:00,"In classy establishments, the hole is pre-provided for you and you just pop your head through."
00:40:00,00:40:04,"So there aren't many of these places around, obviously, because no one wears the big grey"
00:40:04,00:40:07,"wigs anymore, except lawyers, I guess, if you bearish to still wear them."
00:40:07,00:40:11,But there are a few places left historical buildings where they survive.
00:40:11,00:40:15,Southside House is a manor house in Wimbledon in south-west London.
00:40:15,00:40:17,And it's got a lot of beautiful historical features.
00:40:17,00:40:22,"And one of them is this weird cupboard-y room, which has a hole in the wall, and you would"
00:40:22,00:40:26,stick your head through the wall and a servant in there would powder the wig for you.
00:40:26,00:40:27,Right.
00:40:27,00:40:28,And while you wait.
00:40:28,00:40:29,I couldn't work out.
00:40:29,00:40:32,"Is the servant, which I think was a young boy usually, do they live there the whole"
00:40:32,00:40:33,time?
00:40:33,00:40:34,I couldn't work that out.
00:40:34,00:40:35,I don't.
00:40:35,00:40:36,I'm sure.
00:40:36,00:40:37,"It must be there, right?"
00:40:37,00:40:38,It depends.
00:40:38,00:40:41,"Maybe if there's a regular wig powdering time, or if you're having a party."
00:40:41,00:40:42,"Must be parties, right?"
00:40:42,00:40:43,Party.
00:40:43,00:40:44,If you want to quickly get your wig repowed.
00:40:44,00:40:45,Yeah.
00:40:45,00:40:47,So how does it have to be a separate room?
00:40:47,00:40:49,Are the wig wearers pretending it's like magic?
00:40:49,00:40:50,No.
00:40:50,00:40:51,You just put your head in.
00:40:51,00:40:53,"I mean, why do they need to be locking themselves in this cupboard?"
00:40:53,00:40:58,"Have you read the process about how much powder goes into, like the collateral powder of powder"
00:40:58,00:40:59,in your wig?
00:40:59,00:41:00,It goes everywhere.
00:41:00,00:41:01,It's an extraordinary.
00:41:01,00:41:04,"I mean, the opposite version of that is they used to have rooms."
00:41:04,00:41:08,"They found this in one case where you would sit inside in a barber's chair, basically,"
00:41:08,00:41:12,"and through the hole in the wall would be your powderer, effectively your hairdresser,"
00:41:12,00:41:18,"in a different room, applying the powder just through the hole and just smashing your face"
00:41:18,00:41:19,with it.
00:41:19,00:41:23,"And in order to not get it all over your clothes or all over your face, you would wear gowns"
00:41:23,00:41:28,"like you would in a salon, and you would wear a weird cone over your face to stop the powder"
00:41:28,00:41:29,from...
00:41:29,00:41:30,"Yeah, powder cone."
00:41:30,00:41:31,"Yeah, exactly."
00:41:31,00:41:33,"Which makes you look like a really terrifying medieval doctor, doesn't it?"
00:41:33,00:41:34,"Yeah, the plague mask."
00:41:34,00:41:35,The plague mask.
00:41:35,00:41:36,Yeah.
00:41:36,00:41:37,They're very strange.
00:41:37,00:41:40,But presumably the poor servant in the cupboard is absolutely covered.
00:41:40,00:41:42,He's choking on powder by the end of the day.
00:41:42,00:41:43,"You'd guess so, yeah."
00:41:43,00:41:46,"The Peruc powder page, which is what they were called."
00:41:46,00:41:47,Really?
00:41:47,00:41:48,Cripple pea.
00:41:48,00:41:50,"Peruc, old name for a wig."
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Kind of interesting, actually."
00:41:51,00:41:58,"Like, the word ""Peruc"" meant a wig by the 1560s, but in the 1540s it meant a natural"
00:41:58,00:42:00,head of hair.
00:42:00,00:42:02,So in 20 years that changed.
00:42:02,00:42:06,"And that word came from the Italian word ""Peruca,"" which means wig."
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:10,But the wigs were made of real heads of hair.
00:42:10,00:42:15,"Because there were people selling their hair, but also it was standard in much of society."
00:42:15,00:42:20,"Not just high society, in lots of society, for men to be wearing these big wigs."
00:42:20,00:42:21,Hmm.
00:42:21,00:42:23,"Not just the big wigs, rather."
00:42:23,00:42:25,"No, exactly."
00:42:25,00:42:27,"Medium-sized wig, men."
00:42:27,00:42:28,More big wigs.
00:42:28,00:42:34,"But yeah, human hair being sold for wigs was big business throughout this time."
00:42:34,00:42:38,And I was reading an account in 1840 written by a British writer.
00:42:38,00:42:41,And this was when wig-wearing had really gone out of fashion in most places.
00:42:41,00:42:43,But there were parts of France where it was still quite fashionable.
00:42:43,00:42:48,So this British writer went to Brittany and it was like the most extraordinary thing about
00:42:48,00:42:51,being in France is the peasant hair auctions.
00:42:51,00:42:57,And what would happen is you'd have a marketplace in the middle of a town or a village and there'd
00:42:57,00:43:00,be a whole queue of girls wanting to sell their hair.
00:43:00,00:43:05,"And the young girls would mount in turn, mount this platform in the middle, and people would"
00:43:05,00:43:06,shout out bits.
00:43:06,00:43:07,Oh my goodness.
00:43:07,00:43:08,Wow.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"And the girl is shorn on the spot, apparently."
00:43:10,00:43:11,Like a sheep.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Like a sheep.
00:43:12,00:43:16,"How much would the hair go for, as in, would it be more affordable for you to shave your"
00:43:16,00:43:20,"head, sell your hair, and then use that money to buy a wig?"
00:43:20,00:43:21,With the selling of the hair.
00:43:21,00:43:22,Someone's taking money there.
00:43:22,00:43:23,There's a middle man.
00:43:23,00:43:24,Yeah.
00:43:24,00:43:25,Which is what you don't want in business.
00:43:25,00:43:30,But if the amount that your hair sells for greatly is outnumbered is the amount you buy
00:43:30,00:43:31,a wig for.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"I mean, if that's possible, the Nobel Prize in Economics is going to you."
00:43:34,00:43:37,It's a way of making money from nowhere.
00:43:37,00:43:38,"Well, look at these auctions."
00:43:38,00:43:39,"I mean, you know, they could go up and up."
00:43:39,00:43:40,No.
00:43:40,00:43:43,It doesn't work economically unless you had much better quality hair than the wig you
00:43:43,00:43:44,wanted to buy.
00:43:44,00:43:45,Exactly.
00:43:45,00:43:47,You could sell your good hair and buy some shitty hair and you would make money that
00:43:47,00:43:48,way.
00:43:48,00:43:52,But what you're proposing is the wig equivalent of a perpetual motion machine.
00:43:52,00:43:57,"It was partly expensive because it was hard to harvest, so it's not like a crop which"
00:43:57,00:44:02,grows really fast and you can cut it down every year for hair to grow to the ideal length.
00:44:02,00:44:05,"You sort of need two to four years growth, depending on how much you want."
00:44:05,00:44:09,And so people would offer women advanced payments because you've got to make sure you get that
00:44:09,00:44:11,head of hair in four years' time when it's lush.
00:44:11,00:44:15,So you'd pay in advance and say in four years I'll be back to chop that off.
00:44:15,00:44:18,"But you'd have to keep an eye on your investment the whole time, right, to make sure that there's"
00:44:18,00:44:19,not anything.
00:44:19,00:44:23,"I would sell my hair to multiple different people, take all the down payments and then"
00:44:23,00:44:24,scarpa.
00:44:24,00:44:25,And that would be my fraud.
00:44:25,00:44:26,Yeah.
00:44:26,00:44:30,"And the good thing is if you shaved your head, no one would recognize you."
00:44:30,00:44:34,"The Romans used to get hair from peasants, didn't they?"
00:44:34,00:44:35,Oh.
00:44:35,00:44:39,They vogue the blonde hair in Roman times and they went to the conquered sort of Germanic
00:44:39,00:44:43,tribes and people even further north than that and they would take the blonde hair from
00:44:43,00:44:48,"there and then the expensive wigs would be made from them, yeah."
00:44:48,00:44:52,"And in the 16th century in Italy, blonde hair was really popular but it was very hard to"
00:44:52,00:44:54,get hold of blonde wigs.
00:44:54,00:44:58,"So what women would do is they would sit on the top of buildings in huge hats, they were"
00:44:58,00:45:00,called Salanas.
00:45:00,00:45:02,So there was a massive brim but there was no top of the hat.
00:45:02,00:45:05,"No, the sun could bleach their hair."
00:45:05,00:45:06,Oh.
00:45:06,00:45:07,Isn't that interesting.
00:45:07,00:45:09,Why did they have the massive hat?
00:45:09,00:45:11,To stop you from getting tanned skin.
00:45:11,00:45:15,"But also you can lay out, if you've got long hair, you'd lay it out across the brim, can't"
00:45:15,00:45:16,you?
00:45:16,00:45:17,Yes.
00:45:17,00:45:18,So you're bleaching all your hair at the same time.
00:45:18,00:45:19,Yeah.
00:45:19,00:45:20,The suntan thing as well might have been quite interesting.
00:45:20,00:45:22,"Well, for a suntan you don't need a massive hat."
00:45:22,00:45:24,You just need a hat that's got a brim but massive.
00:45:24,00:45:27,I'm picturing sort of an umbrella sized.
00:45:27,00:45:28,Yeah.
00:45:28,00:45:29,I like Andy's theory.
00:45:29,00:45:33,They used to be made of metal in the - Metal wigs.
00:45:33,00:45:34,The wig era.
00:45:34,00:45:35,"Yeah, weird, right?"
00:45:35,00:45:39,"Sort of long strands of tin or steel, I think."
00:45:39,00:45:44,"Not many but it wasn't a big fashion but there are accounts, aren't there, of iron wigs?"
00:45:44,00:45:47,"Yes, iron wigs, yeah."
00:45:47,00:45:49,Edward Waterley Montague was an author and traveller.
00:45:49,00:45:54,"He had an iron wig and there was an advertiser who said it could withstand rain, wind and"
00:45:54,00:45:58,hail and all without causing discomfort to the wearer which feels like a bit of a stretch
00:45:58,00:45:59,because...
00:45:59,00:46:01,"The practical wig, though."
00:46:01,00:46:02,"And then they went out of fashion, didn't they?"
00:46:02,00:46:03,For various reasons.
00:46:03,00:46:05,"One, there was a wig tax."
00:46:05,00:46:06,Wig powder tax even.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"Sorry, that's what I mean."
00:46:07,00:46:08,Yeah.
00:46:08,00:46:09,Yeah.
00:46:09,00:46:10,"It was pit the younger, wasn't it?"
00:46:10,00:46:11,Yeah.
00:46:11,00:46:12,"And there was a licensing system, like a TV license."
00:46:12,00:46:16,"I tell you what, if Pit was a bit older he wouldn't bother about wigs so much."
00:46:16,00:46:21,It's alright for those young people to say no one should have wigs.
00:46:21,00:46:24,"But it was roughly the cost of a modern TV license, I think."
00:46:24,00:46:25,Right.
00:46:25,00:46:27,"And then a year, which I had read..."
00:46:27,00:46:28,A lot of TV licenses.
00:46:28,00:46:31,"Well, about 150 quid in modern money."
00:46:31,00:46:34,"And so, I mean, there are obviously different ways of calculating it, but yeah, that's roughly"
00:46:34,00:46:35,it.
00:46:35,00:46:38,"Well, the hope was that they were going to sort of use that money to fight Napoleon."
00:46:38,00:46:39,Yeah.
00:46:39,00:46:40,It was crazy.
00:46:40,00:46:41,It worked.
00:46:41,00:46:42,"Did it, did they?"
00:46:42,00:46:43,"Yeah, it made a lot of money."
00:46:43,00:46:46,Because I thought people just stopped doing it as a result.
00:46:46,00:46:49,"In the first year it raised £200,000, which was a lot."
00:46:49,00:46:54,"But then by 1869 it was only raising £1,000 a year as wigs had gone out."
00:46:54,00:46:58,And then you were exempt if you were royal or if you were a clergyman on less than £100
00:46:58,00:46:59,a year.
00:46:59,00:47:00,There were various exemptions and...
00:47:00,00:47:04,"Yeah, the royals need the help, don't they, poor guys?"
00:47:04,00:47:08,"And also it allowed them to create a funny nickname, guinea pigs, because pigtails were"
00:47:08,00:47:09,all the rage.
00:47:09,00:47:12,Men used to wear them and it cost a guinea for the wig tax.
00:47:12,00:47:13,"I mean, it's perfect."
00:47:13,00:47:16,So was that the origin of guinea pigs in terms of...
00:47:16,00:47:17,The animal?
00:47:17,00:47:18,"No, not the animal."
00:47:18,00:47:21,"Just in terms of that phrase, or is that a completely separate phase?"
00:47:21,00:47:22,No.
00:47:22,00:47:23,"Wait, what do you mean in terms of that phrase?"
00:47:23,00:47:25,It's the phrase to describe someone being like a lab rat.
00:47:25,00:47:28,That came from the fact that people experimented on guinea pigs.
00:47:28,00:47:29,"Okay, yeah."
00:47:29,00:47:32,But were people already experimenting on guinea pigs?
00:47:32,00:47:36,"Guys, where do you think that meaning of guinea pig would have come from the people who paid"
00:47:36,00:47:37,a wig tax?
00:47:37,00:47:41,"Because they were the first people with the guinea pigs, they were testing the tax on"
00:47:41,00:47:42,them.
00:47:42,00:47:43,It was human guinea pig.
00:47:43,00:47:45,"No, no, it's from people testing drugs on guinea pigs."
00:47:45,00:47:48,"Dan, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with you on this."
00:47:48,00:47:49,I'm not saying I'm with me.
00:47:49,00:47:53,"I was just asking whether or not it was the worst place to be is with Dan, but he's not"
00:47:53,00:47:54,on board.
00:47:54,00:47:55,I'm not with myself.
00:47:55,00:47:59,There's about a dozen early Nobel Prizes that were won by experiments on guinea pigs
00:47:59,00:48:00,specifically.
00:48:00,00:48:01,"Right, okay."
00:48:01,00:48:02,But this phrase is from the...
00:48:02,00:48:03,"Yeah, but that's not what it meant, though."
00:48:03,00:48:04,"Right, sorry, yeah."
00:48:04,00:48:05,Here's the question.
00:48:05,00:48:07,Where does pigs come in into your phrase of guinea pigs?
00:48:07,00:48:08,Pig tails.
00:48:08,00:48:09,People call them pig tails.
00:48:09,00:48:10,Great.
00:48:10,00:48:11,"Are you back on board with yourself, Dan?"
00:48:11,00:48:12,"No, I'm just learning."
00:48:12,00:48:13,I'm just learning.
00:48:13,00:48:16,"What we're not 100% sure of, and maybe we should go back and check the sources, is that"
00:48:16,00:48:19,in all those early 20th century medical sources when they were referred to testing on guinea
00:48:19,00:48:25,"pigs, maybe they actually were testing on these overprivileged wig-wearing tops."
00:48:25,00:48:26,I haven't checked.
00:48:26,00:48:30,"All I'm saying is, was it a phrase that evolved and evolved to a new meaning, kind of like"
00:48:30,00:48:32,"the wig, but turns out it's not."
00:48:32,00:48:34,"So Andy, you're wrong."
00:48:34,00:48:36,"Wow, this is a sick bird."
00:48:36,00:48:39,"You're alone on the ship that Dan's built, then judge."
00:48:39,00:48:40,No!
00:48:40,00:48:43,But they went out of fashion.
00:48:43,00:48:44,We know that by about the 1820s.
00:48:44,00:48:47,"But these weird little holdouts happened, didn't they, across society."
00:48:47,00:48:51,So coachmen kept going until the 1820s.
00:48:51,00:48:53,Bishops stopped in 1832 by royal permission.
00:48:53,00:48:55,"They said, ""We don't want to wear these anymore."""
00:48:55,00:48:59,"Cool people who live in the Hackney today, for instance, like myself, were always wearing"
00:48:59,00:49:00,periwigs.
00:49:00,00:49:01,Right.
00:49:01,00:49:04,"Well, it's you guys and barristers, James, because--"
00:49:04,00:49:06,Barristers and barristers.
00:49:06,00:49:08,"Very, very strong, nice."
00:49:08,00:49:14,"But from the mid-1840s onwards, it sort of had a resurgence in court, and in court you"
00:49:14,00:49:17,were technically invisible unless you were wearing a wig.
00:49:17,00:49:19,I don't mean technically invisible.
00:49:19,00:49:22,"You would be, in quotes, not seen or heard."
00:49:22,00:49:23,The judge would not recognize you.
00:49:23,00:49:24,Wow.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"So it's a way of being invisible, basically."
00:49:26,00:49:27,"Oh, I don't know."
00:49:27,00:49:28,Where is Lord Plinge?
00:49:28,00:49:29,I can't see him anywhere.
00:49:29,00:49:30,Is it like that?
00:49:30,00:49:31,Basically that.
00:49:31,00:49:32,Amazing.
00:49:32,00:49:33,"He's going, ""Objection!"
00:49:33,00:49:34,"Objection!"""
00:49:34,00:49:35,But he's not going his way on.
00:49:35,00:49:39,"Some barristers still wear wigs today, and I read a great piece in the legal magazine"
00:49:39,00:49:45,"called ""Council,"" which is a great magazine, and I recommend you all order, order it."
00:49:45,00:49:50,"God, I just-- this is brilliant."
00:49:50,00:49:54,"But I just-- I'm remembering the thing about the Sellafield magazine a few weeks ago, and"
00:49:54,00:49:59,"I think this could be Addy's magazine, Carter, for me, I think."
00:49:59,00:50:00,100%.
00:50:00,00:50:04,"Sellafield magazine suddenly sounds like an agricultural kind of auction mag, doesn't"
00:50:04,00:50:05,it?
00:50:05,00:50:08,"Oh, God, another huge AK-47, AKB-48 thing."
00:50:08,00:50:13,"Oh, I'm just trying to sell a field, but you've delivered uranium to me."
00:50:13,00:50:16,Now the Soviets are coming.
00:50:16,00:50:18,Put it with the unwanted gun in your pantry.
00:50:18,00:50:24,"Oh, look, anyway, Council magazine wrote all about how wigs were nearly got rid of"
00:50:24,00:50:25,"in court, right?"
00:50:25,00:50:30,"So in 1940s, Parliament debated this clause, which was going to ban wigs and gowns in court."
00:50:30,00:50:34,"It said, ""This is ridiculous,"" so they went out 100 years ago in the rest of society,"
00:50:34,00:50:39,"and it prompted this huge backlash, and lots of MPs, who are obviously very traditionalist"
00:50:39,00:50:41,"as well, objected."
00:50:41,00:50:46,One MP asked whether the clause would also deprive admirals of their three-cornered hats
00:50:46,00:50:50,or deprive generals of their epaulettes or clergymen of their distinctive attire.
00:50:50,00:50:53,"He said nothing about nurses, the person who had proposed this clause."
00:50:53,00:50:57,"He said nothing about nurses, although I think we all agree that they look very pretty in"
00:50:57,00:50:58,their distinctive attire.
00:50:58,00:50:59,"Oh, my God."
00:50:59,00:51:00,I know.
00:51:00,00:51:01,That has a common stuff.
00:51:01,00:51:02,Jesus Christ.
00:51:02,00:51:03,Wow.
00:51:03,00:51:08,"But there was a fear that judges would not look majestic if they took their wigs off,"
00:51:08,00:51:12,"and that if a judge was seen in his wig, he was embodying the law and very powerful."
00:51:12,00:51:15,"But if seen with that one, he might look like a wizened-up gargoyle."
00:51:15,00:51:16,"So, problem."
00:51:16,00:51:22,That's really rough on judges.
00:51:22,00:51:26,Wigs are a big role in the civil rights movement in America.
00:51:26,00:51:32,"That is because during desegregation in the '60s, there are a lot of jobs where they kind"
00:51:32,00:51:36,"of banned African-American hairstyles, and they kind of said you had to comply with"
00:51:36,00:51:38,a certain hairstyle.
00:51:38,00:51:41,And so a lot of people had to wear wigs to kind of cover that up.
00:51:41,00:51:46,"But then there were activists such as Marcus Garvey who said, ""Look, this is ridiculous."
00:51:46,00:51:47,We can't be doing this.
00:51:47,00:51:52,"One, we need to stop people discriminating against hairstyles, but two, we need to kind"
00:51:52,00:51:55,"of reclaim our hairstyle and kind of be proud of it."""
00:51:55,00:51:57,"And he said, ""Don't remove the kinks from your hair."
00:51:57,00:51:59,"Remove them from your brain."""
00:51:59,00:52:04,"And then in the 1970s, there was kind of a resurgence of people reclaiming the African-American"
00:52:04,00:52:06,hairstyle.
00:52:06,00:52:12,"And then all the way to the present day in 2019, New York became the second state to"
00:52:12,00:52:14,ban discrimination on the hairstyles.
00:52:14,00:52:19,"So in California and New York right now, you're not allowed to discriminate on anyone due"
00:52:19,00:52:22,"to their hairstyle, and that is going back to the civil rights movement and all that"
00:52:22,00:52:23,stuff.
00:52:23,00:52:24,Right.
00:52:24,00:52:26,I didn't know we were allowed to do that before.
00:52:26,00:52:27,"You would think so, wouldn't you?"
00:52:27,00:52:28,"No, wouldn't you?"
00:52:28,00:52:32,"You would piss out people with pigtails left, right, and centre."
00:52:32,00:52:33,Do you guys know about the Wig Club?
00:52:33,00:52:34,No.
00:52:34,00:52:35,No.
00:52:35,00:52:40,"It was founded in 1775 in Edinburgh, and there was a really cool investigation into it by"
00:52:40,00:52:44,"an author called David Stevenson, and it was a gentleman's sex club."
00:52:44,00:52:47,"And I mean, no, I haven't heard of it now, and I don't know."
00:52:47,00:52:48,Yeah.
00:52:48,00:52:49,"It was a good test, and well done."
00:52:49,00:52:50,You all passed.
00:52:50,00:52:55,"It was named after a wig that they had as their kind of relic, their club relic that"
00:52:55,00:52:59,was made from the pubic hair of Charles II's mistresses that had apparently been worn
00:52:59,00:53:01,by Charles II.
00:53:01,00:53:06,"And when you joined the Wig Club as part of your initiation, you had to provide locks"
00:53:06,00:53:12,of pubic hair suitably harvested to be added to the wig as proof of having triumph sexually.
00:53:12,00:53:16,"So you had to, after triumphing sexually, I guess, say to the woman, ""Sorry, do you"
00:53:16,00:53:21,"mind if I snip off a curl of your pubic hair because I'm hoping to join a sex club?"""
00:53:21,00:53:26,"To definitely do that afterwards, I would say."
00:53:26,00:53:31,"And yeah, they just met and talked about how much sex they were having and drank a lot."
00:53:31,00:53:33,These guys sound great.
00:53:33,00:53:34,Yeah.
00:53:34,00:53:36,So no actual sex happened at the Wig Club.
00:53:36,00:53:43,"It was just a bunch of virgins getting together, bringing cut locks from their dogs."
00:53:43,00:53:44,Exactly.
00:53:44,00:53:46,"Yeah, I just shagged hard last night, man."
00:53:46,00:53:47,Is that what it was?
00:53:47,00:53:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:53:48,00:53:49,It's a really cool club to be a member of.
00:53:49,00:53:50,Yeah.
00:53:50,00:53:51,I would have applied.
00:53:51,00:53:53,I'm not going to lie.
00:53:53,00:53:58,Some wigs were made of duck's tail feathers.
00:53:58,00:54:03,"Wigs specifically for Parsons and Vickers, because it was to fight off the wet, because"
00:54:03,00:54:04,obviously water off a duck's back.
00:54:04,00:54:05,"Oh, clever."
00:54:05,00:54:09,"They literally had a duck's ass at the front of their head, looking so stupid."
00:54:09,00:54:10,That'd be amazing.
00:54:10,00:54:11,Yeah.
00:54:11,00:54:12,"It is quite clever though, isn't it?"
00:54:12,00:54:13,Yeah.
00:54:13,00:54:17,What animals hair would you have as a wig if you could have any?
00:54:17,00:54:20,Peacock and just let it go.
00:54:20,00:54:21,Yeah.
00:54:21,00:54:22,For long peacocks.
00:54:22,00:54:23,That's a good idea.
00:54:23,00:54:25,Is it a peacock's tail that you've got?
00:54:25,00:54:26,No.
00:54:26,00:54:27,I've missed that bit.
00:54:27,00:54:34,"Oh, you just want the ordinary cleavage, but okay, okay."
00:54:34,00:54:35,That's cool.
00:54:35,00:54:36,Would that be whenever you clench your teeth?
00:54:36,00:54:37,It fans out.
00:54:37,00:54:38,Whenever you tense your head.
00:54:38,00:54:39,"Yeah, so that's a good idea."
00:54:39,00:54:43,"I would have thought like you'd come in from the cold, take your hat off, and it kind of"
00:54:43,00:54:44,comes out.
00:54:44,00:54:45,Yes.
00:54:45,00:54:46,"Yes, it fans."
00:54:46,00:54:47,Jack in a box.
00:54:47,00:54:48,Yeah.
00:54:48,00:54:49,I'd probably get an orangutan.
00:54:49,00:54:50,"Oh, yeah."
00:54:50,00:54:51,Orangutan.
00:54:51,00:54:52,"They do, don't they?"
00:54:52,00:54:53,Yeah.
00:54:53,00:54:54,Always wanted to be a ginger.
00:54:54,00:54:55,Don't know.
00:54:55,00:54:56,Very wiry orangutan hair.
00:54:56,00:54:57,It looks wiry.
00:54:57,00:54:58,How do you know?
00:54:58,00:54:59,It looks wiry.
00:54:59,00:55:00,From a distance.
00:55:00,00:55:01,It's got a pubic quality about it.
00:55:01,00:55:04,You could bring it to your wig party.
00:55:04,00:55:07,"I was just thinking yak, just because it's so long and luscious."
00:55:07,00:55:08,Lovely.
00:55:08,00:55:09,Yeah.
00:55:09,00:55:10,And wise.
00:55:10,00:55:11,Wise.
00:55:11,00:55:12,Just the yak.
00:55:12,00:55:13,Wise like a yak.
00:55:13,00:55:14,Not saying.
