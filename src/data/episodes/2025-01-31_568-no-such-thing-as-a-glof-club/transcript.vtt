 [Music]

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.280
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish!

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.400
 Well, what do we have for you today?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
 Well, it is the last of our little compilations!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 We put together all of the bits from the Australia and New Zealand parts of our tour.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 Things that couldn't quite fit into the show.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.240
 Things where things went a little bit wrong.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.680
 Things where some naughty people in the audience might have shouted things out.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.560
 And I put them all in this little compilation, which I really, really hope you enjoy.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.960
 I should just say that there will be one or two unfamiliar voices in this show.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.320
 Well, not that unfamiliar really, because if you've listened to the last couple of episodes,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.040
 you will know them.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.320
 But Josh Thompson and Leon Buttons Kirkbeck, who both came in and saved the day when Andrew

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.360
 Hunter Murray unexpectedly had to go home for personal reasons.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.880
 They are both in these compilations at various points.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.600
 So don't be surprised when you hear their voices.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 If you have been missing the compilations, we used to put them out quite often, but

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.760
 they don't come here anymore.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.480
 They go on our Club Fish channel.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 And if you want to get those and all sorts of extra material that we do,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.000
 then go to notionsthingsoffish.com/apple or notionsthingsoffish.com/patreon.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 And you'll find all the information of how to get all that extra stuff there.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.160
 Anyway, really hope you enjoy this show.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.800
 We will be back with an office episode.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 For those of you who listen to this show to try and get to sleep and get quite annoyed

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.880
 when we do live ones because they're too loud.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 Don't worry, we're back in the office next week.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.720
 So really hope you will enjoy those.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.320
 But in the meantime, sit back, relax, enjoy our compilation special on With The Podcast.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.880
 Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.320
 a popular conspiracy theory was that German blackmailers had drawn up a list

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
 of 47,000 highly placed English perverts.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.400
 I spoke...

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.600
 What? What was...

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.800
 What's so funny about that?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 It's just a funny photo.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.760
 [Laughter]

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.400
 Sorry about that.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 Well, I don't know what happened there, but I'm sure you're going to the Tower of London.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.240
 I think I'm in serious shit, actually, for what I just did, yeah.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.080
 So this started back in 1965, and there was a journalist...

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.120
 Sorry?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.000
 Did it, though?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.320
 Come on, I get enough shit from these three.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.120
 I don't need fucking Melbourne doing this.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.800
 If we do that after every dubious thing Dan says, it's going to be a long night.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.080
 It's your own time you're wasting.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.960
 It's like the weirdest Panto edition.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.520
 Did it, though?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 He's behind you. Is he, though?

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:13.760
 You can simulate ants fighting by using other video games.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.880
 So there's a video game called Age of Empire, where you get your army

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.800
 and you fight against another army, right?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.280
 And you have a certain... You might have 10,000 of your crew...

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.640
 It's so much more complicated than that.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.800
 There's a lot of strategy that goes into... Sorry.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.960
 I just... It's a civilisation game. It's not a war game.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.600
 All right, go on.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.400
 I was going to say I didn't realise I was sat next to an expert, but...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 You should have guessed.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.200
 I should have guessed, yeah.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
 So let's say, for instance, you're in Australia.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.120
 You've got some Argentinian ants there and you don't want them there.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.200
 You want good old Australian ants in your Australian thing.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.520
 But the only way you're going to get rid of the Argentinian ones

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.000
 is to get a load of Australian ants to attack them.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640
 And the Australian ones are weedy and useless.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.200
 And the Argentinian ones are strong, right?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 So you need to know how many you're going to need.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.120
 And you can use Age of Empire by giving them all different attributes

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.560
 and firing them at each other.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.760
 And that gives you a really good simulation of how that will work in real life.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 Yeah, and they do this all the time.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.920
 Did they plan it? Did they build the game around ants?

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.920
 Is it so like ants because it's based on ant warfare?

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.960
 I only know this video game from seeing adverts on my Facebook.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.840
 But I think it's like...

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.280
 It's like you've got loads and loads of your little characters

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.200
 and they're all fighting the other characters, right?

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.720
 But if you can make your...

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.040
 You can imagine that your characters are slightly weaker,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.160
 but you've got twice as many.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.720
 You can see how many you're going to need to attack them.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.800
 Okay, so ants make those calculations as well

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.040
 and work out how strong the opponent is.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.080
 I'm not sure ants do,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 but the people who are putting ants into this situation...

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880
 Battle Royale.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.280
 I feel like I've either really jet lagged

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.640
 and not explained this very well,

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.280
 or possibly asleep and dreaming that I'm not doing this very well.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.520
 You're just talking to me who's never played a video game.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.440
 Since actually playing the game Ants Age 10,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.480
 which is fucking fantastic.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.920
 And you should have used the analogy.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.640
 No, I'm thinking of worms.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.040
 Sorry.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.800
 Unbelievable.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.640
 What a guy.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.520
 What a guy.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.480
 Record.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.440
 He was like a lot of those kind of mathsy people.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.120
 He was in charge of the mint in England.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.240
 The money thing, not the edible...

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.720
 The flavor.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.120
 Absolutely.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.360
 And then he was accused of siphoning money

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.200
 off the profits made by the mint.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.920
 But it was basically because he was enemies

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.640
 of this other guy called Earl of Pembroke.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.120
 And the Earl of Pembroke was an Earl,

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.320
 and Robert Record wasn't.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.440
 He was just a Welsh guy.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.920
 And so the Earl of Pembroke basically said,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.120
 "Well, I'm going to accuse you of this,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.000
 and send you to prison."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.160
 Sends him to prison, and he died in prison.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.560
 Oh.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.360
 It's really bad.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.520
 Yeah, Detta's prison, he was put into.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.240
 And I think it was around the time of Queen Mary/Elizabeth,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.560
 and so lots of Catholic Protestant, Argy Bargy,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.040
 and he was one of the victims of that, basically.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.720
 Detta's prison was some...

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.840
 I'm not saying it's the way you'd want to go,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.120
 but it sometimes wasn't terrible,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.160
 depending who you were.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.320
 But you could have your own suite.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.720
 There were bars and restaurants in Detta's prisons,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.680
 which if you could afford to use them, it's not bad, is it?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.960
 Who could afford to use them?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.000
 You're in Detta's prison.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.480
 I promise I'm good for them.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.000
 Just put it on the tab.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 Put it on the tab, it's fine.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.920
 That's surely how they bust you when you pay for your drink.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.960
 Ah-ha, you do have money.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.040
 And Dickens' dad was in Detta's prison.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.840
 Dickens used to visit and stay, basically.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.000
 He decided he works in a workhouse,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.760
 but the option was he could have stayed there.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.120
 Yeah, your family often lived there.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.480
 You were allowed to work, I think,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.160
 to work off your debts from the prison.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.360
 I read about a guy who gave Trumpet lessons from Detta's prison,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.880
 which must have been incredibly annoying

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.840
 if you were sharing his cell.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.440
 I imagine not just a professional Trumpeter playing all day,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.240
 that would be fine,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.280
 but someone giving Trumpet lessons in yourself

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.280
 to some 10-year-old who's, you know...

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.040
 Well, you shouldn't have fucked up your finances, should you?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.680
 Yeah, true, yeah.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.840
 You didn't want to listen to an eight-year-old play Trumpet all day?

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.240
 This one's interesting.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.760
 This was a 21-year-old man

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.280
 who, according to the database,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.520
 was riding on a TV when he ran into a turkey

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.160
 and lost control and then ran into a tree.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.920
 No more information supplied.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.480
 No needy.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.560
 Did TVs...

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.200
 Did they have wheels on them in the old days?

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.480
 They might, do you?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.080
 But you don't take it outdoors, do you?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.400
 You're very ready to take a TV out, no.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.120
 But it's a Christmas...

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.320
 Was it an ATV?

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.640
 Oh, we're getting a note from the audience

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.600
 saying it was an ATV, potentially, an all-terrain vehicle.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.120
 Yeah, there's a slight problem in...

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.120
 So, thank you...

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.600
 Well...

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.080
 It says...

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.080
 What, no, okay, so two points.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.720
 Thank you for...

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.280
 Thank you for...

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.920
 We're just...

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.680
 We're going over to Dan for a rebuttal now.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.160
 Yeah, so...

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.280
 Firstly, it is spelled A, space, and then capital TV,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.280
 and then B, shut the fuck up, mate.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.280
 Either that or we're going to need about 2,200 microphones

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.080
 for this podcast.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.480
 I'm joking, obviously.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.080
 There's a lot of the kids' movies are very different

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.080
 than the original stories.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.840
 The Little Mermaid is one.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.320
 In the movie, she wants to become a human

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.280
 because she wants to get married to the prince or whatever.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.400
 In the book, she wants to become a human

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.400
 because she wants to get to heaven.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.720
 In the movie, she kind of gets her voice

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.680
 magicked out of her so she can't speak,

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.800
 and in the book, she has her tongue physically cut out.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.840
 Wow.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.520
 And then in the end, she is given a dagger

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.800
 to kill Eric, the human, and she refuses to do that,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.920
 and so commits suicide and drowns into the water,

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.680
 becoming sea foam.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.160
 Wow.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.800
 So why didn't Disney do that for a story?

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.280
 Do we know?

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.320
 I don't know, because I also at home have a version

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.000
 of the original Pinocchio, where he kills Jiminy Cricket,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.880
 has his feet burned off, and is hanged by villagers.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.480
 And they don't mention that in the Disney one either.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.400
 Can you imagine when you're sitting down,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.240
 the Little Mermaid author, to say,

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.400
 "We're very excited. We've bought the book.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.120
 We've got a few changes to make to your plot."

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.360
 And he's like, "Okay."

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.200
 You've kept the cutting the tongue out.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.960
 No, we haven't.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.720
 We have kept the Jamaican crab.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.200
 Well, that's fine, go ahead.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.560
 They found that all these people who are returning stuff,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.160
 there's just obvious patterns.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.480
 So people who buy portable generators

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.920
 during weather emergencies,

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.720
 they'll use them right until the emergency has ended,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.600
 and then all of those go back, just as huge amount goes back.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.040
 Large TVs, a surge of returns.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.480
 Sorry, what, when you say a TV.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.720
 Yeah.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.120
 Well, I've now finished driving on all the terrains.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.600
 I can send this back.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.880
 There was a survey of children in 1942

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.360
 that found lots of them didn't think bananas were real.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.360
 Oh, come here.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.720
 I haven't seen them in a long time.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.640
 And in the same year, a single banana was auctioned off

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.000
 in Russell Square in London,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.840
 and it sold for over 500 Australian dollars in today's money.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.320
 No.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.600
 For one banana.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.800
 Idiots.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.560
 I can't believe these guys won the war.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.560
 I need to move this on in a sec.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.000
 Can I tell you very quickly, sort of,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.160
 "journalese" is this, like, shorthand term

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.960
 for terms that get chucked into newspapers all the time.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.200
 Yep.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.520
 And there is a book about them called "Romps, Tots and Boffins,"

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.040
 which is by a writer called Robert Hutton,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.480
 which is all about specifically British,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.560
 but I'm sure a lot of them apply around the world.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.960
 And basically, just a few of the best terms.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.960
 Boo's fueled rampage is what vile thugs go on

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.240
 to the dismay of revelers.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.760
 Budding is someone under 20 who's good at something.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.360
 "Rushed" is the only way anyone gets to hospital,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.760
 typically after ambulances raced to the scene.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.560
 The best one.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.800
 A sex session is one or more bonks.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.880
 Very good.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.920
 I really enjoyed a news article I read from 1891

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.960
 about a Christmas party accident that happened

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.400
 where it was in Michigan,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.480
 and there was a man who was dressed as Santa Claus,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.200
 but he made his outfit entirely out of cotton wool.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.640
 He went to a costume party.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.720
 He bumped into a boy who was dressed as

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.600
 "We Really Winky" or something,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.440
 or a ghoul who was carrying a candle.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.560
 So naturally, Father Christmas went up in flames,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.080
 ran around in a total panic.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.720
 As the article said,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.400
 he ran frantically about the saloon,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.280
 setting fire to the costumes of all with whom he came into contact.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.280
 All of whom then went on to rush wildly about the room,

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.520
 setting fire to other people they crashed into.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.760
 Many of the guests of "Saviriy have burned,"

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.480
 the guy dressed as Santa and a couple of others

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.920
 may have succumbed to their injuries.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.040
 So quite a mad catastrophe,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.440
 but I just really liked the understatement of 1891

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.960
 where it said, "For a short time,

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.680
 it seemed likely to end in catastrophe."

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.960
 Wow. That's a shame because what you should have done,

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.920
 that Santa, because there's a stat that came out in 2006,

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.120
 which is that they surveyed hundreds of Santas

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.160
 that were in malls and found that 34% of them

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.960
 regularly were being urinated on by children.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.120
 That's what they said.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.200
 So what he should have done was just found any kid,

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.440
 pick them up, put himself out with, yeah.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.360
 Toddlers make quite good football coaches, soccer coaches.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.880
 It turns out.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.440
 For what reason?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.280
 Oh, I didn't read into that.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:31.280
 No, they try to teach robot footballers how to play football,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.120
 and they use the normal way of doing it.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.640
 They use geometric figures to tell them

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.480
 which way to go and which way to run.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.320
 And then they found another lot where they showed them videos

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.080
 of toddlers sort of wobbling around

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.840
 and trying to walk themselves.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.760
 And when they taught them how to walk like toddlers,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.360
 they were way, way better at football.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.320
 So who was, sorry, who was way, way better?

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.960
 The robots.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.840
 The robots.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.840
 It's specifically for robots learning to play football.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.800
 Yeah.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.920
 You did sex that up a bit.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.360
 I was imagining a toddler on the sidelines

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.680
 in a football match saying, "Get him, you blind bastards!"

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.720
 Can we mention a bit about Ray Gunn quickly,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.800
 because there's been news recently that she's...

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.000
 Oh, what?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.360
 Well, she stepped down right.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.480
 She's retired.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.680
 And I'm not into the bullying that she's got.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.440
 And I have to say it's because I think,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.400
 particularly Australia, is brilliant

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.560
 when they create moments at the Olympics

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.240
 that are different to any other country.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.880
 I mean, this country is so good at embracing those moments.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.560
 Stephen Bradbury, right?

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.960
 Come on.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.720
 Stephen Bradbury for listeners who don't know him

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.280
 is the guy who was ice skating in a race.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.520
 Everyone fell down and he won the semi-final.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.120
 And then he made it to the final.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.520
 And once again, everyone in front of him fell down.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.680
 So basically, all Ray Gunn really needed

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.080
 was for everyone to fall down apart from her.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.440
 They needed to hit their neck.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.280
 But you're meant to fall down and break dancing.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.240
 That's where she went wrong.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.840
 Everyone failed to fall down apart from Ray Gunn.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.080
 But Stephen Bradbury, he embraced it.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.160
 He goes around the country giving talks.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.080
 He... I saw this today.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.680
 He even has a line of beer called Last Man Standing.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.160
 Like, the guy has stepped into it.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.720
 Not Olympics, but another sports star.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.640
 John Hapuate, right?

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.840
 John Hapuate.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.240
 Who's that?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.080
 He got caught putting his finger up people's anuses three times.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.280
 He's a rugby player.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.840
 He's a rugby player.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.480
 He's a rugby player.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.320
 There's the context that I need it.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.280
 He's not a 10-pin bowler.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.360
 Yeah, he played for the West Tigers

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.920
 and it was three North Queensland Cowboy players

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.040
 that he individually put his finger up at different times.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.160
 Now, here's the thing.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.600
 Big Storm, he goes off.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.360
 It's meant to be very embarrassing.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.840
 A mutual friend who was nameless had a drink with him recently

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.520
 and they said, "Are you embarrassed about it?"

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.560
 And he said, "Embarrassed."

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.600
 And he picked up his phone and the shot on his phone

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.320
 that is the screensaver was his finger up someone's ass.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.040
 Australians fucking embrace this stuff.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.080
 And so, I think Ray Gunn needs to get back on the horse.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.600
 You're not allowed horses.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.960
 But what's called dressage, isn't it?

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.880
 What is dressage if not horse break dancing?

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.200
 Thank you, Andy.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.440
 Yeah.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:22.080
 Welcome back.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.360
 Wow, Anna, fuck.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.640
 It just wasn't enough to quite get me through.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.800
 Not that this hasn't been a delight.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.560
 I don't need wine to get through it.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.640
 It's just there was some pretty big political news day

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.600
 and she's celebrating.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:45.840
 James went to Australia Zoo today.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.440
 You went to Steve Irwin's zoo.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.400
 Why is that funny?

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.560
 Open mockery.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.720
 Is that funny going to that zoo?

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.080
 Oh, it's a classic.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.840
 It's Steve Irwin's.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.240
 But it was bold going when we had a show tonight

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.560
 and you woke up later.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.920
 There was a non-zero chance

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.240
 that I was going to be stuck an hour and a half away.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.080
 In a crocodile's mouth.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.240
 I've actually got James bought me a present

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.680
 from Australia Zoo and this is so special

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.080
 because I think it's quite possibly

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.480
 the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.880
 I wanted to buy him something

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.880
 that he would love and his wife would hate.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.880
 It's a commemorative plate of Steve Irwin and someone else.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.880
 If you can't see it at the back, lucky you.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.200
 But it is crockery.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.400
 Oh, come on.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.360
 Yeah, that's true.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.400
 Yeah, all right.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.720
 And he also got me some socks.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.680
 Oh, my God.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.600
 Oh, sogadiles.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.400
 It's not as good as crockery, is it?

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.200
 I should have left that in the bag.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.600
 All right, well, let's press on before that one joke

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.720
 stinks up this whole room.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.800
 Do you know what the Spanish word trampolín means?

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.000
 It's the... It's the eardrum.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.520
 No. No?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.800
 Okay, is it not trampolín?

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:13.600
 It's not trampolín.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.720
 Oh, my goodness. Okay, okay.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.120
 It's a Spanish word for diving board.

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.320
 Wait, I'll get it. I'll get it.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.240
 Spanish word for diving board.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.280
 I can edit this, right?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.520
 So something springy.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:27.840
 Yeah.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.520
 So you jump up and down.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.360
 I wonder what a diving board is.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.560
 Oh, someone in the audience got it.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.040
 Pollocks!

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.760
 And the reason being that the people who invented the trampolín,

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.800
 as we would know it, were inspired by the diving board,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.120
 and they use the Spanish word for diving board.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.560
 So that's the original, if you say it,

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.560
 that a proper trampolín is actually a diving board.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.120
 Really should be.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.080
 Right.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:50.480
 Yeah.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.200
 That's very cool.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.840
 So they think it's fucking weird that none of our trampolins have water.

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.160
 And they all break their legs when they try and jump off them.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.120
 Can I say, and I apologize in advance to Andy,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.640
 because this is a fact of yours,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.400
 that we've never mentioned on the show,

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.760
 but I love it so much.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.320
 Rivalries are often between siblings as well, right?

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.040
 And sometimes siblings we see, like Serena and Venus,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.560
 they make it into sports,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.640
 and they're always paired off against each other.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.160
 Who is the more popular one?

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.640
 But there's a really great fact that Andy told us,

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.200
 which is that in NHL, in ice hockey,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.480
 there is a record for the most points combined,

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.320
 scored by two brothers ever in NHL history,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.160
 and that is by the Gretzky brothers,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.080
 Wayne Gretzky and Brett Gretzky,

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:42.080
 that combined, they have had 2,861 points, goals between them.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.520
 Huge, massive.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.160
 280, 57 them.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.840
 Say that again.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.720
 280.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.920
 2,000.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.240
 Sorry.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.600
 This is why I should let Andy do his own facts.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.640
 2,861 is the total.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.000
 Is the total between them.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.680
 2,857 of those were scored by Wayne,

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.320
 and four were scored by Brent.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.280
 It's a horrible thing.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:11.680
 Yeah.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:13.200
 But Brett's such a nice guy.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.480
 Oh, he's a dude.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.920
 He loves the setup too, yeah.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.560
 Oh my god, guys, I've just had a vision of something.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.160
 Has anyone ever made this connection?

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.840
 The word golf, the O is the ball,

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.480
 the L is the putter, the F is the flag,

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.720
 and the G looks like someone bent over

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.560
 who's about to hit a golf ball.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.240
 That's actually quite good.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.040
 What the fuck?

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.680
 That's actually the first thing

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.360
 you've ever genuinely blown wide open.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.080
 That is good.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.680
 That just came to me.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.160
 I think like you need,

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.240
 the golfer needs to be holding the club

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.120
 and then hissing the ball,

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.080
 so it needs to be golf.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:56.160
 We should petition to rename the club,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.440
 setting up your golf club.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.240
 Yeah.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.040
 Hey, can you guys think if there's a job

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040
 that a banana would cause huge problems for you,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.720
 put you in danger, what is that job?

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.160
 What?

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.040
 Let's imagine you're going to work.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.680
 You're going to work.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.800
 Oh, you slip over.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.600
 So you work.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.240
 I've got one.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.040
 Yeah.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.400
 They are very, very, very, very slightly radioactive.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.040
 So maybe if you are someone who's looking for bums

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.040
 and somewhat you've got your,

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.320
 I don't know where I'm going with this.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.840
 Yeah, you're going to count as always going off

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.120
 and you're like, guys, guys, I've got another one.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.400
 I've got, oh, no, I haven't got another one.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.840
 No, I've just got my lunch.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.480
 Yeah.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.640
 Banana bob again, the false alarms.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.600
 And then it's like cry wolf,

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.880
 because when you do find the bomb,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.680
 no one believes you.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.400
 Yeah.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.520
 And the terrorists have worked out

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.040
 to paint the bomb to look like a banana

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.080
 and put it in Bob's pocket.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.960
 Is that the answer, Dan?

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.080
 Yeah, you got it in one.

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.880
 That's amazing.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.720
 No, the answer is if you're a beekeeper.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.000
 It sends them nuts.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.320
 The smell of it releases this pheromone

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.840
 that makes them want to attack.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.840
 So beekeepers are always advised

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.360
 if you're about to go to work,

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.960
 don't have a banana for breakfast,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.000
 because if you're near the hive

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.560
 and you breathe and they smell your banana breath,

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.920
 they're going to come and attack you.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.360
 There's reports of beekeepers

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.720
 who are sort of like 10, 15 meters away

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.240
 who decide to have a cheeky banana

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.360
 before doing their job.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:17.120
 And suddenly they're being chased

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.280
 by all the bees from the hive

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.280
 who believe that they're being attacked.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.560
 So they're attacking back.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.680
 You know what? I was in Australia Zoo this afternoon.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.320
 That's not funny, guys.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.000
 And it said there that the Komodo dragon

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.960
 can smell its dinner from 11 kilometers away.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.160
 No.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:38.480
 What?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.760
 It must be true.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.440
 It said it in Australia Zoo.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.160
 Really?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.800
 Yeah.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.040
 It's because they use the tongs.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.640
 They kind of stick the tongs out

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.000
 and they can taste some food from 11 kilometers away.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.280
 What the hell is the point in that?

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.400
 They're very slow walkers.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.240
 That's going to take them two days to walk.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.760
 Yeah, that's right.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.200
 They stick their forked tongs out.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.520
 And I think we mentioned this on the show.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.680
 They eat things that are so large

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:03.760
 but they digest so slowly

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.520
 that they need to get the full thing in their mouth

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.160
 quite quickly to start that whole process.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.120
 So what they'll often do

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.000
 is if half an animal is sticking outside of their mouth,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.400
 they will ram themselves into a tree

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.640
 so to knock it further down their throat.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.480
 Just be like trying to get a nail in it the other way.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.160
 I know people who eat like that.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:26.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.680
 No one's pointing fingers.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:32.000
 Can I tell you about one rivalry that happened this year?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.560
 Yeah.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:34.720
 A very, very bad rivalry.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.240
 The annual fat bear week.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.400
 Okay.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.400
 Different bears are pitted against each other

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.360
 and they're sort of assessed to see

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.760
 how much weight they can gain over the feeding-up season.

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.720
 It was delayed this year

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.720
 after one of the contestants killed another bear.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.160
 Oh.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.080
 Bear 469 killed and, I don't know,

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.440
 may have eaten Bear 402.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.400
 That is cheating.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.680
 That is cheating.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:54.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.680
 Eventually, the winner is just one in all as bear, isn't it?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.520
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.640
 Yeah, there you go.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.680
 Do you know that when he died,

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.800
 so he was stuffed, wasn't he?

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.600
 He was taxidermied to be laid in state.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.320
 I think probably preserved rather than stuffed.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.800
 They didn't.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.720
 I don't know.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.440
 I don't know.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.400
 I'm guessing.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.160
 I think he was pretty stuffed at the end.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.960
 He was, okay, yeah.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.000
 Maybe there's other terms.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:18.560
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.040
 Tomato.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.080
 Tomato.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.640
 Embarmed.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.040
 Embarmed?

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.920
 He was embarmed.

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:22.400
 Yeah.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.360
 He was embarmed.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:23.840
 Yeah.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:26.880
 I just, he was stuffed by the exact same guy.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.920
 I mean, the taxidermist looking out of the window

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.080
 halfway through working on a particularly tricky squirrel.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:32.800
 Oh my God.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.040
 Clear the dex.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.440
 Anyway, the same guy who did Chairman Mao did him.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.400
 No, yeah.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.240
 So we talked about the history of mini golf.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:42.800
 Yeah, let's go for it.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.880
 Slash Crazy Golf, which I'm going to call it,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.960
 because as discussed, it's more fun.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.240
 But Garnet Carter seems to be the king of Crazy Golf.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.480
 So some people made some little mini golf courses

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.640
 in their back gardens beforehand with fun stuff in it.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.560
 But Garnet Carter, 1926, made a Tom Thumb golf course,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.640
 and he put lots of elaborate obstacles in it.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.040
 It was in a hotel that I think he owned in America.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.760
 And he painted it within three years

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.040
 of him making that one course.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.800
 There were 25,000 Tom Thumb courses in the US.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.760
 There was a song about him.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.560
 It was so famous.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.800
 There was a national tournament with a $2,000 prize,

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.960
 which was like a billion dollars back then.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.560
 And so he did very, very well.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.160
 1926 to 1929.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.160
 1929, bad year for America.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.640
 His fortune wiped out along with everyone else's.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.800
 And he rebuilt it because his wife had a little garden,

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 or a little rock garden that she'd made.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.320
 And he basically employed someone called Clark Byers

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:40.960
 to spend 30 years painting the words "see rock city"

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.400
 in massive letters on all the sheds of America

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.760
 so that when you were flying over it,

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.760
 you saw it and you went and visited

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.360
 his wife's little rock garden.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.760
 And it became one of the biggest tourist attractions

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.560
 in America.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.040
 Wow.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.880
 Tens of thousands of people went to visit.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.120
 His poor wife, who was just having some quiet time

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.840
 in her rock garden, was descended on.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.000
 And there are still these barn roofs all over America

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.680
 that's, oh, there were like 20 years ago,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.480
 they might have been rubbed off,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.320
 just saying "see rock city".

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.040
 That's amazing.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.400
 Isn't that incredible?

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:08.960
 Love it.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.040
 So, you know, you can make something out of nothing.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.200
 As we are, living evidence of, of course, great.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.680
 Okay, so what about food waste?

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.040
 That's a big problem, isn't it?

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:19.360
 Yep.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.080
 Yeah.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.680
 In Australia, you discard 3.1 million tons of food every year

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.200
 that includes five million bananas,

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.480
 which if laid end to end would go from Sydney to Melbourne.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.840
 Okay.

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.000
 Shame on you.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.520
 It's not a better use for them, do you think?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.280
 It would be quite funny,

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.520
 but anyone walking and slipping all the way.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.280
 Can I say something about modern photographs?

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:47.600
 Yeah.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.240
 Yeah.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.240
 Which I just think is very interesting.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.680
 It's about photographs on Facebook,

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.280
 which is a form of social media.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.560
 And there was, in 2011,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.440
 Yeah.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.920
 2011, Facebook became a big vehicle

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.440
 for people posting up their photos.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.960
 In 2011, it became that, did it?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.600
 It suddenly, a lot of people had it even before that.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.320
 But in...

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.560
 Wow, God, they were freaky earlier.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:15.600
 Adopters, weren't they?

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.480
 Exactly.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.280
 Not just any trials at the time.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.240
 Yeah, go on.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.640
 Facebook gave people the ability to flag photos

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.600
 as offensive or whatever.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.440
 Loads of people flag photos that seemed innocuous,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.800
 saying they were offensive.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.720
 So Facebook did a little survey, some questionnaires,

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.520
 and said, "Why did you people find these particular photos offensive?"

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.720
 And realized they were all photos

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.480
 where the person thought they looked too drunk

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.640
 or stupid or ugly or fat or whatever.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.080
 So they added an option that you can check.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.760
 And obviously, as someone who's never done on Facebook,

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.200
 I actually don't know if this is incredibly well known

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.680
 that it's there,

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.000
 but you could check an option when you flagged it,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.480
 saying, "It makes me feel embarrassed

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.160
 as your reason for flagging it."

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.920
 And when they added that option,

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.120
 one-third of people still chose other,

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.800
 and most of them wrote underneath,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.000
 "It's embarrassing."

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.200
 Because it makes me feel embarrassed...

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.160
 Well, we don't know why,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.520
 but they obviously mean the same thing.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.720
 But it makes me feel embarrassed is,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.320
 like, the problem is you,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.360
 where we're saying it's embarrassing.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.360
 Actually, it's objectively embarrassing.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.160
 It has to do with me.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.080
 It has to do with this photo of me drinking from a hat.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.200
 I'm not the problem.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.200
 Whoever looks like this is the problem.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.080
 That's very funny.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.920
 I was looking at concealing messages within text,

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.040
 which is what this is,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.120
 which is called steganography.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.560
 And, A, I found the etymology of that quite interesting.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.760
 So steganography is the idea of...

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.160
 Rather than other forms of code,

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.200
 which is like when you've written in code

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.400
 that no one can unscramble,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.600
 it's basically sending a message

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.200
 that you can't even tell is code,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.560
 unless you're the recipient,

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.160
 and you know what to look for, like, you know, an acrostic.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.640
 So it comes from the Greek stege,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.080
 meaning a covering or roof.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.720
 And I just like that,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.360
 because it's the same as stegosaurus from when we initially thought.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.920
 Do you remember that, you know, the triangles that stick up on...

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.560
 The plates.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.080
 The plates, thank you.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.360
 That's what you should call them.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.840
 The plates that stick up on a stegosaurus's back,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.160
 they used to think that they were lying down

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.240
 and interlocking like a ceiling,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.480
 which is why they called it the stegosaurus.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.320
 Anyway, that's where steganography comes from.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:16.960
 Okay, cool.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.400
 And one steganography technique

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.360
 is that in ancient China,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.720
 people would write secret messages on fine silk,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.920
 and all we know from the sources,

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.160
 and there are multiple sources that reported it,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.560
 which was then scrunched up into a tiny ball

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.080
 and covered in wax,

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.120
 and then the messenger would swallow the ball of wax,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.200
 and then the paper I was reading about this in says,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.360
 "There are quite a few sources that mention this technique,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.360
 but no one mentions how the ball of wax

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.440
 was recovered from the messenger."

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.960
 So that is to be left to the imagination.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.200
 I can't think of any good way that it comes back out.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.920
 In 2010, a New York man had his girlfriend's name tattooed onto his lip,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.120
 and then in 2013, they split up.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.520
 Bit of a shame.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.600
 And then in 2014, he was fired

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.760
 because his ex-girlfriend was called Isis.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.160
 Oh, no.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:11.920
 Okay.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.240
 I think that's not fair.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.240
 I actually think that's really unfair.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.680
 I think you should be able to have a name badge

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.800
 that explains the situation.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.880
 Well, he could have tattooed on his upper lip, maybe, just saying.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.960
 Here's what happened.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.800
 There was an account by a tattooist in Vice who said,

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.960
 "This guy came in and got a collar rocker

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:30.960
 of the name Vanessa across his chest."

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.080
 I got a what, sorry?

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.960
 Collar rocker?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.600
 I don't know either.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.240
 I like the way you confidently said it.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.960
 Bluff, then retreat.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.720
 Um, about midway through, I asked if Vanessa was his girlfriend

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:47.920
 or his mum, to which he replied it was his ex's name,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.800
 and he was getting it inked in an effort to woo her back.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.000
 If I had known, I wouldn't have started.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.400
 And suffice to say, when I saw the guy about six months later,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.200
 he was still single.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.520
 What doesn't exist in the Coronation Street universe?

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.480
 The most famous moment in his career was when he went electric.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.080
 He was a folk guitarist.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.960
 He'd put in some amps and he'd gotten electric guitar.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.160
 It happened at a very famous Newport Folk Festival in 1965.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.200
 Huge controversy.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.920
 No longer seems very controversial, but fine, whatever.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:19.680
 You were expecting the ooh from the audience that year.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.480
 That news is broken.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.120
 But in Coronation Street, this is very interesting.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.160
 Ken Barlow, canonically, was present at the 1965 gig of Bob Dylan's

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.920
 in Manchester and heckled Bob Dylan.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.280
 He's the guy who yells Judas?

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.840
 That's not Ken Barlow from Coronation Street.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:37.440
 The guy who hit you, shouted Judas was a real person.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.520
 Ken Barlow is a character in Coronation Street,

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.240
 of which Bob Dylan is a fan.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.040
 So what I'm saying is Bob watches a show in which he exists.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.880
 Bob Dylan exists in the Coronation Street universe.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.320
 I understood everything.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:51.120
 But it could have been, it could have been that Corey had written

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.800
 into their plot for Ken Barlow.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.320
 It was the famous guy who shouted to you.

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.360
 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.880
 No, but thank you for that absolute patronising breakdown.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:59.360
 I'm sorry.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.120
 I didn't understand.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.800
 You've got to know when to patronise down and when not to, Andy.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.920
 I'm not cool, man.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.640
 Oh, no.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.160
 Do you guys know, do you eat grape or a lot?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.280
 Not many, but it's really popular.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.280
 And it was very popular in Maori culture.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.280
 And in Maori it's called hapuku.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.680
 And it's so common amongst Maori.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.000
 Go on.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.160
 Thank you very much.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.200
 That'll be great for the edit.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.880
 But just in case, why don't you say hapukka?

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.600
 Yeah, I'm not going to leave it to this person.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.960
 They're not on, Mike.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.600
 In Maori it's called hapukka.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.160
 It's not going to work with the noise, is it?

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:39.920
 Right.

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.880
 So I was sitting in a room today in New Zealand

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.800
 and a guy randomly overheard me talking about this called Wade.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.920
 And he came over and he said,

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.360
 "My grandfather is an example of non-determinism."

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.200
 And so as a result, he then pulled out two unpublished books that he's written,

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.480
 which are all about characters that have names that are relevant to what they do.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.520
 So one story was about someone called Robin Banks,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.040
 who was robbing banks, who had to get in the car for a getaway driver who's called Joyrider,

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.320
 and they bump into a man and bounce off him on the way to get away, who's called Rick O'Shea.

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.720
 And it sounds incredible.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.760
 He hasn't published it yet.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.120
 He's got a working title on it.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.880
 So I think he's working on an actual title,

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.840
 but the moment it's called,

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.400
 "The place where the names of the people are the things they do."

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:29.360
 And that's Wade Beebe, if any, if any publishers are listening in.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.960
 My wife publishes kids' books,

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.560
 but no, she's busy, Wade.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.160
 This is such bullshit.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.680
 This kind of thing just happens to you.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.080
 The three of us slave away for days on end, staring at computer screens.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.160
 You loiter in a pub for a while and someone comes up to you and tells you this stuff.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:56.880
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.600
 My fact this week is that Ray Bradbury's 451 Fahrenheit

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.320
 has been translated into over 30 languages under the same title,

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:12.080
 except in Denmark, where it was published as 233 Celsius.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:16.880
 I should have said 451 Fahrenheit.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.600
 Do you know, I think you should have said Fahrenheit 451, which is what I...

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.680
 Because that's the title, that's the actual title.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:28.240
 I'm really kind of hoping that you say it clean in the next 15 minutes, so that I can edit it in.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.120
 Wow. So here's a picture of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.440
 Crisp.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.600
 Hopefully that works.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.480
 There was a time in Soviet Russia where they did away with the conductors,

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:47.840
 in a non-hierarchical communist society where everyone's equal.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.680
 You don't need one person at the front who's like lording it over everyone else.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.920
 Is it at the same time that there are all of the aeroplane crashes on the tarmac at the airports

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:04.160
 in Soviet Russia because they decide to do away with the guy, because they're like, no, we don't know.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:10.800
 Buttons, this is a podcast, so when your punchline involves no words and movement,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.680
 if you could help the audience at home.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:18.560
 If only you did another podcast to give you the sort of professional experience you need.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.200
 Hey, actually, speaking of that, there is another podcast.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.760
 I mean, we don't usually like people bringing out their phones in a performance like this,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.640
 but I encourage you to bring out your phone, go to Spotify.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.080
 What?

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.200
 There's a little podcast you should look up called The Cryptid Factor.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.640
 What are you talking about?

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.680
 Never heard of it.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.360
 I'm just, you mentioned it, and I wasn't going to.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:44.480
 Well, I think you guys have talked before about how a sauerkraut was renamed Liberty Cabbage,

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.520
 and German measles became Liberty Measles.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:52.880
 But we had a case in New Zealand as well, you got like, I think you call it luncheon sausage.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.080
 What?

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:55.520
 Do you know what luncheon sausage is?

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.680
 Yeah, like a processed roll of meat, sort of like dog roll, but you might eat it.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.880
 Like a hot dog thing?

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.520
 No, no, no, no.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.800
 Like bologna.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.360
 Big old roll of hot dog meat that is sliced.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:07.840
 Oh, okay.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.960
 We just don't eat that.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.200
 Yeah, well, look, you're missing out, mate.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.160
 In Australia it's called Devon Meat, but in New Zealand it used to be called German sausage,

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.480
 but we renamed it to Belgium.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.000
 But only in the South Island.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.200
 Do you guys know what Belgium is?

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.480
 No one else in the world will understand this.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.080
 Was that in the war or just recently?

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.800
 We're not insane.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.680
 It was recent.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.480
 And rare.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:46.880
 Aliens.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.160
 Oh, God.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.960
 No, stay with me.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.000
 Yes, stay with me.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.680
 Aliens are more likely to be us time traveling back from the distant future than they are

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.840
 to be little creatures from another planet.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.640
 Okay.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.520
 Are they not?

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.440
 Buttons, can I just quickly ask, you have had this theory for a long time,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.120
 and I know for a fact that you've said it on a bunch of shows,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.800
 but you did get one amazing opportunity to tell Neil deGrasse Tyson recently, your theory.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.800
 How did he take it?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:25.520
 Worst security called quite briefly.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.640
 I believe the exact words were get the fuck out of my face.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.160
 Okay, audience.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:38.320
 One, two, three, get the fuck out of my face.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:44.400
 Again, obviously, there's always going to be paranoia about whoever is the enemy.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:48.240
 And the Germans in World War I were very paranoid about the countries they invaded,

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.120
 the people in those countries, what were they plotting.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.440
 And when they went into Belgium, there were lots of stories that Belgian children

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.960
 were going to do bad things to them.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.040
 So there were all these rumors that little Belgian girls were coming and cutting off

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.280
 the earlobes in the upper parts of the ears of injured Germans and stashing them.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.520
 And the little Belgian boys were coming and gouging out their eyes

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.880
 and putting them in churches.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.560
 So there were churches in Belgium filled with soldiers, removed eyes.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.360
 None of it was true.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.800
 There weren't 12-year-old girls.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.160
 Might want to rethink your sausage.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:25.600
 Well, I think that's what it was made from, just ears and eyeballs.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:32.640
 This is a study that was done by Metropolis Metropolitan Life Insurance.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:38.800
 Metropolitan.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.560
 See, do you want to have a go at it?

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.400
 What's it like when you two are just doing it?

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.440
 Is this what your other podcast like?

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:55.360
 I do have to say, after 10 years, how many podcasts is no such thing as a fish town?

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.720
 Five hundred.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.840
 Five hundred plus apps.

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:04.880
 With Crypto Factor, 15 years, we just celebrated the other day our 100th episode.

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:12.160
 Because it takes us really long to form sentences.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.360
 Hey buttons, buttons.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.400
 I remember that study.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.160
 Wasn't it from Metropolitan University?

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.040
 Oh, yes.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.600
 Would you like to remind us about this?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.640
 Oh, fuck it.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.360
 The person who cans the beer from Lerwick Brewery in Scotland is called Phil McCann.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.520
 No, beautiful.

00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:37.280
 That was sent to me on Twitter by someone called ASL Peterson.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.640
 And there's a novel called An Office Romance by Iona Rose.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.960
 That's lovely.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:48.160
 You know, when she was Princess Juliana,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:53.120
 she had a town that was named after her called Juliana Drop.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.080
 I was actually named after the birthing process, wasn't it?

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.720
 So this is a municipality in Den Helder.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:05.520
 It's south of the, this Juliana Drop, south of the town of Den Helder,

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:09.760
 which is north of Shagen and west of Helenskruun.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.240
 So.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:10.640
 Okay.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.760
 Is that in the Netherlands?

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:14.000
 I actually didn't look that bit up.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.560
 Yes, it is.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:14.800
 Yeah.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.000
 Yeah.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:16.640
 North Holland.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.440
 So, Holland's Kruun.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.400
 It's next to that.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:18.720
 Yeah.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:22.640
 And so they named it after her, except it changed during World War Two,

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.600
 because there was some beef, and they didn't want to name it that anymore.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:28.320
 So they changed it to Lopjutdorp.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.120
 And then it reverted back to Juliana Drop.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.040
 Again, once all the beef got sorted out.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.680
 So she's twice been named after a place, but the same place.

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.320
 Wow.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.120
 Lopjutdorp.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.560
 What was that?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.080
 It was a guy who founded the town.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:40.640
 Oh, okay.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.480
 Pietlupjut.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.000
 Completely different words the second time around.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.680
 Cool.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.080
 Oh, have you guys come across the German conductor?

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.120
 She's called Mayira.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:56.240
 She's got three arms.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.680
 What?

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.800
 Which makes her a way better conductor than anyone else.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.400
 She actually has.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:02.960
 Come on.

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.480
 So what happens is you can have, like normally a conductor would have to be like,

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:10.160
 you know, this side of the orchestra does this, this side does this,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.160
 but you can only do two, but she can do three.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.240
 This sounds like a sit-up to a really great dad joke.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.560
 I fear it might be.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.360
 She's a robot.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.520
 And she does it, instead of with batons, she does it with lightsabers.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:31.200
 And there is a special piece called the semiconductor's masterpiece,

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.200
 which uses this kind of technique of three different parts of the orchestra all doing

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.920
 different things.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:42.880
 One fact, which is not actually about World War One, but it is about sort of being paranoid

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.720
 about what the enemy is plotting.

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:50.400
 And it was 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War, which is, you know, a huge deal led to the,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.760
 you know, Germany being a thing.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:56.880
 And the Germans had lots of French prisoners of war.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.400
 And it was all over the German papers and all in a German room among the mills

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:05.680
 that the French prisoners were planning this huge mutiny.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.440
 And it was going to be a Christmas mutiny.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.120
 And it was based on the fact that they'd overheard them, these French prisoners of war,

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.480
 whispering the word rebellion over and over again.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.920
 And so everyone was terrified about this.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.840
 And, you know, people were put on hand help out.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.680
 And it turned out, it was investigated.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:24.480
 It turned out that in France, the Christmas meal they have is called the réveillon,

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.160
 which I think we've talked about before.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.640
 And it was just coming up to Christmas and all the French prisoners were going,

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.160
 "What should we do for the réveillon?

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.080
 We're in prison, so it's going to be harder than usual.

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.440
 But maybe we can make it work."

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.680
 And all the Germans were going, "They're going to rebel.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.560
 There's a mutiny."

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.520
 That's so funny.

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.120
 It's not so cool.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.160
 That's incredible.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.440
 Well, that was like, we spoke about a guy who's a local New Zealander,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:48.240
 who's up in, I think, Dunedin, who, when you were having problems with cacophos,

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.640
 having sex, he was a saxophonist who came in and he played,

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:55.600
 they had a sexy room for the cacophos and he was there with a saxophone,

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.160
 just like Kenny Ging it up.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.120
 And I've dealt with these allegations before, mate.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.400
 It's fun to move.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.360
 I, there's a, there's a story that I think is quite heartwarming story,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.320
 but about don't suspect your enemy of too many wrongs.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.840
 And it's in World War II, there was an opera singer called Victor Ivanovich Nikitin,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.160
 who was a Russian opera singer.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.320
 And when the Germans were fighting on the Russian front,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.200
 whenever he started singing, everyone stopped fighting.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:25.600
 Really?

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.160
 Yeah.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.280
 To listen to him.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.200
 So he would, and he has an amazing voice.

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.640
 He was a very famous singer at the time.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:31.920
 I think there were recordings of him.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.120
 So whenever he started singing,

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.920
 the Germans would pause their fighting until he was finished

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.120
 and then start fighting again.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.080
 And I don't know why there must have been a lot of freshers just keep on singing.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.120
 But there was one, one night that the Russians thought,

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.920
 suddenly hang on, the Germans have started contravening this rule,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.160
 whereby we stop fighting whenever this bloke sings,

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.960
 because something landed in their sort of trenches

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.840
 and they immediately rushed to it screaming, it's a grenade,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.840
 they've thrown a grenade and they picked it up.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.120
 And it was a harmonica for them to accompany the opera singer.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.080
 Oh, wow.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:02.880
 Nice.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.200
 What an amazing way for war to be like,

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.440
 maybe they should have people in the trenches reading,

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:09.440
 really gripping audio books out loud.

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.440
 And just pausing on cliffhangers and just,

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.400
 all right, see you tomorrow, let's all get some rest.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.680
 There was a guy called William Howett,

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.880
 who was one of the first people to write about travels in Australia.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.440
 This is just during the gold rush of the 1850s.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.400
 He was in his carriage going down the road

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:31.520
 and he saw a cricket game taking place in the middle of the road.

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.320
 He said, this is not a very safe place to play cricket.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.360
 And the reply was, get along with you.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.880
 We do as we like here.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.640
 You are not in England, remember?

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.560
 Mm.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.880
 Oh, come on. That is such a lame put down.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.640
 I can't even reply to that.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.440
 Well, one of the first English players to ever play in Australia,

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.480
 this guy called Roger Edison in 1862.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.680
 He wrote of the Aussie team.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.560
 He said, I don't think much of their play,

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.280
 but they're a wonderful good lot of drinking men.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:07.440
 That's all you can hope for, guys, so practice that.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.840
 Just a big thank you.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.440
 Something very special happened for us today.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:14.880
 This is actually our second podcast recording of the day.

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:18.800
 The first one happened by a toilet down the road

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 in a bar called Mean Doses.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.000
 Really cool.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.600
 We found out that Mean Doses have been playing us in their toilet

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.680
 on loop nonstop, thanks to Dave, who works there.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.240
 And so we went over and we have recorded--

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.680
 Are you all Dave's mates?

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.400
 I wondered how we sold this out so quickly.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.600
 So we went over there and we recorded

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.680
 what is effectively an exclusive episode

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:50.000
 that will only ever be played inside the toilets at Mean Doses.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.800
 Yeah.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.280
 Very cool.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:56.960
 So if you want to be a completist of all the episodes,

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.400
 you need to go to Mean Doses.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:01.760
 And if you go there, you know, tomorrow or in the next few days,

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:05.680
 they've actually made no such thing as a fish chocolate stout,

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.520
 which is what I'm drinking here on stage.

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.680
 So you can get some of that.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.520
 And by the way, cool fact,

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.280
 Mean Doses is called Mean Doses

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.520
 because the owner of it is called Dean Moses.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.560
 Brilliant.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.240
 Tourism New Zealand have been in touch

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.000
 and they're really excited that there's going to be

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.800
 a whole influx of tourists now coming to New Zealand

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:29.360
 for the Hobbit Caves and to sit in the toilet for 20 minutes.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.280
 Listen to an episode to complete their listening.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.480
 The good thing is after drinking that beer,

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.400
 you will be sitting in the toilet for 20 minutes.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.920
 I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:41.200
 It's delicious.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:47.120
 Okay, that's it.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.400
 That's all of our facts.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.440
 And indeed, that is all of our tour.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:55.360
 We'll be back next week with a regular office-based episode,

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.840
 which I know some of you will be glad to hear.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.640
 But I really hope you enjoyed that show.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.520
 If you do want to come and see our live shows in the future,

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.080
 I'm sure we will book a few later this year.

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.200
 If you go to notionsthingsafish.com/live,

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.120
 you will see information about that.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.720
 Or you could go and look for our social media stuff.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.160
 I'm not going to tell you what they are today.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.000
 You can go to any other episode from our last 560 episodes.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.440
 Listen to the end and you will see

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.720
 all of our social media information there.

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.920
 Not much more to say.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.200
 Really hope you enjoyed the show.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.560
 We'll be back next week

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:38.480
 as the great man Andrew Hunter Murray once said, "Bye!"
