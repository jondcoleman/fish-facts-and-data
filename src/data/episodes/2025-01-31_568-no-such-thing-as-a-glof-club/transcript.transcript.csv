00:00:03,00:00:06,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish!"
00:00:06,00:00:08,"Well, what do we have for you today?"
00:00:08,00:00:12,"Well, it is the last of our little compilations!"
00:00:12,00:00:18,We put together all of the bits from the Australia and New Zealand parts of our tour.
00:00:18,00:00:20,Things that couldn't quite fit into the show.
00:00:20,00:00:22,Things where things went a little bit wrong.
00:00:22,00:00:25,Things where some naughty people in the audience might have shouted things out.
00:00:25,00:00:30,"And I put them all in this little compilation, which I really, really hope you enjoy."
00:00:30,00:00:34,I should just say that there will be one or two unfamiliar voices in this show.
00:00:34,00:00:38,"Well, not that unfamiliar really, because if you've listened to the last couple of episodes,"
00:00:38,00:00:39,you will know them.
00:00:39,00:00:44,"But Josh Thompson and Leon Buttons Kirkbeck, who both came in and saved the day when Andrew"
00:00:44,00:00:47,Hunter Murray unexpectedly had to go home for personal reasons.
00:00:47,00:00:50,They are both in these compilations at various points.
00:00:50,00:00:53,So don't be surprised when you hear their voices.
00:00:53,00:00:56,"If you have been missing the compilations, we used to put them out quite often, but"
00:00:56,00:00:57,they don't come here anymore.
00:00:57,00:01:00,They go on our Club Fish channel.
00:01:00,00:01:04,"And if you want to get those and all sorts of extra material that we do,"
00:01:04,00:01:10,then go to notionsthingsoffish.com/apple or notionsthingsoffish.com/patreon.
00:01:10,00:01:13,And you'll find all the information of how to get all that extra stuff there.
00:01:13,00:01:16,"Anyway, really hope you enjoy this show."
00:01:16,00:01:18,We will be back with an office episode.
00:01:18,00:01:23,For those of you who listen to this show to try and get to sleep and get quite annoyed
00:01:23,00:01:24,when we do live ones because they're too loud.
00:01:24,00:01:26,"Don't worry, we're back in the office next week."
00:01:26,00:01:28,So really hope you will enjoy those.
00:01:28,00:01:34,"But in the meantime, sit back, relax, enjoy our compilation special on With The Podcast."
00:01:48,00:01:53,"Starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:01:53,00:01:56,"Okay, my fact this week is that during World War I,"
00:01:56,00:02:02,a popular conspiracy theory was that German blackmailers had drawn up a list
00:02:02,00:02:07,"of 47,000 highly placed English perverts."
00:02:07,00:02:10,I spoke...
00:02:10,00:02:13,What? What was...
00:02:13,00:02:14,What's so funny about that?
00:02:14,00:02:18,It's just a funny photo.
00:02:19,00:02:21,[Laughter]
00:02:21,00:02:22,Sorry about that.
00:02:22,00:02:28,"Well, I don't know what happened there, but I'm sure you're going to the Tower of London."
00:02:28,00:02:32,"I think I'm in serious shit, actually, for what I just did, yeah."
00:02:32,00:02:38,"So this started back in 1965, and there was a journalist..."
00:02:38,00:02:39,Sorry?
00:02:39,00:02:42,"Did it, though?"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"Come on, I get enough shit from these three."
00:02:44,00:02:47,I don't need fucking Melbourne doing this.
00:02:47,00:02:50,"If we do that after every dubious thing Dan says, it's going to be a long night."
00:02:50,00:02:52,It's your own time you're wasting.
00:02:52,00:02:54,It's like the weirdest Panto edition.
00:02:54,00:02:57,"Did it, though?"
00:02:57,00:03:03,"He's behind you. Is he, though?"
00:03:03,00:03:13,You can simulate ants fighting by using other video games.
00:03:13,00:03:18,"So there's a video game called Age of Empire, where you get your army"
00:03:18,00:03:20,"and you fight against another army, right?"
00:03:20,00:03:23,"And you have a certain... You might have 10,000 of your crew..."
00:03:23,00:03:24,It's so much more complicated than that.
00:03:24,00:03:26,There's a lot of strategy that goes into... Sorry.
00:03:26,00:03:30,I just... It's a civilisation game. It's not a war game.
00:03:30,00:03:31,"All right, go on."
00:03:31,00:03:38,"I was going to say I didn't realise I was sat next to an expert, but..."
00:03:38,00:03:40,You should have guessed.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"I should have guessed, yeah."
00:03:41,00:03:44,"So let's say, for instance, you're in Australia."
00:03:44,00:03:47,You've got some Argentinian ants there and you don't want them there.
00:03:47,00:03:51,You want good old Australian ants in your Australian thing.
00:03:51,00:03:53,But the only way you're going to get rid of the Argentinian ones
00:03:53,00:03:56,is to get a load of Australian ants to attack them.
00:03:56,00:03:58,And the Australian ones are weedy and useless.
00:03:58,00:04:01,"And the Argentinian ones are strong, right?"
00:04:01,00:04:03,So you need to know how many you're going to need.
00:04:03,00:04:07,And you can use Age of Empire by giving them all different attributes
00:04:07,00:04:08,and firing them at each other.
00:04:08,00:04:11,And that gives you a really good simulation of how that will work in real life.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"Yeah, and they do this all the time."
00:04:13,00:04:15,Did they plan it? Did they build the game around ants?
00:04:15,00:04:21,Is it so like ants because it's based on ant warfare?
00:04:21,00:04:26,I only know this video game from seeing adverts on my Facebook.
00:04:26,00:04:27,But I think it's like...
00:04:27,00:04:31,It's like you've got loads and loads of your little characters
00:04:31,00:04:33,"and they're all fighting the other characters, right?"
00:04:33,00:04:34,But if you can make your...
00:04:34,00:04:37,"You can imagine that your characters are slightly weaker,"
00:04:37,00:04:38,but you've got twice as many.
00:04:38,00:04:40,You can see how many you're going to need to attack them.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"Okay, so ants make those calculations as well"
00:04:42,00:04:45,and work out how strong the opponent is.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"I'm not sure ants do,"
00:04:46,00:04:49,but the people who are putting ants into this situation...
00:04:49,00:04:50,Battle Royale.
00:04:50,00:04:55,I feel like I've either really jet lagged
00:04:55,00:04:56,"and not explained this very well,"
00:04:56,00:05:01,or possibly asleep and dreaming that I'm not doing this very well.
00:05:01,00:05:03,You're just talking to me who's never played a video game.
00:05:03,00:05:05,"Since actually playing the game Ants Age 10,"
00:05:05,00:05:06,which is fucking fantastic.
00:05:06,00:05:07,And you should have used the analogy.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"No, I'm thinking of worms."
00:05:10,00:05:11,Sorry.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Unbelievable.
00:05:12,00:05:16,What a guy.
00:05:16,00:05:17,What a guy.
00:05:17,00:05:18,Record.
00:05:18,00:05:21,He was like a lot of those kind of mathsy people.
00:05:21,00:05:23,He was in charge of the mint in England.
00:05:23,00:05:26,"The money thing, not the edible..."
00:05:26,00:05:26,The flavor.
00:05:26,00:05:29,Absolutely.
00:05:29,00:05:31,And then he was accused of siphoning money
00:05:31,00:05:33,off the profits made by the mint.
00:05:33,00:05:35,But it was basically because he was enemies
00:05:35,00:05:38,of this other guy called Earl of Pembroke.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"And the Earl of Pembroke was an Earl,"
00:05:41,00:05:42,and Robert Record wasn't.
00:05:42,00:05:43,He was just a Welsh guy.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"And so the Earl of Pembroke basically said,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"""Well, I'm going to accuse you of this,"
00:05:47,00:05:48,"and send you to prison."""
00:05:48,00:05:50,"Sends him to prison, and he died in prison."
00:05:50,00:05:50,Oh.
00:05:50,00:05:51,It's really bad.
00:05:51,00:05:53,"Yeah, Detta's prison, he was put into."
00:05:53,00:05:56,"And I think it was around the time of Queen Mary/Elizabeth,"
00:05:56,00:05:58,"and so lots of Catholic Protestant, Argy Bargy,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"and he was one of the victims of that, basically."
00:06:01,00:06:02,Detta's prison was some...
00:06:02,00:06:03,"I'm not saying it's the way you'd want to go,"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"but it sometimes wasn't terrible,"
00:06:05,00:06:06,depending who you were.
00:06:06,00:06:08,But you could have your own suite.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"There were bars and restaurants in Detta's prisons,"
00:06:10,00:06:13,"which if you could afford to use them, it's not bad, is it?"
00:06:13,00:06:14,Who could afford to use them?
00:06:14,00:06:16,You're in Detta's prison.
00:06:16,00:06:18,I promise I'm good for them.
00:06:18,00:06:20,Just put it on the tab.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Put it on the tab, it's fine."
00:06:21,00:06:23,That's surely how they bust you when you pay for your drink.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"Ah-ha, you do have money."
00:06:24,00:06:29,And Dickens' dad was in Detta's prison.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"Dickens used to visit and stay, basically."
00:06:31,00:06:34,"He decided he works in a workhouse,"
00:06:34,00:06:35,but the option was he could have stayed there.
00:06:35,00:06:37,"Yeah, your family often lived there."
00:06:37,00:06:38,"You were allowed to work, I think,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,to work off your debts from the prison.
00:06:40,00:06:43,"I read about a guy who gave Trumpet lessons from Detta's prison,"
00:06:43,00:06:44,which must have been incredibly annoying
00:06:44,00:06:45,if you were sharing his cell.
00:06:45,00:06:49,"I imagine not just a professional Trumpeter playing all day,"
00:06:49,00:06:50,"that would be fine,"
00:06:50,00:06:53,but someone giving Trumpet lessons in yourself
00:06:53,00:06:55,"to some 10-year-old who's, you know..."
00:06:55,00:06:57,"Well, you shouldn't have fucked up your finances, should you?"
00:06:57,00:06:57,"Yeah, true, yeah."
00:06:57,00:06:59,You didn't want to listen to an eight-year-old play Trumpet all day?
00:06:59,00:07:02,This one's interesting.
00:07:02,00:07:03,This was a 21-year-old man
00:07:03,00:07:05,"who, according to the database,"
00:07:05,00:07:09,was riding on a TV when he ran into a turkey
00:07:09,00:07:12,and lost control and then ran into a tree.
00:07:12,00:07:15,No more information supplied.
00:07:15,00:07:16,No needy.
00:07:16,00:07:18,Did TVs...
00:07:18,00:07:21,Did they have wheels on them in the old days?
00:07:21,00:07:22,"They might, do you?"
00:07:22,00:07:24,"But you don't take it outdoors, do you?"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"You're very ready to take a TV out, no."
00:07:26,00:07:27,But it's a Christmas...
00:07:27,00:07:30,Was it an ATV?
00:07:30,00:07:32,"Oh, we're getting a note from the audience"
00:07:32,00:07:35,"saying it was an ATV, potentially, an all-terrain vehicle."
00:07:35,00:07:37,"Yeah, there's a slight problem in..."
00:07:37,00:07:41,"So, thank you..."
00:07:41,00:07:41,Well...
00:07:41,00:07:42,It says...
00:07:42,00:07:46,"What, no, okay, so two points."
00:07:46,00:07:46,Thank you for...
00:07:46,00:07:47,Thank you for...
00:07:47,00:07:47,We're just...
00:07:47,00:07:49,We're going over to Dan for a rebuttal now.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"Yeah, so..."
00:07:50,00:07:55,"Firstly, it is spelled A, space, and then capital TV,"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"and then B, shut the fuck up, mate."
00:08:02,00:08:05,"Either that or we're going to need about 2,200 microphones"
00:08:05,00:08:06,for this podcast.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"I'm joking, obviously."
00:08:08,00:08:12,There's a lot of the kids' movies are very different
00:08:12,00:08:14,than the original stories.
00:08:14,00:08:15,The Little Mermaid is one.
00:08:15,00:08:18,"In the movie, she wants to become a human"
00:08:18,00:08:21,because she wants to get married to the prince or whatever.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"In the book, she wants to become a human"
00:08:24,00:08:26,because she wants to get to heaven.
00:08:26,00:08:28,"In the movie, she kind of gets her voice"
00:08:28,00:08:31,"magicked out of her so she can't speak,"
00:08:31,00:08:34,"and in the book, she has her tongue physically cut out."
00:08:34,00:08:35,Wow.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"And then in the end, she is given a dagger"
00:08:39,00:08:42,"to kill Eric, the human, and she refuses to do that,"
00:08:42,00:08:45,"and so commits suicide and drowns into the water,"
00:08:45,00:08:47,becoming sea foam.
00:08:47,00:08:48,Wow.
00:08:48,00:08:50,So why didn't Disney do that for a story?
00:08:50,00:08:51,Do we know?
00:08:51,00:08:54,"I don't know, because I also at home have a version"
00:08:54,00:08:58,"of the original Pinocchio, where he kills Jiminy Cricket,"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"has his feet burned off, and is hanged by villagers."
00:09:00,00:09:04,And they don't mention that in the Disney one either.
00:09:04,00:09:06,"Can you imagine when you're sitting down,"
00:09:06,00:09:08,"the Little Mermaid author, to say,"
00:09:08,00:09:10,"""We're very excited. We've bought the book."
00:09:10,00:09:13,"We've got a few changes to make to your plot."""
00:09:13,00:09:15,"And he's like, ""Okay."""
00:09:15,00:09:17,You've kept the cutting the tongue out.
00:09:17,00:09:18,"No, we haven't."
00:09:18,00:09:20,We have kept the Jamaican crab.
00:09:20,00:09:25,"Well, that's fine, go ahead."
00:09:25,00:09:28,"They found that all these people who are returning stuff,"
00:09:28,00:09:30,there's just obvious patterns.
00:09:30,00:09:32,So people who buy portable generators
00:09:32,00:09:33,"during weather emergencies,"
00:09:33,00:09:36,"they'll use them right until the emergency has ended,"
00:09:36,00:09:39,"and then all of those go back, just as huge amount goes back."
00:09:39,00:09:43,"Large TVs, a surge of returns."
00:09:43,00:09:44,"Sorry, what, when you say a TV."
00:09:44,00:09:44,Yeah.
00:09:44,00:09:51,"Well, I've now finished driving on all the terrains."
00:09:51,00:09:53,I can send this back.
00:09:53,00:09:56,There was a survey of children in 1942
00:09:56,00:09:59,that found lots of them didn't think bananas were real.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"Oh, come here."
00:10:01,00:10:02,I haven't seen them in a long time.
00:10:02,00:10:03,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:03,00:10:06,"And in the same year, a single banana was auctioned off"
00:10:06,00:10:08,"in Russell Square in London,"
00:10:08,00:10:11,and it sold for over 500 Australian dollars in today's money.
00:10:11,00:10:12,No.
00:10:12,00:10:13,For one banana.
00:10:13,00:10:14,Idiots.
00:10:14,00:10:18,I can't believe these guys won the war.
00:10:18,00:10:22,I need to move this on in a sec.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"Can I tell you very quickly, sort of,"
00:10:24,00:10:26,"""journalese"" is this, like, shorthand term"
00:10:26,00:10:28,for terms that get chucked into newspapers all the time.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yep.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"And there is a book about them called ""Romps, Tots and Boffins,"""
00:10:33,00:10:35,"which is by a writer called Robert Hutton,"
00:10:35,00:10:36,"which is all about specifically British,"
00:10:36,00:10:38,but I'm sure a lot of them apply around the world.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"And basically, just a few of the best terms."
00:10:40,00:10:44,Boo's fueled rampage is what vile thugs go on
00:10:44,00:10:46,to the dismay of revelers.
00:10:46,00:10:49,Budding is someone under 20 who's good at something.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"""Rushed"" is the only way anyone gets to hospital,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,typically after ambulances raced to the scene.
00:10:55,00:10:58,The best one.
00:10:58,00:11:00,A sex session is one or more bonks.
00:11:00,00:11:04,Very good.
00:11:04,00:11:07,I really enjoyed a news article I read from 1891
00:11:07,00:11:10,about a Christmas party accident that happened
00:11:10,00:11:12,"where it was in Michigan,"
00:11:12,00:11:14,"and there was a man who was dressed as Santa Claus,"
00:11:14,00:11:17,but he made his outfit entirely out of cotton wool.
00:11:17,00:11:18,He went to a costume party.
00:11:18,00:11:20,He bumped into a boy who was dressed as
00:11:20,00:11:21,"""We Really Winky"" or something,"
00:11:21,00:11:23,or a ghoul who was carrying a candle.
00:11:23,00:11:26,"So naturally, Father Christmas went up in flames,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,ran around in a total panic.
00:11:28,00:11:28,"As the article said,"
00:11:28,00:11:30,"he ran frantically about the saloon,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,setting fire to the costumes of all with whom he came into contact.
00:11:33,00:11:37,"All of whom then went on to rush wildly about the room,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,setting fire to other people they crashed into.
00:11:39,00:11:41,"Many of the guests of ""Saviriy have burned,"""
00:11:41,00:11:44,the guy dressed as Santa and a couple of others
00:11:44,00:11:45,may have succumbed to their injuries.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"So quite a mad catastrophe,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,but I just really liked the understatement of 1891
00:11:51,00:11:52,"where it said, ""For a short time,"
00:11:52,00:11:55,"it seemed likely to end in catastrophe."""
00:11:55,00:11:58,"Wow. That's a shame because what you should have done,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,"that Santa, because there's a stat that came out in 2006,"
00:12:01,00:12:05,which is that they surveyed hundreds of Santas
00:12:05,00:12:08,that were in malls and found that 34% of them
00:12:08,00:12:10,regularly were being urinated on by children.
00:12:10,00:12:13,That's what they said.
00:12:13,00:12:15,"So what he should have done was just found any kid,"
00:12:15,00:12:17,"pick them up, put himself out with, yeah."
00:12:17,00:12:21,"Toddlers make quite good football coaches, soccer coaches."
00:12:21,00:12:22,It turns out.
00:12:22,00:12:23,For what reason?
00:12:23,00:12:25,"Oh, I didn't read into that."
00:12:25,00:12:31,"No, they try to teach robot footballers how to play football,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,and they use the normal way of doing it.
00:12:33,00:12:36,They use geometric figures to tell them
00:12:36,00:12:38,which way to go and which way to run.
00:12:38,00:12:42,And then they found another lot where they showed them videos
00:12:42,00:12:44,of toddlers sort of wobbling around
00:12:44,00:12:45,and trying to walk themselves.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"And when they taught them how to walk like toddlers,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,"they were way, way better at football."
00:12:51,00:12:54,"So who was, sorry, who was way, way better?"
00:12:54,00:12:54,The robots.
00:12:54,00:12:55,The robots.
00:12:55,00:12:57,It's specifically for robots learning to play football.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Yeah.
00:12:58,00:12:59,You did sex that up a bit.
00:12:59,00:13:01,I was imagining a toddler on the sidelines
00:13:01,00:13:03,"in a football match saying, ""Get him, you blind bastards!"""
00:13:03,00:13:08,"Can we mention a bit about Ray Gunn quickly,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,because there's been news recently that she's...
00:13:10,00:13:12,"Oh, what?"
00:13:12,00:13:13,"Well, she stepped down right."
00:13:13,00:13:14,She's retired.
00:13:14,00:13:17,And I'm not into the bullying that she's got.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"And I have to say it's because I think,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,"particularly Australia, is brilliant"
00:13:22,00:13:24,when they create moments at the Olympics
00:13:24,00:13:26,that are different to any other country.
00:13:26,00:13:28,"I mean, this country is so good at embracing those moments."
00:13:28,00:13:30,"Stephen Bradbury, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:30,Come on.
00:13:30,00:13:34,Stephen Bradbury for listeners who don't know him
00:13:34,00:13:37,is the guy who was ice skating in a race.
00:13:37,00:13:39,Everyone fell down and he won the semi-final.
00:13:39,00:13:41,And then he made it to the final.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"And once again, everyone in front of him fell down."
00:13:43,00:13:45,"So basically, all Ray Gunn really needed"
00:13:45,00:13:48,was for everyone to fall down apart from her.
00:13:48,00:13:49,They needed to hit their neck.
00:13:49,00:13:51,But you're meant to fall down and break dancing.
00:13:51,00:13:52,That's where she went wrong.
00:13:52,00:13:55,Everyone failed to fall down apart from Ray Gunn.
00:13:55,00:13:58,"But Stephen Bradbury, he embraced it."
00:13:58,00:14:00,He goes around the country giving talks.
00:14:00,00:14:02,He... I saw this today.
00:14:02,00:14:05,He even has a line of beer called Last Man Standing.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"Like, the guy has stepped into it."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"Not Olympics, but another sports star."
00:14:10,00:14:12,"John Hapuate, right?"
00:14:12,00:14:13,John Hapuate.
00:14:13,00:14:14,Who's that?
00:14:14,00:14:18,He got caught putting his finger up people's anuses three times.
00:14:18,00:14:19,He's a rugby player.
00:14:19,00:14:19,He's a rugby player.
00:14:19,00:14:20,He's a rugby player.
00:14:20,00:14:22,There's the context that I need it.
00:14:22,00:14:25,He's not a 10-pin bowler.
00:14:25,00:14:31,"Yeah, he played for the West Tigers"
00:14:31,00:14:33,and it was three North Queensland Cowboy players
00:14:33,00:14:37,that he individually put his finger up at different times.
00:14:37,00:14:38,"Now, here's the thing."
00:14:38,00:14:39,"Big Storm, he goes off."
00:14:39,00:14:41,It's meant to be very embarrassing.
00:14:41,00:14:45,A mutual friend who was nameless had a drink with him recently
00:14:45,00:14:47,"and they said, ""Are you embarrassed about it?"""
00:14:47,00:14:48,"And he said, ""Embarrassed."""
00:14:48,00:14:51,And he picked up his phone and the shot on his phone
00:14:51,00:14:54,that is the screensaver was his finger up someone's ass.
00:14:54,00:14:59,Australians fucking embrace this stuff.
00:14:59,00:15:02,"And so, I think Ray Gunn needs to get back on the horse."
00:15:02,00:15:05,You're not allowed horses.
00:15:07,00:15:10,"But what's called dressage, isn't it?"
00:15:10,00:15:12,What is dressage if not horse break dancing?
00:15:12,00:15:15,"Thank you, Andy."
00:15:15,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:22,Welcome back.
00:15:22,00:15:23,"Wow, Anna, fuck."
00:15:23,00:15:28,It just wasn't enough to quite get me through.
00:15:28,00:15:30,Not that this hasn't been a delight.
00:15:30,00:15:32,I don't need wine to get through it.
00:15:32,00:15:36,It's just there was some pretty big political news day
00:15:36,00:15:37,and she's celebrating.
00:15:37,00:15:45,James went to Australia Zoo today.
00:15:45,00:15:47,You went to Steve Irwin's zoo.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Why is that funny?
00:15:48,00:15:50,Open mockery.
00:15:50,00:15:52,Is that funny going to that zoo?
00:15:52,00:15:54,"Oh, it's a classic."
00:15:54,00:15:55,It's Steve Irwin's.
00:15:55,00:16:00,But it was bold going when we had a show tonight
00:16:00,00:16:02,and you woke up later.
00:16:02,00:16:03,There was a non-zero chance
00:16:03,00:16:06,that I was going to be stuck an hour and a half away.
00:16:07,00:16:08,In a crocodile's mouth.
00:16:08,00:16:12,I've actually got James bought me a present
00:16:12,00:16:15,from Australia Zoo and this is so special
00:16:15,00:16:18,because I think it's quite possibly
00:16:18,00:16:20,the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
00:16:20,00:16:22,I wanted to buy him something
00:16:22,00:16:24,that he would love and his wife would hate.
00:16:24,00:16:30,It's a commemorative plate of Steve Irwin and someone else.
00:16:30,00:16:32,"If you can't see it at the back, lucky you."
00:16:35,00:16:37,But it is crockery.
00:16:37,00:16:40,"Oh, come on."
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Yeah, that's true."
00:16:41,00:16:46,"Yeah, all right."
00:16:46,00:16:48,And he also got me some socks.
00:16:48,00:16:49,"Oh, my God."
00:16:49,00:16:51,"Oh, sogadiles."
00:16:51,00:16:54,"It's not as good as crockery, is it?"
00:16:54,00:16:57,I should have left that in the bag.
00:16:57,00:17:01,"All right, well, let's press on before that one joke"
00:17:01,00:17:02,stinks up this whole room.
00:17:04,00:17:06,Do you know what the Spanish word trampolín means?
00:17:06,00:17:10,It's the... It's the eardrum.
00:17:10,00:17:11,No. No?
00:17:11,00:17:12,"Okay, is it not trampolín?"
00:17:12,00:17:13,It's not trampolín.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"Oh, my goodness. Okay, okay."
00:17:14,00:17:17,It's a Spanish word for diving board.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Wait, I'll get it. I'll get it."
00:17:18,00:17:22,Spanish word for diving board.
00:17:22,00:17:23,"I can edit this, right?"
00:17:23,00:17:27,So something springy.
00:17:27,00:17:27,Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:29,So you jump up and down.
00:17:29,00:17:31,I wonder what a diving board is.
00:17:31,00:17:32,"Oh, someone in the audience got it."
00:17:32,00:17:33,Pollocks!
00:17:33,00:17:36,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:36,00:17:39,"And the reason being that the people who invented the trampolín,"
00:17:39,00:17:42,"as we would know it, were inspired by the diving board,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,and they use the Spanish word for diving board.
00:17:45,00:17:46,"So that's the original, if you say it,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,that a proper trampolín is actually a diving board.
00:17:48,00:17:49,Really should be.
00:17:49,00:17:50,Right.
00:17:50,00:17:50,Yeah.
00:17:50,00:17:51,That's very cool.
00:17:51,00:17:53,So they think it's fucking weird that none of our trampolins have water.
00:17:53,00:17:58,And they all break their legs when they try and jump off them.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"Can I say, and I apologize in advance to Andy,"
00:18:01,00:18:02,"because this is a fact of yours,"
00:18:03,00:18:04,"that we've never mentioned on the show,"
00:18:04,00:18:05,but I love it so much.
00:18:05,00:18:08,"Rivalries are often between siblings as well, right?"
00:18:08,00:18:11,"And sometimes siblings we see, like Serena and Venus,"
00:18:11,00:18:12,"they make it into sports,"
00:18:12,00:18:14,and they're always paired off against each other.
00:18:14,00:18:16,Who is the more popular one?
00:18:16,00:18:18,"But there's a really great fact that Andy told us,"
00:18:18,00:18:23,"which is that in NHL, in ice hockey,"
00:18:23,00:18:26,"there is a record for the most points combined,"
00:18:26,00:18:30,"scored by two brothers ever in NHL history,"
00:18:30,00:18:32,"and that is by the Gretzky brothers,"
00:18:32,00:18:34,"Wayne Gretzky and Brett Gretzky,"
00:18:34,00:18:42,"that combined, they have had 2,861 points, goals between them."
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Huge, massive."
00:18:43,00:18:46,"280, 57 them."
00:18:46,00:18:47,Say that again.
00:18:47,00:18:48,280.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"2,000."
00:18:49,00:18:50,Sorry.
00:18:50,00:18:55,This is why I should let Andy do his own facts.
00:18:55,00:18:58,"2,861 is the total."
00:18:58,00:19:00,Is the total between them.
00:19:00,00:19:03,"2,857 of those were scored by Wayne,"
00:19:03,00:19:06,and four were scored by Brent.
00:19:06,00:19:11,It's a horrible thing.
00:19:11,00:19:11,Yeah.
00:19:11,00:19:13,But Brett's such a nice guy.
00:19:13,00:19:14,"Oh, he's a dude."
00:19:14,00:19:15,"He loves the setup too, yeah."
00:19:15,00:19:18,"Oh my god, guys, I've just had a vision of something."
00:19:18,00:19:20,Has anyone ever made this connection?
00:19:20,00:19:23,"The word golf, the O is the ball,"
00:19:23,00:19:28,"the L is the putter, the F is the flag,"
00:19:28,00:19:30,and the G looks like someone bent over
00:19:30,00:19:32,who's about to hit a golf ball.
00:19:32,00:19:34,That's actually quite good.
00:19:34,00:19:35,What the fuck?
00:19:35,00:19:41,That's actually the first thing
00:19:41,00:19:43,you've ever genuinely blown wide open.
00:19:43,00:19:44,That is good.
00:19:44,00:19:45,That just came to me.
00:19:45,00:19:48,"I think like you need,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,the golfer needs to be holding the club
00:19:50,00:19:51,"and then hissing the ball,"
00:19:51,00:19:52,so it needs to be golf.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"We should petition to rename the club,"
00:19:56,00:19:57,setting up your golf club.
00:19:57,00:19:58,Yeah.
00:19:58,00:20:03,"Hey, can you guys think if there's a job"
00:20:03,00:20:07,"that a banana would cause huge problems for you,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,"put you in danger, what is that job?"
00:20:08,00:20:10,What?
00:20:10,00:20:13,Let's imagine you're going to work.
00:20:13,00:20:13,You're going to work.
00:20:13,00:20:14,"Oh, you slip over."
00:20:14,00:20:15,So you work.
00:20:15,00:20:16,I've got one.
00:20:16,00:20:17,Yeah.
00:20:17,00:20:20,"They are very, very, very, very slightly radioactive."
00:20:20,00:20:25,So maybe if you are someone who's looking for bums
00:20:25,00:20:27,"and somewhat you've got your,"
00:20:27,00:20:28,I don't know where I'm going with this.
00:20:28,00:20:29,"Yeah, you're going to count as always going off"
00:20:29,00:20:31,"and you're like, guys, guys, I've got another one."
00:20:31,00:20:32,"I've got, oh, no, I haven't got another one."
00:20:32,00:20:33,"No, I've just got my lunch."
00:20:33,00:20:34,Yeah.
00:20:34,00:20:36,"Banana bob again, the false alarms."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"And then it's like cry wolf,"
00:20:37,00:20:38,"because when you do find the bomb,"
00:20:38,00:20:39,no one believes you.
00:20:39,00:20:40,Yeah.
00:20:40,00:20:41,And the terrorists have worked out
00:20:41,00:20:43,to paint the bomb to look like a banana
00:20:43,00:20:44,and put it in Bob's pocket.
00:20:44,00:20:46,"Is that the answer, Dan?"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"Yeah, you got it in one."
00:20:48,00:20:48,That's amazing.
00:20:48,00:20:52,"No, the answer is if you're a beekeeper."
00:20:52,00:20:54,It sends them nuts.
00:20:54,00:20:56,The smell of it releases this pheromone
00:20:56,00:20:57,that makes them want to attack.
00:20:57,00:20:59,So beekeepers are always advised
00:20:59,00:21:01,"if you're about to go to work,"
00:21:01,00:21:02,"don't have a banana for breakfast,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,because if you're near the hive
00:21:04,00:21:06,"and you breathe and they smell your banana breath,"
00:21:06,00:21:07,they're going to come and attack you.
00:21:07,00:21:09,There's reports of beekeepers
00:21:09,00:21:12,"who are sort of like 10, 15 meters away"
00:21:12,00:21:14,who decide to have a cheeky banana
00:21:14,00:21:15,before doing their job.
00:21:15,00:21:17,And suddenly they're being chased
00:21:17,00:21:19,by all the bees from the hive
00:21:19,00:21:21,who believe that they're being attacked.
00:21:21,00:21:22,So they're attacking back.
00:21:22,00:21:25,You know what? I was in Australia Zoo this afternoon.
00:21:25,00:21:28,"That's not funny, guys."
00:21:28,00:21:34,And it said there that the Komodo dragon
00:21:34,00:21:36,can smell its dinner from 11 kilometers away.
00:21:36,00:21:38,No.
00:21:38,00:21:38,What?
00:21:38,00:21:39,It must be true.
00:21:39,00:21:41,It said it in Australia Zoo.
00:21:41,00:21:42,Really?
00:21:42,00:21:42,Yeah.
00:21:42,00:21:45,It's because they use the tongs.
00:21:45,00:21:46,They kind of stick the tongs out
00:21:46,00:21:50,and they can taste some food from 11 kilometers away.
00:21:50,00:21:51,What the hell is the point in that?
00:21:51,00:21:52,They're very slow walkers.
00:21:52,00:21:54,That's going to take them two days to walk.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"Yeah, that's right."
00:21:55,00:21:57,They stick their forked tongs out.
00:21:57,00:21:59,And I think we mentioned this on the show.
00:21:59,00:22:01,They eat things that are so large
00:22:01,00:22:03,but they digest so slowly
00:22:03,00:22:05,that they need to get the full thing in their mouth
00:22:05,00:22:08,quite quickly to start that whole process.
00:22:08,00:22:09,So what they'll often do
00:22:09,00:22:12,"is if half an animal is sticking outside of their mouth,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,they will ram themselves into a tree
00:22:14,00:22:16,so to knock it further down their throat.
00:22:16,00:22:20,Just be like trying to get a nail in it the other way.
00:22:20,00:22:22,I know people who eat like that.
00:22:22,00:22:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:26,00:22:27,No one's pointing fingers.
00:22:27,00:22:32,Can I tell you about one rivalry that happened this year?
00:22:32,00:22:32,Yeah.
00:22:32,00:22:34,"A very, very bad rivalry."
00:22:34,00:22:36,The annual fat bear week.
00:22:36,00:22:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:22:37,00:22:38,Okay.
00:22:38,00:22:40,Different bears are pitted against each other
00:22:40,00:22:41,and they're sort of assessed to see
00:22:41,00:22:43,how much weight they can gain over the feeding-up season.
00:22:43,00:22:44,It was delayed this year
00:22:44,00:22:46,after one of the contestants killed another bear.
00:22:46,00:22:48,Oh.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Bear 469 killed and, I don't know,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,may have eaten Bear 402.
00:22:51,00:22:52,That is cheating.
00:22:52,00:22:53,That is cheating.
00:22:53,00:22:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:54,00:22:57,"Eventually, the winner is just one in all as bear, isn't it?"
00:22:57,00:22:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Yeah, there you go."
00:23:00,00:23:01,"Do you know that when he died,"
00:23:01,00:23:02,"so he was stuffed, wasn't he?"
00:23:02,00:23:05,He was taxidermied to be laid in state.
00:23:05,00:23:08,I think probably preserved rather than stuffed.
00:23:08,00:23:08,They didn't.
00:23:08,00:23:09,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:09,00:23:10,I don't know.
00:23:10,00:23:11,I don't know.
00:23:11,00:23:12,I'm guessing.
00:23:12,00:23:14,I think he was pretty stuffed at the end.
00:23:14,00:23:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:15,00:23:16,"He was, okay, yeah."
00:23:16,00:23:18,Maybe there's other terms.
00:23:18,00:23:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:18,00:23:19,Tomato.
00:23:19,00:23:20,Tomato.
00:23:20,00:23:20,Embarmed.
00:23:20,00:23:21,Embarmed?
00:23:21,00:23:21,He was embarmed.
00:23:21,00:23:22,Yeah.
00:23:22,00:23:23,He was embarmed.
00:23:23,00:23:23,Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"I just, he was stuffed by the exact same guy."
00:23:26,00:23:29,"I mean, the taxidermist looking out of the window"
00:23:29,00:23:32,halfway through working on a particularly tricky squirrel.
00:23:32,00:23:32,Oh my God.
00:23:32,00:23:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:34,00:23:35,Clear the dex.
00:23:35,00:23:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:35,00:23:39,"Anyway, the same guy who did Chairman Mao did him."
00:23:39,00:23:40,"No, yeah."
00:23:40,00:23:42,So we talked about the history of mini golf.
00:23:42,00:23:42,"Yeah, let's go for it."
00:23:42,00:23:44,"Slash Crazy Golf, which I'm going to call it,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,"because as discussed, it's more fun."
00:23:46,00:23:50,But Garnet Carter seems to be the king of Crazy Golf.
00:23:50,00:23:52,So some people made some little mini golf courses
00:23:52,00:23:54,in their back gardens beforehand with fun stuff in it.
00:23:54,00:23:58,"But Garnet Carter, 1926, made a Tom Thumb golf course,"
00:23:58,00:24:00,and he put lots of elaborate obstacles in it.
00:24:00,00:24:03,It was in a hotel that I think he owned in America.
00:24:03,00:24:05,And he painted it within three years
00:24:05,00:24:07,of him making that one course.
00:24:07,00:24:10,"There were 25,000 Tom Thumb courses in the US."
00:24:10,00:24:11,There was a song about him.
00:24:11,00:24:12,It was so famous.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"There was a national tournament with a $2,000 prize,"
00:24:14,00:24:16,which was like a billion dollars back then.
00:24:16,00:24:20,"And so he did very, very well."
00:24:20,00:24:22,1926 to 1929.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"1929, bad year for America."
00:24:24,00:24:26,His fortune wiped out along with everyone else's.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"And he rebuilt it because his wife had a little garden,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,or a little rock garden that she'd made.
00:24:32,00:24:36,And he basically employed someone called Clark Byers
00:24:36,00:24:40,"to spend 30 years painting the words ""see rock city"""
00:24:40,00:24:44,in massive letters on all the sheds of America
00:24:44,00:24:45,"so that when you were flying over it,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,you saw it and you went and visited
00:24:47,00:24:49,his wife's little rock garden.
00:24:49,00:24:51,And it became one of the biggest tourist attractions
00:24:51,00:24:52,in America.
00:24:52,00:24:53,Wow.
00:24:53,00:24:54,Tens of thousands of people went to visit.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"His poor wife, who was just having some quiet time"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"in her rock garden, was descended on."
00:24:59,00:25:02,And there are still these barn roofs all over America
00:25:02,00:25:03,"that's, oh, there were like 20 years ago,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"they might have been rubbed off,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"just saying ""see rock city""."
00:25:06,00:25:07,That's amazing.
00:25:07,00:25:08,Isn't that incredible?
00:25:08,00:25:08,Love it.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"So, you know, you can make something out of nothing."
00:25:11,00:25:13,"As we are, living evidence of, of course, great."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"Okay, so what about food waste?"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"That's a big problem, isn't it?"
00:25:19,00:25:19,Yep.
00:25:19,00:25:20,Yeah.
00:25:20,00:25:25,"In Australia, you discard 3.1 million tons of food every year"
00:25:25,00:25:29,"that includes five million bananas,"
00:25:29,00:25:32,which if laid end to end would go from Sydney to Melbourne.
00:25:32,00:25:35,Okay.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Shame on you.
00:25:36,00:25:37,"It's not a better use for them, do you think?"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"It would be quite funny,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,but anyone walking and slipping all the way.
00:25:45,00:25:47,Can I say something about modern photographs?
00:25:47,00:25:47,Yeah.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:50,Which I just think is very interesting.
00:25:50,00:25:51,"It's about photographs on Facebook,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,which is a form of social media.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"And there was, in 2011,"
00:25:56,00:26:01,Yeah.
00:26:01,00:26:03,"2011, Facebook became a big vehicle"
00:26:03,00:26:05,for people posting up their photos.
00:26:05,00:26:06,"In 2011, it became that, did it?"
00:26:06,00:26:11,"It suddenly, a lot of people had it even before that."
00:26:11,00:26:12,But in...
00:26:12,00:26:14,"Wow, God, they were freaky earlier."
00:26:14,00:26:15,"Adopters, weren't they?"
00:26:15,00:26:16,Exactly.
00:26:16,00:26:19,Not just any trials at the time.
00:26:19,00:26:20,"Yeah, go on."
00:26:20,00:26:22,Facebook gave people the ability to flag photos
00:26:22,00:26:23,as offensive or whatever.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Loads of people flag photos that seemed innocuous,"
00:26:25,00:26:26,saying they were offensive.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"So Facebook did a little survey, some questionnaires,"
00:26:28,00:26:31,"and said, ""Why did you people find these particular photos offensive?"""
00:26:31,00:26:32,And realized they were all photos
00:26:32,00:26:34,where the person thought they looked too drunk
00:26:34,00:26:36,or stupid or ugly or fat or whatever.
00:26:36,00:26:40,So they added an option that you can check.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"And obviously, as someone who's never done on Facebook,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,I actually don't know if this is incredibly well known
00:26:43,00:26:43,"that it's there,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"but you could check an option when you flagged it,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"saying, ""It makes me feel embarrassed"
00:26:48,00:26:50,"as your reason for flagging it."""
00:26:50,00:26:51,"And when they added that option,"
00:26:51,00:26:55,"one-third of people still chose other,"
00:26:55,00:26:56,"and most of them wrote underneath,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"""It's embarrassing."""
00:26:58,00:27:03,Because it makes me feel embarrassed...
00:27:03,00:27:04,"Well, we don't know why,"
00:27:04,00:27:05,but they obviously mean the same thing.
00:27:05,00:27:08,"But it makes me feel embarrassed is,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,"like, the problem is you,"
00:27:10,00:27:11,where we're saying it's embarrassing.
00:27:11,00:27:13,"Actually, it's objectively embarrassing."
00:27:13,00:27:14,It has to do with me.
00:27:14,00:27:18,It has to do with this photo of me drinking from a hat.
00:27:18,00:27:19,I'm not the problem.
00:27:19,00:27:21,Whoever looks like this is the problem.
00:27:21,00:27:24,That's very funny.
00:27:24,00:27:27,"I was looking at concealing messages within text,"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"which is what this is,"
00:27:29,00:27:31,which is called steganography.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"And, A, I found the etymology of that quite interesting."
00:27:34,00:27:35,So steganography is the idea of...
00:27:35,00:27:38,"Rather than other forms of code,"
00:27:38,00:27:41,which is like when you've written in code
00:27:41,00:27:42,"that no one can unscramble,"
00:27:42,00:27:43,it's basically sending a message
00:27:43,00:27:45,"that you can't even tell is code,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,"unless you're the recipient,"
00:27:46,00:27:50,"and you know what to look for, like, you know, an acrostic."
00:27:50,00:27:52,"So it comes from the Greek stege,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,meaning a covering or roof.
00:27:54,00:27:54,"And I just like that,"
00:27:54,00:27:59,because it's the same as stegosaurus from when we initially thought.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Do you remember that, you know, the triangles that stick up on..."
00:28:01,00:28:02,The plates.
00:28:02,00:28:04,"The plates, thank you."
00:28:04,00:28:05,That's what you should call them.
00:28:05,00:28:07,"The plates that stick up on a stegosaurus's back,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,they used to think that they were lying down
00:28:10,00:28:12,"and interlocking like a ceiling,"
00:28:12,00:28:14,which is why they called it the stegosaurus.
00:28:14,00:28:16,"Anyway, that's where steganography comes from."
00:28:16,00:28:16,"Okay, cool."
00:28:16,00:28:20,And one steganography technique
00:28:20,00:28:23,"is that in ancient China,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,"people would write secret messages on fine silk,"
00:28:26,00:28:27,"and all we know from the sources,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,"and there are multiple sources that reported it,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,which was then scrunched up into a tiny ball
00:28:32,00:28:34,"and covered in wax,"
00:28:34,00:28:37,"and then the messenger would swallow the ball of wax,"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"and then the paper I was reading about this in says,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,"""There are quite a few sources that mention this technique,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,but no one mentions how the ball of wax
00:28:43,00:28:45,"was recovered from the messenger."""
00:28:45,00:28:48,So that is to be left to the imagination.
00:28:48,00:28:51,I can't think of any good way that it comes back out.
00:28:51,00:28:57,"In 2010, a New York man had his girlfriend's name tattooed onto his lip,"
00:28:57,00:29:01,"and then in 2013, they split up."
00:29:01,00:29:03,Bit of a shame.
00:29:03,00:29:05,"And then in 2014, he was fired"
00:29:05,00:29:07,because his ex-girlfriend was called Isis.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Oh, no."
00:29:11,00:29:11,Okay.
00:29:11,00:29:14,I think that's not fair.
00:29:14,00:29:16,I actually think that's really unfair.
00:29:16,00:29:17,I think you should be able to have a name badge
00:29:17,00:29:18,that explains the situation.
00:29:18,00:29:22,"Well, he could have tattooed on his upper lip, maybe, just saying."
00:29:22,00:29:24,Here's what happened.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"There was an account by a tattooist in Vice who said,"
00:29:26,00:29:28,"""This guy came in and got a collar rocker"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"of the name Vanessa across his chest."""
00:29:30,00:29:32,"I got a what, sorry?"
00:29:32,00:29:32,Collar rocker?
00:29:32,00:29:33,I don't know either.
00:29:33,00:29:38,I like the way you confidently said it.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"Bluff, then retreat."
00:29:40,00:29:44,"Um, about midway through, I asked if Vanessa was his girlfriend"
00:29:44,00:29:47,"or his mum, to which he replied it was his ex's name,"
00:29:47,00:29:50,and he was getting it inked in an effort to woo her back.
00:29:50,00:29:54,"If I had known, I wouldn't have started."
00:29:54,00:29:56,"And suffice to say, when I saw the guy about six months later,"
00:29:56,00:29:57,he was still single.
00:29:57,00:30:01,What doesn't exist in the Coronation Street universe?
00:30:01,00:30:04,The most famous moment in his career was when he went electric.
00:30:04,00:30:06,He was a folk guitarist.
00:30:06,00:30:08,He'd put in some amps and he'd gotten electric guitar.
00:30:08,00:30:12,It happened at a very famous Newport Folk Festival in 1965.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Huge controversy.
00:30:13,00:30:15,"No longer seems very controversial, but fine, whatever."
00:30:15,00:30:19,You were expecting the ooh from the audience that year.
00:30:19,00:30:20,That news is broken.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"But in Coronation Street, this is very interesting."
00:30:23,00:30:28,"Ken Barlow, canonically, was present at the 1965 gig of Bob Dylan's"
00:30:28,00:30:29,in Manchester and heckled Bob Dylan.
00:30:29,00:30:31,He's the guy who yells Judas?
00:30:31,00:30:33,That's not Ken Barlow from Coronation Street.
00:30:33,00:30:37,"The guy who hit you, shouted Judas was a real person."
00:30:37,00:30:39,"Ken Barlow is a character in Coronation Street,"
00:30:39,00:30:42,of which Bob Dylan is a fan.
00:30:42,00:30:45,So what I'm saying is Bob watches a show in which he exists.
00:30:45,00:30:46,Bob Dylan exists in the Coronation Street universe.
00:30:46,00:30:48,I understood everything.
00:30:48,00:30:51,"But it could have been, it could have been that Corey had written"
00:30:51,00:30:52,into their plot for Ken Barlow.
00:30:52,00:30:54,It was the famous guy who shouted to you.
00:30:54,00:30:55,"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
00:30:55,00:30:58,"No, but thank you for that absolute patronising breakdown."
00:30:58,00:30:59,I'm sorry.
00:30:59,00:31:01,I didn't understand.
00:31:01,00:31:04,"You've got to know when to patronise down and when not to, Andy."
00:31:04,00:31:05,"I'm not cool, man."
00:31:05,00:31:06,"Oh, no."
00:31:06,00:31:10,"Do you guys know, do you eat grape or a lot?"
00:31:10,00:31:13,"Not many, but it's really popular."
00:31:13,00:31:15,And it was very popular in Maori culture.
00:31:15,00:31:17,And in Maori it's called hapuku.
00:31:17,00:31:19,And it's so common amongst Maori.
00:31:19,00:31:20,Go on.
00:31:20,00:31:22,Thank you very much.
00:31:22,00:31:23,That'll be great for the edit.
00:31:23,00:31:26,"But just in case, why don't you say hapukka?"
00:31:26,00:31:29,"Yeah, I'm not going to leave it to this person."
00:31:29,00:31:30,"They're not on, Mike."
00:31:30,00:31:33,In Maori it's called hapukka.
00:31:34,00:31:38,"It's not going to work with the noise, is it?"
00:31:38,00:31:39,Right.
00:31:39,00:31:42,So I was sitting in a room today in New Zealand
00:31:42,00:31:46,and a guy randomly overheard me talking about this called Wade.
00:31:46,00:31:47,"And he came over and he said,"
00:31:47,00:31:51,"""My grandfather is an example of non-determinism."""
00:31:51,00:31:55,"And so as a result, he then pulled out two unpublished books that he's written,"
00:31:55,00:31:58,which are all about characters that have names that are relevant to what they do.
00:31:58,00:32:01,"So one story was about someone called Robin Banks,"
00:32:01,00:32:07,"who was robbing banks, who had to get in the car for a getaway driver who's called Joyrider,"
00:32:07,00:32:12,"and they bump into a man and bounce off him on the way to get away, who's called Rick O'Shea."
00:32:12,00:32:14,And it sounds incredible.
00:32:14,00:32:15,He hasn't published it yet.
00:32:15,00:32:17,He's got a working title on it.
00:32:17,00:32:18,"So I think he's working on an actual title,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,"but the moment it's called,"
00:32:19,00:32:22,"""The place where the names of the people are the things they do."""
00:32:22,00:32:29,"And that's Wade Beebe, if any, if any publishers are listening in."
00:32:29,00:32:30,"My wife publishes kids' books,"
00:32:30,00:32:32,"but no, she's busy, Wade."
00:32:32,00:32:36,This is such bullshit.
00:32:36,00:32:37,This kind of thing just happens to you.
00:32:37,00:32:42,"The three of us slave away for days on end, staring at computer screens."
00:32:42,00:32:46,You loiter in a pub for a while and someone comes up to you and tells you this stuff.
00:32:46,00:32:56,"It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:32:56,00:33:01,My fact this week is that Ray Bradbury's 451 Fahrenheit
00:33:01,00:33:06,"has been translated into over 30 languages under the same title,"
00:33:06,00:33:12,"except in Denmark, where it was published as 233 Celsius."
00:33:12,00:33:16,I should have said 451 Fahrenheit.
00:33:16,00:33:19,"Do you know, I think you should have said Fahrenheit 451, which is what I..."
00:33:19,00:33:21,"Because that's the title, that's the actual title."
00:33:21,00:33:28,"I'm really kind of hoping that you say it clean in the next 15 minutes, so that I can edit it in."
00:33:28,00:33:33,Wow. So here's a picture of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.
00:33:33,00:33:35,Crisp.
00:33:35,00:33:37,Hopefully that works.
00:33:37,00:33:42,"There was a time in Soviet Russia where they did away with the conductors,"
00:33:42,00:33:47,in a non-hierarchical communist society where everyone's equal.
00:33:47,00:33:51,You don't need one person at the front who's like lording it over everyone else.
00:33:51,00:33:57,Is it at the same time that there are all of the aeroplane crashes on the tarmac at the airports
00:33:57,00:34:04,"in Soviet Russia because they decide to do away with the guy, because they're like, no, we don't know."
00:34:04,00:34:10,"Buttons, this is a podcast, so when your punchline involves no words and movement,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,if you could help the audience at home.
00:34:13,00:34:18,If only you did another podcast to give you the sort of professional experience you need.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"Hey, actually, speaking of that, there is another podcast."
00:34:21,00:34:25,"I mean, we don't usually like people bringing out their phones in a performance like this,"
00:34:25,00:34:28,"but I encourage you to bring out your phone, go to Spotify."
00:34:28,00:34:30,What?
00:34:30,00:34:33,There's a little podcast you should look up called The Cryptid Factor.
00:34:33,00:34:34,What are you talking about?
00:34:34,00:34:35,Never heard of it.
00:34:35,00:34:39,"I'm just, you mentioned it, and I wasn't going to."
00:34:40,00:34:44,"Well, I think you guys have talked before about how a sauerkraut was renamed Liberty Cabbage,"
00:34:44,00:34:47,and German measles became Liberty Measles.
00:34:47,00:34:52,"But we had a case in New Zealand as well, you got like, I think you call it luncheon sausage."
00:34:52,00:34:54,What?
00:34:54,00:34:55,Do you know what luncheon sausage is?
00:34:55,00:35:01,"Yeah, like a processed roll of meat, sort of like dog roll, but you might eat it."
00:35:01,00:35:02,Like a hot dog thing?
00:35:02,00:35:03,"No, no, no, no."
00:35:03,00:35:04,Like bologna.
00:35:04,00:35:07,Big old roll of hot dog meat that is sliced.
00:35:07,00:35:07,"Oh, okay."
00:35:07,00:35:08,We just don't eat that.
00:35:08,00:35:11,"Yeah, well, look, you're missing out, mate."
00:35:11,00:35:16,"In Australia it's called Devon Meat, but in New Zealand it used to be called German sausage,"
00:35:16,00:35:18,but we renamed it to Belgium.
00:35:18,00:35:22,But only in the South Island.
00:35:22,00:35:23,Do you guys know what Belgium is?
00:35:23,00:35:26,No one else in the world will understand this.
00:35:26,00:35:30,Was that in the war or just recently?
00:35:30,00:35:32,We're not insane.
00:35:32,00:35:35,It was recent.
00:35:36,00:35:36,And rare.
00:35:36,00:35:46,Aliens.
00:35:46,00:35:48,"Oh, God."
00:35:48,00:35:50,"No, stay with me."
00:35:50,00:35:52,"Yes, stay with me."
00:35:52,00:35:59,Aliens are more likely to be us time traveling back from the distant future than they are
00:35:59,00:36:01,to be little creatures from another planet.
00:36:01,00:36:02,Okay.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Are they not?
00:36:03,00:36:07,"Buttons, can I just quickly ask, you have had this theory for a long time,"
00:36:07,00:36:11,"and I know for a fact that you've said it on a bunch of shows,"
00:36:11,00:36:16,"but you did get one amazing opportunity to tell Neil deGrasse Tyson recently, your theory."
00:36:16,00:36:18,How did he take it?
00:36:18,00:36:25,Worst security called quite briefly.
00:36:25,00:36:30,I believe the exact words were get the fuck out of my face.
00:36:33,00:36:34,"Okay, audience."
00:36:34,00:36:38,"One, two, three, get the fuck out of my face."
00:36:38,00:36:44,"Again, obviously, there's always going to be paranoia about whoever is the enemy."
00:36:44,00:36:48,"And the Germans in World War I were very paranoid about the countries they invaded,"
00:36:48,00:36:51,"the people in those countries, what were they plotting."
00:36:51,00:36:55,"And when they went into Belgium, there were lots of stories that Belgian children"
00:36:55,00:36:56,were going to do bad things to them.
00:36:56,00:37:01,So there were all these rumors that little Belgian girls were coming and cutting off
00:37:01,00:37:05,the earlobes in the upper parts of the ears of injured Germans and stashing them.
00:37:05,00:37:09,And the little Belgian boys were coming and gouging out their eyes
00:37:09,00:37:10,and putting them in churches.
00:37:10,00:37:14,"So there were churches in Belgium filled with soldiers, removed eyes."
00:37:14,00:37:15,None of it was true.
00:37:15,00:37:16,There weren't 12-year-old girls.
00:37:16,00:37:18,Might want to rethink your sausage.
00:37:18,00:37:25,"Well, I think that's what it was made from, just ears and eyeballs."
00:37:25,00:37:32,This is a study that was done by Metropolis Metropolitan Life Insurance.
00:37:32,00:37:38,Metropolitan.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"See, do you want to have a go at it?"
00:37:40,00:37:42,What's it like when you two are just doing it?
00:37:42,00:37:45,Is this what your other podcast like?
00:37:45,00:37:55,"I do have to say, after 10 years, how many podcasts is no such thing as a fish town?"
00:37:55,00:37:56,Five hundred.
00:37:56,00:37:57,Five hundred plus apps.
00:37:57,00:38:04,"With Crypto Factor, 15 years, we just celebrated the other day our 100th episode."
00:38:04,00:38:12,Because it takes us really long to form sentences.
00:38:12,00:38:15,"Hey buttons, buttons."
00:38:15,00:38:16,I remember that study.
00:38:16,00:38:18,Wasn't it from Metropolitan University?
00:38:18,00:38:19,"Oh, yes."
00:38:19,00:38:23,Would you like to remind us about this?
00:38:23,00:38:24,"Oh, fuck it."
00:38:24,00:38:31,The person who cans the beer from Lerwick Brewery in Scotland is called Phil McCann.
00:38:31,00:38:33,"No, beautiful."
00:38:33,00:38:37,That was sent to me on Twitter by someone called ASL Peterson.
00:38:37,00:38:42,And there's a novel called An Office Romance by Iona Rose.
00:38:42,00:38:44,That's lovely.
00:38:44,00:38:48,"You know, when she was Princess Juliana,"
00:38:48,00:38:53,she had a town that was named after her called Juliana Drop.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"I was actually named after the birthing process, wasn't it?"
00:38:56,00:39:00,So this is a municipality in Den Helder.
00:39:00,00:39:05,"It's south of the, this Juliana Drop, south of the town of Den Helder,"
00:39:05,00:39:09,which is north of Shagen and west of Helenskruun.
00:39:09,00:39:10,So.
00:39:10,00:39:10,Okay.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Is that in the Netherlands?
00:39:11,00:39:14,I actually didn't look that bit up.
00:39:14,00:39:14,"Yes, it is."
00:39:14,00:39:14,Yeah.
00:39:14,00:39:16,Yeah.
00:39:16,00:39:16,North Holland.
00:39:16,00:39:17,"So, Holland's Kruun."
00:39:17,00:39:18,It's next to that.
00:39:18,00:39:18,Yeah.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"And so they named it after her, except it changed during World War Two,"
00:39:22,00:39:25,"because there was some beef, and they didn't want to name it that anymore."
00:39:25,00:39:28,So they changed it to Lopjutdorp.
00:39:28,00:39:31,And then it reverted back to Juliana Drop.
00:39:31,00:39:33,"Again, once all the beef got sorted out."
00:39:33,00:39:35,"So she's twice been named after a place, but the same place."
00:39:35,00:39:36,Wow.
00:39:36,00:39:37,Lopjutdorp.
00:39:37,00:39:38,What was that?
00:39:38,00:39:40,It was a guy who founded the town.
00:39:40,00:39:40,"Oh, okay."
00:39:40,00:39:42,Pietlupjut.
00:39:42,00:39:46,Completely different words the second time around.
00:39:46,00:39:47,Cool.
00:39:47,00:39:52,"Oh, have you guys come across the German conductor?"
00:39:52,00:39:53,She's called Mayira.
00:39:53,00:39:56,She's got three arms.
00:39:56,00:39:57,What?
00:39:57,00:40:00,Which makes her a way better conductor than anyone else.
00:40:00,00:40:02,She actually has.
00:40:02,00:40:02,Come on.
00:40:02,00:40:06,"So what happens is you can have, like normally a conductor would have to be like,"
00:40:06,00:40:10,"you know, this side of the orchestra does this, this side does this,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"but you can only do two, but she can do three."
00:40:12,00:40:16,This sounds like a sit-up to a really great dad joke.
00:40:16,00:40:18,I fear it might be.
00:40:18,00:40:19,She's a robot.
00:40:21,00:40:25,"And she does it, instead of with batons, she does it with lightsabers."
00:40:25,00:40:31,"And there is a special piece called the semiconductor's masterpiece,"
00:40:31,00:40:35,which uses this kind of technique of three different parts of the orchestra all doing
00:40:35,00:40:35,different things.
00:40:35,00:40:42,"One fact, which is not actually about World War One, but it is about sort of being paranoid"
00:40:42,00:40:44,about what the enemy is plotting.
00:40:44,00:40:50,"And it was 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War, which is, you know, a huge deal led to the,"
00:40:50,00:40:51,"you know, Germany being a thing."
00:40:51,00:40:56,And the Germans had lots of French prisoners of war.
00:40:56,00:41:02,And it was all over the German papers and all in a German room among the mills
00:41:02,00:41:05,that the French prisoners were planning this huge mutiny.
00:41:05,00:41:07,And it was going to be a Christmas mutiny.
00:41:07,00:41:11,"And it was based on the fact that they'd overheard them, these French prisoners of war,"
00:41:11,00:41:14,whispering the word rebellion over and over again.
00:41:14,00:41:15,And so everyone was terrified about this.
00:41:15,00:41:17,"And, you know, people were put on hand help out."
00:41:17,00:41:19,"And it turned out, it was investigated."
00:41:19,00:41:24,"It turned out that in France, the Christmas meal they have is called the réveillon,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,which I think we've talked about before.
00:41:26,00:41:28,"And it was just coming up to Christmas and all the French prisoners were going,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"""What should we do for the réveillon?"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"We're in prison, so it's going to be harder than usual."
00:41:32,00:41:33,"But maybe we can make it work."""
00:41:33,00:41:35,"And all the Germans were going, ""They're going to rebel."
00:41:35,00:41:36,"There's a mutiny."""
00:41:36,00:41:37,That's so funny.
00:41:37,00:41:39,It's not so cool.
00:41:39,00:41:40,That's incredible.
00:41:40,00:41:43,"Well, that was like, we spoke about a guy who's a local New Zealander,"
00:41:43,00:41:48,"who's up in, I think, Dunedin, who, when you were having problems with cacophos,"
00:41:48,00:41:52,"having sex, he was a saxophonist who came in and he played,"
00:41:52,00:41:55,"they had a sexy room for the cacophos and he was there with a saxophone,"
00:41:55,00:41:58,just like Kenny Ging it up.
00:41:58,00:42:01,"And I've dealt with these allegations before, mate."
00:42:01,00:42:04,It's fun to move.
00:42:04,00:42:09,"I, there's a, there's a story that I think is quite heartwarming story,"
00:42:09,00:42:12,but about don't suspect your enemy of too many wrongs.
00:42:12,00:42:17,"And it's in World War II, there was an opera singer called Victor Ivanovich Nikitin,"
00:42:17,00:42:20,who was a Russian opera singer.
00:42:20,00:42:22,"And when the Germans were fighting on the Russian front,"
00:42:22,00:42:25,"whenever he started singing, everyone stopped fighting."
00:42:25,00:42:25,Really?
00:42:25,00:42:26,Yeah.
00:42:26,00:42:27,To listen to him.
00:42:27,00:42:29,"So he would, and he has an amazing voice."
00:42:29,00:42:30,He was a very famous singer at the time.
00:42:30,00:42:31,I think there were recordings of him.
00:42:31,00:42:33,"So whenever he started singing,"
00:42:33,00:42:35,the Germans would pause their fighting until he was finished
00:42:35,00:42:37,and then start fighting again.
00:42:37,00:42:40,And I don't know why there must have been a lot of freshers just keep on singing.
00:42:40,00:42:45,"But there was one, one night that the Russians thought,"
00:42:45,00:42:47,"suddenly hang on, the Germans have started contravening this rule,"
00:42:47,00:42:50,"whereby we stop fighting whenever this bloke sings,"
00:42:50,00:42:52,because something landed in their sort of trenches
00:42:52,00:42:55,"and they immediately rushed to it screaming, it's a grenade,"
00:42:55,00:42:57,they've thrown a grenade and they picked it up.
00:42:57,00:43:01,And it was a harmonica for them to accompany the opera singer.
00:43:01,00:43:02,"Oh, wow."
00:43:02,00:43:02,Nice.
00:43:02,00:43:05,"What an amazing way for war to be like,"
00:43:05,00:43:07,"maybe they should have people in the trenches reading,"
00:43:07,00:43:09,really gripping audio books out loud.
00:43:09,00:43:13,"And just pausing on cliffhangers and just,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,"all right, see you tomorrow, let's all get some rest."
00:43:16,00:43:19,"There was a guy called William Howett,"
00:43:19,00:43:22,who was one of the first people to write about travels in Australia.
00:43:22,00:43:25,This is just during the gold rush of the 1850s.
00:43:25,00:43:28,He was in his carriage going down the road
00:43:28,00:43:31,and he saw a cricket game taking place in the middle of the road.
00:43:31,00:43:34,"He said, this is not a very safe place to play cricket."
00:43:34,00:43:37,"And the reply was, get along with you."
00:43:37,00:43:38,We do as we like here.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"You are not in England, remember?"
00:43:41,00:43:42,Mm.
00:43:42,00:43:46,"Oh, come on. That is such a lame put down."
00:43:46,00:43:48,I can't even reply to that.
00:43:48,00:43:51,"Well, one of the first English players to ever play in Australia,"
00:43:51,00:43:54,this guy called Roger Edison in 1862.
00:43:54,00:43:55,He wrote of the Aussie team.
00:43:55,00:43:58,"He said, I don't think much of their play,"
00:43:58,00:44:01,but they're a wonderful good lot of drinking men.
00:44:01,00:44:07,"That's all you can hope for, guys, so practice that."
00:44:08,00:44:09,Just a big thank you.
00:44:09,00:44:11,Something very special happened for us today.
00:44:11,00:44:14,This is actually our second podcast recording of the day.
00:44:14,00:44:18,The first one happened by a toilet down the road
00:44:18,00:44:20,in a bar called Mean Doses.
00:44:20,00:44:24,Really cool.
00:44:24,00:44:27,We found out that Mean Doses have been playing us in their toilet
00:44:27,00:44:31,"on loop nonstop, thanks to Dave, who works there."
00:44:31,00:44:34,And so we went over and we have recorded--
00:44:34,00:44:35,Are you all Dave's mates?
00:44:36,00:44:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:44:38,00:44:40,I wondered how we sold this out so quickly.
00:44:40,00:44:43,So we went over there and we recorded
00:44:43,00:44:45,what is effectively an exclusive episode
00:44:45,00:44:50,that will only ever be played inside the toilets at Mean Doses.
00:44:50,00:44:50,Yeah.
00:44:50,00:44:53,Very cool.
00:44:53,00:44:56,"So if you want to be a completist of all the episodes,"
00:44:56,00:44:58,you need to go to Mean Doses.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"And if you go there, you know, tomorrow or in the next few days,"
00:45:01,00:45:05,"they've actually made no such thing as a fish chocolate stout,"
00:45:05,00:45:07,which is what I'm drinking here on stage.
00:45:07,00:45:09,So you can get some of that.
00:45:09,00:45:11,"And by the way, cool fact,"
00:45:11,00:45:13,Mean Doses is called Mean Doses
00:45:13,00:45:15,because the owner of it is called Dean Moses.
00:45:15,00:45:18,Brilliant.
00:45:18,00:45:20,Tourism New Zealand have been in touch
00:45:20,00:45:22,and they're really excited that there's going to be
00:45:22,00:45:24,a whole influx of tourists now coming to New Zealand
00:45:24,00:45:29,for the Hobbit Caves and to sit in the toilet for 20 minutes.
00:45:30,00:45:33,Listen to an episode to complete their listening.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"The good thing is after drinking that beer,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,you will be sitting in the toilet for 20 minutes.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking."
00:45:39,00:45:41,It's delicious.
00:45:41,00:45:47,"Okay, that's it."
00:45:47,00:45:48,That's all of our facts.
00:45:48,00:45:51,"And indeed, that is all of our tour."
00:45:51,00:45:55,"We'll be back next week with a regular office-based episode,"
00:45:55,00:45:57,which I know some of you will be glad to hear.
00:45:57,00:46:00,But I really hope you enjoyed that show.
00:46:00,00:46:03,"If you do want to come and see our live shows in the future,"
00:46:03,00:46:06,I'm sure we will book a few later this year.
00:46:06,00:46:09,"If you go to notionsthingsafish.com/live,"
00:46:09,00:46:11,you will see information about that.
00:46:11,00:46:14,Or you could go and look for our social media stuff.
00:46:14,00:46:16,I'm not going to tell you what they are today.
00:46:16,00:46:20,You can go to any other episode from our last 560 episodes.
00:46:20,00:46:21,Listen to the end and you will see
00:46:21,00:46:24,all of our social media information there.
00:46:24,00:46:25,Not much more to say.
00:46:25,00:46:27,Really hope you enjoyed the show.
00:46:27,00:46:28,We'll be back next week
00:46:28,00:46:38,"as the great man Andrew Hunter Murray once said, ""Bye!"""
