00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,800
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,160
 from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,520
 Hunter Murray, Anish Zinsky and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,520
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,920
 starting with you Andy. My fact is that in the 19th century champion flowers were traded like

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,000
 Premier League footballers. I don't know how exactly like Premier League football as it was but

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,560
 it wasn't for like ten million pounds. No exactly, I think the sums were a bit lower but there was

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,920
 a big thing where there were lots of plowing competitions in the 19th century where you had to

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,720
 you had to plow up and down a field and one of the there are all these metrics in plowing about

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,440
 whether you're doing it right or wrong and squires who had lots of plowmen would kind of pet them

12
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,320
 against each other and then the winners would win a year's wages and then they might be transferred

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,120
 could I just can I ask what a squire is because I associate that with King Arthur Times and this is

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,520
 the 19th century where it started yeah so that's a kind of assistant to a nobleman isn't it okay but

15
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:33,280
 in the late of times it's more of a kind of junior aristocrat sort of a slight landowner I think yeah

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,600
 so for example you get the word squirearchy which is a word for quite affluent families from the

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,360
 country is it is a not a very common word I think do you get the word I don't use it casually

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,800
 pop conversation here's a less common word I think you used to get a squish it someone who was a

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,040
 squire and a bishop that's great oh wow again don't use that in the normal conversation but that

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,880
 is that do they just do that like Scorkman who delivers the milk but also a squire is that just

21
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,120
 applies smashing the words and so it was landowners and they would get have these competitions so

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,880
 that the land got plowed basically and so like for instance the first one ever in Kent was in

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,400
 1867 on the first big one in Kent and that was run by a guy called Mr. Hart's Dyke who owned a massive

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,920
 amount of land in Kent and who then later had children who had children who had children who

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:37,440
 had Miranda from the TV Miranda oh wow and Tom Hart Dyke who we know yeah oh who he he was he's

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,160
 still he works in in agriculture to an extent he he plants things yes so there's a massive garden

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,680
 in Kent which he runs from his ancestral home which was where this plowing competition

28
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,080
 wow isn't that so cool he got on the side now he got he was famous for being stolen or kidnapped by

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,960
 gorillas out in the Dorian gap and they held him for months and they let him go finally and then he

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:07,200
 went back to get directions and while he was kept by the gorillas they are the gorillas he

31
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,520
 like I kind of you can't say yeah yeah well that damn pronounced it so profoundly like the word gorillas

32
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,520
 I'm so that you clarify I'm slowly realizing we're talking about humans are not actual gorillas

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,840
 the humans are talking so while he was kidnapped by these fighters he kept like a little garden

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
 didn't he where he was kept and like he would ask them for plants and stuff like that to kind of

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:41,360
 keep him sane a squirrella is someone who's a squire and the guerilla squire yeah so anyway I should

36
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,520
 say that the way this comes from because it's a really good story it's a guardian long read on the

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,600
 world plowing championship and it's an incredible read it's 5,000 words of plowing action and it's so good

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,160
 so you there are all these things you have to do right basically you have to plow up and down

39
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,840
 and plowing we should just say what it is it's turning soil upside down basically so you're

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,120
 inverting it which means that you're bringing nutrients to the surface and you're plowing weeds

41
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,240
 and other plants back into the earth so they break down and they feed the soil so the aim is

42
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:18,400
 that you've prepared a field for planting yeah that's what plowing is yeah well I mean is it necessary

43
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,680
 maybe we'll come on to that later yeah what's allowing us very controversial in this day and

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,600
 it kills the soil yeah ruins farms now we've been doing it for thousands of years and now people have

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
 suddenly started doing this thing called till free farming or no till farming where they've realized

46
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,400
 you can just spread the seeds on unplowed land and they can actually get better yields it's a thing

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,920
 this is why they've been doing it South America for years because their land isn't as robust as

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,640
 ours and so they've realized that it's been really drying out and ring the nutrients because the idea

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
 is that we suddenly disturb this massive ecosystem with this plow you dig down you wrench up all these

50
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,680
 insects and stuff and you plop them on top and they don't know what they're doing well it's an argument

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,960
 and the experiments are happening and they're getting kind of similar-ish results to plow fields

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
 so might something in it I mean imagine if it turned out plowing have been totally pointless all

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,640
 of these years well I mean it hasn't been there's been these amazing competitions going on

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,560
 that's what you think about it and it's still and it's what they say it's the biggest event in Europe

55
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,440
 the one that happens in Ireland in Ireland the outdoor event in 2017 291,000 people went along to the

56
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,680
 plowing competition to see I read an article about it and it said that two thirds of the attendees

57
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,040
 have absolutely no interest in agriculture whatsoever it's because it's a huge event you know

58
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,080
 when you're someone's going to a village show because you're a bit bored of a Saturday it's like

59
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
 a massive version of that it's like a festival kind of thing isn't it yeah and then how's

60
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,200
 that attendance is twice as much as glass and brie here are some of the things that you can actually

61
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,760
 see at it outside of the plowing there's a robotic milking machine that milks 40 cows so you can

62
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,840
 watch that there's a pesteront which serves mealworms and crickets local locusts tractor football

63
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,440
 so that's a that's one of the new chance yeah so it's teams of tractors push a giant football

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,440
 around the field yeah and then they say there's there's the RTE tent where they have a very famous

65
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,800
 commentator slash news broadcaster called Marty Morrissey and you can meet him and then they say

66
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,920
 in brackets or his cardboard cutout yeah it's a massive deal and the same person has been

67
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,320
 the head of the National Plowing Association which is the organization that runs it for 68 years now

68
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,000
 since 85-year-old woman called Anna-May McCue who I think is a bit of a legend there basically

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
 and so it's quite impressive that she's a woman because only about 2% of plowers who enter these

70
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,760
 contests are women and she said I was reading an interview with her and she was saying that there's

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:57,200
 this contest for farmer rats which are the female farmers and they sort of compete over who's

72
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,160
 going to be queen of the plow and it used to be that the queen of the plow if you won that title

73
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,480
 at the contest you were given a hundred pound dowry as long as you were married by the age of 25

74
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:15,360
 wow yeah good right ancestor actually on that the the first farmette competition was in 1954

75
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
 that was the first time they allowed women in and not many people were happy about it some people

76
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,440
 said it was introducing Hollywood razzamatas at its worst sounds like it

77
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,320
 they want introducing Mae Weston I also said that you were allowed to enter it if it was open this is

78
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,960
 from I should say this is from Andy's article not your article but the one that you forwarded to us

79
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,120
 which as Andy says is fantastic and so the farmette class was open to girls and women that were

80
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,360
 single married or widowed which are the three I guess options of life generally but not divorced

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,360
 you might be right um so that just while we're on plowing in sexism there is a really interesting

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,000
 theory that plowing created sexism in the first place it's so good I wonder why you were so against

83
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,240
 plowing gather so people plowing is invented with agriculture about 10 that roughly 10,000 years ago

84
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,240
 10 to 8 and the original plows were called scratch plows so they don't turn the soil over they

85
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
 just literally dig a little trench through it and you don't need too much strength to do it but you

86
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,880
 do need quite a lot of upper body strength to do that and before that lots of women have been in

87
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:35,360
 charge of fields in cereal growing because they were using hose and then when plowing has invented

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,760
 and I mean hose smoking hose and then we're on the side of the sexism I thought you'd grab you've

89
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,840
 gone later on to use to plant crops okay do you think that's where the phrase grows before

90
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:55,120
 hose comes from but then when plowing is invented suddenly the men are in charge and in Mesopotamia

91
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,080
 there's this flip from mother goddesses to male gods and this is the really weird thing it still

92
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,560
 happens today as in the the effects might still be being felt so women descended from plow using

93
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,160
 societies are much less likely to work outside the home or BMPs or run businesses whereas in

94
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,840
 countries like Rwanda and Botswana and Madagascar which are mostly hoe using places and everyone's

95
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,240
 giggling again but in those countries women are much likely to be in the labour force

96
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,880
 because of but what's the reason that it drove women out is it the weight of the plow so it was

97
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,680
 when people had to pull the plow or direct the animals exactly the first world plow champion

98
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,520
 was a guy called Jim Eccles from Ontario and the only writer if I could find said that he was so shy

99
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:45,360
 he only entered because his friends taught him into it and the second champion was Hugh Bar of

100
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,120
 Antrim and Eccles only came eighth in this competition because according to the article I read he had

101
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 the bad luck of drawing a plot with a bump in it oh so it's all down to how lucky you were with

102
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,840
 your little bit of field it's true and all the international competitors in that second one

103
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,640
 which was in Ireland hated it because they had stony fields in Ireland and you didn't get stony

104
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
 fields anywhere else around the world so you have to clear the stones out of the way I think before

105
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,280
 you start so Richard Herring who's new podcast is about him clearing stones from fields is he

106
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:27,920
 secretly training for the next international athlete now championship okay it is time for fact

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,840
 number two and that is James okay my fat this week is that the American centre for disease control

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,840
 has warned against kissing hedgehogs how come because they can give you illness they can give you

109
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,640
 salmonella specifically and there have been eleven in January they said that there have been eleven

110
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,480
 people in eight states who've got a strain of salmonella and in ten of the eleven cases the people

111
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,920
 had reported recent contact with the hedgehog it's too much to be coincidence it's too much it's too

112
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,800
 much I can only think that the eleventh person is lying this happened in Missouri in Minnesota in

113
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,080
 Colorado main Mississippi in Nebraska Texas and Wyoming and we already knew that hedgehogs can give

114
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,960
 you salmonella but it seems like it's a particularly bad strain at the moment in America it's so widely

115
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,040
 spread across all the different states that it makes you think as though each state has one person

116
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,960
 and they all know each other and they just have a hedgehog kissing club and they just like sending

117
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,760
 videos around to each other or it could be just one widely traveled hedgehog who's just going

118
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,280
 around attacking people is it French kissing that they're doing with the hedgehogs or is it just

119
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:45,440
 it doesn't specify but I think it's nuzzling okay right if you imagine like a you could do that

120
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,200
 if you had a small child with a hedgehog wouldn't you if I had a pet hedgehog I would definitely

121
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,240
 kiss it at some point would you yeah okay I get attached it's edible right so they don't even have

122
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,200
 to have snogged it some hedgehog come on just been near it and it's got in the dust between the

123
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,680
 hedgehog and the cousin can do but it dies quite quickly in the air I think maybe you hold the hedgehog

124
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,520
 and then you put it down and you suck your finger for the reason you like so you're bigger for any

125
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,640
 reason yeah although you shouldn't uh incidentally while we're on giving advice about what to do with

126
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:27,200
 hedgehogs you shouldn't have sex with them because in 2007 a Serbian man needed emergency surgery

127
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,920
 after he had sex with a hedgehog on a witch doctor's advice she told him it would cure his premature

128
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,600
 ejaculation and it actually just left him severely lacerated because they're covered in needles

129
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:47,280
 any who sorry Salmanella yeah so other other animals in the US that can give you Salmanella or

130
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,880
 that have given people Salmanella in the last few years include chickens ducklings guinea pigs frogs

131
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,440
 turtles geckos and bearded dragons who have all given people Salmanella recently all from kissing or

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,480
 from I don't know I don't know what kind of he's saying undercooked bearded dragons you know when he

133
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,520
 is slightly undercooked bearded dragons you often feel sick afterwards uh turtle was in that list and

134
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,920
 I was reading a story of um in China that was a man who made the news not too long ago because he

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,440
 decided to get rid of his pet turtle so he was releasing it back into the wild and as he did so he

136
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,880
 decided to give it a goodbye kiss um but unfortunately it was a snapping turtle and it grabbed onto

137
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,200
 his lower lip and refused to let go um and you can see video footage of his face uh which does not

138
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,800
 look good basically it kind of locked on and didn't come off um yeah so don't kiss turtles as

139
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:44,240
 another thing just don't kiss other animals is that as well isn't it well there's a series a study uh

140
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,280
 I think it was in 2015 and it was analysing you know how people kiss their dogs yeah yeah I mean I

141
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,880
 include that in animals yeah no you're right but um it was at the University of Arizona and they

142
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,800
 were trying to find out whether the microbes in dog guts might be good for humans okay and whether

143
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,400
 they might actually it's like having a probiotic yogurt basically kissing a dog right um it is not

144
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,600
 as delicious but this is really weird dogs and their owners end up having very similar gut bacteria

145
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,160
 so it you end up with the same kind of microbiome and so the study was pairing people with dogs for

146
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,760
 three months and testing them to see if there was any change yeah is that so does that mean it's a good

147
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,440
 idea to kiss your dog because at least that you won't get a strange bacteria or it's kind of pointless

148
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,720
 actually because you're not getting any new bacteria you didn't have already yeah I think they

149
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,280
 were saying it could have good effects but also obviously it could have bad effects because what are

150
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,320
 you for a piece of advice it probably means if you have your dogs bacteria in your stomach then it

151
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:58,000
 would be easier for you to digest um dog food yeah come brexit do you guys know the what do you

152
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,800
 think is the food stuff that most commonly gives people salmonella chicken eggs it's salmon or it's a

153
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,840
 bit of salmon I used to think that I used to think salmon really salmon other yeah sorry it was just

154
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,080
 found by a guy called salmon salmon no it salad or something it is yeah it's leafy greens um so I

155
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:23,520
 didn't know this we don't give them enough stick it's cucumber and melon are responsible for

156
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,360
 are responsible for 20% of cases of salmonella whereas chicken is only 19 oh what a stupid

157
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,600
 hey it just overtook it the last minute I'm immediately going to go home throw away the balance

158
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,480
 I replaced them with raw chickens anyway this is true and generally meat so chicken beef and pork

159
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,400
 account for 33% of salmonella poisonings whereas leafy greens again a huge lead with 35%

160
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,800
 um so we never talk about that and is I think the salmonella you get from salmonella you get from

161
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,000
 the meats can be a more virulent strain so it produces the most deaths but really avoid salad I

162
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,720
 think is the next big advice I think that's good advice um you said that it was invented it was

163
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,200
 discovered by mr. Salmon um actually discovered by his assistant the abol smith uh Daniel

164
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,320
 Salmon was the other guy uh and the abol smith was also the first person to discover that text could

165
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,960
 spread disease and he also discovered anaphylaxis did you know oh he's quite a big deal that is a big deal

166
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,720
 feels like he didn't get the credit he deserved there no smith anella is probably a hard word to say

167
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:35,200
 you're right andaphylaxis is sometimes called the theobold smith predominant um but again don't

168
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,800
 use that in conversation because people have no idea what I think if you're ringing 999 when someone's

169
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,120
 having anaphylactic shock don't say he's suffering the theobold smith predominant sound clever

170
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:52,320
 um hedgehogs yeah yeah there was a tradition in the Victorian times of having a hedgehog in your

171
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,040
 kitchen to go around eating insects oh wow hedgehogs seem to make quite fun pets for some people so they

172
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,040
 love running in their wheels didn't know there's a love running in their wheels more than anything so

173
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,920
 like a hamster but more enthusiastic and I was on these sites which were saying which were giving

174
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,760
 advice about how to keep hedgehogs they were saying you've got to take the wheel away as soon as

175
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,000
 the hedgehog gets pregnant because they love the wheel so much that they'll keep running while they

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,480
 give birth for instance wow they'll often then trample down the thing they've just given birth to

177
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
 because they'll keep running no way they won't look after their babies because they're too busy running

178
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,120
 in the wheel and sometimes they pick up the little hoglets so that's what you call the little hedgehogs

179
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,320
 in their mouth to take them onto the wheel so at least they're with them but then they'll just run

180
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
 over them it's like heroin it's like heroin yeah it's like hedgehog heroin that's another thing

181
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,720
 you shouldn't indulge them while pregnant I believe a special advice that's amazing that's incredible

182
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:50,640
 yeah pretty pregnancy they have very loud sex hedgehogs yep very loud sex especially with

183
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,840
 the sleeping with a man from Serbia oh my god sake already

184
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:02,400
 but they do have loud sex even when having sex with each other and there was a man in Germany

185
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,480
 who called police once who's in his apartment he was reporting heavy panting happening under the

186
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,120
 common stairwell in his house so we called the police saying can you stop these heavy panters

187
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:18,880
 the police came round and they just found two mating hedgehogs under the stairs and as the police

188
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,720
 spokesperson said we just found two hedgehogs loudly engaged ensuring the continuity of their species

189
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,520
 and so they left them to it yeah because they last a long time which is why they could they were

190
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,280
 still doing it when the police came round they can go on for hours which again I guess is why

191
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,000
 they're particularly good it's more satirical

192
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:47,040
 okay it's time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact is scientists have finally worked

193
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:54,560
 out what time it is on Saturn and what time is it um it's well yeah uh we don't know it's we know

194
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,040
 how long we we know how long that I can't tell you exactly right now what time it is on Saturn

195
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,720
 I can tell you how long a day is on Saturn and that's what they've worked out it's 10 hours

196
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,280
 33 minutes and 38 seconds now this is new from what we thought decades ago up by as the article says

197
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,400
 several minutes it's it's a very interesting reason of how they found it out so Cassini which was

198
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,200
 the spacecraft which has been taking all the images that we have a Saturn it's it was an incredible

199
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,120
 mission that is ended now I believe that the Cassini is actually burnt up into Saturn's atmosphere now

200
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,560
 but everyone was looking for how long it took to rotate um by looking at the planet and there was a

201
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,160
 student of astronomy at UC Santa Cruz who started looking at the data about the rings of Saturn and

202
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,280
 what they noticed that the rings themselves started taking impressions off them kind of like how if

203
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,360
 you were having a earthquake on earth you could use seismology to work out how strong it was say

204
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
 they were noticing that a similar thing was going on with the core of Saturn that was releasing

205
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,200
 certain seismological waves that were being recorded in the rings so what the guy did was he made a

206
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,280
 simulation of how fast the core would be turning by using the waves that were imprinted on the ring

207
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,680
 on a computer simulation and by doing that was able to match it up with what the spin would be

208
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,200
 and that came out at 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds oh well when when they discovered the rings

209
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,400
 it was a pretty confusing episode so Galileo the first person to observe the rings and describe

210
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,080
 them poor guy this is in 1610 and he saw it with a telescope and he sent this cryptic message to

211
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,760
 Kepler saying I've seen the highest triform planet and Kepler told King Rudolph and Rudolph said what

212
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,640
 the hell you on about Galileo and he Galileo said I think it's three planets side by side because he

213
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,200
 was sort of seeing it as three um but then so he wanted to have another look at it so he waited a

214
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,880
 couple of years for some reason and then um after a couple of years what he didn't realize was that

215
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,360
 he was observing them at the Saturn ring plane crossing so that is when Earth crosses like into

216
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,280
 the exact plane of Saturn's rings so it happens about once every 13 to 15 years and at that point

217
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,480
 because they're so flat if you're looking at them face on you can't see anything

218
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,160
 so Galileo looked they'd totally gone and he was really freaked out he thought I have no idea what's

219
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,960
 gone on them so so it seems like I've lied that's bad luck it's really bad how often does that happen

220
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,560
 every 13 to 15 years god so it's the same thing of that timing you know if we didn't look again we

221
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,320
 would assume that it didn't have it but it was just that little blip yeah where suddenly it just

222
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,440
 doesn't to us yeah and then it's going again a bit later oh yeah yeah the second check how did

223
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,120
 you know it was the same one I would have thought I've just seen a different one a different planet

224
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,520
 yeah yeah I guess that's what astronomers do for living isn't it they could predict where

225
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,400
 the planets were going to be they knew which was which yeah he was a smart guy Andy okay well

226
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,880
 not that you're not but probably in different ways yeah I would like to see him improvising the

227
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:57,520
 Jane Austen play I think we all would actually love that amazing I'd actually go and see

228
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:05,200
 but the rings of Saturn they're 180,000 miles wide and they're only 300 feet high yeah

229
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,800
 always that that's crazy isn't there 400 kilometers wide like the actual ring bit there so they're

230
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,320
 that many miles across around the from one end of the ring to the very first on the other side

231
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,280
 of the planet yeah yeah but yeah they are incredibly flat I think someone worked out that if they were

232
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,800
 the equivalent of paper so if they were the thickness of paper then you need a sheet of paper that

233
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,520
 was 1.7 miles across wow that's the equivalent there's a theory that I just saw in the new scientists

234
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,840
 this afternoon which says that the planet Pluto might be a billion comets squished together

235
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,600
 that's how all the planets are really aren't they they're just bits of rock and dust squished

236
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,200
 together I guess I think there was an alternative theory but I have I literally just saw it as we

237
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,920
 sat down so yeah it's not even even Saturn began as a pebble just begins as a pebble going around

238
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:59,120
 and then another pebble squashes into it and then bigger pebbles bigger pebbles if actually you've got

239
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,640
 Saturn that's quite that's such a nice fable you'll make a great dodgy your kids feeling a bit small

240
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,320
 you can always say even Saturn was once a pebble that's great yeah look at him now look at him now

241
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,400
 oh huh did you guys know just speaking of sort of time and space that there are two different days

242
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,800
 on earth we have two different days there are seven in a week oh my god I've been saying that all wrong

243
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,320
 oh my god what's half a juice day it's not Monday again

244
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,760
 it's invigorating no there are two different types of day on earth so there's a solar day

245
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,200
 which is the one that we know which is the 24 hour day actually the more legit day so if I asked you

246
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:48,240
 what is the definition of a solar day how quickly we spin round yeah how many degrees have you spun

247
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,960
 around yeah three six yeah in correct it's actually a tiny bit more than 360 so a sedereal day

248
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,480
 is 23 hours and 56 minutes and that's how quickly the earth does one rotation of 360 degrees but

249
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,680
 actually because we are also rotating around the Sun every time the earth rotates in order to get

250
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,800
 from midday one day to exactly midday the other it needs to spin that tiny bit more because he moved

251
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,680
 around a bit more so our 24 hour day is actually you're spinning around a bit more than 360 degrees

252
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:24,480
 and I didn't know that how does that affect our working life and pay and stuff well so I think

253
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,280
 what you can say is actually the day is four minutes shorter than you thought so you can go home

254
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,120
 from work four minutes earlier than new plans great yeah let's do it yeah finished now

255
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,600
 just stop this podcast four minutes before the end yeah yeah so do you know how long a day is on

256
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,640
 the Sun how long it takes the Sun to rotate once on its axis yeah and as opposed to when it's

257
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:58,160
 light which is all the time it's 24.5 earth days on the equator but 34 earth days at the poles and

258
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,760
 this is always a problem isn't it because they're big gas things and things are spinning at different

259
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,440
 speeds yeah so if you're on a holiday you would have your holiday at the pole of the Sun

260
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,200
 because you get you get longer still hot this time of year yeah I don't know if you want longer I

261
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
 think you want to shorten that holiday as much as possible if you're holidaying on the Sun don't you

262
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,680
 well and I see you've got very good good factor good factor Sun cream yeah okay that's amazing though

263
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:27,520
 it has two different days or three and it's different days okay yeah so Saturn the Saturn is a god

264
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,040
 in Roman mythology right um so there's also Jupiter Jupiter all the planets are gods basically

265
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,720
 not earth apart from earth all the power unless you can't guy who's Greek goddess

266
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:47,680
 but Jupiter's far Jupiter the fifth planet then the Saturn the sixth Jupiter's father is Saturn right

267
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:54,480
 right and then the next planet is Uranus and Uranus is the father of Saturn so Jupiter

268
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,240
 next planet father next planet father the solar system is basically a big who do you think you are

269
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,520
 yeah in some traditions Mars the fourth planet is the son of Jupiter so that so yeah it's like a

270
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,000
 family tree going outwards that's a way you can remember and so is Uranus's father Neptune

271
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,080
 I think we didn't know about Neptune and the father of all the gods is that cartoon duck

272
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:26,480
 that is really cool that's really yeah Pluto knocked out because that just didn't work for the

273
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:37,760
 system it actually is a planet but they're like okay it is time for our final fact of the show and

274
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:44,000
 that is Chazinski my fact is that the first ever blood transfusion to be a scientifically recorded

275
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,960
 used a goose quill to connect an artery in the neck of one dog to the joggular vein in the neck of

276
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,880
 another and it was successful the dog was okay one of the dogs was okay it was half a success it was

277
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,440
 a hot well the dog was okay that they wanted to be okay the dog that was receiving blood exactly

278
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,960
 so it's actually quite mean this was done in 1666 by a guy called Richard Lauer or Lauer who was

279
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
 from Cornwall and he traveled up to the Royal Society in London and did it in front of an audience

280
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,960
 and he apparently got a medium sized dog I don't know why the size was that relevant but he severed

281
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,640
 its jugular and blood it until it was approaching death and then thought okay cool now we can see if

282
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,960
 we can save this dog and he did that by then sort of severing the artery of a secondary dog attaching

283
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,120
 a quill between the two and siphoning the blood from the secondary dog into the next one but then

284
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,080
 you need a third dog to save the second dog and indeed yeah they call that day the massacre of 500

285
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,520
 dogs no don't you ever be the massacre of one it's only over the last dog on the congular

286
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,360
 yeah could you not like put it in like a circle so that everyone gets everyone else oh yeah wow he

287
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,760
 should have done that I don't know why he didn't do two gruse quills and swap them but no he didn't

288
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,840
 he just bled you put in a second quill at the back end of the dog couldn't you one in the neck of

289
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,760
 the dog and one in the bum of the dog don't think it works like that doesn't it and then you get the

290
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,760
 blood just going round you know you've got two hearts you've got two circulatory systems yeah just

291
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,440
 like a circuit I don't know that doesn't go for the head to the bum and the back end I think that would

292
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,480
 work yeah you said the transfusion came to an end when the emittant dog which is the one who gave

293
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:26,080
 the blood began to cry and faint and fall into convulsions and the last die oh yeah they weren't

294
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,360
 the animal rights weren't as strong in the olden days yeah but it was successful which is kind of

295
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,840
 weird actually because just like humans really when you're doing blood transfusions in pets it's good

296
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,760
 to have the same blood type I think dogs have same blood type I know cats have a a b and b yeah I

297
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,880
 think they're different a's and b's aren't they as in their different proteins on the oh are they

298
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,920
 I believe so yeah but hang on would it would that's a I've never considered that would a great

299
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:58,000
 day and have different types of blood to a scotty no so all dogs so all dogs can give blood to

300
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,280
 all other dogs but I feeling they can't give its humans because of the pro the antigens on the

301
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,680
 yes although I didn't know they could give it to all other dogs I think so it's the same species

302
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,200
 isn't it it's just different yeah but all humans can't give blood to all other humans oh sorry no

303
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,680
 yeah you're right yeah so it's the same as humans as in a scotty and a tie patient now the

304
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,840
 yes yeah yeah yeah yeah if you're a bird any kind of bird then you can have a transfusion from

305
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,640
 any other kind of bird wow so rubbing could donate to an ostrich but you'd need quite a lot of

306
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:38,160
 rubbins that's incredible yeah so donating blood between animals they started you know injecting

307
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,720
 blood from let's say a calf into a person that was a few a year later after this first experiment

308
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,680
 and he died so it was banned for a long time the person died yeah but there was this weird

309
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,000
 rash of cases in the mid 19th century where doctors just started saying well milk will probably

310
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,200
 work just as well and putting milk into people's bloodstreams directly yeah yeah they thought because

311
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,600
 it's got these little oily droplets and fatty droplets they thought well they might turn into white

312
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,120
 blood cells and they just there were two doctors called bovell and Hodder and this is all from I found

313
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,400
 this a journal called transfusion and this is the 1969 edition but they wrote up the whole thing

314
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,920
 and their first patient was said to respond dramatically to 12 ounces of cow's milk

315
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,800
 but two other patients who they transfused the following week died and people kept dying as well

316
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:34,080
 when they say it was pondermatically and it happened and for 25 years at least

317
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,480
 that people were just putting milk into your blood well they started that's how they started doing

318
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,600
 it even in the 17th century so Christopher rendered a lot of this bizarrely before he got into building

319
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,800
 cathedrals but he was involved with which allowed with his first transfusion and he used to inject

320
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,000
 dogs with water, milk, beer, wine and opium to see if any of them were just blood transfusions.

321
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,960
 He once said I have injected wine and ale into a living dog into the mass of blood by a vein

322
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,480
 in good quantities till I have made him extremely drunk but soon after he pisseth it out

323
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,080
 but also the idea of putting animal blood into humans there was a big theological debate about

324
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,240
 what you would be doing if you were putting foreign blood into someone else's body because

325
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,040
 supposedly the soul would be contained inside some of that blood so you're altering the whole

326
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:26,480
 person so what they used to plan out was if they were going for someone who was a bit wild they

327
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,840
 would get sheep's blood because that was a calm nurturing Jesus-like animal would then give

328
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,280
 a sort of balance of a soul to this wild character equally if they had someone who was very shy

329
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,560
 they might adopt an animal that had a bit more of a wild attitude and the idea was to inject

330
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,600
 them with that blood although a sociable Jesus-like lamb lamb lamb lamb lamb of God okay yeah yeah

331
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:55,040
 similarities there's a weird thing this is so on just taking blood and putting it into other people

332
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,840
 we've said before you know the secret service in America they have several pints of the president's

333
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,640
 blood type in his car which is pretty cool but I read this piece in the Atlantic about how the

334
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,880
 secret service was protecting Barack Obama's DNA because you know we all shed millions of cells

335
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,720
 a day yeah so the DNA is intact so if you let's say the president shook hands with you and you got a

336
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,080
 few live cells or he sneezed and he threw away the tissue you could make you can now make cells

337
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:32,080
 into other cell types so you could make synthetic sperm cells from the president's sneeze in a tissue

338
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,920
 and then you can you know they can't fertilize eggs with them but you could say oh look we've

339
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,880
 got evidence of this so they could what you could say they might clone Barack Obama or I think it's

340
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,160
 not exactly that you'd make another president but you could one another but why do you want another

341
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:54,560
 who doesn't want to know why stay you I'll take a sterile sperm cell of Barack Obama is president of

342
00:32:54,560 --> 00:33:00,800
 America but you could so you could fabricate evidence of an affair or you can or for example you

343
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:06,480
 can analyze the genetic markers of diseases that you could say well he's more prone to outzymas

344
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,120
 or to this heart disease and you could cast out on their legitimacy that way truth that he was

345
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,320
 born in Africa yeah so yeah so these this is a real problem so presumably they have Trump's DNA as

346
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:27,600
 well I think a lot of people have Trump's DNA in Japan a blood type is a super important thing

347
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,240
 isn't it I don't think we've mentioned before I think we've done it on QI but it's on job applications

348
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,200
 and stuff it's so related to thought to be so related to who you are and what you're like kind

349
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,480
 of like how we see maybe star signs but much more believed in and invested in and yeah you'll have

350
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880
 to say on your application what blood type you are but they I mean saying horoscopes they in the

351
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,840
 morning TV shows in Japan they have the blood type horoscopes they do do that and yeah and on an

352
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,120
 Asian Asian countries on their Facebook profiles that tends to be a thing and you're about you would

353
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,400
 have your blood type in there because it tells you a lot about who you are for potential you know I

354
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,520
 didn't even know what my blood type was until earlier this year that's weird isn't it I still don't

355
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,040
 know I don't know I don't know I always call my mom whenever I need to know it she knows it well

356
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:35,680
 she's very deaf though so she always says hey thanks mom okay that's it that is all of our facts thank
