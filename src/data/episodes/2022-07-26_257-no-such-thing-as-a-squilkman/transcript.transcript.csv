00:00:15,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:20,00:00:26,"from the QI offices in Covert Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew"
00:00:26,00:00:31,"Hunter Murray, Anish Zinsky and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:31,00:00:37,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go
00:00:37,00:00:43,starting with you Andy. My fact is that in the 19th century champion flowers were traded like
00:00:43,00:00:50,Premier League footballers. I don't know how exactly like Premier League football as it was but
00:00:50,00:00:54,"it wasn't for like ten million pounds. No exactly, I think the sums were a bit lower but there was"
00:00:54,00:00:59,a big thing where there were lots of plowing competitions in the 19th century where you had to
00:00:59,00:01:04,you had to plow up and down a field and one of the there are all these metrics in plowing about
00:01:04,00:01:09,whether you're doing it right or wrong and squires who had lots of plowmen would kind of pet them
00:01:09,00:01:14,against each other and then the winners would win a year's wages and then they might be transferred
00:01:14,00:01:19,could I just can I ask what a squire is because I associate that with King Arthur Times and this is
00:01:19,00:01:25,the 19th century where it started yeah so that's a kind of assistant to a nobleman isn't it okay but
00:01:25,00:01:33,in the late of times it's more of a kind of junior aristocrat sort of a slight landowner I think yeah
00:01:33,00:01:39,so for example you get the word squirearchy which is a word for quite affluent families from the
00:01:39,00:01:45,country is it is a not a very common word I think do you get the word I don't use it casually
00:01:45,00:01:50,pop conversation here's a less common word I think you used to get a squish it someone who was a
00:01:50,00:01:57,squire and a bishop that's great oh wow again don't use that in the normal conversation but that
00:01:57,00:02:02,is that do they just do that like Scorkman who delivers the milk but also a squire is that just
00:02:02,00:02:09,applies smashing the words and so it was landowners and they would get have these competitions so
00:02:09,00:02:14,that the land got plowed basically and so like for instance the first one ever in Kent was in
00:02:14,00:02:22,1867 on the first big one in Kent and that was run by a guy called Mr. Hart's Dyke who owned a massive
00:02:22,00:02:27,amount of land in Kent and who then later had children who had children who had children who
00:02:27,00:02:37,had Miranda from the TV Miranda oh wow and Tom Hart Dyke who we know yeah oh who he he was he's
00:02:37,00:02:44,still he works in in agriculture to an extent he he plants things yes so there's a massive garden
00:02:44,00:02:49,in Kent which he runs from his ancestral home which was where this plowing competition
00:02:49,00:02:56,wow isn't that so cool he got on the side now he got he was famous for being stolen or kidnapped by
00:02:56,00:03:00,gorillas out in the Dorian gap and they held him for months and they let him go finally and then he
00:03:00,00:03:07,went back to get directions and while he was kept by the gorillas they are the gorillas he
00:03:08,00:03:15,like I kind of you can't say yeah yeah well that damn pronounced it so profoundly like the word gorillas
00:03:15,00:03:23,I'm so that you clarify I'm slowly realizing we're talking about humans are not actual gorillas
00:03:23,00:03:29,the humans are talking so while he was kidnapped by these fighters he kept like a little garden
00:03:29,00:03:33,didn't he where he was kept and like he would ask them for plants and stuff like that to kind of
00:03:33,00:03:41,keep him sane a squirrella is someone who's a squire and the guerilla squire yeah so anyway I should
00:03:41,00:03:45,say that the way this comes from because it's a really good story it's a guardian long read on the
00:03:45,00:03:51,"world plowing championship and it's an incredible read it's 5,000 words of plowing action and it's so good"
00:03:51,00:03:56,so you there are all these things you have to do right basically you have to plow up and down
00:03:56,00:04:01,and plowing we should just say what it is it's turning soil upside down basically so you're
00:04:01,00:04:07,inverting it which means that you're bringing nutrients to the surface and you're plowing weeds
00:04:07,00:04:12,and other plants back into the earth so they break down and they feed the soil so the aim is
00:04:12,00:04:18,that you've prepared a field for planting yeah that's what plowing is yeah well I mean is it necessary
00:04:18,00:04:23,maybe we'll come on to that later yeah what's allowing us very controversial in this day and
00:04:23,00:04:31,it kills the soil yeah ruins farms now we've been doing it for thousands of years and now people have
00:04:31,00:04:36,suddenly started doing this thing called till free farming or no till farming where they've realized
00:04:36,00:04:44,you can just spread the seeds on unplowed land and they can actually get better yields it's a thing
00:04:44,00:04:47,this is why they've been doing it South America for years because their land isn't as robust as
00:04:47,00:04:52,ours and so they've realized that it's been really drying out and ring the nutrients because the idea
00:04:52,00:04:58,is that we suddenly disturb this massive ecosystem with this plow you dig down you wrench up all these
00:04:58,00:05:03,insects and stuff and you plop them on top and they don't know what they're doing well it's an argument
00:05:03,00:05:08,and the experiments are happening and they're getting kind of similar-ish results to plow fields
00:05:08,00:05:13,so might something in it I mean imagine if it turned out plowing have been totally pointless all
00:05:13,00:05:18,of these years well I mean it hasn't been there's been these amazing competitions going on
00:05:18,00:05:22,that's what you think about it and it's still and it's what they say it's the biggest event in Europe
00:05:22,00:05:29,"the one that happens in Ireland in Ireland the outdoor event in 2017 291,000 people went along to the"
00:05:29,00:05:33,plowing competition to see I read an article about it and it said that two thirds of the attendees
00:05:33,00:05:39,have absolutely no interest in agriculture whatsoever it's because it's a huge event you know
00:05:39,00:05:42,when you're someone's going to a village show because you're a bit bored of a Saturday it's like
00:05:42,00:05:45,a massive version of that it's like a festival kind of thing isn't it yeah and then how's
00:05:45,00:05:49,that attendance is twice as much as glass and brie here are some of the things that you can actually
00:05:49,00:05:55,see at it outside of the plowing there's a robotic milking machine that milks 40 cows so you can
00:05:55,00:06:03,watch that there's a pesteront which serves mealworms and crickets local locusts tractor football
00:06:03,00:06:09,so that's a that's one of the new chance yeah so it's teams of tractors push a giant football
00:06:09,00:06:15,around the field yeah and then they say there's there's the RTE tent where they have a very famous
00:06:15,00:06:20,commentator slash news broadcaster called Marty Morrissey and you can meet him and then they say
00:06:20,00:06:27,in brackets or his cardboard cutout yeah it's a massive deal and the same person has been
00:06:27,00:06:34,the head of the National Plowing Association which is the organization that runs it for 68 years now
00:06:34,00:06:40,since 85-year-old woman called Anna-May McCue who I think is a bit of a legend there basically
00:06:40,00:06:44,and so it's quite impressive that she's a woman because only about 2% of plowers who enter these
00:06:44,00:06:49,contests are women and she said I was reading an interview with her and she was saying that there's
00:06:49,00:06:57,this contest for farmer rats which are the female farmers and they sort of compete over who's
00:06:57,00:07:02,going to be queen of the plow and it used to be that the queen of the plow if you won that title
00:07:02,00:07:06,at the contest you were given a hundred pound dowry as long as you were married by the age of 25
00:07:06,00:07:15,wow yeah good right ancestor actually on that the the first farmette competition was in 1954
00:07:15,00:07:19,that was the first time they allowed women in and not many people were happy about it some people
00:07:19,00:07:25,said it was introducing Hollywood razzamatas at its worst sounds like it
00:07:26,00:07:34,they want introducing Mae Weston I also said that you were allowed to enter it if it was open this is
00:07:34,00:07:38,from I should say this is from Andy's article not your article but the one that you forwarded to us
00:07:38,00:07:45,which as Andy says is fantastic and so the farmette class was open to girls and women that were
00:07:45,00:07:51,single married or widowed which are the three I guess options of life generally but not divorced
00:07:52,00:07:59,you might be right um so that just while we're on plowing in sexism there is a really interesting
00:07:59,00:08:06,theory that plowing created sexism in the first place it's so good I wonder why you were so against
00:08:06,00:08:12,"plowing gather so people plowing is invented with agriculture about 10 that roughly 10,000 years ago"
00:08:12,00:08:18,10 to 8 and the original plows were called scratch plows so they don't turn the soil over they
00:08:18,00:08:22,just literally dig a little trench through it and you don't need too much strength to do it but you
00:08:22,00:08:28,do need quite a lot of upper body strength to do that and before that lots of women have been in
00:08:28,00:08:35,charge of fields in cereal growing because they were using hose and then when plowing has invented
00:08:35,00:08:41,and I mean hose smoking hose and then we're on the side of the sexism I thought you'd grab you've
00:08:41,00:08:47,gone later on to use to plant crops okay do you think that's where the phrase grows before
00:08:47,00:08:55,hose comes from but then when plowing is invented suddenly the men are in charge and in Mesopotamia
00:08:55,00:09:00,there's this flip from mother goddesses to male gods and this is the really weird thing it still
00:09:00,00:09:06,happens today as in the the effects might still be being felt so women descended from plow using
00:09:06,00:09:12,societies are much less likely to work outside the home or BMPs or run businesses whereas in
00:09:12,00:09:17,countries like Rwanda and Botswana and Madagascar which are mostly hoe using places and everyone's
00:09:17,00:09:22,giggling again but in those countries women are much likely to be in the labour force
00:09:22,00:09:28,because of but what's the reason that it drove women out is it the weight of the plow so it was
00:09:28,00:09:33,when people had to pull the plow or direct the animals exactly the first world plow champion
00:09:33,00:09:39,was a guy called Jim Eccles from Ontario and the only writer if I could find said that he was so shy
00:09:39,00:09:45,he only entered because his friends taught him into it and the second champion was Hugh Bar of
00:09:45,00:09:51,Antrim and Eccles only came eighth in this competition because according to the article I read he had
00:09:51,00:09:57,the bad luck of drawing a plot with a bump in it oh so it's all down to how lucky you were with
00:09:57,00:10:03,your little bit of field it's true and all the international competitors in that second one
00:10:03,00:10:08,which was in Ireland hated it because they had stony fields in Ireland and you didn't get stony
00:10:08,00:10:12,fields anywhere else around the world so you have to clear the stones out of the way I think before
00:10:12,00:10:17,you start so Richard Herring who's new podcast is about him clearing stones from fields is he
00:10:17,00:10:27,secretly training for the next international athlete now championship okay it is time for fact
00:10:27,00:10:33,number two and that is James okay my fat this week is that the American centre for disease control
00:10:33,00:10:41,has warned against kissing hedgehogs how come because they can give you illness they can give you
00:10:41,00:10:48,salmonella specifically and there have been eleven in January they said that there have been eleven
00:10:48,00:10:54,people in eight states who've got a strain of salmonella and in ten of the eleven cases the people
00:10:54,00:11:01,had reported recent contact with the hedgehog it's too much to be coincidence it's too much it's too
00:11:01,00:11:08,much I can only think that the eleventh person is lying this happened in Missouri in Minnesota in
00:11:08,00:11:14,Colorado main Mississippi in Nebraska Texas and Wyoming and we already knew that hedgehogs can give
00:11:14,00:11:18,you salmonella but it seems like it's a particularly bad strain at the moment in America it's so widely
00:11:18,00:11:23,spread across all the different states that it makes you think as though each state has one person
00:11:23,00:11:26,and they all know each other and they just have a hedgehog kissing club and they just like sending
00:11:26,00:11:33,videos around to each other or it could be just one widely traveled hedgehog who's just going
00:11:33,00:11:39,around attacking people is it French kissing that they're doing with the hedgehogs or is it just
00:11:39,00:11:45,it doesn't specify but I think it's nuzzling okay right if you imagine like a you could do that
00:11:45,00:11:49,if you had a small child with a hedgehog wouldn't you if I had a pet hedgehog I would definitely
00:11:49,00:11:58,kiss it at some point would you yeah okay I get attached it's edible right so they don't even have
00:11:58,00:12:03,to have snogged it some hedgehog come on just been near it and it's got in the dust between the
00:12:03,00:12:07,hedgehog and the cousin can do but it dies quite quickly in the air I think maybe you hold the hedgehog
00:12:07,00:12:13,and then you put it down and you suck your finger for the reason you like so you're bigger for any
00:12:13,00:12:18,reason yeah although you shouldn't uh incidentally while we're on giving advice about what to do with
00:12:18,00:12:27,hedgehogs you shouldn't have sex with them because in 2007 a Serbian man needed emergency surgery
00:12:27,00:12:31,after he had sex with a hedgehog on a witch doctor's advice she told him it would cure his premature
00:12:31,00:12:37,ejaculation and it actually just left him severely lacerated because they're covered in needles
00:12:37,00:12:47,any who sorry Salmanella yeah so other other animals in the US that can give you Salmanella or
00:12:47,00:12:52,that have given people Salmanella in the last few years include chickens ducklings guinea pigs frogs
00:12:52,00:12:59,turtles geckos and bearded dragons who have all given people Salmanella recently all from kissing or
00:12:59,00:13:04,from I don't know I don't know what kind of he's saying undercooked bearded dragons you know when he
00:13:04,00:13:09,is slightly undercooked bearded dragons you often feel sick afterwards uh turtle was in that list and
00:13:09,00:13:13,I was reading a story of um in China that was a man who made the news not too long ago because he
00:13:13,00:13:19,decided to get rid of his pet turtle so he was releasing it back into the wild and as he did so he
00:13:19,00:13:24,decided to give it a goodbye kiss um but unfortunately it was a snapping turtle and it grabbed onto
00:13:24,00:13:31,his lower lip and refused to let go um and you can see video footage of his face uh which does not
00:13:31,00:13:36,look good basically it kind of locked on and didn't come off um yeah so don't kiss turtles as
00:13:36,00:13:44,another thing just don't kiss other animals is that as well isn't it well there's a series a study uh
00:13:44,00:13:49,I think it was in 2015 and it was analysing you know how people kiss their dogs yeah yeah I mean I
00:13:49,00:13:54,include that in animals yeah no you're right but um it was at the University of Arizona and they
00:13:54,00:14:00,were trying to find out whether the microbes in dog guts might be good for humans okay and whether
00:14:00,00:14:06,they might actually it's like having a probiotic yogurt basically kissing a dog right um it is not
00:14:06,00:14:13,as delicious but this is really weird dogs and their owners end up having very similar gut bacteria
00:14:13,00:14:20,so it you end up with the same kind of microbiome and so the study was pairing people with dogs for
00:14:20,00:14:25,three months and testing them to see if there was any change yeah is that so does that mean it's a good
00:14:25,00:14:29,idea to kiss your dog because at least that you won't get a strange bacteria or it's kind of pointless
00:14:29,00:14:32,actually because you're not getting any new bacteria you didn't have already yeah I think they
00:14:32,00:14:37,were saying it could have good effects but also obviously it could have bad effects because what are
00:14:37,00:14:44,you for a piece of advice it probably means if you have your dogs bacteria in your stomach then it
00:14:44,00:14:58,would be easier for you to digest um dog food yeah come brexit do you guys know the what do you
00:14:58,00:15:06,think is the food stuff that most commonly gives people salmonella chicken eggs it's salmon or it's a
00:15:06,00:15:11,bit of salmon I used to think that I used to think salmon really salmon other yeah sorry it was just
00:15:11,00:15:18,found by a guy called salmon salmon no it salad or something it is yeah it's leafy greens um so I
00:15:18,00:15:23,didn't know this we don't give them enough stick it's cucumber and melon are responsible for
00:15:23,00:15:29,are responsible for 20% of cases of salmonella whereas chicken is only 19 oh what a stupid
00:15:29,00:15:35,hey it just overtook it the last minute I'm immediately going to go home throw away the balance
00:15:35,00:15:42,I replaced them with raw chickens anyway this is true and generally meat so chicken beef and pork
00:15:42,00:15:48,account for 33% of salmonella poisonings whereas leafy greens again a huge lead with 35%
00:15:49,00:15:54,um so we never talk about that and is I think the salmonella you get from salmonella you get from
00:15:54,00:16:00,the meats can be a more virulent strain so it produces the most deaths but really avoid salad I
00:16:00,00:16:04,think is the next big advice I think that's good advice um you said that it was invented it was
00:16:04,00:16:11,discovered by mr. Salmon um actually discovered by his assistant the abol smith uh Daniel
00:16:11,00:16:16,Salmon was the other guy uh and the abol smith was also the first person to discover that text could
00:16:16,00:16:22,spread disease and he also discovered anaphylaxis did you know oh he's quite a big deal that is a big deal
00:16:22,00:16:28,feels like he didn't get the credit he deserved there no smith anella is probably a hard word to say
00:16:28,00:16:35,you're right andaphylaxis is sometimes called the theobold smith predominant um but again don't
00:16:35,00:16:40,use that in conversation because people have no idea what I think if you're ringing 999 when someone's
00:16:40,00:16:45,having anaphylactic shock don't say he's suffering the theobold smith predominant sound clever
00:16:45,00:16:52,um hedgehogs yeah yeah there was a tradition in the Victorian times of having a hedgehog in your
00:16:52,00:16:59,kitchen to go around eating insects oh wow hedgehogs seem to make quite fun pets for some people so they
00:16:59,00:17:03,love running in their wheels didn't know there's a love running in their wheels more than anything so
00:17:03,00:17:07,like a hamster but more enthusiastic and I was on these sites which were saying which were giving
00:17:07,00:17:11,advice about how to keep hedgehogs they were saying you've got to take the wheel away as soon as
00:17:11,00:17:16,the hedgehog gets pregnant because they love the wheel so much that they'll keep running while they
00:17:16,00:17:20,give birth for instance wow they'll often then trample down the thing they've just given birth to
00:17:20,00:17:24,because they'll keep running no way they won't look after their babies because they're too busy running
00:17:24,00:17:29,in the wheel and sometimes they pick up the little hoglets so that's what you call the little hedgehogs
00:17:29,00:17:32,in their mouth to take them onto the wheel so at least they're with them but then they'll just run
00:17:32,00:17:37,over them it's like heroin it's like heroin yeah it's like hedgehog heroin that's another thing
00:17:37,00:17:42,you shouldn't indulge them while pregnant I believe a special advice that's amazing that's incredible
00:17:42,00:17:50,yeah pretty pregnancy they have very loud sex hedgehogs yep very loud sex especially with
00:17:50,00:17:53,the sleeping with a man from Serbia oh my god sake already
00:17:53,00:18:02,but they do have loud sex even when having sex with each other and there was a man in Germany
00:18:02,00:18:06,who called police once who's in his apartment he was reporting heavy panting happening under the
00:18:06,00:18:11,common stairwell in his house so we called the police saying can you stop these heavy panters
00:18:11,00:18:18,the police came round and they just found two mating hedgehogs under the stairs and as the police
00:18:18,00:18:24,spokesperson said we just found two hedgehogs loudly engaged ensuring the continuity of their species
00:18:24,00:18:29,and so they left them to it yeah because they last a long time which is why they could they were
00:18:29,00:18:33,still doing it when the police came round they can go on for hours which again I guess is why
00:18:33,00:18:38,they're particularly good it's more satirical
00:18:38,00:18:47,okay it's time for fact number three and that is my fact my fact is scientists have finally worked
00:18:47,00:18:54,out what time it is on Saturn and what time is it um it's well yeah uh we don't know it's we know
00:18:54,00:18:59,how long we we know how long that I can't tell you exactly right now what time it is on Saturn
00:18:59,00:19:02,I can tell you how long a day is on Saturn and that's what they've worked out it's 10 hours
00:19:02,00:19:09,33 minutes and 38 seconds now this is new from what we thought decades ago up by as the article says
00:19:09,00:19:16,several minutes it's it's a very interesting reason of how they found it out so Cassini which was
00:19:16,00:19:21,the spacecraft which has been taking all the images that we have a Saturn it's it was an incredible
00:19:21,00:19:27,mission that is ended now I believe that the Cassini is actually burnt up into Saturn's atmosphere now
00:19:28,00:19:34,but everyone was looking for how long it took to rotate um by looking at the planet and there was a
00:19:34,00:19:40,student of astronomy at UC Santa Cruz who started looking at the data about the rings of Saturn and
00:19:40,00:19:45,what they noticed that the rings themselves started taking impressions off them kind of like how if
00:19:45,00:19:51,you were having a earthquake on earth you could use seismology to work out how strong it was say
00:19:51,00:19:56,they were noticing that a similar thing was going on with the core of Saturn that was releasing
00:19:56,00:20:03,certain seismological waves that were being recorded in the rings so what the guy did was he made a
00:20:03,00:20:09,simulation of how fast the core would be turning by using the waves that were imprinted on the ring
00:20:09,00:20:13,on a computer simulation and by doing that was able to match it up with what the spin would be
00:20:13,00:20:19,and that came out at 10 hours 33 minutes and 38 seconds oh well when when they discovered the rings
00:20:19,00:20:24,it was a pretty confusing episode so Galileo the first person to observe the rings and describe
00:20:24,00:20:30,them poor guy this is in 1610 and he saw it with a telescope and he sent this cryptic message to
00:20:30,00:20:35,Kepler saying I've seen the highest triform planet and Kepler told King Rudolph and Rudolph said what
00:20:35,00:20:40,the hell you on about Galileo and he Galileo said I think it's three planets side by side because he
00:20:40,00:20:45,was sort of seeing it as three um but then so he wanted to have another look at it so he waited a
00:20:45,00:20:50,couple of years for some reason and then um after a couple of years what he didn't realize was that
00:20:50,00:20:57,he was observing them at the Saturn ring plane crossing so that is when Earth crosses like into
00:20:57,00:21:03,the exact plane of Saturn's rings so it happens about once every 13 to 15 years and at that point
00:21:03,00:21:06,because they're so flat if you're looking at them face on you can't see anything
00:21:06,00:21:12,so Galileo looked they'd totally gone and he was really freaked out he thought I have no idea what's
00:21:12,00:21:16,gone on them so so it seems like I've lied that's bad luck it's really bad how often does that happen
00:21:16,00:21:22,every 13 to 15 years god so it's the same thing of that timing you know if we didn't look again we
00:21:22,00:21:26,would assume that it didn't have it but it was just that little blip yeah where suddenly it just
00:21:26,00:21:31,doesn't to us yeah and then it's going again a bit later oh yeah yeah the second check how did
00:21:31,00:21:35,you know it was the same one I would have thought I've just seen a different one a different planet
00:21:35,00:21:41,yeah yeah I guess that's what astronomers do for living isn't it they could predict where
00:21:41,00:21:46,the planets were going to be they knew which was which yeah he was a smart guy Andy okay well
00:21:46,00:21:50,not that you're not but probably in different ways yeah I would like to see him improvising the
00:21:50,00:21:57,Jane Austen play I think we all would actually love that amazing I'd actually go and see
00:21:57,00:22:05,"but the rings of Saturn they're 180,000 miles wide and they're only 300 feet high yeah"
00:22:05,00:22:10,always that that's crazy isn't there 400 kilometers wide like the actual ring bit there so they're
00:22:10,00:22:16,that many miles across around the from one end of the ring to the very first on the other side
00:22:16,00:22:21,of the planet yeah yeah but yeah they are incredibly flat I think someone worked out that if they were
00:22:21,00:22:26,the equivalent of paper so if they were the thickness of paper then you need a sheet of paper that
00:22:26,00:22:33,was 1.7 miles across wow that's the equivalent there's a theory that I just saw in the new scientists
00:22:33,00:22:37,this afternoon which says that the planet Pluto might be a billion comets squished together
00:22:37,00:22:43,that's how all the planets are really aren't they they're just bits of rock and dust squished
00:22:43,00:22:47,together I guess I think there was an alternative theory but I have I literally just saw it as we
00:22:47,00:22:53,sat down so yeah it's not even even Saturn began as a pebble just begins as a pebble going around
00:22:53,00:22:59,and then another pebble squashes into it and then bigger pebbles bigger pebbles if actually you've got
00:22:59,00:23:04,Saturn that's quite that's such a nice fable you'll make a great dodgy your kids feeling a bit small
00:23:04,00:23:10,you can always say even Saturn was once a pebble that's great yeah look at him now look at him now
00:23:10,00:23:16,oh huh did you guys know just speaking of sort of time and space that there are two different days
00:23:16,00:23:22,on earth we have two different days there are seven in a week oh my god I've been saying that all wrong
00:23:22,00:23:26,oh my god what's half a juice day it's not Monday again
00:23:26,00:23:33,it's invigorating no there are two different types of day on earth so there's a solar day
00:23:33,00:23:39,which is the one that we know which is the 24 hour day actually the more legit day so if I asked you
00:23:40,00:23:48,what is the definition of a solar day how quickly we spin round yeah how many degrees have you spun
00:23:48,00:23:54,around yeah three six yeah in correct it's actually a tiny bit more than 360 so a sedereal day
00:23:54,00:24:02,is 23 hours and 56 minutes and that's how quickly the earth does one rotation of 360 degrees but
00:24:02,00:24:07,actually because we are also rotating around the Sun every time the earth rotates in order to get
00:24:07,00:24:12,from midday one day to exactly midday the other it needs to spin that tiny bit more because he moved
00:24:12,00:24:17,around a bit more so our 24 hour day is actually you're spinning around a bit more than 360 degrees
00:24:17,00:24:24,and I didn't know that how does that affect our working life and pay and stuff well so I think
00:24:24,00:24:29,what you can say is actually the day is four minutes shorter than you thought so you can go home
00:24:29,00:24:35,from work four minutes earlier than new plans great yeah let's do it yeah finished now
00:24:35,00:24:41,just stop this podcast four minutes before the end yeah yeah so do you know how long a day is on
00:24:41,00:24:48,the Sun how long it takes the Sun to rotate once on its axis yeah and as opposed to when it's
00:24:48,00:24:58,light which is all the time it's 24.5 earth days on the equator but 34 earth days at the poles and
00:24:58,00:25:01,this is always a problem isn't it because they're big gas things and things are spinning at different
00:25:01,00:25:05,speeds yeah so if you're on a holiday you would have your holiday at the pole of the Sun
00:25:05,00:25:11,because you get you get longer still hot this time of year yeah I don't know if you want longer I
00:25:11,00:25:14,think you want to shorten that holiday as much as possible if you're holidaying on the Sun don't you
00:25:14,00:25:19,well and I see you've got very good good factor good factor Sun cream yeah okay that's amazing though
00:25:19,00:25:27,it has two different days or three and it's different days okay yeah so Saturn the Saturn is a god
00:25:27,00:25:33,in Roman mythology right um so there's also Jupiter Jupiter all the planets are gods basically
00:25:33,00:25:38,not earth apart from earth all the power unless you can't guy who's Greek goddess
00:25:38,00:25:47,but Jupiter's far Jupiter the fifth planet then the Saturn the sixth Jupiter's father is Saturn right
00:25:47,00:25:54,right and then the next planet is Uranus and Uranus is the father of Saturn so Jupiter
00:25:54,00:26:00,next planet father next planet father the solar system is basically a big who do you think you are
00:26:00,00:26:07,yeah in some traditions Mars the fourth planet is the son of Jupiter so that so yeah it's like a
00:26:07,00:26:14,family tree going outwards that's a way you can remember and so is Uranus's father Neptune
00:26:14,00:26:18,I think we didn't know about Neptune and the father of all the gods is that cartoon duck
00:26:18,00:26:26,that is really cool that's really yeah Pluto knocked out because that just didn't work for the
00:26:26,00:26:37,system it actually is a planet but they're like okay it is time for our final fact of the show and
00:26:37,00:26:44,that is Chazinski my fact is that the first ever blood transfusion to be a scientifically recorded
00:26:44,00:26:48,used a goose quill to connect an artery in the neck of one dog to the joggular vein in the neck of
00:26:48,00:26:56,another and it was successful the dog was okay one of the dogs was okay it was half a success it was
00:26:56,00:27:01,a hot well the dog was okay that they wanted to be okay the dog that was receiving blood exactly
00:27:01,00:27:06,so it's actually quite mean this was done in 1666 by a guy called Richard Lauer or Lauer who was
00:27:06,00:27:11,from Cornwall and he traveled up to the Royal Society in London and did it in front of an audience
00:27:11,00:27:16,and he apparently got a medium sized dog I don't know why the size was that relevant but he severed
00:27:16,00:27:22,its jugular and blood it until it was approaching death and then thought okay cool now we can see if
00:27:22,00:27:28,we can save this dog and he did that by then sort of severing the artery of a secondary dog attaching
00:27:28,00:27:33,a quill between the two and siphoning the blood from the secondary dog into the next one but then
00:27:33,00:27:38,you need a third dog to save the second dog and indeed yeah they call that day the massacre of 500
00:27:38,00:27:43,dogs no don't you ever be the massacre of one it's only over the last dog on the congular
00:27:43,00:27:49,yeah could you not like put it in like a circle so that everyone gets everyone else oh yeah wow he
00:27:49,00:27:53,should have done that I don't know why he didn't do two gruse quills and swap them but no he didn't
00:27:53,00:27:57,he just bled you put in a second quill at the back end of the dog couldn't you one in the neck of
00:27:57,00:28:01,the dog and one in the bum of the dog don't think it works like that doesn't it and then you get the
00:28:01,00:28:05,blood just going round you know you've got two hearts you've got two circulatory systems yeah just
00:28:05,00:28:13,like a circuit I don't know that doesn't go for the head to the bum and the back end I think that would
00:28:13,00:28:18,work yeah you said the transfusion came to an end when the emittant dog which is the one who gave
00:28:18,00:28:26,the blood began to cry and faint and fall into convulsions and the last die oh yeah they weren't
00:28:26,00:28:31,the animal rights weren't as strong in the olden days yeah but it was successful which is kind of
00:28:31,00:28:35,weird actually because just like humans really when you're doing blood transfusions in pets it's good
00:28:35,00:28:41,to have the same blood type I think dogs have same blood type I know cats have a a b and b yeah I
00:28:41,00:28:46,think they're different a's and b's aren't they as in their different proteins on the oh are they
00:28:46,00:28:51,I believe so yeah but hang on would it would that's a I've never considered that would a great
00:28:51,00:28:58,day and have different types of blood to a scotty no so all dogs so all dogs can give blood to
00:28:58,00:29:03,all other dogs but I feeling they can't give its humans because of the pro the antigens on the
00:29:03,00:29:07,yes although I didn't know they could give it to all other dogs I think so it's the same species
00:29:07,00:29:11,isn't it it's just different yeah but all humans can't give blood to all other humans oh sorry no
00:29:11,00:29:15,yeah you're right yeah so it's the same as humans as in a scotty and a tie patient now the
00:29:15,00:29:21,yes yeah yeah yeah yeah if you're a bird any kind of bird then you can have a transfusion from
00:29:21,00:29:26,any other kind of bird wow so rubbing could donate to an ostrich but you'd need quite a lot of
00:29:26,00:29:38,rubbins that's incredible yeah so donating blood between animals they started you know injecting
00:29:38,00:29:42,blood from let's say a calf into a person that was a few a year later after this first experiment
00:29:42,00:29:47,and he died so it was banned for a long time the person died yeah but there was this weird
00:29:47,00:29:54,rash of cases in the mid 19th century where doctors just started saying well milk will probably
00:29:54,00:29:59,work just as well and putting milk into people's bloodstreams directly yeah yeah they thought because
00:29:59,00:30:03,it's got these little oily droplets and fatty droplets they thought well they might turn into white
00:30:03,00:30:09,blood cells and they just there were two doctors called bovell and Hodder and this is all from I found
00:30:09,00:30:14,this a journal called transfusion and this is the 1969 edition but they wrote up the whole thing
00:30:14,00:30:19,and their first patient was said to respond dramatically to 12 ounces of cow's milk
00:30:20,00:30:24,but two other patients who they transfused the following week died and people kept dying as well
00:30:24,00:30:34,when they say it was pondermatically and it happened and for 25 years at least
00:30:34,00:30:38,that people were just putting milk into your blood well they started that's how they started doing
00:30:38,00:30:43,it even in the 17th century so Christopher rendered a lot of this bizarrely before he got into building
00:30:43,00:30:48,cathedrals but he was involved with which allowed with his first transfusion and he used to inject
00:30:48,00:30:54,"dogs with water, milk, beer, wine and opium to see if any of them were just blood transfusions."
00:30:54,00:30:58,He once said I have injected wine and ale into a living dog into the mass of blood by a vein
00:30:58,00:31:04,in good quantities till I have made him extremely drunk but soon after he pisseth it out
00:31:04,00:31:12,but also the idea of putting animal blood into humans there was a big theological debate about
00:31:12,00:31:16,what you would be doing if you were putting foreign blood into someone else's body because
00:31:16,00:31:21,supposedly the soul would be contained inside some of that blood so you're altering the whole
00:31:21,00:31:26,person so what they used to plan out was if they were going for someone who was a bit wild they
00:31:26,00:31:31,would get sheep's blood because that was a calm nurturing Jesus-like animal would then give
00:31:31,00:31:37,a sort of balance of a soul to this wild character equally if they had someone who was very shy
00:31:37,00:31:42,they might adopt an animal that had a bit more of a wild attitude and the idea was to inject
00:31:42,00:31:49,them with that blood although a sociable Jesus-like lamb lamb lamb lamb lamb of God okay yeah yeah
00:31:49,00:31:55,similarities there's a weird thing this is so on just taking blood and putting it into other people
00:31:55,00:31:59,we've said before you know the secret service in America they have several pints of the president's
00:31:59,00:32:06,blood type in his car which is pretty cool but I read this piece in the Atlantic about how the
00:32:06,00:32:12,secret service was protecting Barack Obama's DNA because you know we all shed millions of cells
00:32:12,00:32:18,a day yeah so the DNA is intact so if you let's say the president shook hands with you and you got a
00:32:18,00:32:24,few live cells or he sneezed and he threw away the tissue you could make you can now make cells
00:32:24,00:32:32,into other cell types so you could make synthetic sperm cells from the president's sneeze in a tissue
00:32:32,00:32:35,and then you can you know they can't fertilize eggs with them but you could say oh look we've
00:32:35,00:32:42,got evidence of this so they could what you could say they might clone Barack Obama or I think it's
00:32:42,00:32:48,not exactly that you'd make another president but you could one another but why do you want another
00:32:48,00:32:54,who doesn't want to know why stay you I'll take a sterile sperm cell of Barack Obama is president of
00:32:54,00:33:00,America but you could so you could fabricate evidence of an affair or you can or for example you
00:33:00,00:33:06,can analyze the genetic markers of diseases that you could say well he's more prone to outzymas
00:33:06,00:33:11,or to this heart disease and you could cast out on their legitimacy that way truth that he was
00:33:11,00:33:18,born in Africa yeah so yeah so these this is a real problem so presumably they have Trump's DNA as
00:33:18,00:33:27,well I think a lot of people have Trump's DNA in Japan a blood type is a super important thing
00:33:27,00:33:32,isn't it I don't think we've mentioned before I think we've done it on QI but it's on job applications
00:33:32,00:33:37,and stuff it's so related to thought to be so related to who you are and what you're like kind
00:33:37,00:33:42,of like how we see maybe star signs but much more believed in and invested in and yeah you'll have
00:33:42,00:33:46,to say on your application what blood type you are but they I mean saying horoscopes they in the
00:33:46,00:33:53,morning TV shows in Japan they have the blood type horoscopes they do do that and yeah and on an
00:33:53,00:33:59,Asian Asian countries on their Facebook profiles that tends to be a thing and you're about you would
00:33:59,00:34:04,have your blood type in there because it tells you a lot about who you are for potential you know I
00:34:04,00:34:09,didn't even know what my blood type was until earlier this year that's weird isn't it I still don't
00:34:09,00:34:15,know I don't know I don't know I always call my mom whenever I need to know it she knows it well
00:34:15,00:34:35,she's very deaf though so she always says hey thanks mom okay that's it that is all of our facts thank
00:34:35,00:34:39,you so much for listening if you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that
00:34:39,00:34:43,we have said over the course of this podcast we can be found on our Twitter accounts I'm on
00:34:43,00:34:49,at Shriberland Andy at Andrew Hunter James James Harkin and Anna you can email podcast at qi.com
00:34:49,00:34:54,yep or you can go to our group account at no such thing or our website no such thing as a fish.com
00:34:54,00:34:59,we have all of our previous episodes up there we also have a page of links to all the tour dates
00:34:59,00:35:03,that we're going to be playing in the next few months and look out for some European ones very
00:35:03,00:35:09,exciting we're going to a place called Europe okay we'll be back again next week with another
00:35:09,00:35:22,episode we'll see you then goodbye
