00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
 Hey, Clubfish members, welcome to this compilation episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.120
 This is all the outtakes and bloopers and bits that just didn't fit the main narrative

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the episodes that go out on the main feed, but stuff that we thought is too good to lose.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.960
 So you can hear the voices of me, Anna, James and Andy, but also you're going to hear Malcolm

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 Gladwell, Angela Barnes and Steve Mould, who all make little cameos along the way in

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 this episode.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.240
 I just want to quickly remind you as well before we start, a lot of stuff going on with

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 the fish at the moment.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.520
 There's the Discord, which if you haven't got to, I highly recommend nosuchthingasafish.com/fishcord.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.840
 It's where a lot of the people who are part of this Clubfish membership are hanging out

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.240
 and just chatting literally every day about everything.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 There's general fish chat, to recent episode chat, to fax fax fax, which is a thread where

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.840
 everyone's just putting in their own fax.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.160
 There's the No Such Thing as the cutest pet, everyone's uploading photos of their pets.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.240
 There's meetups where people are saying, "Where do you live?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.240
 Do you live in my city?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.240
 People have a group meetup."

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.600
 There's book recommendations, movie recommendations, TV, music.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.880
 It's a whole world of interesting chat, and it's all exclusive to the Clubfish members.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.640
 So, if you're paying for this Patreon, if you're hearing this right now, you are eligible

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.040
 to join it, so get in there and start chatting away.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.480
 Okay, enough of me waffling on, let's get on with the compilation.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:29.320
 Here you go, on with the show.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.040
 It was used medicinally a lot, wasn't it, sort of seaweed back in the day.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.120
 There was a story I was reading about Francis Bacon.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.800
 Francis Bacon, there used to be that thing we spoke about before of grinding up mummy

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.080
 and skull and bones and all that sort of stuff.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.320
 When that wasn't available, supposedly Francis Bacon started a little trend of crushing up

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.360
 moss with skull.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 So it was a moss and skull thing, sorry, rather than seaweed.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.400
 And you would put that in your nostrils, and you would eat it and so on, and that became

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.040
 another kind of version of that, yeah.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.560
 There's a Northern Irish version of kerrigan called dulce, and you eat that, you eat it

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.160
 in candy and stuff like that.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.160
 But one way they use it now is as a vegetarian substitute for bacon.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.160
 Really?

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.480
 Not Francis Bacon.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.120
 Good, because it's a bit salty.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.080
 It's salty, yeah, and in Northern Ireland, you can still get this, I think, it's a candy

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.440
 called yellowman and dulce.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 And it's like, you know what's it called, that stuff?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.920
 It's like honeycomb, and then this seaweed on the side of it, and so it's sugary and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.520
 also salty, and it's like, you know, salted caramel became a thing like 20 years ago.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.040
 I mean, there's some hundred years before that.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.120
 That sounds quite good, actually.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.120
 It does.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 Honeycomb with moss.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 It sounds like a nice...

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 It's a dulce.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 Honeycomb with moss is also a good name for a detective couple.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800
 It is.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.680
 I'm Sean Honeycomb, and I'm Janet Moss.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
 Oh, see, I would've...

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.760
 You're gonna go the other way round.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760
 Well done.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
 Well, I like to subvert.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.800
 It only really works if that is a thing, honeycomb and moss, right?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.440
 Otherwise, the pun doesn't really work, because you'd have to explain to your viewers that

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.400
 there is a thing called...

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.440
 I think episode one is some extensive food history.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.640
 That's how all good detective dramas begin.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.200
 I quite like, just separate to the actual screen time itself, just how much information

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.960
 is in our phone now, not within the body of it, as in not within the metadata, but the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.440
 actual physical bacteria that's sitting on top of it.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.920
 If you swab phones now, they're able to tell so many things about us.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.480
 They're able to tell us where you've been, what medicine you might be on, what you just

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.920
 ate for your last meal.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.320
 We're basically just implanting a footprint onto the face of our phone each day.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.760
 So if you lost someone's phone, you could probably tell everything about it.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760
 Who's it was?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760
 Who's it was?

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.400
 Yeah, apparently, our phones at this point, because we're so careless with them in the

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.480
 way that we put them down, the bacteria on it is something like 17,000 bits of bacteria

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.600
 latch onto it.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.920
 It's dirtier than an average toilet, yet we're holding it to our heads every day.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.680
 I always have slight doubts about that stat, as in...

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.880
 Yeah, who's counting?

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.680
 It can't be dirtier than the average toilet.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680
 It can't...

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680
 Poo's on their phone.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.440
 It's not those kind of bacteria, is it?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 You've not got the toilet paper hat, have you?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.400
 There is always panic, obviously, about new technologies, although this does seem markedly

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 different because it's so all-consuming, but I always like going back through old records

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.280
 to see what people were saying about new stuff.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.960
 So like with the printing press, there was real fear for about 100 years that it would

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.440
 cause a massive overload of books and information, huge overabundance.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.440
 People wouldn't be able to handle it.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.720
 Turns out all of that turns out to be true.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
 Yeah.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.640
 Well, I was thinking, has this been disproved?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.880
 There was a tract written in 1545 saying that Princes and Kings had to deal with this and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.560
 sort of ban people from having books because of this confusing and harmful abundance of

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.560
 information.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.840
 But maybe that's where we went wrong, books.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840
 Yeah.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 Maybe this is...

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840
 Let's go to the source.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.840
 Yeah.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.600
 Burn the printing presses.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.480
 I found a superhero who derives his powers from seaweed.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.480
 Yeah.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.760
 So this was a character, I think it was created by DC, and the idea was they wanted a version

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.000
 of Popeye, and they wanted someone who could take on Superman.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.800
 So I think it kind of was a parody, but it sort of also reads as if they introduced it

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 as a real thing.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.080
 So Captain Horatio Strong, he was called, and he used to eat seaweed, which was called

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.320
 Sancha, and Sancha was basically an alien origin seaweed, which I think he might not

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.120
 have known at the time, because he then finds out that it is and he becomes addicted to

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.120
 it.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.120
 So it's kind of a bit like a...

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.320
 It's a drug addict story, really.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.160
 And he has to go cold turkey on the seaweed, so he quits the seaweed, and he then returns

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.640
 to natural level of strength as a normal human would have.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.160
 And the only surviving bit of this alien seaweed, he keeps on his houseboat, and he keeps it

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.040
 there as a way to sort of look at it and sort of tempt himself into a strong will of not

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040
 having to have it.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040
 Sort of there.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040
 So he gives up his superpowers.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040
 Yeah.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.040
 Wow.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.040
 I would have thought he would...

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.040
 Also, firstly, you don't get many superheroes who live on houseboats, I think that's quite

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.040
 a nice touch.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040
 Yeah, that's rare.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.120
 I also think like Popeye, by the way, missing a trick, not eating seaweed, because he's

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120
 a sailor man, right?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.120
 He is a sailor man.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.880
 And where do you not grow spinach in the middle of the sea?

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880
 Such a good point.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.880
 Yeah.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:20.880
 But you do get seaweeds.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.880
 You do get seaweeds.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:22.880
 Yeah.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880
 Yeah.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.440
 Lots of superheroes are kind of addicts in one way or another.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.720
 Like Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde, he kind of gets addicted to...

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
 Is he a superhero?

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.720
 Is he a superhero?

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.840
 I missed that comic book.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.840
 Is he kids?

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.520
 He's a kind of... Sorry, yeah, he's a proto superhero, but he invents the formula to turn

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.520
 himself into...

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.520
 Yes.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.520
 ...bananaman.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520
 Who eats a banana when there comes a banana man?

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520
 Absolutely.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520
 He's addicted to bananas.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520
 He is.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520
 Frodo?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
 Addicted to the ring.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 Oh my God.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520
 Superhero.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520
 Oh my God.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.480
 Do you know, winning the lottery can also cause different kinds of problems.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.640
 So a couple of decades ago, there was the Grand Bay Waffle House, whereby there used to be

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.480
 a customer who was called Edward Seward, and he used to come in and he used to just, as

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.440
 a tip, leave a lottery ticket every single time.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.440
 That would be his thing.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:08.440
 Okay.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.680
 So this day, the waitress who was there was called Tonda Dickerson, and the numbers came

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.080
 up and she won $10 million.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.080
 And this was an amazing thing.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.600
 So then she got the offer of, "Do you want to have it as the full $10 million or do you

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.680
 want to break it up over 30 years so she would get $375,000 every year?"

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
 She picked that option.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 Good idea.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.680
 All of a sudden, chaos just erupted.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.920
 Someone who worked there said, "Hang on, there's an unspoken rule that should anyone have ever

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.280
 won this, it would be split amongst us all."

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.280
 Oh, an unspoken rule.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.280
 That's a tricky one.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280
 Yeah.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.280
 Sorry.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.960
 How much spoken is what they claimed.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960
 Oh, okay.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960
 Okay.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960
 We all just assumed.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.960
 Sorry.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.960
 Absolutely.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.960
 Okay.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960
 Okay.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960
 Yeah.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960
 Understanding.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960
 Yeah.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.680
 And so they took her to court and the court said, "Yeah, it needs to be split," but then

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.880
 she had that overturned.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.640
 Then there was the guy who left the ticket himself saying, "I should be getting some of

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.120
 the benefit of this."

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.120
 Yeah.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
 Oh, no.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120
 You leave a lottery ticket behind.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.960
 I think he said that there was also a spoken rule that he would get some sort of truck

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 as a compensation.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.960
 She never got.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960
 Can't get this in writing.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.240
 This is why we asked Malcolm to sign a release form.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.440
 This is why you get his contracts down in writing.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440
 You get signatures.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440
 Yeah.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.680
 And then the ex-husband got involved and actually tried to kidnap her at one point.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.680
 Yeah.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.120
 It was all horrific and then the IRS got involved and they wanted bigger amounts of the tax that

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.120
 they had taken off.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.520
 It was hell for her to win it and not even for the benefits of people asking for money.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520
 It was people literally...

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:36.520
 But she could have just split...

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:40.040
 I mean, it's not that much hell for her because she could have just split it up equally between

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.920
 all the people who deserved it as was the unspoken or spoken agreement, couldn't she?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920
 Yes.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920
 My sympathy is limited.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920
 Just saying.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920
 It's a cautionary tale.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
 Isn't there a...

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.760
 That's why you should always win a hundred billions so you can have them all assassinated

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.760
 and...

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.160
 Did they split tips as a matter of course in a restaurant?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
 You usually would, right?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160
 I guess.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160
 Do you think that would be a precedent?

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.160
 That would...

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 I don't know.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160
 Some restaurants do and some restaurants don't.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160
 The question is whether that...

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.160
 Is it considered an ordinary...

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.160
 If it's...

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.160
 He left it as a tip.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.160
 Yeah.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
 That's a good point.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.160
 That's a good point.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160
 So, you know, I...

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.400
 Way back in time when I worked in restaurants, I was never a waiter, I was always the dishwasher.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.400
 We split...

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.280
 There was a policy that all tips were split.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.280
 Yeah.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
 It doesn't sound like...

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:26.280
 If there was a clear, I don't know, clear policy in place of splitting tips at this restaurant,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.760
 this whole thing wouldn't have arisen, right?

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.880
 She clearly had the expectation, she must have been keeping her tips.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.880
 Yeah.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880
 I'm with her.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.880
 Yeah.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 Oh, really?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880
 Yes.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880
 You think it's...

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
 In accordance with the restaurant policy, you're keeping your tips.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880
 You keep a 30 mil.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880
 I think you keep the...

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.880
 I mean, if she was...

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.600
 She should have turned around and out of the goodness of her heart, shared it, but they

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.040
 have no right to compel her to share it if to practice it in the restaurant was you keep

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040
 your own tips.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040
 Well, there you go.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.040
 We've got the case for the defense, the case for the prosecution.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.320
 That's where you do the whole thing.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.200
 I'll support whoever's willing to share the 30 million dollars, probably.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.120
 Karris is another similar-ish food.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.640
 It's also from 10th century Baghdad, which is fish tongues suspended in a concealed broth

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.680
 made of fish heads, boiled in vinegar.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680
 Where is the...

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.680
 Where do you conceal the broth?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.680
 What?

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.680
 Good point.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.680
 Oh my God.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.680
 Congealed.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680
 Congealed.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.680
 It's false.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:19.680
 Sorry.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:23.640
 You'll just have to trust me, the tongues are in there, but you know how to seal it.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640
 We'll bring the bill.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.760
 You won't be able to see the bill, but sorry.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:35.480
 One really cool way of taking chloroform was done by Anita Berber, who was a German dancer

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:42.800
 from the 1920s say, and she used to take some chloroform, put it in a bowl, and then stir

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.680
 it with a white rose, and then eat the rose petals, and that would be the way that she

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.680
 would get high.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:49.680
 Wow.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.680
 That's really cool.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:51.680
 That's classy.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.680
 It's quite sexy stuff.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:59.320
 It's quite a sexy dame if I can use the words from the '90s up from the '20s.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.560
 She did dances called cocaine, called morphium, quite often got naked in them.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560
 Dancers.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560
 Dancers.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560
 Yeah, she was a dancer.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560
 Cool.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560
 You wouldn't have thought it would improve your dancing, dosing up on chloroform beforehand.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560
 Was it a co-dance treat?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560
 I reckon she did it in...

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.560
 Yeah, a green room afterwards, probably.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560
 Yeah.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.160
 Like cocaine's going to give you one hell of a kick, isn't it?

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 Yes.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160
 Right.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.800
 She was a Budapest and Vienna for both places for removing all of her clothes, and she supposedly

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.640
 ended up in prison in Zagreb for six weeks after insulting the King of Yugoslavia.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.640
 Wow.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.640
 That's great.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640
 That's a great person.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640
 What are you in for?

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.640
 I'm mugging.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.640
 What about you?

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.080
 I insulted the King of Yugoslavia.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.720
 Apparently, the King came up to her.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.920
 She didn't know it was the King and said something in Serbian, I think.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.520
 And she said, "I don't understand your barbaric tongue."

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.520
 She said, "I'm French."

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.520
 What was her name?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
 Her name was Berber, though.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:51.520
 Anita Berber.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.560
 So it was kind of a clever joke, almost.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560
 Berberic.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560
 Berberic.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.560
 Oh, that is clever.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.560
 Yeah.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.560
 She probably knew her surname.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560
 She'll probably offer that as a defence.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560
 Probably didn't work.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:05.280
 There was another controversy, weirdly, just as we're talking about the raunchy side of

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.520
 chloroform, which is that it was frowned on partly because it caused erotic dreams.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.520
 Did it?

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.520
 Yeah.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.760
 So there was a chance that when it was used on women in labour, they would experience

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.200
 erotic visions.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.040
 And there was a French woman who confessed, this is actually a related thing.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.640
 This one is about Aether, which apparently had a similar effect.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.840
 One French woman confessed that under the influence of Aether, she had dreamed about

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.720
 having sexual intercourse with her own husband.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720
 Ugh, disgusting.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
 I know.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.280
 Because we all thought you were going to say baby, then.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.280
 I think we all thought we were watching you, believed.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.960
 I don't think any of us went to bed.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.960
 No.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.960
 They never just either went there.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:39.960
 No worries.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.800
 I've got one very final use of chloroform, which is just so weird that I wanted to mention

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800
 it.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 It's in this book, "Cloroform" by Linda Stratman.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800
 Yeah.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800
 I mean, there were various uses.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.040
 It was used to preserve meat in 1851.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.320
 It was used, it was inserted into the rectum to treat irritability.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.440
 You know, all of these uses...

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.120
 Irritability of the rectum, or just general irritability.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.120
 Yes, yes.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.120
 Okay.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
 So there were all these uses, right?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:05.520
 But in 1849, it was announced that chloroform could power a steamship.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.520
 Oh, okay.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.860
 And there was this test in the French port of Loréand.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:12.200
 The steamship went around.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.200
 How would it work?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.160
 Well, if it's steam, it doesn't matter what you're boiling, right?

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 Oh, I guess.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 Is that...

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
 Does it seem like a waste?

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
 I thought it was the...

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 I didn't think that was what the...

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.440
 As in I thought it was water powering or being powered by...

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.400
 It could be, but I mean, you could take some chloroform and boil it and then use that.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
 Yeah.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
 But I mean...

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.400
 It does seem like the entire crew would be unconscious.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.400
 Yeah.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.400
 Like the entire ship got going.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400
 Yeah, there's no further record.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400
 But it worked.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.400
 It worked.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400
 It happened.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.960
 And then there's no other trace of it being used again.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
 Wow.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.960
 Yeah.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:41.960
 A mystery.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960
 Wow.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:43.960
 Yeah.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.520
 Maybe there was that one 10 years when it was used for everything and it turns out to be

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.680
 brilliant for everything.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.040
 Then 10 years later, I thought, "Oh, what's that thing that we used?"

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:53.800
 Some illegible notes.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.800
 What is this?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 Have you guys heard of dark lightning?

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 No.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 Dark lightning.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 It doesn't exist.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.200
 No, it does.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.020
 It's basically something that can happen in a lightning storm.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.400
 But rather than being electricity as we know it, it's basically bursts of gamma rays.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400
 So it's radiation.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400
 Yeah.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.720
 And what will happen is if you get hit by dark lightning, you'd have to be flying for

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.000
 it to hit you really because it has to be quite high up.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.240
 It can't come all the way down to the ground.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:26.320
 But if you're in an aeroplane, for instance, if you're in a light aeroplane, you might

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.200
 get hit by it.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.280
 And if you're hit by it in a light aeroplane, you would get as much energetic radiation as

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.360
 you would get in basically an entire lifetime.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.360
 Oh, no.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.360
 All in one go.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120
 Oh, you mean as a passenger on the plane?

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.120
 Yeah.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.120
 You can't really cause cancer.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.120
 Oh, my God.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.480
 But you can't see it.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 It just happens.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
 You can't feel it.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 You can't see it.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
 You don't know you've been hit.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 So does this happen?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480
 So this could just happen?

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480
 It happens.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.480
 Are there plane loads of people who have cancer who find out?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.480
 It's rare.

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480
 It's rare.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:02.100
 And that's actually, I mean, if you know about aeroplane, flying an aeroplane, aeroplane

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.600
 rides, I always say.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.600
 They're outside the supermarket, aren't they?

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600
 You put a quid in.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.800
 I've been on loads of this.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.600
 If you fly an aeroplane, you do get more cancerous radiation than if you don't, and

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.120
 it's partly due to this kind of stuff.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120
 But a lifetime worth.

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120
 A lifetime.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120
 Yeah, that's a lot.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.960
 It's not the sort of thing, not sort of lifetime supplier you want to win.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960
 No.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.840
 You've lost a competition at that stage.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:29.120
 It's called the Velvet Revolution, the fall of Soviet Czechoslovakia in 1989, called that

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.440
 because it was bloodless.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.560
 In Slovakia, they call it the Gentle Revolution, and then in 1992 they split into Czechia or

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.760
 Czech Republic as it was then, and Slovakia, and that's sometimes called the Velvet Divorce.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.640
 But in 2017 there was a poll, and I think this is kind of still true, that 42% of Czechs

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.120
 and 40% of Slovaks don't really agree with what happened, and they would rather still

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:55.120
 be Czechoslovakia.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.440
 And in 1992 when it happened, it was 36% and 37% who wanted to split.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.920
 So largely speaking, I mean, obviously it's quite a big split, but a lot of people in

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.940
 the country didn't really want to split.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.960
 So we might be looking at a Velvet remarriage.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960
 That would be good.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.160
 Like a Burton-Taylor scenario.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.880
 Velvet Reformation of Vows.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:24.720
 And by Klav Havel, who I mentioned, who was in charge of, he was basically the president

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.120
 of the new Czechoslovakia.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:31.120
 Klav is a heroic anti-communist, he's an amazing revolutionary figure really.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.640
 Like still now, if you speak to any Czechoslovak people, he's a superstar.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.760
 He's a superhero.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:37.760
 Superhero.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.600
 Oh, so drug addicts, lives on the houseboat.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.320
 But there's two places in Prague that are named after him, the airport and the new stage

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.360
 of the National Theatre, and he hated the theatre and he hated flying.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360
 That's great.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.600
 In your face.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:02.240
 On the subject of the inside of an anus, it is on the same subject.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.440
 Just gustatory cells that we have on our tongues.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.880
 We also have them in our digestive system.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.240
 So in your stomach and in your intestinal linings and stuff, there are, for example,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.040
 glucose receptors, just like the ones on your tongue.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.360
 It's good for your stomach to know that these things are in there so that they can send

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:26.520
 out the right enzymes and stuff to deal with it and pull those nutrients into your bloodstream.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.440
 But it's such a shame it doesn't get to the brain though.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.240
 It would be so fun if you ate and you could taste your food all the way down.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.640
 It's always a sad moment when you swallow your food and then that's over, isn't it?

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.840
 A sad moment, yeah.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840
 Whereas, yeah.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.520
 If you could keep enjoying the meal all the way through.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.520
 All the way through.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:43.720
 There would have to be a cut-off point at some point in your intestines.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.440
 Why not go all the way through until it comes out on the other end?

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.560
 If it tastes sweet, it's fine, right?

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:49.560
 Yeah, I mean if, if.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:54.640
 There will be a point where it's not a good look with a dragon's head or as all I'm saying.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.800
 It's amazing how long we've been able to predict eclipses, thousands of years.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800
 Yeah, it's really weird.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800
 Yeah.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.000
 Like in Brits of Humans, well done.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.240
 But it wasn't great news for a lot of people.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.160
 So ancient Mesopotamians in like the 2nd and 3rd millennia BC thought there was such bad

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:12.040
 news that, and so dangerous for the kingdom, that if there was eclipses coming, the king

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.940
 and queen would have to be removed from the throne and replaced by a substitute in case

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.960
 they were killed by this awful omen.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.960
 Oh, really?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960
 Yeah.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960
 And it happened so much over hundreds of years.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.960
 It's so cool.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.460
 So you'd, you'd take the king away, you'd hide him, and you'd get a replacement king.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.840
 You'd dress him up as a king.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.480
 Which would be just like a farmer or like.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.480
 Yeah, just a bloke, a gardener.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.480
 It wasn't like someone who was next in line.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480
 It was, yeah.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.200
 No, it's got to be the most lowly person possible because they might die.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.200
 Because they might die.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
 Why?

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.040
 What happens after the eclipse when, presumably, they haven't died?

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040
 They change back.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.200
 Well, if you're the farmer, surely you're like, well, I'm king now.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.200
 Yeah.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200
 Well, but here's the thing.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.200
 No, there's a couple of awkward things.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200
 First of all, you get killed as the farmer.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.200
 Yeah.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200
 Oh, you're joking.

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200
 Just in case.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200
 Yeah.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.200
 Have they secured my sign off on this arrangement as a farmer?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.560
 You're sacrificing yourself for the health of your country.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.560
 Yeah.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.560
 For the good of the king.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.560
 Well, that's what I've got a problem with.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.320
 I still feel like there's a loophole that you have become king.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.360
 And at that stage, you can say, you know, that rule about killing the farmer guy, let's

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360
 not do that anymore.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360
 Yeah.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360
 Yeah, that's true.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.680
 But there is an actual loophole, which is if the king does die in that period, the real

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.440
 king who's in hiding, the farmer then just stays.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.640
 So you've got an incentive as the farmer to then have the king assassinated during that

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.640
 period.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.640
 Exactly.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.640
 You've got a very narrow window of opportunity.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640
 Six minutes.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.000
 This is the ingredient of a very funny film, I think.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.360
 A very short film.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.360
 Yeah.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360
 Very short, yeah.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.360
 I didn't know that was a rule.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.400
 I did read, there was one instance where, so they didn't always kill the replacement,

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400
 they usually did.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.480
 But there was one person who didn't get killed, he just got to go back to being a gardener,

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480
 which is what he was.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.440
 He was called Enlil Barney.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.440
 And then the king who he'd replaced died a couple of years later, a short time afterwards,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.400
 and he was made king again.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.720
 And he actually ruled this area until this was in Babylonian times, and he was Babylonian

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.040
 king for 25 years.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040
 Wow.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040
 That's good.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.040
 Was he a good king?

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.600
 Did he just force everyone to have really nice gardens?

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.540
 That's not the worst thing you could do as a king, right?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:07.080
 It seems like a kind of Prince Charles approach to being king.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080
 That's really good.

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080
 Yeah.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.520
 It just goes to show, take opportunities when they come up, and you don't know how you're

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520
 going to benefit further down the line.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:18.040
 Do you change your tune from the, when did I sign off, well, you sign the form now then.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:23.520
 There is somewhere where they celebrate kale in all of its glory in northern Germany.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.960
 They have, so basically the kale harvest is a huge deal there around those parts.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.680
 And they have a festival, and the main highlight of this festival seems to be the Kohlfart,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.800
 the kale fart, or the kale walk.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:42.320
 And there's, I think it's Oldenburg calls itself the Kohlfart capital of the world.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.960
 And it sounds like such a fun event.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960
 So you...

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960
 No, it doesn't.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.960
 Isn't it?

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.960
 Because kale is cabbage, isn't it?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.960
 Cabbage.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.960
 Cabbage.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960
 So it's all sort of all cruciferous.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.600
 I think it's kale is the main event, but then other cabbages can attend, I believe.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.760
 And it's to celebrate that, and you get a kale king and queen crowned every year.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.520
 And I think sometimes you can crown the king and queen based on, you weigh them at the

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.320
 start and then you weigh them at the end of the feast, and then whoever's gained the most

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.320
 weight gets to be king and queen for the next year.

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320
 Whoever's eating the most kale.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.320
 Yeah, basically.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.200
 Which is served with like large chunks of meat.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.200
 Yeah.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.600
 It's also quite a mouthful, presumably that's the Kohlkönig and the Kohlkönigin.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.160
 So the Kohlkönigin is king and queen.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.160
 Oh, yes.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 So you'd be the Kohlkönig.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160
 The Kohlkönigin.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160
 Kohlkönigin, yes.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 It's quite hard to say.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 That's brilliant.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 There you go.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.040
 Try saying that five times first after ten sausages.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.960
 I think it's cool when there are amazing ways of cooking food that are not, you know, that

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.120
 you're taking something you're already using and you're just, you're using it to cook.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.120
 That's a fried egg on a bonnet.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.120
 Exactly.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.120
 That's right.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.120
 I was thinking actually a sausage on the exhaust pipe.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:52.080
 Would that work, putting a sausage up the exhaust pipe of your car?

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.080
 No.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080
 I think it might do.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.920
 But the chemicals will be shooting out of it, aren't they?

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.160
 You need to give it a rinse, I think afterwards, but I think could you, do you think it gets

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 hot enough?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.160
 I think it probably does.

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.720
 I think the exhaust pipe gets pretty hot.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 Yeah.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.160
 You'd have to strap it in, like tie it, like strap it in and put the sausage up your exhaust

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160
 pipe.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160
 I don't think so.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.080
 Oh, I think it definitely would work.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080
 It would taste rank.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.000
 Fried egg on the bonnet, sausage up the exhaust pipe.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.680
 You just need someone to cook the beans in the cigarette lighter.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680
 Lovely.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.680
 You can get a full English out of one's car.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680
 And that's how you toast.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680
 Bread.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.680
 This is just my cooking cup.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:37.800
 I thought the etymology of the emu family, ratites is quite interesting, because they're

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.120
 called ratites and that includes all the big birds, you know, all the famous ones.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.120
 Cassowary.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.120
 Nice.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120
 Chris Ria.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.120
 Very nice, yeah.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.120
 Chris Ria.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.120
 Chris Ria.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120
 Yeah, he's in there.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120
 Yeah.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.120
 You're ostrich.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.120
 And your kiwis actually, who just sneak in there even though they're quite small and

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120
 squat.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120
 Right.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.120
 But ratite, I thought, well, that's weird, because they're not very rat-like, but it

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.980
 actually comes surprisingly from a different origin, which comes from the Latin to mean

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.400
 a raft.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.000
 And that's because the key thing about ratites and the reason they're flightless is because

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.240
 they have no keel, which I didn't know, is the big extension of a breastbone that you

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.840
 can see if you look at the skeleton of any of these big birds and it holds onto the pectoral

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840
 muscles.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.600
 So the big muscles, if you don't have a keel, those poor wing muscles have got nothing

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.640
 to sort of get purchased against, so they just flap uselessly and embarrassingly, whereas

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.560
 all are the birds, you know, they've got something to hold their wings onto you.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.560
 Interesting.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560
 So ratite comes from raft.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.040
 Raft, because a raft is a boat without a keel.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040
 Oh my God.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040
 That is quite good.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
 That's great.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040
 That's a long journey.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040
 But what a journey.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.600
 We were talking about Irish dancing before.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.680
 Do you know why in Irish dancing you stand with your top half completely still?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.740
 Is it because they're always holding a very full cup of coffee at the time, aren't they?

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:58.720
 I would guess, logically, it must be that you've got room for your legs to move, but not

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.720
 your arms, right?

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:05.760
 So maybe the rooms they performed in were very narrow above hip height, but very broad

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.040
 like rooms are often different.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.480
 How are they getting into those rooms?

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.920
 It doesn't make any sense, does it?

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.640
 We have to crawl into the room because it's very open, and then we stand up into the narrowing

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640
 closed space.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.040
 I've never seen a room like this, by the way, I just guess it.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.040
 I don't think I've said it here once, I was looking at houses and I went to this house

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:30.400
 and they had a bedroom, but they have two kids there, and the kids didn't want to stay

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.280
 in the same bedroom, but they only had one bedroom, and so they made it so it was in

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.880
 half top and bottom, so they put a fake floor halfway up the wall, and one of the kids had

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.120
 to climb up onto the top half, and the other one had his little sort of underground room

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.120
 that he had.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120
 So it's like a bunk bed, but a whole room?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.120
 The whole room was a bunk bed.

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.120
 That's brilliant.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.680
 You'd want to be in the top bit, wouldn't you?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680
 Yeah.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
 You'd want to climb up.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.680
 Especially because I don't trust my parents' building abilities, that floor's going to fall

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680
 through at some point.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.120
 Yeah, sorry, we were saying about the Irish, so basically Irish dancing was outlawed by

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:08.160
 the English along with other things like Irish sports, stuff like that, and so the theory

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.260
 goes that the Irish would keep their top half still and dance with their bottom half,

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.400
 so the British wouldn't be able to tell if they were dancing if they saw them in the

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:21.000
 window of a pub or behind a hedge.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
 Brilliant.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 Brilliant.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Just dancing the way he's dancing.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.200
 We're just having a quiet pint of Guinness.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.040
 Exactly, and one of the theory is that it began when some dancers were forced to dance

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:38.080
 for Queen Elizabeth I, and she was responsible for starting the plantations in Ireland, so

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.280
 they had no chance but to dance, but to protest against it and show their fellow countrymen

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.760
 that they didn't want to dance in front of the Queen, they kept their top half really

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.760
 still.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760
 Like throwing a real strop?

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.760
 Yeah.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.880
 Like eating your peas, but crying at the same time?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.720
 Kind of like folding your arms with a grumpy face, but then your legs are still dancing,

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.720
 kind of thing.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.720
 Wow.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.120
 That's hilarious.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.760
 Just on floodlights, I don't know if this is interesting, but the first time they had

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:08.560
 floodlights at Old Trafford I was reading yesterday, they were going to play against

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.680
 Real Madrid the following week, and they knew that there would be floodlights in Spain,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.400
 and so they quickly put up their own floodlights, and they were playing Bolton Wanderers in

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.320
 the league, and they made the Bolton players dress like Real Madrid players so that they

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.360
 be able to see what the Real Madrid players would look like.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360
 Oh, wow.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.920
 So they wore like, and they already both wore white, but they wore the same shorts and the

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.920
 same socks as Real Madrid.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.920
 That's amazing.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:32.920
 So they could just do a dummy run of...

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.920
 Pretty much.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.920
 Even though it was a proper league match in the UK, they wanted to be like, "Okay."

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.920
 Can you still do that?

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.920
 Football matches, can you insist that your opponents wear a costume?

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.920
 Clown outfit.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.920
 Clown outfit.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.920
 Effectively.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.920
 Or clown outfit.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.920
 Big slam on Real Madrid there.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920
 Or Bolton.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.920
 Yeah.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.680
 But yeah, I think like in those days it was, everyone was quite wanting the English teams

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.640
 to do well in Europe, so they helped them out.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640
 Wow.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.160
 Anyway.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:00.360
 If you had clown shoes on, would that help or hinder your match?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360
 Hinder.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.360
 I think you know the answer to that.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.360
 Hang on, hang on.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.360
 I haven't done anything to the question.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.360
 In a football match?

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360
 Yeah, I was going to say...

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360
 Or in the big top.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.280
 In a dance match, it would be bad actually, wouldn't it?

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.160
 Because you would be quite further, you'd be a lot further away from the board.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.120
 But you could possibly counterweight yourself and bend forward really far if you had heavy

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.120
 shoes.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.120
 Exactly.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.560
 If you were the goalie, you would have a longer reach for getting to the ball.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.560
 Why?

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:29.080
 Well, if you had to kick your leg out, that little two-inch difference might be...

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.680
 I've once played football in Wellington Boots, and I can say that it was much more difficult

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.080
 than playing in football boots.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.820
 But was everyone playing in the Wellington Boots?

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.680
 Everyone on my team was, and the other team were in normal shoes.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.280
 Were the other team about to play some international team which was going to play in a monsoon?

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.280
 They needed...

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280
 They were about to play in a monsoon, and they needed...

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.960
 It was for charity when I was a kid.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960
 Right.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.880
 So our Wellington Boots were full of custard as well, so that also helped.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880
 What?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880
 That'll make it more difficult.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.880
 Yeah.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.880
 Yeah.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:27:59.880
 What?

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880
 It was for the...

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:02.880
 Possibly the first, or maybe the second, never, comment relief.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880
 Wow.

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.880
 Really?

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.880
 Did you have to drink the custard at the end?

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:06.880
 No.

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:07.880
 I would have thought that would be...

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880
 Really?

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880
 Just oranges like normal.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.880
 What was the final score?

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.880
 I don't recall.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.880
 Did you decide when?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.800
 I think we must have done, because we were playing against kids, like really young kids.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.800
 Yeah.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800
 Sorry.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:17.800
 Hang on.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800
 You were adults.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800
 No, we weren't adults, but we were older kids.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800
 Yeah.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.800
 But you had the handicap of...

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:22.800
 Exactly.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:23.800
 Wellington Boots full of custard.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.800
 That's right.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.800
 Okay.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800
 Okay.

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:28.800
 So if more matches have played like that, I'd be more attracted to football.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:30.800
 Exactly.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800
 I think it would be fascinating to see...

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.800
 That sort of weird handicap when you come to someone's home ground, they have to just...

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800
 Yeah.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.800
 Who's the best football team at the moment?

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.800
 Man City.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.800
 Man City.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.800
 Man City.

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.800
 I'd love to see Man City play...

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.800
 Sorry, who's the worst football team at the moment?

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.800
 Trump.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.800
 Trump is.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800
 That's my team.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.800
 Okay, I'd love to see...

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:51.800
 Man City play Tremerovers, but Man City are all tied together in a line.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800
 That's great.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800
 Oh, nice.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800
 I think...

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.800
 Like, the handicap depends on the deficiency between the two teams, right?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800
 Exactly.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800
 Yeah.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800
 That's great.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800
 Or if they were positioned like foosball, so like a...

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800
 Yeah.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.800
 You know, a big mess of ball.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800
 They will be drilled through their bodies.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.800
 Yeah, through.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:07.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.800
 In the position.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:12.800
 Anyway, I look forward to that nil-nil game between Tremero and Man City.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.800
 Jon Osborne wrote, "Don't look back in anger while sitting on a deck chair in Morgan Bay for 17 days."

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.800
 That's great.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.800
 Get piled.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800
 There's play.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800
 It's a play, right?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.800
 It's a play, yeah, yeah.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800
 It's a famous angry young man play.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800
 Well, it was where angry young men came from.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.800
 They named it in the reviews for it.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800
 But yeah.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.800
 It's quite hard to look back on a deck chair, isn't it?

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.800
 Yeah, that's why they got so angry.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800
 Yeah.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.800
 Being angry on a deck chair doesn't feel right, does it?

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800
 No.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.800
 It's like being angry on a trampoline.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:41.800
 You can't do it.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:42.800
 You can't do it.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.800
 You can be angry.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800
 Should we put dangerous world leaders on deck chairs?

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.800
 Or like Putin should have all his meetings on a deck chair from now on.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.800
 And it might solve a lot of problems.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.800
 Put them in soft play centres.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.800
 Yeah.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.800
 That's where they belong.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800
 Your coffers should be.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800
 Yeah.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.800
 Apparently, in look back in anger, it is kind of one of these kitchen sink plays.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.800
 I haven't seen it, actually.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.800
 But there is a moment where someone brings out an ironing board.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:09.800
 And apparently the first time it played in London's Royal Court Theatre,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:14.800
 the audience gasped because there was an ironing board on stage.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800
 When was it?

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800
 It started in 1956.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:18.800
 That's great.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.800
 But you didn't have them in those days.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.800
 If all you've seen was the importance of being earnest.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.800
 Yeah.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800
 No ironing at all.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.800
 Or Shakespeare or whatever.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800
 Yeah.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.800
 And there was a review where apparently there's a woman,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.800
 one of the characters is basically ironing throughout the first half.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.800
 But there was a review saying a guy called Gerald Berry,

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.800
 who said that he almost had a nervous breakdown,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.800
 watching her take so long to iron one pajama top.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.800
 It was supposed to be realism,

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800
 but she didn't change any of the ironing.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.800
 She just sat there ironing this one thing all the way through the book.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800
 That's so funny.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.800
 You would definitely focus on that when you were in the audience.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.800
 I wouldn't be listening to anything they said.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.800
 I'd say she's still not ironing that top.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.800
 That's really funny.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.800
 Definitely funny.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.800
 We're just one other cool thing that they have in airport.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800
 And this is around the world as well.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.800
 So you know how you have your runway.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800
 And when you're landing a plane,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.800
 you don't want to go off the end of the runway.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800
 It's frowned on.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 But you can't land exactly at the beginning of the runway.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 And sometimes, you know,

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.800
 terrible conditions or there's a mistake in the cockpit, whatever,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.800
 planes do just go a bit further than they should.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.800
 There's an amazing system they have,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.800
 which is called EMAS.

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.800
 It's engineered materials arresting system.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.800
 So it looks like normal tarmac runway, right?

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.800
 But it's designed to crunch down

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.800
 and to collapse like a blamange as soon as the plane hits it.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.800
 So it's like the plane runs into treacle.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.800
 It just slows the plane down and brings it to a complete stop.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.800
 And it's just this amazing crunchy surface

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.800
 that they have beyond the end of runways

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.800
 in loads of airports these days.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.800
 If you accidentally wander onto that,

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.800
 do you end up crunched up?

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.800
 You miss your flight.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.800
 But it destroys the plane's wheels

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.800
 just because it just is grinding it to a halt

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.800
 because it's literally designed to collapse.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800
 Here's one thing.

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.800
 Another thing that might happen,

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800
 you're taking off.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.800
 Obviously, like you say,

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.800
 sometimes mistakes, sometimes you go too far,

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800
 you start in the wrong place.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.800
 What if you're trying to take off and you hit this stuff?

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.800
 Yeah, probably huge problems.

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:15.800
 Delays, I imagine, for the passengers.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.800
 I think, I don't know if it's ever happened.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800
 It might be.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.800
 It's not nose dive into the ground.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.800
 My wife, when she sleeps,

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800
 she puts her arms above her like a zombie.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.800
 That's quite scary.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800
 You mean she's on her back and she sticks them out?

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.800
 Yeah, yeah, in the air.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.800
 Is it a sort of slow rise

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.800
 or just they straight up in a sort of...

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.800
 Yeah, no, I'm not like Hitler.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.800
 I've never asked her if she's dreaming about being at Nuremberg.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.800
 Maybe she is, but no, they're like,

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.800
 they slowly rise until they're vertical.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800
 Wow.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.800
 Yeah.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.800
 Does she say, "brains, brains, brains"?

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.800
 I imagine you wake up with sort of pins and needles.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.800
 Yeah, you think so, right?

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.800
 Yeah, you think so, right?

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.800
 She wakes, that's when she's in a really deep sleep,

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.800
 so by the time she's woken up, she's no longer riking.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:07.800
 Emus has been banned from a hotel in Queensland

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800
 for misbehaving.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:09.800
 Okay.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800
 Really?

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800
 A Yorak hotel.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800
 It's in a very remote part of Western Queensland

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.800
 and they've actually put a sign up saying,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.800
 "Emus, a ban for bad behaviour

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.800
 and there's a rope and you have to fasten it behind you,"

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.800
 because they kept,

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.800
 there are just two Emus left in the area

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800
 called Kevin and Carol

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.800
 and they kept wandering into the pub

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.800
 and stealing guest possessions

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.800
 and apparently putting their heads in the toaster

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.800
 to take, to take, to take toaster out.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.800
 Can they read?

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.800
 What good is the sign?

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800
 That feels a bit...

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.800
 If there are only two Emus in the area,

00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.800
 it feels like a bit of overkill, frankly,

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800
 to ban all Emus

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.800
 when actually you're just aiming this at Kevin and Carol.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800
 Just say that on the sign.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800
 Just say, "Kevin and Carol,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.800
 Kevin and Carol ban from this place.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800
 Please cover that with the rope when you go in."

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.800
 You're right, don't tar all Emus with the Kevin and Carol brush.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.800
 I got a very small quiz,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800
 potentially one-question quiz.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800
 Derring a quiz.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800
 Let's begin.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.800
 You've just walked up to Saddam Hussein.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.800
 You're going to give him a kiss.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800
 Okay.

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800
 Where do you kiss him?

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.800
 Is this after he died?

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.800
 No, pre-death.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800
 Is he still in charge?

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800
 He's still in charge.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800
 On the moustache.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800
 Ooh, lovely stuff.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800
 But not the lips.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.800
 But not the lips.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.800
 Yeah.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800
 He's got a big moustache.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.800
 That's very achievable.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800
 Yeah.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.800
 I mean, I like to think I'd have more self-control.

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.800
 But if I'm compelled to, this is a diplomatic thing.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800
 And you know, otherwise...

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.800
 You're going for what he wants.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.800
 Oh, what he wants.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.800
 I'd say the berry.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:33.800
 Oh, interesting.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.800
 Interesting.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800
 Yeah.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:39.800
 Well, I'm just thinking about what's left of Saddam Hussein.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.800
 Maybe on his medals, did he not always...

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.800
 Are my thinking of someone else?

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.800
 He probably wore a few.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800
 Colonel Gaddafi.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800
 I don't know.

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.800
 But yeah, maybe on his medals.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800
 You've picked...

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800
 James is the closest.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800
 You've picked the right spot.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800
 Nipple.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800
 It's the armpits.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.800
 It's roughly in the armpit area.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800
 Sort of chest going into the armpits.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800
 No.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.800
 So this was discovered by a guy called Joel Soler.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.800
 He made a documentary about Saddam Hussein.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800
 He went into Iraq under a different...

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.800
 Like he claimed he was there filming some other stuff.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.800
 And then he smuggled archive footage that had been filmed of Saddam Hussein while he was there out of the country.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:16.800
 And he made a satirical documentary about all the stuff.

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.800
 I believe, I hope I'm not being tricked here, but I believe all the stuff in it is...

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.800
 Like Michael Moore's satirical documentaries are real stuff, real fact the whole way through.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.800
 He got footage of where Saddam, who was a hygiene freak, to...

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.800
 He didn't want to kiss his on the cheek, so that's where you would kiss him.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.800
 In his armpit areas.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.800
 All these weird leaders are hygiene freaks.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.800
 That was a strong correlation.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.800
 Sorry, can I just pick up down on the way he said hygiene?

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.800
 I think the reason that they're hygiene freaks is because they think they might be assassinated.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800
 A lot of them.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:49.800
 A paradise.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.800
 The gun is in their mouth.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.800
 And you don't want to...

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.800
 You could be shot in the armpit and live.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.800
 That's fine.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.800
 But you know...

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.800
 Okay, well, second question to the quiz and then I'll be done with the quiz.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.800
 Did I get the points for the first one?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800
 You do, you absolutely.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800
 So James is winning 1-0.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800
 Right.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800
 So, second question.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.800
 You're a princess.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.800
 You found a frog.

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.800
 You're chatting to the frog.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.800
 The frog's chatting back.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.800
 You realise you could turn this frog into a prince.

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:19.800
 Where do you kiss the frog according to the grim tales?

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.800
 Can I just say, first of all, someone's stomach rumbled halfway through that fact.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.800
 And I really hope it came up on the mics because it sounded like a frog was in the room.

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.800
 Who was it?

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800
 Was that me?

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.800
 I'll dive in and I'll go classic reversal.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:36.800
 I'll say the bum.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.800
 Oh, damn it.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.800
 I knew I shouldn't have let you go first.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.800
 It's not what you're going to say.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.800
 Yeah, it just feels like the only other non-obvious hole.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.800
 A nostril?

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800
 A nostril.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800
 A frog nostril.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:52.800
 Well, I'm thinking the fact that it's in the same quiz, armpit.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.800
 Ah, very nice answer as well.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.800
 No, the answer is that you don't need to kiss the frog at all.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.800
 That's a later addition to the story.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800
 Oh, really?

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800
 Yeah.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.800
 So in the original grim story, rather than kissing the frog, she gets really pissed off with the frog,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.800
 picks it up and chucks it at a wall.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.800
 And when it smashes at the wall, it then turns into the prince.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.800
 Wow.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800
 Yeah, there's no kiss at all.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:14.800
 She's like, she picks it up.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.800
 Now, will you be quiet, you ugly frog, pegs it at the wall,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.800
 and then a handsome prince just sort of pops out from the-

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.800
 Wait, but is he-

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.800
 I'll roll his bones broken because he's just been thrown at the wall.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.800
 So presumably he doesn't fancy her after that.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.800
 Yeah, she's really shown her character there.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.800
 That's true.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.800
 They do say you have to throw a lot of men against the wall before you find your prince.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.800
 Scallops move around using jet propulsion.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800
 Oh, my God.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800
 That's amazing, isn't it?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.800
 That big muscle means they can just clamp that thing close really quickly, really strongly.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800
 It creates a jet of water and they move around.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.800
 It's to get away from predators.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.800
 They can make the jet go in different directions, so they have this kind of random motion.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.800
 It's basically an evasive manoeuvre.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800
 It's so cool.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800
 Yeah.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.800
 If you see a footage of a scallop escaping from something, it's like,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.800
 it reminded me of the chattering teeth.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800
 Yeah.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800
 It just sort of go off in one direction.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800
 That's weird.

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800
 It's a bit random and it's, you know.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:10.800
 It reminded me of Sesame Street animals for exactly the same.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.800
 Is that one that, you know, the Sesame Street Muppets?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800
 Their mouths.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.800
 The Muppets Muppets.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.800
 Well, there's a bit of a cinematic universe going on here.

00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.800
 There's the Muppets on the Muppet show.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.800
 And then the Sesame Street, which I think is, I think they are Muppets on Sesame Street.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.800
 Is Big Bird a Muppet?

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800
 Oh, God, I thought they all were.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800
 Maybe the Muppets is a trademark for the Muppets.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.800
 Which are the ones that do have mouths like scallops that snap, snap, snap,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800
 like you say, like the teeth?

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800
 I think all of them do.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800
 I think that's not a useful.

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800
 Maybe Big Bird doesn't, I don't know.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800
 No, Big Bird has a beak.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800
 No, that's a completely different one.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.800
 But Big Bird's just a bloke in a suit, isn't it?

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.800
 Yes.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800
 What?

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.800
 But they are manic, aren't they?

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.800
 Like chattering, looping around.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.800
 And they move so fast through the water.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800
 It's incredible.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.800
 You'd think they were really slow, but no.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.800
 I think, I've been on a jet ski quite recently and I found that it's really hard

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.800
 to change direction when you're going slowly,

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.800
 but actually weirdly a lot easier when you're going a bit quicker.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.800
 So I wonder if there's something to do with that if they're jet propelled.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.800
 Yeah.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:13.800
 There's no stability in the way they move, so they sort of tumble as they go.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.800
 So every time they squeeze the water out,

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.800
 they're facing in a new direction anyway, so they just kind of tumble around.

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800
 Interesting.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.800
 So Gatwick has a train line at the end of its runway.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.800
 And as it trains, like not right at the end,

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800
 like there's just a train track that goes past Gatwick Airport.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.800
 But there's a special tripwire in the train track.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.800
 And I think it has it when it runs past Gatwick

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.800
 and then it runs past another airport somewhere else in the south.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.800
 But there's a tripwire that automatically cuts the power to trains

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800
 if a plane doesn't stop at the end of the runway.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.800
 So there's a system that detects immediately if the plane hasn't stopped

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.800
 and that cuts the power.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800
 And it has been tripped occasionally, but by accident,

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.800
 which is quite annoying because your train just does an emergency stop.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800
 That's awesome.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800
 That's so clever.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800
 It's a clever system.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.800
 What if you're in the line of the actual runway?

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.800
 Yeah, that's a cock up, I suppose.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800
 You just cross your fingers.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.800
 I know it's really cold there.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800
 I know that, guys.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800
 And the Antarctic.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800
 Yeah, and the Antarctic.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800
 I know it's cold there.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800
 I know that.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.800
 But what I didn't know is how cold it was.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.800
 And I now have a good way of measuring possibly for some listener at home

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.800
 of how cold it was and it is in the Antarctic.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.800
 So we told a story back in episode 111 of the time

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800
 when Neil Armstrong, Edmund Hillary and Steve Fossett

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.800
 all went to the North Pole together.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.800
 So there was a guy who dreamed of bringing the first man on top of the world,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.800
 the first man off the world, and Steve Fossett.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.800
 And Steve Fossett.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800
 He went around the world.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800
 He was a ballooner, right?

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.800
 Okay, he's definitely less famous.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800
 He's definitely the--

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:41.800
 Oh, yeah.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.800
 But he was a very rich billionaire, Branson-esque kind of person.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.800
 Yeah.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:46.800
 And so--

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800
 Bring the guy with the money.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.800
 And so they all went there and they landed, they didn't do it a proper track.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:55.800
 They sort of got brought by helicopter and so on to land there.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.800
 And when they landed there to celebrate,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.800
 they popped open a bottle of champagne and before even two glasses were poured,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.800
 the entire champagne froze.

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.800
 That's how cold it is.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.800
 Champagne will freeze within two doors.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.800
 I'm not that surprised by that because I've seen like videos on YouTube

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.800
 in really cold places where people like pour hot water

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.800
 and it just freezes on the way down.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800
 Wow.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.800
 But you have to down it super fast then.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800
 Pretty bad gas.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.800
 It's very hard holding the flute in your mitt as well.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.800
 Excuse me, I asked for this whiskey without ice.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.800
 Wow.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:33.800
 What a way to kill someone because if you drank and it froze as it was going down your throat

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.800
 and sort of blocked your entire--

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.800
 Luckily, hopefully your throat is not so cold that it would--

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.800
 If your throat is cold enough to freeze water, you're probably already dead.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800
 Good point.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.800
 Otherwise, you're eating all the stuff and you're worrying it's going to freeze in your stomach.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.800
 Yeah, I think your assassination club needs more work.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.800
 The other day I drove across for the first time.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:58.800
 You know, if you drive into Gibraltar, you have to drive over and feel--

00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800
 Yeah.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800
 No, no.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800
 Yeah, so it's a runway.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.800
 Kind of like how you stop for a train and let the train pass and then they lift it up.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.800
 That's the runway.

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.800
 Yeah, so like you drive into the-- you go through Pascalville control

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.800
 and then it's a straight road and the runway goes right across your road

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800
 and if there's a plane coming, it stops you from going.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:18.800
 But you know when you go across a level crossing and there's trains

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.800
 and you're still thinking right, I'm going to definitely check both ways just in case.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.800
 You definitely do that for planes as well.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.800
 Always looking, oh, I hope there's not a 747 about to come this way.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.800
 Yeah, I always get so freaked out going over level crossings that have let me go through,

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800
 the lights are green, they're not even deeing down.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.800
 I also assume that my car is just going to get over one of them

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.800
 and not on the other one and I'm just going to be balanced on top of the rails.

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:47.800
 You do drive one of those Cozy Coupe red in the other car, don't you?

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:53.800
 In the the queue, something that got quite a bad rep was our old friend What3Words.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800
 Oh, really? Yeah.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.800
 What3Words for anyone who doesn't know.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:04.800
 So What3Words is basically a system of addresses where a place is identified by just three random words.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.800
 So you get the coordinates and you can say, hey, can you come to a bubble--

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.800
 It's hard to think of three words, isn't it?

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:19.800
 Bubblecat table and then that'll be a specific place in the world and it'll be somewhere in Finland.

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.800
 You put the three words into your app and it'll tell you exactly where to go.

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.800
 Yes, but I'd never thought of the flaw in What3Words before until the queue happened,

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.800
 which is that if you don't get it exactly right, unlike if you don't get a normal address exactly right,

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.800
 it's usually quite close, this would have sent you somewhere completely different.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:39.800
 So there was a bunch of queers who were told to go and start queuing in California.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:44.800
 Well, What3Words say is that actually if you put the three words into your app

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.800
 and it tells you that the start of the queue to see the queen is in California,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.800
 you might think, probably I've put the wrong word in.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.800
 Whereas if you say it's number 34 High Street and it's actually number 38 High Street,

00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:59.800
 then it's more likely that you'll get things mixed up.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:01.800
 But people can be silly, can't they?

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.800
 You know, they'd heard it was long, maybe they thought.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.800
 And it did keep on, it was because I think the What3Words was same valve grid.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.800
 What was that? Was that the end of the queue?

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.800
 That was the end of the queue, yeah, exactly.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.800
 So that's where people went and actually it was supposed to be same value grid, I think.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.800
 And then they accidentally misdirected people to a different part of London,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.800
 which could have been confusing for people.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.800
 Right, interesting.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.800
 And then sent them to North Carolina later on.

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.800
 So who knows how many idiots are scattered across bits of North America now?

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.800
 None of this is the fault of What3Words in my opinion.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.800
 I'm going to stick with Andy's opinion as well.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.800
 Look, I'm not Andy What3Words either, just be careful of typos.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.800
 Helicopters create lightning, sometimes, I heard.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:49.800
 I've been in quite a few helicopters and never noticed it.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.800
 Well, you've been lucky, be careful.

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.800
 So this happens wherever there are helicopters

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.800
 and thunderstorms happening at the same time, or heavy rain.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.800
 And in the North Sea, a small number of helicopters will be struck by lightning every year.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.800
 And they're struck way more than they would ordinarily be.

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.800
 And even if there's no lightning in the area, it can happen.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.800
 So what's going on?

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.800
 I don't know the exact process, but I don't know.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.800
 So it doesn't come out of them, it's not like you see a helicopter above you

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.800
 and it might target you and strike you down with lightning?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800
 No, it's not Zeus.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.800
 What do you mean create lightning?

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.800
 Static created by the blades, I'm guessing.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800
 It must be something to do with that.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.800
 Yeah, I don't know the exact explanation.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:29.800
 But helicopters do have anti-lightning technology on them.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.800
 Well, it's not working, it sounds like.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.800
 It's creating it.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.800
 I think how many would be plummeting out of the sky without it?

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.800
 To protect the people inside, I mean.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.800
 So if planes these days get hit by lightning all the time, it's normally fine.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.800
 And same with helicopters, yeah.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.800
 Wow.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.800
 I've got one very final thing.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.800
 Have you guys heard of, I know you've heard of the Wilhelm Scream.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800
 Yeah?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800
 Yes.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800
 Have you guys heard of Castle Thunder?

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:55.800
 No.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.800
 But the Wilhelm Scream for people who don't know, it's that Scream in movies that is used over and over again.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.800
 Sounds about like that.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800
 That was quite good.

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.800
 Well, there is a single movie Thunder Clap as well.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.800
 And it's called Castle Thunder.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.800
 And it's used in so many films.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.800
 So it's in the original Frankenstein.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.800
 It was in Cleopatra.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.800
 I can hear it in my head right now.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.800
 Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Citizen Kane.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.800
 It's in so many.

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.800
 And it's one sound.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800
 I think it is.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800
 That could be so many.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.800
 No, no, but the rhythm, the rhythm of that.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.800
 Yeah, yeah, you might be right.

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.800
 Which one resonated with you guys?

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.800
 Bambi is the scene I remember best of those.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.800
 I'm not sure I've seen any of them.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.800
 What were they?

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.800
 All there's nothing recent.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:41.800
 Yeah.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.800
 Stop on my mum will shoot.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.800
 You might have seen the original Ghostbusters.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800
 I have actually.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.800
 For a sort of, you know, if you were on a history trip or something.

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.800
 I actually did watch that when I was a kid.

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:52.800
 That's good. What's in that?

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800
 Oh, Castle Thunder.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.800
 Very cool.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.800
 Okay, that's it.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.800
