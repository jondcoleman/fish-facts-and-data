00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
 Hey, Clubfish members, welcome to this compilation episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,120
 This is all the outtakes and bloopers and bits that just didn't fit the main narrative

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,080
 of the episodes that go out on the main feed, but stuff that we thought is too good to lose.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,960
 So you can hear the voices of me, Anna, James and Andy, but also you're going to hear Malcolm

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,960
 Gladwell, Angela Barnes and Steve Mould, who all make little cameos along the way in

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
 this episode.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,240
 I just want to quickly remind you as well before we start, a lot of stuff going on with

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,240
 the fish at the moment.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,520
 There's the Discord, which if you haven't got to, I highly recommend nosuchthingasafish.com/fishcord.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,840
 It's where a lot of the people who are part of this Clubfish membership are hanging out

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,240
 and just chatting literally every day about everything.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,240
 There's general fish chat, to recent episode chat, to fax fax fax, which is a thread where

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,840
 everyone's just putting in their own fax.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,160
 There's the No Such Thing as the cutest pet, everyone's uploading photos of their pets.

15
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,240
 There's meetups where people are saying, "Where do you live?

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,240
 Do you live in my city?

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,240
 People have a group meetup."

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,600
 There's book recommendations, movie recommendations, TV, music.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,880
 It's a whole world of interesting chat, and it's all exclusive to the Clubfish members.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,640
 So, if you're paying for this Patreon, if you're hearing this right now, you are eligible

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,040
 to join it, so get in there and start chatting away.

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,480
 Okay, enough of me waffling on, let's get on with the compilation.

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:29,320
 Here you go, on with the show.

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,040
 It was used medicinally a lot, wasn't it, sort of seaweed back in the day.

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,120
 There was a story I was reading about Francis Bacon.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,800
 Francis Bacon, there used to be that thing we spoke about before of grinding up mummy

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,080
 and skull and bones and all that sort of stuff.

28
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,320
 When that wasn't available, supposedly Francis Bacon started a little trend of crushing up

29
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,360
 moss with skull.

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
 So it was a moss and skull thing, sorry, rather than seaweed.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,400
 And you would put that in your nostrils, and you would eat it and so on, and that became

32
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,040
 another kind of version of that, yeah.

33
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
 There's a Northern Irish version of kerrigan called dulce, and you eat that, you eat it

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,160
 in candy and stuff like that.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 But one way they use it now is as a vegetarian substitute for bacon.

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
 Really?

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,480
 Not Francis Bacon.

38
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
 Good, because it's a bit salty.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,080
 It's salty, yeah, and in Northern Ireland, you can still get this, I think, it's a candy

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,440
 called yellowman and dulce.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,840
 And it's like, you know what's it called, that stuff?

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,920
 It's like honeycomb, and then this seaweed on the side of it, and so it's sugary and

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,520
 also salty, and it's like, you know, salted caramel became a thing like 20 years ago.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,040
 I mean, there's some hundred years before that.

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,120
 That sounds quite good, actually.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
 It does.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
 Honeycomb with moss.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
 It sounds like a nice...

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
 It's a dulce.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
 Honeycomb with moss is also a good name for a detective couple.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
 It is.

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
 I'm Sean Honeycomb, and I'm Janet Moss.

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
 Oh, see, I would've...

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,760
 You're gonna go the other way round.

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
 Well done.

56
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
 Well, I like to subvert.

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,800
 It only really works if that is a thing, honeycomb and moss, right?

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,440
 Otherwise, the pun doesn't really work, because you'd have to explain to your viewers that

60
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,400
 there is a thing called...

61
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,440
 I think episode one is some extensive food history.

62
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,640
 That's how all good detective dramas begin.

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,200
 I quite like, just separate to the actual screen time itself, just how much information

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,960
 is in our phone now, not within the body of it, as in not within the metadata, but the

65
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,440
 actual physical bacteria that's sitting on top of it.

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,920
 If you swab phones now, they're able to tell so many things about us.

67
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,480
 They're able to tell us where you've been, what medicine you might be on, what you just

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,920
 ate for your last meal.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,320
 We're basically just implanting a footprint onto the face of our phone each day.

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,760
 So if you lost someone's phone, you could probably tell everything about it.

71
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,760
 Who's it was?

72
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
 Who's it was?

73
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,400
 Yeah, apparently, our phones at this point, because we're so careless with them in the

74
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,480
 way that we put them down, the bacteria on it is something like 17,000 bits of bacteria

75
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,600
 latch onto it.

76
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,920
 It's dirtier than an average toilet, yet we're holding it to our heads every day.

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,680
 I always have slight doubts about that stat, as in...

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,880
 Yeah, who's counting?

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,680
 It can't be dirtier than the average toilet.

80
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
 It can't...

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
 Poo's on their phone.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,440
 It's not those kind of bacteria, is it?

83
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,440
 You've not got the toilet paper hat, have you?

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,400
 There is always panic, obviously, about new technologies, although this does seem markedly

85
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,400
 different because it's so all-consuming, but I always like going back through old records

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,280
 to see what people were saying about new stuff.

87
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,960
 So like with the printing press, there was real fear for about 100 years that it would

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
 cause a massive overload of books and information, huge overabundance.

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
 People wouldn't be able to handle it.

90
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,720
 Turns out all of that turns out to be true.

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 Yeah.

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,640
 Well, I was thinking, has this been disproved?

93
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,880
 There was a tract written in 1545 saying that Princes and Kings had to deal with this and

94
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
 sort of ban people from having books because of this confusing and harmful abundance of

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
 information.

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
 But maybe that's where we went wrong, books.

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,840
 Yeah.

98
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
 Maybe this is...

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
 Let's go to the source.

100
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,840
 Yeah.

101
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,600
 Burn the printing presses.

102
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,480
 I found a superhero who derives his powers from seaweed.

103
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
 Oh, yeah.

104
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Yeah.

105
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,760
 So this was a character, I think it was created by DC, and the idea was they wanted a version

106
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,000
 of Popeye, and they wanted someone who could take on Superman.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,800
 So I think it kind of was a parody, but it sort of also reads as if they introduced it

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
 as a real thing.

109
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,080
 So Captain Horatio Strong, he was called, and he used to eat seaweed, which was called

110
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,320
 Sancha, and Sancha was basically an alien origin seaweed, which I think he might not

111
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,120
 have known at the time, because he then finds out that it is and he becomes addicted to

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
 it.

113
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,120
 So it's kind of a bit like a...

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,320
 It's a drug addict story, really.

115
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,160
 And he has to go cold turkey on the seaweed, so he quits the seaweed, and he then returns

116
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,640
 to natural level of strength as a normal human would have.

117
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,160
 And the only surviving bit of this alien seaweed, he keeps on his houseboat, and he keeps it

118
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,040
 there as a way to sort of look at it and sort of tempt himself into a strong will of not

119
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
 having to have it.

120
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
 Sort of there.

121
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
 So he gives up his superpowers.

122
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
 Yeah.

123
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
 Wow.

124
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
 I would have thought he would...

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
 Also, firstly, you don't get many superheroes who live on houseboats, I think that's quite

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
 a nice touch.

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
 Yeah, that's rare.

128
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,120
 I also think like Popeye, by the way, missing a trick, not eating seaweed, because he's

129
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
 a sailor man, right?

130
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
 He is a sailor man.

131
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,880
 And where do you not grow spinach in the middle of the sea?

132
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
 Such a good point.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
 Yeah.

134
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 But you do get seaweeds.

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
 You do get seaweeds.

136
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
 Yeah.

137
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,880
 Yeah.

138
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,440
 Lots of superheroes are kind of addicts in one way or another.

139
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,720
 Like Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde, he kind of gets addicted to...

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 Is he a superhero?

141
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,720
 Is he a superhero?

142
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,840
 I missed that comic book.

143
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
 Is he kids?

144
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,520
 He's a kind of... Sorry, yeah, he's a proto superhero, but he invents the formula to turn

145
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
 himself into...

146
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
 Yes.

147
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
 ...bananaman.

148
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,520
 Who eats a banana when there comes a banana man?

149
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
 Absolutely.

150
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
 He's addicted to bananas.

151
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
 He is.

152
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
 Frodo?

153
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 Addicted to the ring.

154
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,520
 Oh my God.

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
 Superhero.

156
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
 Oh my God.

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,480
 Do you know, winning the lottery can also cause different kinds of problems.

158
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,640
 So a couple of decades ago, there was the Grand Bay Waffle House, whereby there used to be

159
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,480
 a customer who was called Edward Seward, and he used to come in and he used to just, as

160
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,440
 a tip, leave a lottery ticket every single time.

161
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
 That would be his thing.

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
 Okay.

163
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,680
 So this day, the waitress who was there was called Tonda Dickerson, and the numbers came

164
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,080
 up and she won $10 million.

165
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
 And this was an amazing thing.

166
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 So then she got the offer of, "Do you want to have it as the full $10 million or do you

167
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,680
 want to break it up over 30 years so she would get $375,000 every year?"

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
 She picked that option.

169
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
 Good idea.

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,680
 All of a sudden, chaos just erupted.

171
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,920
 Someone who worked there said, "Hang on, there's an unspoken rule that should anyone have ever

172
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,280
 won this, it would be split amongst us all."

173
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
 Oh, an unspoken rule.

174
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,280
 That's a tricky one.

175
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
 Yeah.

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
 Sorry.

177
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,960
 How much spoken is what they claimed.

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
 Oh, okay.

179
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
 Okay.

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
 We all just assumed.

181
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
 Sorry.

182
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,960
 Absolutely.

183
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
 Okay.

184
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
 Okay.

185
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Yeah.

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 Understanding.

187
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 Yeah.

188
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,680
 And so they took her to court and the court said, "Yeah, it needs to be split," but then

189
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,880
 she had that overturned.

190
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,640
 Then there was the guy who left the ticket himself saying, "I should be getting some of

191
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,120
 the benefit of this."

192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
 Yeah.

193
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
 Oh, no.

194
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
 You leave a lottery ticket behind.

195
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,960
 I think he said that there was also a spoken rule that he would get some sort of truck

196
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 as a compensation.

197
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
 She never got.

198
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
 Can't get this in writing.

199
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,240
 This is why we asked Malcolm to sign a release form.

200
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,440
 This is why you get his contracts down in writing.

201
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
 You get signatures.

202
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
 Yeah.

203
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
 And then the ex-husband got involved and actually tried to kidnap her at one point.

204
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,680
 Yeah.

205
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,120
 It was all horrific and then the IRS got involved and they wanted bigger amounts of the tax that

206
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,120
 they had taken off.

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,520
 It was hell for her to win it and not even for the benefits of people asking for money.

208
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
 It was people literally...

209
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,520
 But she could have just split...

210
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,040
 I mean, it's not that much hell for her because she could have just split it up equally between

211
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,920
 all the people who deserved it as was the unspoken or spoken agreement, couldn't she?

212
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
 Yes.

213
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
 My sympathy is limited.

214
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
 Oh, yeah.

215
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,920
 Just saying.

216
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
 It's a cautionary tale.

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
 Isn't there a...

218
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,760
 That's why you should always win a hundred billions so you can have them all assassinated

219
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
 and...

220
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,160
 Did they split tips as a matter of course in a restaurant?

221
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
 You usually would, right?

222
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
 I guess.

223
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 Do you think that would be a precedent?

224
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
 That would...

225
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,160
 I don't know.

226
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,160
 Some restaurants do and some restaurants don't.

227
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
 The question is whether that...

228
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
 Is it considered an ordinary...

229
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
 If it's...

230
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,160
 He left it as a tip.

231
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,160
 Yeah.

232
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,160
 That's a good point.

233
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
 That's a good point.

234
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
 So, you know, I...

235
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,400
 Way back in time when I worked in restaurants, I was never a waiter, I was always the dishwasher.

236
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
 We split...

237
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,280
 There was a policy that all tips were split.

238
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
 Yeah.

239
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
 It doesn't sound like...

240
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,280
 If there was a clear, I don't know, clear policy in place of splitting tips at this restaurant,

241
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,760
 this whole thing wouldn't have arisen, right?

242
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,880
 She clearly had the expectation, she must have been keeping her tips.

243
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 Yeah.

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
 I'm with her.

245
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,880
 Yeah.

246
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,880
 Oh, really?

247
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,880
 Yes.

248
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
 You think it's...

249
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
 In accordance with the restaurant policy, you're keeping your tips.

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,880
 You keep a 30 mil.

251
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
 I think you keep the...

252
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
 I mean, if she was...

253
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,600
 She should have turned around and out of the goodness of her heart, shared it, but they

254
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,040
 have no right to compel her to share it if to practice it in the restaurant was you keep

255
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
 your own tips.

256
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
 Well, there you go.

257
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
 We've got the case for the defense, the case for the prosecution.

258
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,320
 That's where you do the whole thing.

259
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,200
 I'll support whoever's willing to share the 30 million dollars, probably.

260
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,120
 Karris is another similar-ish food.

261
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,640
 It's also from 10th century Baghdad, which is fish tongues suspended in a concealed broth

262
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,680
 made of fish heads, boiled in vinegar.

263
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 Where is the...

264
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
 Where do you conceal the broth?

265
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
 What?

266
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
 Good point.

267
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 Oh my God.

268
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
 Congealed.

269
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
 Congealed.

270
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
 It's false.

271
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
 Sorry.

272
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,640
 You'll just have to trust me, the tongues are in there, but you know how to seal it.

273
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,640
 We'll bring the bill.

274
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,760
 You won't be able to see the bill, but sorry.

275
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,480
 One really cool way of taking chloroform was done by Anita Berber, who was a German dancer

276
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,800
 from the 1920s say, and she used to take some chloroform, put it in a bowl, and then stir

277
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,680
 it with a white rose, and then eat the rose petals, and that would be the way that she

278
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
 would get high.

279
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
 Wow.

280
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
 That's really cool.

281
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
 That's classy.

282
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
 It's quite sexy stuff.

283
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:59,320
 It's quite a sexy dame if I can use the words from the '90s up from the '20s.

284
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,560
 She did dances called cocaine, called morphium, quite often got naked in them.

285
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
 Dancers.

286
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
 Dancers.

287
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,560
 Yeah, she was a dancer.

288
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
 Cool.

289
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
 You wouldn't have thought it would improve your dancing, dosing up on chloroform beforehand.

290
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
 Was it a co-dance treat?

291
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
 I reckon she did it in...

292
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
 Yeah, a green room afterwards, probably.

293
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,560
 Yeah.

294
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,160
 Like cocaine's going to give you one hell of a kick, isn't it?

295
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 Yes.

296
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 Right.

297
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,800
 She was a Budapest and Vienna for both places for removing all of her clothes, and she supposedly

298
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,640
 ended up in prison in Zagreb for six weeks after insulting the King of Yugoslavia.

299
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
 Wow.

300
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
 That's great.

301
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
 That's a great person.

302
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
 What are you in for?

303
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
 I'm mugging.

304
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
 What about you?

305
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,080
 I insulted the King of Yugoslavia.

306
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,720
 Apparently, the King came up to her.

307
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,920
 She didn't know it was the King and said something in Serbian, I think.

308
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,520
 And she said, "I don't understand your barbaric tongue."

309
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
 She said, "I'm French."

310
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,520
 What was her name?

311
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
 Her name was Berber, though.

312
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
 Anita Berber.

313
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,560
 So it was kind of a clever joke, almost.

314
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
 Berberic.

315
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,560
 Berberic.

316
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
 Oh, that is clever.

317
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
 Yeah.

318
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
 She probably knew her surname.

319
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
 She'll probably offer that as a defence.

320
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
 Probably didn't work.

321
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,280
 There was another controversy, weirdly, just as we're talking about the raunchy side of

322
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,520
 chloroform, which is that it was frowned on partly because it caused erotic dreams.

323
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
 Did it?

324
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
 Yeah.

325
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,760
 So there was a chance that when it was used on women in labour, they would experience

326
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,200
 erotic visions.

327
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,040
 And there was a French woman who confessed, this is actually a related thing.

328
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
 This one is about Aether, which apparently had a similar effect.

329
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,840
 One French woman confessed that under the influence of Aether, she had dreamed about

330
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,720
 having sexual intercourse with her own husband.

331
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 Ugh, disgusting.

332
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 I know.

333
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,280
 Because we all thought you were going to say baby, then.

334
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
 I think we all thought we were watching you, believed.

335
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,960
 I don't think any of us went to bed.

336
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,960
 No.

337
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
 They never just either went there.

338
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
 No worries.

339
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,800
 I've got one very final use of chloroform, which is just so weird that I wanted to mention

340
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
 it.

341
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 It's in this book, "Cloroform" by Linda Stratman.

342
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
 Yeah.

343
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
 I mean, there were various uses.

344
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,040
 It was used to preserve meat in 1851.

345
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,320
 It was used, it was inserted into the rectum to treat irritability.

346
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,440
 You know, all of these uses...

347
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
 Irritability of the rectum, or just general irritability.

348
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
 Yes, yes.

349
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,120
 Okay.

350
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,120
 So there were all these uses, right?

351
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,520
 But in 1849, it was announced that chloroform could power a steamship.

352
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
 Oh, okay.

353
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,860
 And there was this test in the French port of Loréand.

354
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,200
 The steamship went around.

355
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
 How would it work?

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,160
 Well, if it's steam, it doesn't matter what you're boiling, right?

357
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
 Oh, I guess.

358
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 Is that...

359
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
 Does it seem like a waste?

360
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
 I thought it was the...

361
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 I didn't think that was what the...

362
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,440
 As in I thought it was water powering or being powered by...

363
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,400
 It could be, but I mean, you could take some chloroform and boil it and then use that.

364
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,400
 Yeah.

365
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 But I mean...

366
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
 It does seem like the entire crew would be unconscious.

367
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
 Yeah.

368
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
 Like the entire ship got going.

369
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
 Yeah, there's no further record.

370
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 But it worked.

371
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
 It worked.

372
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
 It happened.

373
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,960
 And then there's no other trace of it being used again.

374
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
 Wow.

375
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 Yeah.

376
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
 A mystery.

377
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,960
 Wow.

378
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
 Yeah.

379
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,520
 Maybe there was that one 10 years when it was used for everything and it turns out to be

380
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,680
 brilliant for everything.

381
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,040
 Then 10 years later, I thought, "Oh, what's that thing that we used?"

382
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,800
 Some illegible notes.

383
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 What is this?

384
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 Have you guys heard of dark lightning?

385
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 No.

386
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 Dark lightning.

387
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 It doesn't exist.

388
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,200
 No, it does.

389
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,020
 It's basically something that can happen in a lightning storm.

390
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,400
 But rather than being electricity as we know it, it's basically bursts of gamma rays.

391
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 So it's radiation.

392
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
 Yeah.

393
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,720
 And what will happen is if you get hit by dark lightning, you'd have to be flying for

394
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,000
 it to hit you really because it has to be quite high up.

395
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,240
 It can't come all the way down to the ground.

396
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,320
 But if you're in an aeroplane, for instance, if you're in a light aeroplane, you might

397
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,200
 get hit by it.

398
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,280
 And if you're hit by it in a light aeroplane, you would get as much energetic radiation as

399
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,360
 you would get in basically an entire lifetime.

400
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,360
 Oh, no.

401
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,360
 All in one go.

402
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,120
 Oh, you mean as a passenger on the plane?

403
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
 Yeah.

404
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
 You can't really cause cancer.

405
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
 Oh, my God.

406
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,480
 But you can't see it.

407
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 It just happens.

408
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 You can't feel it.

409
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 You can't see it.

410
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 You don't know you've been hit.

411
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 So does this happen?

412
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
 So this could just happen?

413
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 Yeah, yeah.

414
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
 It happens.

415
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
 Are there plane loads of people who have cancer who find out?

416
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 It's rare.

417
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
 It's rare.

418
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,100
 And that's actually, I mean, if you know about aeroplane, flying an aeroplane, aeroplane

419
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,600
 rides, I always say.

420
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,600
 They're outside the supermarket, aren't they?

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
 You put a quid in.

422
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,800
 I've been on loads of this.

423
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,600
 If you fly an aeroplane, you do get more cancerous radiation than if you don't, and

424
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,120
 it's partly due to this kind of stuff.

425
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
 But a lifetime worth.

426
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
 A lifetime.

427
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
 Yeah, that's a lot.

428
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,960
 It's not the sort of thing, not sort of lifetime supplier you want to win.

429
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
 No.

430
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,840
 You've lost a competition at that stage.

431
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,120
 It's called the Velvet Revolution, the fall of Soviet Czechoslovakia in 1989, called that

432
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,440
 because it was bloodless.

433
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,560
 In Slovakia, they call it the Gentle Revolution, and then in 1992 they split into Czechia or

434
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,760
 Czech Republic as it was then, and Slovakia, and that's sometimes called the Velvet Divorce.

435
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,640
 But in 2017 there was a poll, and I think this is kind of still true, that 42% of Czechs

436
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,120
 and 40% of Slovaks don't really agree with what happened, and they would rather still

437
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
 be Czechoslovakia.

438
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,440
 And in 1992 when it happened, it was 36% and 37% who wanted to split.

439
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,920
 So largely speaking, I mean, obviously it's quite a big split, but a lot of people in

440
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,940
 the country didn't really want to split.

441
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,960
 So we might be looking at a Velvet remarriage.

442
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,960
 That would be good.

443
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,160
 Like a Burton-Taylor scenario.

444
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,880
 Velvet Reformation of Vows.

445
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,720
 And by Klav Havel, who I mentioned, who was in charge of, he was basically the president

446
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,120
 of the new Czechoslovakia.

447
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,120
 Klav is a heroic anti-communist, he's an amazing revolutionary figure really.

448
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,640
 Like still now, if you speak to any Czechoslovak people, he's a superstar.

449
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,760
 He's a superhero.

450
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
 Superhero.

451
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,600
 Oh, so drug addicts, lives on the houseboat.

452
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
 Yeah, yeah.

453
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,320
 But there's two places in Prague that are named after him, the airport and the new stage

454
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,360
 of the National Theatre, and he hated the theatre and he hated flying.

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
 That's great.

456
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,600
 In your face.

457
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,240
 On the subject of the inside of an anus, it is on the same subject.

458
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,440
 Just gustatory cells that we have on our tongues.

459
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,880
 We also have them in our digestive system.

460
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,240
 So in your stomach and in your intestinal linings and stuff, there are, for example,

461
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,040
 glucose receptors, just like the ones on your tongue.

462
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,360
 It's good for your stomach to know that these things are in there so that they can send

463
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,520
 out the right enzymes and stuff to deal with it and pull those nutrients into your bloodstream.

464
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,440
 But it's such a shame it doesn't get to the brain though.

465
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,240
 It would be so fun if you ate and you could taste your food all the way down.

466
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,640
 It's always a sad moment when you swallow your food and then that's over, isn't it?

467
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,840
 A sad moment, yeah.

468
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
 Whereas, yeah.

469
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
 If you could keep enjoying the meal all the way through.

470
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
 All the way through.

471
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,720
 There would have to be a cut-off point at some point in your intestines.

472
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,440
 Why not go all the way through until it comes out on the other end?

473
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,560
 If it tastes sweet, it's fine, right?

474
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
 Yeah, I mean if, if.

475
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,640
 There will be a point where it's not a good look with a dragon's head or as all I'm saying.

476
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,800
 It's amazing how long we've been able to predict eclipses, thousands of years.

477
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
 Yeah, it's really weird.

478
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
 Yeah.

479
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
 Like in Brits of Humans, well done.

480
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,240
 But it wasn't great news for a lot of people.

481
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:08,160
 So ancient Mesopotamians in like the 2nd and 3rd millennia BC thought there was such bad

482
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,040
 news that, and so dangerous for the kingdom, that if there was eclipses coming, the king

483
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,940
 and queen would have to be removed from the throne and replaced by a substitute in case

484
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,960
 they were killed by this awful omen.

485
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
 Oh, really?

486
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
 Yeah.

487
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
 And it happened so much over hundreds of years.

488
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
 It's so cool.

489
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,460
 So you'd, you'd take the king away, you'd hide him, and you'd get a replacement king.

490
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,840
 You'd dress him up as a king.

491
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,480
 Which would be just like a farmer or like.

492
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
 Yeah, just a bloke, a gardener.

493
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
 It wasn't like someone who was next in line.

494
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
 It was, yeah.

495
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
 No, it's got to be the most lowly person possible because they might die.

496
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
 Because they might die.

497
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 Why?

498
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,040
 What happens after the eclipse when, presumably, they haven't died?

499
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,040
 They change back.

500
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,200
 Well, if you're the farmer, surely you're like, well, I'm king now.

501
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 Yeah.

502
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
 Well, but here's the thing.

503
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
 No, there's a couple of awkward things.

504
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 First of all, you get killed as the farmer.

505
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
 Yeah.

506
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
 Oh, you're joking.

507
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
 Just in case.

508
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
 Yeah.

509
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
 Have they secured my sign off on this arrangement as a farmer?

510
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,560
 You're sacrificing yourself for the health of your country.

511
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
 Yeah.

512
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
 For the good of the king.

513
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
 Well, that's what I've got a problem with.

514
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,320
 I still feel like there's a loophole that you have become king.

515
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,360
 And at that stage, you can say, you know, that rule about killing the farmer guy, let's

516
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
 not do that anymore.

517
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
 Yeah.

518
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,360
 Yeah, that's true.

519
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,680
 But there is an actual loophole, which is if the king does die in that period, the real

520
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,440
 king who's in hiding, the farmer then just stays.

521
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,640
 So you've got an incentive as the farmer to then have the king assassinated during that

522
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
 period.

523
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,640
 Exactly.

524
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
 You've got a very narrow window of opportunity.

525
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
 Six minutes.

526
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,000
 This is the ingredient of a very funny film, I think.

527
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,360
 A very short film.

528
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
 Yeah.

529
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
 Very short, yeah.

530
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
 I didn't know that was a rule.

531
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,400
 I did read, there was one instance where, so they didn't always kill the replacement,

532
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
 they usually did.

533
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
 But there was one person who didn't get killed, he just got to go back to being a gardener,

534
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
 which is what he was.

535
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,440
 He was called Enlil Barney.

536
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
 And then the king who he'd replaced died a couple of years later, a short time afterwards,

537
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,400
 and he was made king again.

538
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,720
 And he actually ruled this area until this was in Babylonian times, and he was Babylonian

539
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,040
 king for 25 years.

540
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
 Wow.

541
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
 That's good.

542
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
 Was he a good king?

543
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,600
 Did he just force everyone to have really nice gardens?

544
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,540
 That's not the worst thing you could do as a king, right?

545
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,080
 It seems like a kind of Prince Charles approach to being king.

546
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,080
 That's really good.

547
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 Yeah.

548
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,520
 It just goes to show, take opportunities when they come up, and you don't know how you're

549
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
 going to benefit further down the line.

550
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,040
 Do you change your tune from the, when did I sign off, well, you sign the form now then.

551
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,520
 There is somewhere where they celebrate kale in all of its glory in northern Germany.

552
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,960
 They have, so basically the kale harvest is a huge deal there around those parts.

553
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,680
 And they have a festival, and the main highlight of this festival seems to be the Kohlfart,

554
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:37,800
 the kale fart, or the kale walk.

555
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,320
 And there's, I think it's Oldenburg calls itself the Kohlfart capital of the world.

556
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,960
 And it sounds like such a fun event.

557
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
 So you...

558
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
 No, it doesn't.

559
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
 Isn't it?

560
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
 Because kale is cabbage, isn't it?

561
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
 Cabbage.

562
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
 Cabbage.

563
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
 So it's all sort of all cruciferous.

564
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,600
 I think it's kale is the main event, but then other cabbages can attend, I believe.

565
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,760
 And it's to celebrate that, and you get a kale king and queen crowned every year.

566
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,520
 And I think sometimes you can crown the king and queen based on, you weigh them at the

567
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
 start and then you weigh them at the end of the feast, and then whoever's gained the most

568
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
 weight gets to be king and queen for the next year.

569
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,320
 Whoever's eating the most kale.

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
 Yeah, basically.

571
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,200
 Which is served with like large chunks of meat.

572
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
 Yeah.

573
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:19,600
 It's also quite a mouthful, presumably that's the Kohlkönig and the Kohlkönigin.

574
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,160
 So the Kohlkönigin is king and queen.

575
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
 Oh, yes.

576
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 So you'd be the Kohlkönig.

577
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
 The Kohlkönigin.

578
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,160
 Kohlkönigin, yes.

579
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 It's quite hard to say.

580
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 That's brilliant.

581
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 There you go.

582
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,040
 Try saying that five times first after ten sausages.

583
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,960
 I think it's cool when there are amazing ways of cooking food that are not, you know, that

584
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,120
 you're taking something you're already using and you're just, you're using it to cook.

585
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
 That's a fried egg on a bonnet.

586
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
 Exactly.

587
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
 That's right.

588
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
 I was thinking actually a sausage on the exhaust pipe.

589
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:52,080
 Would that work, putting a sausage up the exhaust pipe of your car?

590
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
 No.

591
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
 I think it might do.

592
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,920
 But the chemicals will be shooting out of it, aren't they?

593
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,160
 You need to give it a rinse, I think afterwards, but I think could you, do you think it gets

594
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
 hot enough?

595
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
 I think it probably does.

596
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,720
 I think the exhaust pipe gets pretty hot.

597
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,720
 Yeah.

598
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,160
 You'd have to strap it in, like tie it, like strap it in and put the sausage up your exhaust

599
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
 pipe.

600
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
 I don't think so.

601
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,080
 Oh, I think it definitely would work.

602
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 It would taste rank.

603
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,000
 Fried egg on the bonnet, sausage up the exhaust pipe.

604
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,680
 You just need someone to cook the beans in the cigarette lighter.

605
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 Lovely.

606
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,680
 You can get a full English out of one's car.

607
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
 And that's how you toast.

608
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

609
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 Bread.

610
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,680
 This is just my cooking cup.

611
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:37,800
 I thought the etymology of the emu family, ratites is quite interesting, because they're

612
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,120
 called ratites and that includes all the big birds, you know, all the famous ones.

613
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
 Cassowary.

614
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
 Nice.

615
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
 Chris Ria.

616
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
 Very nice, yeah.

617
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
 Chris Ria.

618
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
 Chris Ria.

619
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
 Yeah, he's in there.

620
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
 Yeah.

621
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
 You're ostrich.

622
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
 And your kiwis actually, who just sneak in there even though they're quite small and

623
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 squat.

624
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
 Right.

625
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,120
 But ratite, I thought, well, that's weird, because they're not very rat-like, but it

626
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,980
 actually comes surprisingly from a different origin, which comes from the Latin to mean

627
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,400
 a raft.

628
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,000
 And that's because the key thing about ratites and the reason they're flightless is because

629
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,240
 they have no keel, which I didn't know, is the big extension of a breastbone that you

630
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,840
 can see if you look at the skeleton of any of these big birds and it holds onto the pectoral

631
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
 muscles.

632
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,600
 So the big muscles, if you don't have a keel, those poor wing muscles have got nothing

633
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,640
 to sort of get purchased against, so they just flap uselessly and embarrassingly, whereas

634
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,560
 all are the birds, you know, they've got something to hold their wings onto you.

635
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
 Interesting.

636
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
 So ratite comes from raft.

637
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,040
 Raft, because a raft is a boat without a keel.

638
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
 Oh my God.

639
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,040
 That is quite good.

640
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
 That's great.

641
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
 That's a long journey.

642
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
 But what a journey.

643
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:43,600
 We were talking about Irish dancing before.

644
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,680
 Do you know why in Irish dancing you stand with your top half completely still?

645
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,740
 Is it because they're always holding a very full cup of coffee at the time, aren't they?

646
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,720
 I would guess, logically, it must be that you've got room for your legs to move, but not

647
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 your arms, right?

648
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:05,760
 So maybe the rooms they performed in were very narrow above hip height, but very broad

649
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,040
 like rooms are often different.

650
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,480
 How are they getting into those rooms?

651
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,920
 It doesn't make any sense, does it?

652
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,640
 We have to crawl into the room because it's very open, and then we stand up into the narrowing

653
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,640
 closed space.

654
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,040
 I've never seen a room like this, by the way, I just guess it.

655
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,040
 I don't think I've said it here once, I was looking at houses and I went to this house

656
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,400
 and they had a bedroom, but they have two kids there, and the kids didn't want to stay

657
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,280
 in the same bedroom, but they only had one bedroom, and so they made it so it was in

658
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,880
 half top and bottom, so they put a fake floor halfway up the wall, and one of the kids had

659
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,120
 to climb up onto the top half, and the other one had his little sort of underground room

660
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
 that he had.

661
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
 So it's like a bunk bed, but a whole room?

662
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
 The whole room was a bunk bed.

663
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
 That's brilliant.

664
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,680
 You'd want to be in the top bit, wouldn't you?

665
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
 Yeah.

666
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
 You'd want to climb up.

667
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 Especially because I don't trust my parents' building abilities, that floor's going to fall

668
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
 through at some point.

669
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:03,120
 Yeah, sorry, we were saying about the Irish, so basically Irish dancing was outlawed by

670
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,160
 the English along with other things like Irish sports, stuff like that, and so the theory

671
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,260
 goes that the Irish would keep their top half still and dance with their bottom half,

672
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,400
 so the British wouldn't be able to tell if they were dancing if they saw them in the

673
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,000
 window of a pub or behind a hedge.

674
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Brilliant.

675
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Brilliant.

676
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Just dancing the way he's dancing.

677
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Yeah, yeah.

678
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,200
 We're just having a quiet pint of Guinness.

679
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,040
 Exactly, and one of the theory is that it began when some dancers were forced to dance

680
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:38,080
 for Queen Elizabeth I, and she was responsible for starting the plantations in Ireland, so

681
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,280
 they had no chance but to dance, but to protest against it and show their fellow countrymen

682
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,760
 that they didn't want to dance in front of the Queen, they kept their top half really

683
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
 still.

684
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
 Like throwing a real strop?

685
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
 Yeah.

686
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,880
 Like eating your peas, but crying at the same time?

687
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,720
 Kind of like folding your arms with a grumpy face, but then your legs are still dancing,

688
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 kind of thing.

689
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 Wow.

690
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,120
 That's hilarious.

691
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,760
 Just on floodlights, I don't know if this is interesting, but the first time they had

692
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,560
 floodlights at Old Trafford I was reading yesterday, they were going to play against

693
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,680
 Real Madrid the following week, and they knew that there would be floodlights in Spain,

694
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,400
 and so they quickly put up their own floodlights, and they were playing Bolton Wanderers in

695
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,320
 the league, and they made the Bolton players dress like Real Madrid players so that they

696
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,360
 be able to see what the Real Madrid players would look like.

697
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
 Oh, wow.

698
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,920
 So they wore like, and they already both wore white, but they wore the same shorts and the

699
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,920
 same socks as Real Madrid.

700
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
 That's amazing.

701
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,920
 So they could just do a dummy run of...

702
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,920
 Pretty much.

703
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,920
 Even though it was a proper league match in the UK, they wanted to be like, "Okay."

704
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
 Can you still do that?

705
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,920
 Football matches, can you insist that your opponents wear a costume?

706
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
 Clown outfit.

707
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
 Clown outfit.

708
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
 Effectively.

709
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,920
 Or clown outfit.

710
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 Big slam on Real Madrid there.

711
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
 Or Bolton.

712
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
 Yeah.

713
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,680
 But yeah, I think like in those days it was, everyone was quite wanting the English teams

714
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
 to do well in Europe, so they helped them out.

715
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
 Wow.

716
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,160
 Anyway.

717
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,360
 If you had clown shoes on, would that help or hinder your match?

718
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,360
 Hinder.

719
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,360
 I think you know the answer to that.

720
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,360
 Hang on, hang on.

721
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
 I haven't done anything to the question.

722
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
 In a football match?

723
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
 Yeah, I was going to say...

724
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,360
 Or in the big top.

725
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,280
 In a dance match, it would be bad actually, wouldn't it?

726
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,160
 Because you would be quite further, you'd be a lot further away from the board.

727
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:18,120
 But you could possibly counterweight yourself and bend forward really far if you had heavy

728
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
 shoes.

729
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
 Exactly.

730
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,560
 If you were the goalie, you would have a longer reach for getting to the ball.

731
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,560
 Why?

732
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,080
 Well, if you had to kick your leg out, that little two-inch difference might be...

733
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,680
 I've once played football in Wellington Boots, and I can say that it was much more difficult

734
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,080
 than playing in football boots.

735
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,820
 But was everyone playing in the Wellington Boots?

736
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:40,680
 Everyone on my team was, and the other team were in normal shoes.

737
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:45,280
 Were the other team about to play some international team which was going to play in a monsoon?

738
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
 They needed...

739
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 They were about to play in a monsoon, and they needed...

740
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,960
 It was for charity when I was a kid.

741
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
 Right.

742
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,880
 So our Wellington Boots were full of custard as well, so that also helped.

743
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 What?

744
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
 That'll make it more difficult.

745
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 Yeah.

746
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 Yeah.

747
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
 What?

748
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 It was for the...

749
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,880
 Possibly the first, or maybe the second, never, comment relief.

750
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 Wow.

751
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
 Really?

752
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,880
 Did you have to drink the custard at the end?

753
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 No.

754
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 I would have thought that would be...

755
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,880
 Really?

756
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 Just oranges like normal.

757
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
 What was the final score?

758
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 I don't recall.

759
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,880
 Did you decide when?

760
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,800
 I think we must have done, because we were playing against kids, like really young kids.

761
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,800
 Yeah.

762
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,800
 Sorry.

763
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
 Hang on.

764
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
 You were adults.

765
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,800
 No, we weren't adults, but we were older kids.

766
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 Yeah.

767
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
 But you had the handicap of...

768
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 Exactly.

769
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,800
 Wellington Boots full of custard.

770
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
 That's right.

771
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
 Okay.

772
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
 Okay.

773
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
 So if more matches have played like that, I'd be more attracted to football.

774
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 Yeah, yeah.

775
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
 Exactly.

776
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,800
 I think it would be fascinating to see...

777
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
 That sort of weird handicap when you come to someone's home ground, they have to just...

778
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 Yeah.

779
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
 Who's the best football team at the moment?

780
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 Man City.

781
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
 Man City.

782
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
 Man City.

783
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
 I'd love to see Man City play...

784
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
 Sorry, who's the worst football team at the moment?

785
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 Trump.

786
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
 Trump is.

787
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
 That's my team.

788
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 Okay, I'd love to see...

789
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,800
 Man City play Tremerovers, but Man City are all tied together in a line.

790
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
 That's great.

791
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
 Oh, nice.

792
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 I think...

793
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,800
 Like, the handicap depends on the deficiency between the two teams, right?

794
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
 Exactly.

795
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
 Yeah.

796
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
 That's great.

797
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
 Or if they were positioned like foosball, so like a...

798
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 Yeah.

799
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
 You know, a big mess of ball.

800
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 Oh, yeah.

801
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,800
 They will be drilled through their bodies.

802
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
 Yeah, through.

803
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

804
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
 In the position.

805
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,800
 Anyway, I look forward to that nil-nil game between Tremero and Man City.

806
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,800
 Jon Osborne wrote, "Don't look back in anger while sitting on a deck chair in Morgan Bay for 17 days."

807
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
 That's great.

808
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 Get piled.

809
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
 There's play.

810
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
 It's a play, right?

811
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 It's a play, yeah, yeah.

812
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
 It's a famous angry young man play.

813
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
 Well, it was where angry young men came from.

814
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 They named it in the reviews for it.

815
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,800
 But yeah.

816
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,800
 It's quite hard to look back on a deck chair, isn't it?

817
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 Yeah, that's why they got so angry.

818
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,800
 Yeah.

819
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
 Being angry on a deck chair doesn't feel right, does it?

820
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 No.

821
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
 It's like being angry on a trampoline.

822
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 You can't do it.

823
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,800
 You can't do it.

824
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,800
 You can be angry.

825
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
 Should we put dangerous world leaders on deck chairs?

826
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,800
 Or like Putin should have all his meetings on a deck chair from now on.

827
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
 And it might solve a lot of problems.

828
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,800
 Put them in soft play centres.

829
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 Yeah.

830
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
 That's where they belong.

831
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
 Your coffers should be.

832
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
 Yeah.

833
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 Apparently, in look back in anger, it is kind of one of these kitchen sink plays.

834
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
 I haven't seen it, actually.

835
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,800
 But there is a moment where someone brings out an ironing board.

836
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,800
 And apparently the first time it played in London's Royal Court Theatre,

837
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:14,800
 the audience gasped because there was an ironing board on stage.

838
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 When was it?

839
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
 It started in 1956.

840
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 That's great.

841
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
 But you didn't have them in those days.

842
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
 If all you've seen was the importance of being earnest.

843
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 Yeah.

844
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
 No ironing at all.

845
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
 Or Shakespeare or whatever.

846
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
 Yeah.

847
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,800
 And there was a review where apparently there's a woman,

848
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,800
 one of the characters is basically ironing throughout the first half.

849
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,800
 But there was a review saying a guy called Gerald Berry,

850
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
 who said that he almost had a nervous breakdown,

851
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,800
 watching her take so long to iron one pajama top.

852
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 It was supposed to be realism,

853
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 but she didn't change any of the ironing.

854
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
 She just sat there ironing this one thing all the way through the book.

855
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
 That's so funny.

856
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,800
 You would definitely focus on that when you were in the audience.

857
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
 I wouldn't be listening to anything they said.

858
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
 I'd say she's still not ironing that top.

859
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 That's really funny.

860
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
 Definitely funny.

861
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,800
 We're just one other cool thing that they have in airport.

862
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
 And this is around the world as well.

863
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,800
 So you know how you have your runway.

864
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
 And when you're landing a plane,

865
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
 you don't want to go off the end of the runway.

866
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 It's frowned on.

867
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
 But you can't land exactly at the beginning of the runway.

868
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 And sometimes, you know,

869
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
 terrible conditions or there's a mistake in the cockpit, whatever,

870
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,800
 planes do just go a bit further than they should.

871
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,800
 There's an amazing system they have,

872
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
 which is called EMAS.

873
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,800
 It's engineered materials arresting system.

874
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 So it looks like normal tarmac runway, right?

875
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,800
 But it's designed to crunch down

876
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,800
 and to collapse like a blamange as soon as the plane hits it.

877
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,800
 So it's like the plane runs into treacle.

878
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
 It just slows the plane down and brings it to a complete stop.

879
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
 And it's just this amazing crunchy surface

880
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
 that they have beyond the end of runways

881
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
 in loads of airports these days.

882
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 If you accidentally wander onto that,

883
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
 do you end up crunched up?

884
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
 You miss your flight.

885
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
 But it destroys the plane's wheels

886
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 just because it just is grinding it to a halt

887
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
 because it's literally designed to collapse.

888
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,800
 Here's one thing.

889
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,800
 Another thing that might happen,

890
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,800
 you're taking off.

891
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
 Obviously, like you say,

892
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
 sometimes mistakes, sometimes you go too far,

893
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 you start in the wrong place.

894
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,800
 What if you're trying to take off and you hit this stuff?

895
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 Oh, yeah.

896
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,800
 Yeah, probably huge problems.

897
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 Delays, I imagine, for the passengers.

898
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

899
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 I think, I don't know if it's ever happened.

900
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 It might be.

901
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
 It's not nose dive into the ground.

902
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 My wife, when she sleeps,

903
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
 she puts her arms above her like a zombie.

904
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
 That's quite scary.

905
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 You mean she's on her back and she sticks them out?

906
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
 Yeah, yeah, in the air.

907
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 Is it a sort of slow rise

908
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
 or just they straight up in a sort of...

909
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 Yeah, no, I'm not like Hitler.

910
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,800
 I've never asked her if she's dreaming about being at Nuremberg.

911
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
 Maybe she is, but no, they're like,

912
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 they slowly rise until they're vertical.

913
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,800
 Wow.

914
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
 Yeah.

915
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,800
 Does she say, "brains, brains, brains"?

916
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,800
 I imagine you wake up with sort of pins and needles.

917
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 Yeah, you think so, right?

918
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
 Yeah, you think so, right?

919
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 She wakes, that's when she's in a really deep sleep,

920
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
 so by the time she's woken up, she's no longer riking.

921
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,800
 Emus has been banned from a hotel in Queensland

922
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,800
 for misbehaving.

923
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,800
 Okay.

924
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
 Really?

925
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 A Yorak hotel.

926
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
 It's in a very remote part of Western Queensland

927
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 and they've actually put a sign up saying,

928
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,800
 "Emus, a ban for bad behaviour

929
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
 and there's a rope and you have to fasten it behind you,"

930
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
 because they kept,

931
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
 there are just two Emus left in the area

932
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
 called Kevin and Carol

933
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
 and they kept wandering into the pub

934
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
 and stealing guest possessions

935
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
 and apparently putting their heads in the toaster

936
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,800
 to take, to take, to take toaster out.

937
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,800
 Can they read?

938
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
 What good is the sign?

939
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,800
 That feels a bit...

940
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,800
 If there are only two Emus in the area,

941
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,800
 it feels like a bit of overkill, frankly,

942
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
 to ban all Emus

943
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,800
 when actually you're just aiming this at Kevin and Carol.

944
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,800
 Just say that on the sign.

945
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
 Just say, "Kevin and Carol,

946
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,800
 Kevin and Carol ban from this place.

947
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
 Please cover that with the rope when you go in."

948
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,800
 You're right, don't tar all Emus with the Kevin and Carol brush.

949
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
 I got a very small quiz,

950
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
 potentially one-question quiz.

951
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
 Derring a quiz.

952
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
 Let's begin.

953
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,800
 You've just walked up to Saddam Hussein.

954
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,800
 You're going to give him a kiss.

955
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
 Okay.

956
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 Where do you kiss him?

957
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,800
 Is this after he died?

958
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 No, pre-death.

959
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,800
 Is he still in charge?

960
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 He's still in charge.

961
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,800
 On the moustache.

962
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
 Ooh, lovely stuff.

963
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,800
 But not the lips.

964
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,800
 But not the lips.

965
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 Yeah.

966
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,800
 He's got a big moustache.

967
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
 That's very achievable.

968
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
 Yeah.

969
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,800
 I mean, I like to think I'd have more self-control.

970
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,800
 But if I'm compelled to, this is a diplomatic thing.

971
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
 And you know, otherwise...

972
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 You're going for what he wants.

973
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
 Oh, what he wants.

974
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 I'd say the berry.

975
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
 Oh, interesting.

976
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,800
 Interesting.

977
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,800
 Yeah.

978
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,800
 Well, I'm just thinking about what's left of Saddam Hussein.

979
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
 Maybe on his medals, did he not always...

980
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
 Are my thinking of someone else?

981
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 He probably wore a few.

982
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
 Colonel Gaddafi.

983
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,800
 I don't know.

984
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
 But yeah, maybe on his medals.

985
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,800
 You've picked...

986
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,800
 James is the closest.

987
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
 You've picked the right spot.

988
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
 Nipple.

989
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
 It's the armpits.

990
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
 It's roughly in the armpit area.

991
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
 Sort of chest going into the armpits.

992
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 No.

993
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
 So this was discovered by a guy called Joel Soler.

994
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,800
 He made a documentary about Saddam Hussein.

995
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,800
 He went into Iraq under a different...

996
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
 Like he claimed he was there filming some other stuff.

997
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,800
 And then he smuggled archive footage that had been filmed of Saddam Hussein while he was there out of the country.

998
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
 And he made a satirical documentary about all the stuff.

999
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,800
 I believe, I hope I'm not being tricked here, but I believe all the stuff in it is...

1000
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,800
 Like Michael Moore's satirical documentaries are real stuff, real fact the whole way through.

1001
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
 He got footage of where Saddam, who was a hygiene freak, to...

1002
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,800
 He didn't want to kiss his on the cheek, so that's where you would kiss him.

1003
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,800
 In his armpit areas.

1004
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,800
 All these weird leaders are hygiene freaks.

1005
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,800
 That was a strong correlation.

1006
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,800
 Sorry, can I just pick up down on the way he said hygiene?

1007
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,800
 I think the reason that they're hygiene freaks is because they think they might be assassinated.

1008
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
 A lot of them.

1009
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
 A paradise.

1010
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
 The gun is in their mouth.

1011
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
 And you don't want to...

1012
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
 You could be shot in the armpit and live.

1013
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
 That's fine.

1014
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
 But you know...

1015
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,800
 Okay, well, second question to the quiz and then I'll be done with the quiz.

1016
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 Did I get the points for the first one?

1017
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,800
 You do, you absolutely.

1018
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,800
 So James is winning 1-0.

1019
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,800
 Right.

1020
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 So, second question.

1021
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
 You're a princess.

1022
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
 You found a frog.

1023
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
 You're chatting to the frog.

1024
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 The frog's chatting back.

1025
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
 You realise you could turn this frog into a prince.

1026
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,800
 Where do you kiss the frog according to the grim tales?

1027
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,800
 Can I just say, first of all, someone's stomach rumbled halfway through that fact.

1028
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,800
 And I really hope it came up on the mics because it sounded like a frog was in the room.

1029
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,800
 Who was it?

1030
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 Was that me?

1031
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,800
 I'll dive in and I'll go classic reversal.

1032
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
 I'll say the bum.

1033
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
 Oh, damn it.

1034
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
 I knew I shouldn't have let you go first.

1035
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
 It's not what you're going to say.

1036
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,800
 Yeah, it just feels like the only other non-obvious hole.

1037
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
 A nostril?

1038
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
 A nostril.

1039
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
 A frog nostril.

1040
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 Well, I'm thinking the fact that it's in the same quiz, armpit.

1041
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,800
 Ah, very nice answer as well.

1042
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 No, the answer is that you don't need to kiss the frog at all.

1043
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
 That's a later addition to the story.

1044
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,800
 Oh, really?

1045
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
 Yeah.

1046
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,800
 So in the original grim story, rather than kissing the frog, she gets really pissed off with the frog,

1047
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 picks it up and chucks it at a wall.

1048
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,800
 And when it smashes at the wall, it then turns into the prince.

1049
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
 Wow.

1050
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
 Yeah, there's no kiss at all.

1051
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
 She's like, she picks it up.

1052
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 Now, will you be quiet, you ugly frog, pegs it at the wall,

1053
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,800
 and then a handsome prince just sort of pops out from the-

1054
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
 Wait, but is he-

1055
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,800
 I'll roll his bones broken because he's just been thrown at the wall.

1056
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
 So presumably he doesn't fancy her after that.

1057
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,800
 Yeah, she's really shown her character there.

1058
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
 That's true.

1059
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,800
 They do say you have to throw a lot of men against the wall before you find your prince.

1060
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,800
 Scallops move around using jet propulsion.

1061
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
 Oh, my God.

1062
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,800
 That's amazing, isn't it?

1063
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,800
 Yeah, it's incredible.

1064
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
 That big muscle means they can just clamp that thing close really quickly, really strongly.

1065
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
 It creates a jet of water and they move around.

1066
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,800
 It's to get away from predators.

1067
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,800
 They can make the jet go in different directions, so they have this kind of random motion.

1068
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,800
 It's basically an evasive manoeuvre.

1069
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,800
 It's so cool.

1070
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
 Yeah.

1071
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
 If you see a footage of a scallop escaping from something, it's like,

1072
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
 it reminded me of the chattering teeth.

1073
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 Yeah.

1074
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,800
 It just sort of go off in one direction.

1075
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
 That's weird.

1076
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
 It's a bit random and it's, you know.

1077
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,800
 It reminded me of Sesame Street animals for exactly the same.

1078
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
 Is that one that, you know, the Sesame Street Muppets?

1079
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
 Their mouths.

1080
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
 The Muppets Muppets.

1081
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
 Yeah, yeah.

1082
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,800
 Well, there's a bit of a cinematic universe going on here.

1083
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
 There's the Muppets on the Muppet show.

1084
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,800
 And then the Sesame Street, which I think is, I think they are Muppets on Sesame Street.

1085
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
 Is Big Bird a Muppet?

1086
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,800
 Oh, God, I thought they all were.

1087
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
 Maybe the Muppets is a trademark for the Muppets.

1088
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 Which are the ones that do have mouths like scallops that snap, snap, snap,

1089
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
 like you say, like the teeth?

1090
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
 I think all of them do.

1091
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
 I think that's not a useful.

1092
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
 Maybe Big Bird doesn't, I don't know.

1093
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
 No, Big Bird has a beak.

1094
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
 No, that's a completely different one.

1095
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,800
 But Big Bird's just a bloke in a suit, isn't it?

1096
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
 Yes.

1097
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
 What?

1098
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,800
 But they are manic, aren't they?

1099
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
 Like chattering, looping around.

1100
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
 And they move so fast through the water.

1101
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,800
 It's incredible.

1102
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,800
 You'd think they were really slow, but no.

1103
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,800
 I think, I've been on a jet ski quite recently and I found that it's really hard

1104
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
 to change direction when you're going slowly,

1105
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,800
 but actually weirdly a lot easier when you're going a bit quicker.

1106
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,800
 So I wonder if there's something to do with that if they're jet propelled.

1107
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
 Yeah.

1108
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
 There's no stability in the way they move, so they sort of tumble as they go.

1109
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
 So every time they squeeze the water out,

1110
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,800
 they're facing in a new direction anyway, so they just kind of tumble around.

1111
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,800
 Interesting.

1112
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,800
 So Gatwick has a train line at the end of its runway.

1113
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,800
 And as it trains, like not right at the end,

1114
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
 like there's just a train track that goes past Gatwick Airport.

1115
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 But there's a special tripwire in the train track.

1116
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
 And I think it has it when it runs past Gatwick

1117
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,800
 and then it runs past another airport somewhere else in the south.

1118
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,800
 But there's a tripwire that automatically cuts the power to trains

1119
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
 if a plane doesn't stop at the end of the runway.

1120
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
 So there's a system that detects immediately if the plane hasn't stopped

1121
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
 and that cuts the power.

1122
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
 And it has been tripped occasionally, but by accident,

1123
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
 which is quite annoying because your train just does an emergency stop.

1124
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
 That's awesome.

1125
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
 That's so clever.

1126
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 It's a clever system.

1127
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 What if you're in the line of the actual runway?

1128
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
 Yeah, that's a cock up, I suppose.

1129
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
 You just cross your fingers.

1130
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
 I know it's really cold there.

1131
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,800
 I know that, guys.

1132
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,800
 And the Antarctic.

1133
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,800
 Yeah, and the Antarctic.

1134
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,800
 I know it's cold there.

1135
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
 I know that.

1136
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,800
 But what I didn't know is how cold it was.

1137
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,800
 And I now have a good way of measuring possibly for some listener at home

1138
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,800
 of how cold it was and it is in the Antarctic.

1139
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
 So we told a story back in episode 111 of the time

1140
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,800
 when Neil Armstrong, Edmund Hillary and Steve Fossett

1141
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
 all went to the North Pole together.

1142
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,800
 So there was a guy who dreamed of bringing the first man on top of the world,

1143
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,800
 the first man off the world, and Steve Fossett.

1144
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
 And Steve Fossett.

1145
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
 He went around the world.

1146
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
 He was a ballooner, right?

1147
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
 Okay, he's definitely less famous.

1148
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
 He's definitely the--

1149
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
 Oh, yeah.

1150
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
 But he was a very rich billionaire, Branson-esque kind of person.

1151
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
 Yeah.

1152
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
 And so--

1153
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
 Bring the guy with the money.

1154
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

1155
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
 And so they all went there and they landed, they didn't do it a proper track.

1156
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,800
 They sort of got brought by helicopter and so on to land there.

1157
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,800
 And when they landed there to celebrate,

1158
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,800
 they popped open a bottle of champagne and before even two glasses were poured,

1159
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
 the entire champagne froze.

1160
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
 That's how cold it is.

1161
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
 Champagne will freeze within two doors.

1162
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,800
 I'm not that surprised by that because I've seen like videos on YouTube

1163
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
 in really cold places where people like pour hot water

1164
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,800
 and it just freezes on the way down.

1165
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,800
 Wow.

1166
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
 But you have to down it super fast then.

1167
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
 Pretty bad gas.

1168
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,800
 It's very hard holding the flute in your mitt as well.

1169
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,800
 Excuse me, I asked for this whiskey without ice.

1170
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,800
 Wow.

1171
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,800
 What a way to kill someone because if you drank and it froze as it was going down your throat

1172
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
 and sort of blocked your entire--

1173
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
 Luckily, hopefully your throat is not so cold that it would--

1174
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
 If your throat is cold enough to freeze water, you're probably already dead.

1175
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
 Good point.

1176
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
 Otherwise, you're eating all the stuff and you're worrying it's going to freeze in your stomach.

1177
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,800
 Yeah, I think your assassination club needs more work.

1178
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,800
 The other day I drove across for the first time.

1179
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:58,800
 You know, if you drive into Gibraltar, you have to drive over and feel--

1180
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
 Yeah.

1181
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,800
 No, no.

1182
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
 Yeah, so it's a runway.

1183
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,800
 Kind of like how you stop for a train and let the train pass and then they lift it up.

1184
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,800
 That's the runway.

1185
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,800
 Yeah, so like you drive into the-- you go through Pascalville control

1186
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,800
 and then it's a straight road and the runway goes right across your road

1187
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,800
 and if there's a plane coming, it stops you from going.

1188
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
 But you know when you go across a level crossing and there's trains

1189
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,800
 and you're still thinking right, I'm going to definitely check both ways just in case.

1190
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,800
 You definitely do that for planes as well.

1191
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,800
 Always looking, oh, I hope there's not a 747 about to come this way.

1192
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,800
 Yeah, I always get so freaked out going over level crossings that have let me go through,

1193
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
 the lights are green, they're not even deeing down.

1194
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,800
 I also assume that my car is just going to get over one of them

1195
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,800
 and not on the other one and I'm just going to be balanced on top of the rails.

1196
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:47,800
 You do drive one of those Cozy Coupe red in the other car, don't you?

1197
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,800
 In the the queue, something that got quite a bad rep was our old friend What3Words.

1198
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
 Oh, really? Yeah.

1199
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,800
 What3Words for anyone who doesn't know.

1200
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,800
 So What3Words is basically a system of addresses where a place is identified by just three random words.

1201
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,800
 So you get the coordinates and you can say, hey, can you come to a bubble--

1202
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
 It's hard to think of three words, isn't it?

1203
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,800
 Bubblecat table and then that'll be a specific place in the world and it'll be somewhere in Finland.

1204
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,800
 You put the three words into your app and it'll tell you exactly where to go.

1205
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,800
 Yes, but I'd never thought of the flaw in What3Words before until the queue happened,

1206
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
 which is that if you don't get it exactly right, unlike if you don't get a normal address exactly right,

1207
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,800
 it's usually quite close, this would have sent you somewhere completely different.

1208
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,800
 So there was a bunch of queers who were told to go and start queuing in California.

1209
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,800
 Well, What3Words say is that actually if you put the three words into your app

1210
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,800
 and it tells you that the start of the queue to see the queen is in California,

1211
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,800
 you might think, probably I've put the wrong word in.

1212
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,800
 Whereas if you say it's number 34 High Street and it's actually number 38 High Street,

1213
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
 then it's more likely that you'll get things mixed up.

1214
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
 But people can be silly, can't they?

1215
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
 You know, they'd heard it was long, maybe they thought.

1216
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,800
 And it did keep on, it was because I think the What3Words was same valve grid.

1217
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,800
 What was that? Was that the end of the queue?

1218
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
 That was the end of the queue, yeah, exactly.

1219
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,800
 So that's where people went and actually it was supposed to be same value grid, I think.

1220
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,800
 And then they accidentally misdirected people to a different part of London,

1221
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 which could have been confusing for people.

1222
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
 Right, interesting.

1223
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
 And then sent them to North Carolina later on.

1224
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,800
 So who knows how many idiots are scattered across bits of North America now?

1225
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,800
 None of this is the fault of What3Words in my opinion.

1226
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,800
 I'm going to stick with Andy's opinion as well.

1227
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,800
 Look, I'm not Andy What3Words either, just be careful of typos.

1228
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,800
 Helicopters create lightning, sometimes, I heard.

1229
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,800
 I've been in quite a few helicopters and never noticed it.

1230
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,800
 Well, you've been lucky, be careful.

1231
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,800
 So this happens wherever there are helicopters

1232
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,800
 and thunderstorms happening at the same time, or heavy rain.

1233
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,800
 And in the North Sea, a small number of helicopters will be struck by lightning every year.

1234
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,800
 And they're struck way more than they would ordinarily be.

1235
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
 And even if there's no lightning in the area, it can happen.

1236
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
 So what's going on?

1237
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,800
 I don't know the exact process, but I don't know.

1238
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,800
 So it doesn't come out of them, it's not like you see a helicopter above you

1239
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,800
 and it might target you and strike you down with lightning?

1240
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
 No, it's not Zeus.

1241
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,800
 What do you mean create lightning?

1242
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,800
 Static created by the blades, I'm guessing.

1243
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
 It must be something to do with that.

1244
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
 Yeah, I don't know the exact explanation.

1245
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,800
 But helicopters do have anti-lightning technology on them.

1246
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,800
 Well, it's not working, it sounds like.

1247
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,800
 It's creating it.

1248
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
 I think how many would be plummeting out of the sky without it?

1249
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,800
 To protect the people inside, I mean.

1250
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,800
 So if planes these days get hit by lightning all the time, it's normally fine.

1251
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
 And same with helicopters, yeah.

1252
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
 Wow.

1253
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
 I've got one very final thing.

1254
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,800
 Have you guys heard of, I know you've heard of the Wilhelm Scream.

1255
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,800
 Yeah?

1256
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:53,800
 Yes.

1257
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
 Have you guys heard of Castle Thunder?

1258
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,800
 No.

1259
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,800
 But the Wilhelm Scream for people who don't know, it's that Scream in movies that is used over and over again.

1260
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,800
 Sounds about like that.

1261
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,800
 That was quite good.

1262
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,800
 Well, there is a single movie Thunder Clap as well.

1263
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,800
 And it's called Castle Thunder.

1264
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,800
 And it's used in so many films.

1265
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,800
 So it's in the original Frankenstein.

1266
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,800
 It was in Cleopatra.

1267
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,800
 I can hear it in my head right now.

1268
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,800
 Bambi, Sleeping Beauty, Star Wars, Ghostbusters, Citizen Kane.

1269
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
 It's in so many.

1270
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
 And it's one sound.

1271
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,800
 I think it is.

1272
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,800
 That could be so many.

1273
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,800
 No, no, but the rhythm, the rhythm of that.

1274
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,800
 Yeah, yeah, you might be right.

1275
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
 Which one resonated with you guys?

1276
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,800
 Bambi is the scene I remember best of those.

1277
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,800
 I'm not sure I've seen any of them.

1278
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,800
 What were they?

1279
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
 All there's nothing recent.

1280
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:41,800
 Yeah.

1281
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,800
 Stop on my mum will shoot.

1282
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,800
 You might have seen the original Ghostbusters.

1283
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,800
 I have actually.

1284
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
 For a sort of, you know, if you were on a history trip or something.

1285
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
 I actually did watch that when I was a kid.

1286
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1287
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:52,800
 That's good. What's in that?

1288
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,800
 Oh, Castle Thunder.

1289
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
 Very cool.

1290
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,800
 Okay, that's it.

1291
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
