00:00:00,00:00:04,We run it on QI a few years ago. Yeah. Which was there's no such thing as a fish.
00:00:04,00:00:09,You did a nice such thing as a fish. No seriously it's in the Oxford Dictionary of Underwater Life.
00:00:09,00:00:12,It says it right there first paragraph no such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:22,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:22,00:00:26,from the QI offices in Covenant Garden. My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting with two
00:00:26,00:00:31,of the regular elves Andy Murray and Anna Chazinski and we have a special guest today.
00:00:31,00:00:35,"It's the co-host of Antony, this Helen Zoltzman and once again we gathered around with our"
00:00:35,00:00:39,favorite four facts from the last week and here they are in no particular order.
00:00:39,00:00:48,"Okay, fact number one and that's you Helen. Yes, I discovered that L-O-L, the acronym that"
00:00:48,00:00:51,people now use to signify the fact that they're weak-minded and words are inadequate for their own
00:00:51,00:01:00,need. Used to me not laugh out loud or even lots of love but little old lady which doesn't
00:01:00,00:01:04,come up that much now in the Twitter and text speak but it was a medical definition. They had a whole
00:01:04,00:01:11,list of little old lady related abbreviations like Lollinad which was little old lady in no apparent
00:01:11,00:01:16,distress which you would think why do they need to note the absence of distress or you would just
00:01:16,00:01:21,note the fact that she was distressed and Loll for the group which stood for little old lady fall
00:01:21,00:01:29,"down go boom. It's a very common complaint isn't it? Yeah, you have to be very careful because"
00:01:29,00:01:34,some of them are unstable. Is this the thing like the medical slang that the doctors used to write on
00:01:34,00:01:38,charts? Is that where it comes from? Because there's a story that keeps on servicing about the
00:01:38,00:01:43,three letter acronyms your doctor uses like FLK means funny looking kid. I think they've not
00:01:43,00:01:48,"been used for a very long time. No, they're not my friends use them, they're doctors. Yeah,"
00:01:48,00:01:55,"they're still the news mate, yeah. I found another LOL which was through NASA. NASA when they were sending"
00:01:55,00:01:59,all of their missions they had sort of I guess I don't know if it's right to call them primitive
00:01:59,00:02:05,computer systems but they had a thing called core rope memory which was basically a read-only memory
00:02:05,00:02:12,style computer that they used and it was made in factories by effectively little old ladies
00:02:12,00:02:16,and it's called LOL memory and it means little old lady memory. And yet little
00:02:16,00:02:20,ladies often their memories are really erratic. You know remember childhood but not things that
00:02:20,00:02:25,"happen last week. Yeah, it's literally the worst style of memory you want to send on a mission tomorrow."
00:02:25,00:02:28,My grandmother was always calling me by one of my brother's names because she just couldn't remember.
00:02:28,00:02:35,"Yeah, imagine a pal on her 2001 space odyssey was was LOL. It was a little old lady. What's your name?"
00:02:35,00:02:43,"Do you want a biscuit? I can't do that Brian or Sydney, whatever. Morse code had a list of official"
00:02:43,00:02:49,abbreviations written up in 1878 and it's quite funny because you look through them so it's called
00:02:49,00:02:52,the Phillips code and it's obviously like if you're transmitting Morse code and you want to speed
00:02:52,00:02:57,things up there are a few things that you say a lot so you need to so he assigned them a number rather
00:02:57,00:03:02,than spelling it out. So they're kind of obvious stuff like five is have you got business for me?
00:03:02,00:03:09,"22 is wire test, 23 is all copy, 88 is love and kisses. It's the only one that's like that."
00:03:09,00:03:14,"All the rest of the number 80s. Yeah, yeah. It's a shame it wasn't high out the rankings."
00:03:14,00:03:18,"No, it wasn't. That's the most boring bingo callers in the world."
00:03:18,00:03:26,Five wire tests. Love and kisses. That's great. I also was because this whole idea of finding words
00:03:26,00:03:31,that were used for different meanings previously. I read this blog run by Ann Cosen who's a language
00:03:31,00:03:34,expert and she was talking about how different words and what they were previously used for it.
00:03:34,00:03:41,"So the word guy to mean a guy. Do you know where that comes from? It's not from guy folks, is it?"
00:03:41,00:03:44,"According to her, yes. Really? Yeah, it comes directly from guy folks."
00:03:44,00:03:47,"Oh, it seems too obvious to be true. It does. I think I would have assumed that and then there was"
00:03:47,00:03:53,going to be a twisted weird answer. And then somehow and it was mainly in America that it picked up
00:03:53,00:03:57,that it just became guy but it was off the back of guy folks. According to her. It's weird that
00:03:57,00:04:02,"there's an America it picks up because it is fundamentally British. They have no investment. Yeah,"
00:04:02,00:04:10,"I also suggest that they think all men are merely effigies of humanity. It's true, it's true,"
00:04:10,00:04:14,"but it must have been like the original action man I guess in America, but it was called guy."
00:04:14,00:04:19,"So it was just like, okay, this is a guy, this is a guy. It's just a guy. It's all your action man."
00:04:19,00:04:24,"No, I'm just saying action man is called action man, right? He's not called Mark. It's an action man."
00:04:24,00:04:29,And this was a guy toy. You got your guy toy. What is action man's real name? I don't know if action man
00:04:29,00:04:33,has a name. That is a great question. That is a brilliant question. We're raising more than we're
00:04:33,00:04:40,solving today. Yeah. There is nothing really embarrassing. I just water. Yeah. Wayne. Yeah. Wayne man.
00:04:40,00:04:48,"Man is definitely his last day. Yeah. I've got a real name for action man. Yep. Right, this is in the"
00:04:48,00:04:54,"TV series from 1995, who is a man suffering from amnesia, who is a pointed leader of team extreme"
00:04:54,00:04:59,fighting against the evil doctor X. He later learns his real name is Matthew Exler.
00:04:59,00:05:04,Exler. Yeah. Ex LER. Look at his name. Is this TV series canon in the action man?
00:05:04,00:05:11,"Genre. According to action man Wiki, his name as an action man toy is Matthew Exler as well."
00:05:11,00:05:15,I learned a good thing of things that other things used to be called while we're in this category.
00:05:15,00:05:20,"So sandwich is, I've been researching because obviously they're named after but not"
00:05:20,00:05:25,"invented by the fourth Earl of sandwich. He was only called sandwich because his great-grandfather,"
00:05:25,00:05:30,"the first Earl, was given the chance to choose a town for the peerage to be named after when he"
00:05:30,00:05:34,was given a peerage. And he chose sandwich because it's where his fleet was anchored. He was a
00:05:34,00:05:39,big admiral. And he originally didn't want to choose sandwich. He chose it because his first choice
00:05:39,00:05:43,was Portsmouth and it was already a Lord Portsmouth and he had a bit of an Archibaldi about who
00:05:43,00:05:49,would get to be the Earl of Portsmouth. So we could all be having Egg and Crest Portsmouth today. How cool
00:05:49,00:05:53,is that? That's very cool. Yeah. It works. A Portsmouth. I can imagine saying that. It actually
00:05:53,00:05:58,"is more of a sensible word than sandwich. I mean, she's Portsmouth. Yes, please. Yeah. That worked."
00:05:58,00:06:02,"Yeah. It was more inviting. Yeah, that felt very good. Just jumping on Portsmouth, something that"
00:06:02,00:06:07,should have had a different name as well. Gandalf the Grey wasn't going to be called Gandalf the Grey.
00:06:07,00:06:11,What was it going to be called? Action man. He was going to be called Action Bad Grey. He was going
00:06:11,00:06:19,to be called Bladderthin. Which is not what you should call an old man with a beard. Bladderthin
00:06:19,00:06:28,"is a dead thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, B-L-A-D-O-R-T-H-I-N. That was a name that was eventually given to a"
00:06:28,00:06:33,"dead king who's mentioned just once. I wasn't the rising mention just once, Sladderthin. Yeah,"
00:06:33,00:06:39,readers didn't go for that. Won't bring him back. Yeah. So I enjoy the battle of emoticons
00:06:39,00:06:44,that were the first emoticon appeared. So I think we researched some of this for QI last year.
00:06:44,00:06:48,"This is related to the laws, right? Everyone sees the link. Yep. So there was a smiley face apparently"
00:06:48,00:06:54,"in a transcript of a speech by Lincoln, which is just a semicolon and a closed brackets."
00:06:54,00:07:00,So Winky. Yeah. Yeah. We have won the Battle of Gettysburg. Wink. Wink. Wink. Does that mean he has won or he's not?
00:07:00,00:07:09,I just changed the history books. That might be the most revealing thing a document is ever shown.
00:07:09,00:07:14,"That was history altered. As the equivalent of fingers crossed, I'd be back."
00:07:15,00:07:23,"Or not. Yeah. So I think it's a typo. But now there's one in 1648, which someone has found in a 1648 poem."
00:07:23,00:07:29,It's called To Fortune by Robert Herrick. It has the word smiling yet and then it has a colon
00:07:29,00:07:34,and then a closed brackets and it is in brackets. So it's probably also a typo. But the first
00:07:34,00:07:38,"actual emoticons definitely emoticons were in Puck, weren't they in 1881. We'll put this on the website."
00:07:38,00:07:43,"What's Puck? Puck is a human magazine, a satirical magazine in the 19th century. And so basically it was"
00:07:43,00:07:47,in a joke about how they didn't want to keep paying cartoonists. So there's quite a funny little paragraph
00:07:47,00:07:52,"they say where they say cartoonists are totally overrated. We don't need you as stupid, overpaid,"
00:07:52,00:07:57,"overvalued art. We can create art just with our typewriters and then it gives you a smiley face,"
00:07:57,00:08:03,"a grumpy face, a board face and a surprised face below created with typography. And they're the"
00:08:03,00:08:09,first things. Smiley's Puck. 1881. And yet you would think that back then when it was a lot harder
00:08:09,00:08:14,"to type than it is now because keyboards were quite beefy. And before that, scribes had a lot of"
00:08:14,00:08:19,words. Do you think that emoticons would be more expedient than they are now? Now it's easier than
00:08:19,00:08:25,"ever to type a word. Yeah, yeah, you're right. So you're saying they were justified in 1881. But now,"
00:08:25,00:08:31,"no, get over it. Yes. Biotapistry could have saved a big drawing of Harold, just do a winky face."
00:08:31,00:08:38,"Actually, originally meant, has been shot in eye. Maybe that like an hour in the night is just"
00:08:38,00:08:42,typography for winky face back in those days. That's what he was doing.
00:08:42,00:08:53,"Okay, time for fact number two. And that's my fact. My fact this week is, according to researchers at"
00:08:53,00:08:59,"Glasgow, Caledonian University, listening to Billy Connolly can substantially increase your tolerance"
00:08:59,00:09:04,"to pain. Wow. Is it because after you've listened to Billy Connolly, everything else seems insignificant"
00:09:04,00:09:07,or is it that Billy Connolly really distracts you from the pain and makes feel more positive?
00:09:07,00:09:14,It's a positive thing. It was basically an ice bucket challenge. They put patients fists into
00:09:14,00:09:18,"buckets of ice and they found that when they were listening to Billy Connolly, it actually increased"
00:09:18,00:09:22,the length of time that they could keep their hand inside there. So it distracted them. It distracted
00:09:22,00:09:27,them and made them sort of enjoy having their fist in a bucket of ice. This is directly from an
00:09:27,00:09:33,article that announced the findings of these scientists. It's from April 7th 2003. So boffins have
00:09:33,00:09:42,proved that laughter. So immediately very much a... What are these bloody dweeps find out then?
00:09:42,00:09:49,Nerd burgers have proved that laughter really is the best medicine with some help from Billy Connolly
00:09:49,00:09:54,stand-up routines. A team of scientists discovered that the big Ian's pattern acts as a pain killer.
00:09:54,00:09:59,"Psychologists compared people's pain thresholds while listening to music, comedy, and doing mental arithmetic."
00:09:59,00:10:02,"The Glasgow Caledonian University team claims vintage Connolly,"
00:10:02,00:10:09,incredibly vintage. None of the new stuff. Increased tolerance of pain by up to three times.
00:10:09,00:10:13,I can completely buy this actually. It was a three-year study. The weird thing is that things were
00:10:13,00:10:18,"different for men and women. So for women, the most effective pain relief was not actually from the"
00:10:18,00:10:21,"comedy. It was from hearing their favorite music. Now if you're allowed to choose your own music,"
00:10:21,00:10:26,"that has an also beneficial effect on the kind of... The gateway theory, isn't it, is one theory of"
00:10:26,00:10:31,pain that by blocking the pain from getting through with another stimulus. People could be listening
00:10:31,00:10:35,to this show whilst having minor surgery to take their mind off it. I don't know if our chat about
00:10:35,00:10:43,doctors at the beginning is going to get us into hospitals now. I think it was round 1910 or 1915.
00:10:43,00:10:49,"A woman had a grapefruit-sized tumour removed from her ovaries, had the surgery on her kitchen table."
00:10:49,00:10:53,"And even though Anesthesia existed at that point, she didn't have any, she just sang hymns to"
00:10:53,00:11:01,"stave off the pain. Wow. Did it work? Well, she's dead now! His hymn has gone very high pitched and"
00:11:01,00:11:06,"shrieky. I guess, no, it's definitely in the notes. Yeah, tip for dentists and people carrying out"
00:11:06,00:11:13,"minor surgery, it turned to him 454 in your works. Nearer my god to thee. Oh no, not nearer my god to thee."
00:11:16,00:11:20,There's no evidence that the surgeon's forced Anesthesia upon this woman just to shut her up.
00:11:20,00:11:24,"It'd be super distracting, wouldn't it? And also, it means she wouldn't be still."
00:11:24,00:11:30,"I risk dental surgery, that'd be really irritating, wouldn't it? There are amazing things"
00:11:30,00:11:35,which can increase your tolerance to pain. They've tried smells on people and- More theme.
00:11:35,00:11:42,"They've tried working in a team, so they tested on rowers. They tried rows from the Oxford"
00:11:42,00:11:47,boat race squad and they put them in a team and they had a higher pain threshold when they were
00:11:47,00:11:51,"working together, when they had been trained together than when they were separate. So we're going"
00:11:51,00:11:56,"to perform surgery on you, but if all your friends also agree to have surgery before them at the same time,"
00:11:56,00:12:00,it's going to be better for you. Maybe it just seems rude or to moan when you know that everyone
00:12:00,00:12:05,"else is feeling the same pain as you. Can I tell you about one guy, football match FA Cup Final,"
00:12:05,00:12:11,Manchester City Birmingham in 1956. The goalkeeper from City was called Bert Trautman. He broke his
00:12:11,00:12:18,"neck after diving for the ball and played on. He made a series of crucial saves and his team one,"
00:12:18,00:12:26,"three, one. Wow. A 2006 study found that people with migraines, people who get migraines have 20%"
00:12:26,00:12:33,"more sexual desire. There you go. Again, is it to take their minds off it? It's just not taking"
00:12:33,00:12:42,"your mind off it. Yeah. Yeah. Tonight dear, I've got a headache. Pop on. There was quite a good"
00:12:42,00:12:48,"2008 study at Stanford. It showed traumatic pictures to its study participants. And I just like it,"
00:12:48,00:12:52,because it sounds like a traumatic study to be involved in and found that if you encourage the
00:12:52,00:12:56,"participants to make jokes about the traumatic thing you were watching, then it decreased their"
00:12:56,00:13:01,"negative feelings about it. And if you encourage them to make positive jokes, it really decreased"
00:13:01,00:13:04,"their negative feelings about it. So they were showing pictures of, this is the list,"
00:13:04,00:13:08,ranging from car accidents and corpses to aggressive animals and dental exams. God.
00:13:08,00:13:12,But I'm so impressed that the study participants couldn't make funny jokes. If someone says
00:13:12,00:13:16,"make a positive joke about that picture of a dead person now, I'm quite impressed. They all do it."
00:13:16,00:13:18,The thing is they kind of like mock the weak in that sense.
00:13:18,00:13:29,"Okay, time to move on. Time to go to fact number three and that is Chasinski."
00:13:30,00:13:35,My fact is that the first woman to cycle around the world learned to ride a bike the day before
00:13:35,00:13:39,"she set off. Well, she probably figured she could pick it up on the mission. Yeah, you got it long"
00:13:39,00:13:43,"enough. Yeah, my practice. What I like is that in the 1890s, the records for, around the world"
00:13:43,00:13:47,travel and the records for cycling around the world were both broken by women. It's quite
00:13:47,00:13:50,unexpected. Nelly Blire was a woman who wanted to imitate Phillyus Fog and do around the world
00:13:50,00:13:55,"in 80 days, did it in 72. So who was this woman who cycled around the world? She was called Annie"
00:13:55,00:14:01,Cohen Kopchowski. She was originally Latvian. She was 23 years old at the time. Jewish married mother
00:14:01,00:14:07,of three children lived in Boston and she just decided she was going to do it. So she was such an
00:14:07,00:14:11,amazing character. So she was a real raccoon to her. She told amazing stories. So it's very hard
00:14:11,00:14:15,"to know actually what her story is true and what's not. But she said, you know, I got on a bike"
00:14:15,00:14:20,the day before I had two lessons and set off and she claimed she did this because she'd heard
00:14:20,00:14:25,these two men in a bar make a bet that no woman could travel around the world on a bike. And so she
00:14:25,00:14:30,"decided to challenge them and she was offered a $10,000 reward if she made it which she did. So she got"
00:14:30,00:14:35,"that. Interestingly, when she did it, she wasn't called Annie Cohen Kopchowski. She was called Annie"
00:14:35,00:14:42,London Dairy because she got sponsorship from London Dairy Spring Water. So they paid her $100 to
00:14:42,00:14:46,"change her name and have their branding on the back of her bike. That's hilarious. It's good, isn't it?"
00:14:46,00:14:51,Wow. So it dates back a lot. Yeah. So much further than I had realised. Yeah. When you're cycling
00:14:51,00:14:57,"around the world, what are the rules about crossing water? Could you do the least amount of"
00:14:57,00:15:01,land cycling possible and just take a boat for most of the way? She did. She did do a lot of
00:15:01,00:15:06,"boating. You would have to really, because of oceans. There was, there was a very snarky thing that"
00:15:06,00:15:11,"was said about it when she got back, which was they said she travelled around the world with a bike,"
00:15:11,00:15:15,"not on a bike. That's good. She was the first woman to travel around the world with a bike,"
00:15:15,00:15:21,"barely blinded, not a bike. Still a record, guys. Yeah. And she made up a lot of things about her life,"
00:15:21,00:15:25,didn't she? Yeah. So that she studied medicine for two years. And she was a married mother of three.
00:15:25,00:15:30,And she was sold in the newspaper stories as an unmarried and childless woman. Maybe she just
00:15:30,00:15:37,"wanted to get away from the kids. Have any of you been following the progress of Mr Bullsey,"
00:15:37,00:15:43,"who is a man who in order to raise awareness of testicular cancer, of which he is a survivor"
00:15:43,00:15:49,"and currently in remission, is pushing a giant inflatable testicle across the United States"
00:15:49,00:15:54,"from Los Angeles to New York. It started on the 3rd of September, so he's done a few hundred"
00:15:54,00:15:59,"miles and he's got 4,000 left to go. And he's been through some desert, so he's quite lucky that"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"the testicle hasn't punctured yet. We can shelter in the shade of it, though, to protect"
00:16:03,00:16:08,himself from the heat. How big is it? Six feet diameter. And he's just rolling it along. He's
00:16:08,00:16:13,"rolling it along. And if you meet him along the way, then you can write things on the testicle."
00:16:13,00:16:21,That's great. Mr Bullsey sounds like a good Mr Man as well. Mr Bullsey went for it. He didn't care.
00:16:21,00:16:26,Was he called Bullsey originally or was he sponsored by the Bullsey company? His name is Thomas
00:16:26,00:16:31,"Kankley. But yeah, Andy, you were saying she made up fantastical stories about her life, this woman."
00:16:31,00:16:34,"And it was partly, I think, how she funded her trip, so she'd sell her stories to give lectures"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"along the way and stuff. So a few of the things she claimed was that she spoke several languages,"
00:16:38,00:16:42,"that she'd been to a whole bunch of countries that she definitely didn't go to, that she'd hunted"
00:16:42,00:16:47,tigers with Indian royalty. She was almost killed by what she called aegiatics because they thought
00:16:47,00:16:54,"she was an evil spirit. She fought in the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, where she fell through a frozen river"
00:16:54,00:16:58,and ended up in a Japanese prison with a bullet wound in her shoulder. And then she was attacked by
00:16:58,00:17:03,highway men in Marseys. Wow. She was just a brilliant storyteller. People loved it. Not surprisingly.
00:17:03,00:17:07,"Well, he would, wouldn't he? If no one was there to check, wouldn't you say, yeah, it was fine. Yeah,"
00:17:07,00:17:12,"I stayed in OK hotel. Yeah, you're right. Do you think the men in the bar who were betting that a woman"
00:17:12,00:17:16,could never cycle around the world? Do you think they existed or were they just a fiction to get her to
00:17:16,00:17:20,do this trip? I don't know. You can imagine men betting that? I thought the idea was that they were
00:17:20,00:17:25,"just making those kind of bets and she thought, oh yeah, that's because they call it the age of"
00:17:25,00:17:32,"round the world bets. No one's ever traced them in. She made them up. Yeah. But nonetheless, very cool."
00:17:32,00:17:38,I found that a lady called Julianne Burring was the first lady to cycle actually around the world.
00:17:38,00:17:44,"And the rules started in it was in 2012, which staggers me. I know. Yeah, it's weird, isn't it? You would have"
00:17:44,00:17:47,"thought they'd done it ages ago. Yeah, but when we say actually we mean without taking a boat most of the"
00:17:47,00:17:52,"way, which to be fair, it's what Annie London do, he did. Yeah, yeah. So there are official rules about it."
00:17:52,00:17:57,I think these must be Guinness World Record rules. You have to cycle the same distance as the circumference
00:17:57,00:18:02,"of the earth, which is 24,900 miles. You have to go in one direction and start and finish in the same"
00:18:02,00:18:08,"place. So you are allowed to go by sea and air, but do you have to cycle at least 18,000 miles of the"
00:18:08,00:18:13,"route? So that's the rules. And she actually, Miss Burring, she had only been riding a road bike"
00:18:13,00:18:17,"properly for eight months, which is not quite the same as, you know, learning the day before, but still,"
00:18:17,00:18:23,"it's not much training. Yeah, she's not pro, is she? Wow. Yeah, I thought 2012 was late. When women"
00:18:23,00:18:27,"started cycling, obviously it was very controversial in the 19th century because it was thought of as"
00:18:27,00:18:32,inappropriate thing for women to be doing. And New York newspaper released a list of rules for women
00:18:32,00:18:38,"cycling, a list of advice, which included things like don't try to ride in your brother's clothes"
00:18:38,00:18:45,"just to see how it feels. Don't scream if you meet a cow. If she sees you first, she will run."
00:18:45,00:18:51,And don't use bicycle slang. Leave that to the boys. Bicycle slang. Bicycle slang. It was a very
00:18:51,00:18:55,"body subject language. Yeah, it was. What about things like how not to flush their bloomers and"
00:18:55,00:19:00,"well, they weren't supposed to wear bloomers at first, but then they started because they were"
00:19:00,00:19:05,"much more sensible, a tighter than I think people wanted to keep women wearing proper clothing rather"
00:19:05,00:19:11,"than changing for cycling. So they sold special, likely-boned corsets for ladies like those of"
00:19:11,00:19:17,"the American lady corset company, which offered $100 of free bicycle insurance with every biking"
00:19:17,00:19:22,"corset sold. Oh, so it came with the bike insurance was a massive thing. You used to get insurance"
00:19:22,00:19:26,"if you rode the daily mail. You would have insurance against railway accidents. If you could prove it,"
00:19:26,00:19:31,"you had a copy of the coupon from the paper on you when you were maimed in a railway accident,"
00:19:31,00:19:36,"then you would be given £100 of insurance. Wow. The handy thing to have around. Yeah, I love the"
00:19:36,00:19:40,"original title of the bicycle because it wasn't originally called bicycle. I mean, there was a more"
00:19:40,00:19:48,"primitive version of a bicycle. Yeah, called the Velocipede. Yeah. Isn't that great? Velocipede. Velocipede."
00:19:48,00:19:52,"Yeah, it sounds so much speedier and cooler. Yeah. I thought I thought you would say they didn't want"
00:19:52,00:19:57,women's cycles. It was dangerously liberating. What was that? You can move around more. You can move
00:19:57,00:20:01,"to the next village and find maybe another man, not the man that, you know, you're Uncle wanted to"
00:20:01,00:20:08,"marry. The thing that I love about any London dairy is she just, it's of that period. I mean, I think"
00:20:08,00:20:11,"we still have people like that living today. But when you read stories about them, it's like, I'm"
00:20:11,00:20:15,"going to cycle the world. Oh, I don't know how to cycle kind of things. It's just these brilliant"
00:20:15,00:20:21,"eccentric who just went off and did these huge, yeah, endurance feats like Mary Kingsley. I look"
00:20:21,00:20:26,"at her and just go, what an extraordinary person. She just went off and did it in a time where she"
00:20:26,00:20:31,"was told you shouldn't be doing that. She was an explorer. Well, yeah, she was an explorer. She,"
00:20:31,00:20:37,"yeah, she went to West Africa. She used to do this thing. Whenever she would rock up to a tribe"
00:20:37,00:20:41,"that would just, you know, not necessarily had any contact. And she was told, in majority of these"
00:20:41,00:20:46,"places, they will just kill you on sight. And her thing was she just didn't care. She just used to"
00:20:46,00:20:53,"run into the villages and just yell, don't worry, it's only me. And she actually survived the war."
00:20:53,00:21:00,"It's amazing. On round the world stuff, another random connection, the first ship to travel around"
00:21:00,00:21:05,"the world twice was called HMS Dolphin. It was in the 1760s, but it was captain by Lord Byron's"
00:21:05,00:21:11,grandfather. And he was the same guy who named and claimed the folkland islands. So when he was on
00:21:11,00:21:15,"HMS Dolphin, he bumped into the folkland and went, can I call these folklands and King George,"
00:21:15,00:21:20,they yours. He was very accident prone. He was called Fowl Weather Jack. That was his nickname.
00:21:20,00:21:25,"Whenever he went, he had an amazing, unerring knack of sailing into massive storms and hurricanes"
00:21:25,00:21:29,and tempests. Oh god. Really? Yeah. So you can imagine the crews delight when they saw him walking
00:21:29,00:21:41,up the gang bank. Oh great. Hey guys. It's going to be funny. Have you all brought your umbrellas?
00:21:41,00:21:48,"Okay, time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy Murray. Okay, my fact is when squirrels"
00:21:48,00:21:52,"are attacked by snakes, they increase their blood pressure so much that the tail gives off more"
00:21:52,00:21:58,infrared radiation and it makes them look bigger. That is really cool. Just the tail or the rest of
00:21:58,00:22:03,"the squirrel as well. Just the tail really. Yeah, I should specify this is with Californian ground squirrels"
00:22:03,00:22:08,and it's when they're doing with rattlesnakes. Now rattlesnakes can see an infrared and so when
00:22:08,00:22:12,"they are confronted, they heat up their tail deliberately, they increase the temperature and then"
00:22:12,00:22:18,"they wave it in the snake's face. To these snakes infrared sensing organs, it looks as though there's"
00:22:18,00:22:24,"a much larger creature there and when they see other snakes, they don't do it. They do wave their tail"
00:22:24,00:22:28,"around but they know that the rattlesnake can see an infrared. Yeah, they know the rattlesnake can see"
00:22:28,00:22:33,infrared even though the squirrel can't see an infrared. It knows the rattlesnake can and when it's
00:22:33,00:22:37,"when it meets a gopher snake which can't see an infrared, it doesn't do it. I mean, it doesn't know"
00:22:37,00:22:42,it can see an infrared. It's evolved to learn that the rattlesnake doesn't like it. Maybe it's just a
00:22:42,00:22:48,"coincidence, happy coincidence. But as Helen says, it's not, it doesn't see a huge animal, it sees a"
00:22:48,00:22:53,small squirrel with a gigantic tail. Yeah. Is that what was happening. And they're scared of
00:22:53,00:22:56,tails? They can't do that. They're afraid of tails. They're afraid of tails. They've got their own
00:22:56,00:23:02,lethal tails. Yeah. There's a there's a type of squirrel where it's genitals of 40% the length of
00:23:02,00:23:09,"its body. So I wonder whether rattlesnakes are, I'm not bothered. And that squirrel can autopolate."
00:23:09,00:23:15,"Yeah, it gives it self-polation. Oh goodness. Yeah. Yeah. That is a good claim again. I saw a photo of it"
00:23:15,00:23:20,"and its testicles are 20% the length of its body and it's just outrageous. If you see them in infrared,"
00:23:20,00:23:25,they're twice as big as that. Yeah. These are South African ground squirrels.
00:23:25,00:23:28,"Someone worked out that if, if they were humans, they'd have a 35-centimeter scrotum."
00:23:28,00:23:33,"It's inconvenient, isn't it? Yeah. On a bicycle, especially."
00:23:33,00:23:39,"Apparently in 2007 in Iran, they arrested 14 squirrels on suspicion of espionage."
00:23:39,00:23:44,That's wonderful. So what were the squirrels doing in Iran?
00:23:44,00:23:50,"Well, they thought that they'd been all kitted up by the enemy to go in and do squirrel espionage."
00:23:50,00:23:54,Were they kitted up? What? With magnifying glasses. It's a tool that squirrels see.
00:23:54,00:23:56,They've got a collection of cars. They've got rashes.
00:23:56,00:24:00,"Because if I got a squirrel like carrying in a nigma machine or something, I would actually be"
00:24:00,00:24:05,suspicious that something was going on. Yeah. Someone is going to a lot of effort for a YouTube
00:24:05,00:24:09,"viral certainly. Yeah. A lot of defense mechanisms are extraordinary though, aren't they?"
00:24:09,00:24:13,"Because some of them were obvious, like making yourself look big. But others, them like,"
00:24:13,00:24:19,"there's a, there's a, the horned lizards in Texas can shoot blood after five feet out of its eyes."
00:24:20,00:24:24,But then it's lost a third of its blood. So it's not exactly 15-50 feet.
00:24:24,00:24:28,"Has to go up and collect all the blood. Yeah, but you wouldn't, you wouldn't have, if I was,"
00:24:28,00:24:32,"you know, picking my own fish in a restaurant tank and one shot blood out of its eyes,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"probably bigger different fish. Yeah, um."
00:24:35,00:24:39,Baroness CQ come as well. They shoot their internal organs out of their anuses.
00:24:39,00:24:42,"You think, well, that's really going to scare an enemy, isn't it? Oh, look. I've had a prolapse."
00:24:42,00:24:47,"They shoot their intestines. I mean, that's intestines. They just, like, that's a pretty"
00:24:48,00:24:53,severe bullet to get to the face. It is a very bold. How'd you get them back in? Is it like on a spring?
00:24:53,00:24:58,"They just grow new ones. Yeah, I really take ages. So I'll see CQ come as well. Cool."
00:24:58,00:25:03,"There are squirrels which can do other things as well. So one of California ground squirrels,"
00:25:03,00:25:09,they chew on old skins from rattlesnakes and then they lick themselves and their pups.
00:25:09,00:25:15,And this makes them smell half like a squirrel and half like a snake. And it means that the snakes
00:25:15,00:25:19,"leave them alone and they've tested on snakes. They've given them stuff that smells like squirrels,"
00:25:19,00:25:24,"like snakes, and then this half and half mix. And they only go for the stuff which smells"
00:25:24,00:25:28,exclusively like a squirrel. So that's how they protect themselves. Other ones have ultrasound.
00:25:28,00:25:32,Squirrels are incredible. What's the thing you were telling me about eagles the other day with squirrels?
00:25:32,00:25:35,"Yeah, they, oh, if they're being hunted by a bird of prey, they will go round and round a tree"
00:25:35,00:25:39,"very first to disorient the bird, which will sort of just start sparring and then crash into the"
00:25:39,00:25:43,branches of the tree and be embarrassed. I'll have to leave because of its embarrassment.
00:25:43,00:25:46,"And they're just, they're amazing. Yeah. That sounds like something out of a cartoon."
00:25:46,00:25:51,"It does, isn't it? Sure. Squirrels versus rattlesnakes does seem like a classic cartoon setup."
00:25:51,00:25:55,"Oh, they've got to do that. In the like alien versus predator series and their whole series of"
00:25:55,00:25:59,"films, they've got to do squirrels versus rattlesnakes. Yeah, and it wouldn't be much worse than the"
00:25:59,00:26:05,most recent alien versus predator films. So is it definitely that it's not an intimidation thing
00:26:05,00:26:08,to the rattlesnake? It's that they think it's bigger because I already think where it said that
00:26:08,00:26:12,"what it in fact does, it says to the rattlesnake that I know that you're there."
00:26:13,00:26:16,"Rather than being a sort of like, whoa, that's a big squirrel, better not"
00:26:16,00:26:20,mess with that one. I don't know if they know exactly what effect they think they're having
00:26:20,00:26:24,on the rattlesnake. And I'll ask whether it's the attack or defense or anything like that.
00:26:24,00:26:27,"But yeah, it seems to have the desired effect. Yeah, okay, yeah."
00:26:27,00:26:30,"It would just probably shock them in the same way that cats do it. I mean,"
00:26:30,00:26:33,"lots of animals do it, don't they? That's why we get goose bumps. Well, they think that."
00:26:33,00:26:36,"What should we look bigger? Yeah, so it's not the most functional defense thing."
00:26:36,00:26:39,"It's all the hair, right? It's a hangover from when we were covered in hair."
00:26:39,00:26:44,"Okay. People think all the hairs rise up. Yeah, and therefore you look slightly bigger"
00:26:44,00:26:46,"and more intense. Very so. I mean, I agree. It's a shit defense mechanism."
00:26:46,00:26:51,"What you look like, you've just been blow-dried. Yeah, and that's scary."
00:26:51,00:26:54,"Yeah, that is scary. He looks after himself, but he knows it's a fight."
00:26:54,00:26:58,"Yeah, that's true. Speaking of things that shoot out of the eyeballs,"
00:26:58,00:27:02,so the toady we're just talking about. Do you guys know about the Mongolian deathworm?
00:27:02,00:27:06,No. Okay. So no one's technically seen a Mongolian deathworm.
00:27:06,00:27:11,"Okay, the made up deathworm. Yeah, it's a cryptid. It's a lie. It's a lie. It's a cryptid."
00:27:11,00:27:13,"There are people in Mongolia who claim to have seen it. It's definitely a cryptid,"
00:27:13,00:27:17,"but what I like about it is its defense mechanism is that it can shoot acid from its eyes,"
00:27:17,00:27:23,and lightning bolts from its ass. What? Yeah. Yeah. This made up creature can shoot lightning
00:27:23,00:27:28,"off it. Sorry, who came up with this? It's a Mongolian fiction. Fiction."
00:27:28,00:27:35,"All right. Yeah, that is incredible. We should be able to utilize that in science somehow."
00:27:35,00:27:39,"Lightning bolts from the ice. Lightning from an anus. It's like Dan's crypto corner,"
00:27:39,00:27:43,"isn't it? Every week. And if you spot where it is, you let us know and you'll win a book."
00:27:43,00:27:47,It's a particular kind of amp that can shoot a nuclear holocaust.
00:27:47,00:27:54,"There is a termite though that explodes if you're eating it. So if it gets eaten by its prey,"
00:27:54,00:27:59,"it kind of suicide bombs itself, and it takes out the prey that's eating it."
00:27:59,00:28:06,"Now we are and see through fiction, we found our way back to facts. Can I tell you one more"
00:28:06,00:28:10,thing about squirrels? Yeah. Okay. So there are there are Arctic ground squirrels and they
00:28:10,00:28:15,"hibernate for eight months of the year, but when they're hibernating, their body temperature drops"
00:28:15,00:28:21,"to minus three degrees Celsius, which is the lowest body temperature any mammal has ever been recorded"
00:28:21,00:28:26,"as having as in right in the middle its core is minus three. How do they do that? Well, some fish do"
00:28:26,00:28:32,"the same thing. It's called being super cool and they live in sub zero temperatures, but they know"
00:28:32,00:28:36,"how the fish do it because they have a kind of antifreeze in their blood, but the squirrels don't"
00:28:36,00:28:42,"don't have that. So they have no idea how they do it. Also on squirrels, they plant more trees than"
00:28:42,00:28:49,"humans do because 74% of the nuts they bury, they forget where they put them. Wow. Idiots. Idiots."
00:28:51,00:28:59,"It was the two busy auto-forlating. Goose bumps, which we were talking about, gray books."
00:28:59,00:29:03,Oh yeah. Are all fine. Excellent. Be tweeted me once. That was the most exciting moment.
00:29:03,00:29:06,"Well, I tweeted him forosey to the night. Did he just tweet you saying, ""Wooo!"""
00:29:06,00:29:12,Sorry Emma. Sorry. Is it a way of bumpy texture?
00:29:12,00:29:20,"But goose bumps are called hen bumps in French and Spanish, chicken bumps in Dutch and Chinese"
00:29:20,00:29:26,and duck bumps in Hebrew. But there's a real poultry theme. There's definitely a poultry theme.
00:29:26,00:29:29,Everyone's got the same idea and they've just gone slightly different ways with it.
00:29:29,00:29:33,"I think when you call Turkey, it has something to do with that as well. When people are coming off"
00:29:33,00:29:36,"drugs, they get massive goose bumps and people are like, ""Well, that's like when you've got a turkey"
00:29:36,00:29:41,"that you've plucked."" Oh really? Okay. Turkey's which have been plucked do look like that."
00:29:41,00:29:44,Like like heroin addicts.
00:29:48,00:29:54,Pete docketies. Look. Put Pete in the oven for four four hours.
00:29:54,00:30:04,"Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts. Thanks so much everyone for listening to this show."
