00:00:10,00:00:18,">> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:18,00:00:23,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Richmond.
00:00:23,00:00:25,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:25,00:00:27,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:33,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:33,00:00:36,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four"
00:00:36,00:00:38,favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:38,00:00:42,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Starting with fact number one, that is Andy."
00:00:45,00:00:50,My fact is that spiny anteaters only use half their penis during sex.
00:00:50,00:00:52,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:52,00:00:53,>> Which half?
00:00:53,00:00:55,">> The top half, yeah, yeah."
00:00:55,00:00:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:00:59,00:01:02,">> The left or the right half, believe it or not."
00:01:02,00:01:06,"The spiny anteater, so this is an animal, better known as a echidna."
00:01:06,00:01:09,"And they're Australian, they're very cute little creatures."
00:01:09,00:01:11,They look sort of like- >> Like a hedgehog.
00:01:11,00:01:12,">> Weird hedgehogs basically, yeah."
00:01:12,00:01:17,"Imagine a hedgehog, not that, but not far off."
00:01:17,00:01:22,"And they have these penises which are foreheaded, which have really, really-"
00:01:22,00:01:24,>> As if they're like a forehead.
00:01:24,00:01:27,">> So, well, yeah, they've got four heads on their penises."
00:01:27,00:01:29,"It's really, they are dickheads."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"No, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're lovely."
00:01:32,00:01:36,"So, yeah, they've got four sort of ends of the penis, but"
00:01:36,00:01:38,they only use two at any one time.
00:01:38,00:01:42,"It's really, it's a really, really bizarre animal, and it's either the left or"
00:01:42,00:01:43,"the right, and they switch."
00:01:43,00:01:48,"So, only two ends get an erection at any one time."
00:01:48,00:01:49,>> Really?
00:01:49,00:01:52,">> And do we know, it seems weird to have one side of something getting an erection"
00:01:52,00:01:53,without taking the other side with it.
00:01:53,00:01:56,>> It's very hard to imagine how you wouldn't be dragged along.
00:01:56,00:01:59,">> Yeah, right, yeah, yeah."
00:01:59,00:02:02,">> I mean, if the right-hand side of your penis is erect,"
00:02:02,00:02:05,"you, it's, I can't imagine where else the left side is gonna be."
00:02:05,00:02:08,">> It's gonna look like your penis has had a stroke, isn't it, basically?"
00:02:08,00:02:09,">> Yeah, yeah."
00:02:09,00:02:13,">> And it probably has an erection, yeah, yeah, there we go."
00:02:13,00:02:18,"Anyway, look, to steer us gently towards safe territory, they found this out in 2007."
00:02:18,00:02:22,"And it was really hard to see a kid in his breeding, because they, in captivity,"
00:02:22,00:02:24,"they don't really, they don't breed much."
00:02:24,00:02:29,And some scientists in Queensland led by a guy called Steve Johnston.
00:02:29,00:02:32,"They inherited a male echidna, which had lived in a zoo, but"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"it had been retired from the zoo, because it kept getting erections at public"
00:02:36,00:02:37,viewing sessions.
00:02:37,00:02:42,">> That's the word, retired, being used very euphemistically, isn't it?"
00:02:42,00:02:47,If you get retired from your job because you keep getting inappropriate erections.
00:02:47,00:02:50,">> Yeah, he was just promoted to somewhere completely different when no"
00:02:50,00:02:53,"members of the public would see him, he was moved back off his stuff."
00:02:53,00:02:54,">> Wow, that's great."
00:02:54,00:02:56,">> And the Me4 movement with the kidneys, right?"
00:02:56,00:02:59,>> [LAUGH]
00:02:59,00:03:00,>> Wow.
00:03:00,00:03:03,>> [LAUGH]
00:03:03,00:03:04,>> Yeah.
00:03:04,00:03:07,">> They were very readily, well, this particular echidna seemed very ready to"
00:03:07,00:03:09,"have an erection, didn't it?"
00:03:09,00:03:11,"It was kind of a gift from God, no one had ever seen the mate."
00:03:11,00:03:14,"And then suddenly the zookeeper said they had a captive echidna which,"
00:03:14,00:03:17,"on handling, readily produced an erection."
00:03:17,00:03:19,And they were able to condition the echidna to have an erection to
00:03:19,00:03:23,the point where it would ejaculate whenever they wanted to.
00:03:23,00:03:24,>> Whenever they wanted to.
00:03:24,00:03:26,">> Whenever they fancied it, which is useful,"
00:03:26,00:03:29,"because you also want to know about its sperm, what's in its sperm."
00:03:29,00:03:32,And so all they had to do was sort of push its abdomen.
00:03:32,00:03:33,>> How interesting.
00:03:33,00:03:34,>> It went for it.
00:03:34,00:03:38,>> One thing we know about the sperm is that they're all very cooperative.
00:03:38,00:03:41,You always think of sperm like as a swimming race where they're all fighting
00:03:41,00:03:43,against each other.
00:03:43,00:03:47,"But in this case, you get about 100 sperms at once, all kind of gather together in"
00:03:47,00:03:50,a little sphere and kind of swim.
00:03:50,00:03:52,And apparently they can swim faster because of that.
00:03:52,00:03:53,>> So that's amazing.
00:03:53,00:03:54,">> After you, no, I insist."
00:03:54,00:03:56,"After you, no, please."
00:03:56,00:03:58,>> It's like a peloton.
00:03:58,00:03:59,">> Exactly, exactly."
00:03:59,00:04:03,">> Or like in triathlon, all the swimmers often swim next to each other."
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Because you get, yeah, yeah."
00:04:04,00:04:06,>> Do they swim in the shape of a giant sperm?
00:04:06,00:04:08,"As in, is that a more efficient shape to swim in?"
00:04:08,00:04:09,That'd be cool.
00:04:09,00:04:10,>> Would that be cool?
00:04:10,00:04:11,>> Yeah. >> Spear-like.
00:04:11,00:04:12,">> Oh, sphere, sorry, okay, okay."
00:04:12,00:04:16,">> But I think unlike a peloton, their heads are actually cemented together"
00:04:16,00:04:18,"when they swim, which I don't think is how cycling works."
00:04:18,00:04:19,Although I have not really watched cycling.
00:04:19,00:04:20,>> [LAUGH]
00:04:20,00:04:22,">> But there's a special kind of cementing material,"
00:04:22,00:04:24,which literally joins all their heads together.
00:04:24,00:04:27,And they wag their tails as they swim along.
00:04:27,00:04:30,"And yeah, they think it might be for speed, but it seems like they're not really"
00:04:30,00:04:33,"sure, it's just speculation as to why on earth they're bundling up like this."
00:04:33,00:04:35,Could be that thing where I think penguins do it.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"Where the person in the middle has the greatest advantage,"
00:04:38,00:04:40,because they're not gonna get buffeted around by the outside.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"So you just, if you go as a group, then the guy in the middle will survive."
00:04:44,00:04:48,>> It's amazing the whole sex life of the echidna seems to be shrouded in theory and
00:04:48,00:04:49,mystery.
00:04:49,00:04:52,"Like we don't know, there are so many things we don't know."
00:04:52,00:04:53,"Like you just said, why did they do that?"
00:04:53,00:04:59,Why are they using two penises rather than the four available ones at the time?
00:04:59,00:05:03,"Also, they do this weird thing where when they're courting a female,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"they form what's kind of, it's called the love train."
00:05:05,00:05:06,>> [LAUGH]
00:05:06,00:05:12,">> It's basically a conga line of echidnas that just follow in a line,"
00:05:12,00:05:17,"the female for up to a month, and they're just behind her wherever she goes."
00:05:17,00:05:19,They're just snaking around with her.
00:05:19,00:05:20,>> That's a long conga.
00:05:20,00:05:23,">> It is a long conga, and at the end of the month,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"a decision is made, which we don't know what the decision is."
00:05:26,00:05:29,"Like with those theories, is it the dominant male?"
00:05:29,00:05:32,"Because they've noticed that kind of like a Russian doll, the biggest is at the top,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,and they get smaller and smaller and smaller as they go along.
00:05:34,00:05:36,"So the smallest is at the back, but we don't."
00:05:36,00:05:38,>> They sometimes have a little fight at the end.
00:05:38,00:05:41,"We have seen that, whether that always happens, we're not sure."
00:05:41,00:05:45,"But then also sometimes if there's two congas, two rival congas going along,"
00:05:45,00:05:48,you might be doing your conga along.
00:05:48,00:05:52,"But then if you go near to the other congas, sometimes you might swap to the other one."
00:05:52,00:05:53,">> Oh, really?"
00:05:53,00:05:56,">> If you fancy the head of the other conga a bit more, you might go over there."
00:05:56,00:06:00,">> Wow, does that ever happen in real conga, that there's a rival line?"
00:06:00,00:06:03,"And you're like, I'm gonna take everyone behind me into that line."
00:06:03,00:06:06,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, what will happen is there's a conga going along, and"
00:06:06,00:06:09,then one person will go a bit too fast and someone's not paying attention.
00:06:09,00:06:11,And then suddenly that person who wasn't paying attention serves
00:06:11,00:06:13,"them right, they're the head of the conga now, and"
00:06:13,00:06:15,they have all the responsibility that entails.
00:06:15,00:06:16,>> That's so funny.
00:06:16,00:06:20,>> It would be so cool if you could hear the echidnas doing their conga line in
00:06:20,00:06:21,Australia.
00:06:21,00:06:25,I'd appreciate that on the outback if you just heard a little [MUSIC]
00:06:25,00:06:26,"They're coming, the echidnas are coming."
00:06:26,00:06:27,>> It does sound terrifying.
00:06:27,00:06:30,"So one of the, you mentioned this fight, James, that they have."
00:06:30,00:06:34,"One possible, or one way it sometimes goes, is that when the female finally says"
00:06:34,00:06:39,"right, I am ready to mate, the males dig a trench and then compete by pushing"
00:06:39,00:06:43,"each other out of the trench, and the last remaining echidna in the trench is"
00:06:43,00:06:44,the one who gets to mate with the female.
00:06:44,00:06:45,">> Yeah, incredible."
00:06:45,00:06:49,">> Is it like a moat around the female, or is it just a singular trench?"
00:06:49,00:06:51,>> I don't know how developed they are.
00:06:51,00:06:53,">> I think it's a- >> They invented the conga,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,but have they invented the moat?
00:06:54,00:06:56,Which is more sophisticated?
00:06:56,00:06:57,>> They're like a little horseshoe.
00:06:57,00:06:59,">> Okay, right. >> That go all the way around, yeah, yeah."
00:06:59,00:07:00,>> Wow. >> Are they?
00:07:00,00:07:02,I thought it was kind of like your own sleeping bag.
00:07:02,00:07:06,"You divot yourself into the ground, cuz they mate side by side, don't they?"
00:07:06,00:07:12,"Well, they sort of make, she mates face down, which sounds fine each to their own."
00:07:12,00:07:18,"But every time, she's face down, and he's on his side, but either side, apparently."
00:07:18,00:07:22,"So if he doesn't like the look of her, he can turn his back and"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"mate sort of from, like, bent himself around to get to her."
00:07:27,00:07:29,"But so that would be very insulting if you're, so if you're the female,"
00:07:29,00:07:34,"you're lying down, and you can check if the male is facing you, I guess you're in."
00:07:34,00:07:37,"And if he's not, I think that's insulting, isn't that insulting?"
00:07:37,00:07:42,">> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it seems like it."
00:07:42,00:07:45,">> They sometimes, after they've mated, they'll hibernate the females,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,straight after they've mated.
00:07:47,00:07:52,"And in the hibernation part, their whole body kind of stops kind of doing stuff."
00:07:52,00:07:55,So it means that the pregnancy won't really start properly for
00:07:55,00:07:57,a little while until they wake up.
00:07:57,00:08:01,And this is because what they might want to do is if they've mated with someone
00:08:01,00:08:06,"that isn't quite the best echidna in the area, they can hibernate and"
00:08:06,00:08:08,hope that someone else comes along while they're asleep.
00:08:08,00:08:14,A bit like Snow White waiting for the Prince Charming to come and wake her up.
00:08:14,00:08:15,>> I don't recall.
00:08:15,00:08:16,>> It's that bit.
00:08:16,00:08:19,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:19,00:08:21,">> She's asleep and she just kind of half awake, she hears."
00:08:21,00:08:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:25,00:08:28,">> The dwarves all behind him, kicking their legs up."
00:08:28,00:08:31,>> There's only one other mammal that we know that does this that hibernates
00:08:31,00:08:35,"after straight after sex, the female, and it is the Hori bat."
00:08:35,00:08:36,>> How dare you.
00:08:36,00:08:38,>> [LAUGH]
00:08:38,00:08:39,>> That's so funny.
00:08:39,00:08:42,They're remarkable for a number of reasons.
00:08:42,00:08:47,"They're a mammal that lays eggs, which is, it's very Australian."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"There's, you know, we've got- >> Very Australian?"
00:08:49,00:08:51,">> Well, yeah, the platypus, and then that's it."
00:08:51,00:08:52,>> It's just those.
00:08:52,00:08:54,">> Yeah, you know."
00:08:54,00:08:56,>> But they are both only found mostly in Australia.
00:08:56,00:08:57,>> Mostly in Australia.
00:08:57,00:08:59,">> Well, can I just interject there?"
00:08:59,00:09:01,Because I think Australia gets a lot of credit for the echidna.
00:09:01,00:09:03,>> Uh-huh. >> And there are four species of echidna.
00:09:03,00:09:05,And one of them is in Australia.
00:09:05,00:09:07,>> Yeah. >> And all the other three are in Papua New Guinea.
00:09:07,00:09:09,>> Okay. >> And I just don't think the Papua New
00:09:09,00:09:11,Guinea is getting as much air time.
00:09:11,00:09:13,"And actually, they're way cooler echidna."
00:09:13,00:09:16,"And I've seen the Australian one, I love it."
00:09:16,00:09:19,I've stalked an echidna up on Australian Hill for a long period of time.
00:09:19,00:09:20,>> For a month.
00:09:20,00:09:25,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:25,00:09:26,>> Where's Anagon?
00:09:26,00:09:29,"Just, shh, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da."
00:09:29,00:09:31,">> She's up over there, let's move on."
00:09:31,00:09:35,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:09:35,00:09:42,"My fact this week is that in the 1960s, a 47-year-old man paid a 90-year-old woman"
00:09:42,00:09:48,"2,500 francs a month so that he could own her apartment when she passed away."
00:09:48,00:09:52,"Unfortunately for him, she outlived him by not dying and"
00:09:52,00:09:55,making it to be 122 years old.
00:09:55,00:09:58,>> [LAUGH]
00:09:58,00:09:59,>> Imagine it.
00:09:59,00:10:06,So this is actually quite a famous old person who has set the record for
00:10:06,00:10:07,the oldest person ever.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"Her name was Jean Calment, and she was a French person."
00:10:11,00:10:12,You might have heard of her.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"And this was a deal, and this is a thing that does happen in France."
00:10:14,00:10:19,"When someone's getting a bit old, someone says, I'll pay you a certain amount."
00:10:19,00:10:22,It might be the mortgage amount or the rent amount or whatever it is.
00:10:22,00:10:24,"And in this case, it was 2,500."
00:10:24,00:10:27,And it was a guy called Andre Francois Rafferty.
00:10:27,00:10:31,"And he paid the money, and he kept paying and kept paying."
00:10:31,00:10:34,And she kept not dying and not dying.
00:10:34,00:10:36,"And then he dies, she still lives."
00:10:36,00:10:39,"But because of the French law of what they were doing,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,the widow and family then have to continue paying her.
00:10:41,00:10:43,>> [LAUGH]
00:10:43,00:10:45,">> Yeah, the ages are incredible."
00:10:45,00:10:48,"It was only a few more years, wasn't it, after he died?"
00:10:48,00:10:53,"Because in theory, if she was still alive in her 170, 180,"
00:10:53,00:10:55,his kids would have to have paid her as well.
00:10:55,00:10:56,>> Exactly.
00:10:56,00:11:01,"But by the time he died, he had paid twice the apartment's market value."
00:11:01,00:11:03,Like that's how much he had paid.
00:11:03,00:11:03,>> That's incredible.
00:11:03,00:11:07,">> He was 47 when he arranged this, and she was 90."
00:11:07,00:11:09,"So he would have had really good odds, he thought."
00:11:09,00:11:13,"But then he died at age 77, and she was still going."
00:11:13,00:11:14,She was 120 at that point.
00:11:14,00:11:14,>> That's just amazing.
00:11:14,00:11:17,>> They're called Vigets in France.
00:11:17,00:11:20,"These are really interesting, kind of a mechanism of releasing."
00:11:20,00:11:23,"You get a lump sum, you get about a third of the cost of your home in cash."
00:11:23,00:11:25,And then you get these monthly payments.
00:11:25,00:11:29,"But the ads for these arrangements, they come with details of the age of"
00:11:29,00:11:32,"the person selling, so you can kind of assess it."
00:11:32,00:11:35,And there was a piece about it in The Economist which said some elderly
00:11:35,00:11:37,French widows looking to sell their home via this method.
00:11:37,00:11:41,They've been known to light cigarettes before reviewing to imply that they
00:11:41,00:11:42,have a very unhealthy lifestyle.
00:11:42,00:11:45,>> And they can't be long for this world.
00:11:45,00:11:50,">> That's amazing, a little bit of a sniffle, that's so cool."
00:11:50,00:11:55,"Yeah, she had come on, was the oldest ever movie star."
00:11:55,00:11:59,"She was in a movie called Vincent and Me, that way she was 114."
00:11:59,00:12:02,">> Star's a strong word, isn't it, for what she did in that film?"
00:12:02,00:12:03,>> I suppose so.
00:12:03,00:12:05,>> Would you say she was the lead role in Vincent and Me?
00:12:05,00:12:06,>> It was named after her.
00:12:06,00:12:07,>> Okay. >> Okay.
00:12:07,00:12:12,">> You know, Vincent and Me, I went the time she supposedly met Vincent Van Gogh."
00:12:12,00:12:15,"And she appeared in a sort of, as a self in a later scene, right?"
00:12:15,00:12:16,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:12:16,00:12:20,"And quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song."
00:12:20,00:12:21,>> Ah!
00:12:21,00:12:24,">> And again, she wasn't really in it much."
00:12:24,00:12:27,"You just hear her going, je m'appelle, je m'commande."
00:12:27,00:12:29,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:29,00:12:32,">> And then another rapper just going, you're gonna hear an old lady talk."
00:12:32,00:12:33,>> [LAUGH]
00:12:33,00:12:33,>> Really?
00:12:33,00:12:36,">> But it's, no, I was gonna say it's quite good."
00:12:36,00:12:38,"It's not quite good, it's quite bad."
00:12:38,00:12:41,But you can listen to it online if you'd like.
00:12:41,00:12:44,">> And you did genuinely claim an association with Van Gogh, didn't she?"
00:12:44,00:12:45,Which is quite weird.
00:12:45,00:12:49,"It's a bit like, you know, when you're watching Doctor Who or something, and"
00:12:49,00:12:52,"wherever he travels in time, he always happens to land in the drawing room of"
00:12:52,00:12:54,the most famous person you've heard of at that time.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"There's Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare, or Jesus."
00:12:57,00:12:58,">> Sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there."
00:12:58,00:13:02,"The tortoise brings him to lands that are in need, and"
00:13:02,00:13:06,often the most pivotal humans of their era are the people who were central to a
00:13:06,00:13:08,moment where a time fracture is happening.
00:13:08,00:13:10,>> He's never just helping that.
00:13:10,00:13:13,>> He's never just helping thousands of peasants slowly improve their economic
00:13:13,00:13:13,"conditions, is he?"
00:13:13,00:13:15,">> No, no, no, no."
00:13:15,00:13:19,">> So much like Doctor Who, Jean Calmore said that she knew"
00:13:19,00:13:21,Vincent Van Gogh in the 1880s.
00:13:21,00:13:26,"It was 1888, and he came into her family's dry goods store."
00:13:26,00:13:28,I don't know if dry goods store is just something that sells anything that's not
00:13:28,00:13:33,"wet, but wanted to buy a canvas, and she said her father waited on him."
00:13:33,00:13:36,And she described him as very ugly like a louse.
00:13:36,00:13:39,>> Wow.
00:13:39,00:13:42,">> Now, the big problem is that her father didn't own a dry goods store."
00:13:42,00:13:44,>> That is the one slight problem with that story.
00:13:44,00:13:46,"Yes, her husband did, or her husband's family did, I think."
00:13:46,00:13:49,">> Yeah, that's where we get into something a little bit dodgy about this story."
00:13:49,00:13:52,">> Yeah, okay, first off though, before we get into it,"
00:13:52,00:13:53,when did she tell this story?
00:13:53,00:13:57,"Because if she was 120 at the time, I think you're allowed to fuck up a bit of"
00:13:57,00:13:59,timeline in your life.
00:13:59,00:13:59,>> Agreed.
00:13:59,00:14:01,">> Yeah, so there's a theory, isn't there?"
00:14:01,00:14:05,There's a theory that maybe she didn't live to 122 years old and
00:14:05,00:14:09,"that she didn't die in 1997, but in 1934."
00:14:09,00:14:09,>> Yes.
00:14:09,00:14:10,>> Yeah.
00:14:10,00:14:13,>> But you would have been much younger.
00:14:13,00:14:18,">> But there's a theory, I can't stress enough theory, but that her daughter had"
00:14:18,00:14:21,"died, no, wait, her daughter hadn't died."
00:14:21,00:14:24,"Okay, you're all with me, great, her daughter hadn't died."
00:14:24,00:14:29,"But it was a pretend that she had, at which point, the daughter assumed the"
00:14:29,00:14:34,"identity of her own mother, so therefore gained another 20, 30 years on the clock."
00:14:34,00:14:38,And the idea was that they did it because they would have to pay tax on the
00:14:38,00:14:42,"inheritance when she got the house, and they thought that maybe she pretended to"
00:14:42,00:14:43,be her mother.
00:14:43,00:14:45,There's a few problems with the theory.
00:14:45,00:14:48,"One, she would have had to have lived with her father as her husband for"
00:14:48,00:14:50,quite a few years.
00:14:50,00:14:53,">> I mean, no one's checking up on their copulation levels, are they?"
00:14:53,00:14:54,Probably.
00:14:54,00:14:59,I just think that's an easier bit to fake than when you meet your friends a week
00:14:59,00:15:02,"later and they go, my God, you've sort of lost 30 years."
00:15:02,00:15:10,>> But there is one main guy who is kind of pushes this theory and he's called
00:15:10,00:15:12,Nicolaj Zak.
00:15:12,00:15:17,"And we came, we did a gig in Nottingham yesterday and our train back was, I think,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,about two and a half hours.
00:15:19,00:15:22,I spent the entire time talking to Nicolaj Zak.
00:15:22,00:15:25,He is very keen to tell us his theories.
00:15:25,00:15:29,"But by the end of it, I must admit, by the time we're pulling into London, I, you"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"know, I think, well, he has a few good points, I think."
00:15:32,00:15:36,"And really, like for instance, there was an interview with the family where they"
00:15:36,00:15:41,"kept confusing Jim with her daughter, Yvonne, and they just kept getting the"
00:15:41,00:15:43,names wrong all the way through.
00:15:43,00:15:47,">> Again, though, that's like, my mom calls me the dog's name all the time, right?"
00:15:47,00:15:50,"Like, that's, that's a very classic thing to get a name right."
00:15:50,00:15:55,">> He's a mathematician, this guy, and he used Bayesian statistics to work out the"
00:15:55,00:15:57,chances that this could be true.
00:15:57,00:16:00,And he reckons it's well in the 10 millions to one that this is true.
00:16:00,00:16:04,"So that's his main bit of evidence that statistically, he doesn't think this is"
00:16:04,00:16:05,true.
00:16:05,00:16:10,"He's shown the signatures over the years, and he shows that around the 1930s,"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"the signature changes really, really quite differently."
00:16:13,00:16:17,"It's kind of similar, but the T is very different and the J is very different."
00:16:17,00:16:20,>> This coming from a man who we should say does change his signature every
00:16:20,00:16:21,single year.
00:16:21,00:16:22,">> I do do that, yeah."
00:16:22,00:16:24,>> Maybe she was just taking after you.
00:16:24,00:16:26,>> Only 50 years before me.
00:16:26,00:16:27,>> That's right.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"Well, you know, she knew Dr. Hoopat, I don't know."
00:16:29,00:16:34,"But the thing is that this guy is saying, right, we have the blood of Jean Calment,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"right, so it's really easy to test."
00:16:36,00:16:39,You can just test the blood and you'll know exactly how old she is.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"But the people, her family are refusing to let them do it."
00:16:41,00:16:45,"And they're saying they're not going to let him do that, or let anyone do that,"
00:16:45,00:16:45,in fact.
00:16:45,00:16:49,"And they always kind of say, oh, he's just working for the KGB."
00:16:49,00:16:50,That's how they started.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"And when they realized it couldn't be that, they were like, oh, no,"
00:16:52,00:16:56,he's in the pocket of rich billionaires who want the secret of eternal life.
00:16:56,00:16:59,So they're kind of attacking on this side.
00:16:59,00:17:01,He says that he's just looking for the truth.
00:17:01,00:17:02,He's not trying to prove anyone wrong.
00:17:02,00:17:03,He's just trying to look for the truth.
00:17:03,00:17:07,And that's my TED talk.
00:17:07,00:17:11,">> Is it fair to say, so the family refusing to do it, partially a reason,"
00:17:11,00:17:18,"I'm guessing, is in France, Jean Calment is quite a sort of household name to people."
00:17:18,00:17:24,"Like, we don't necessarily know them, know her over here, them, I thought into the theory."
00:17:24,00:17:29,"But she's in books, and she's part of the culture."
00:17:29,00:17:31,So let's not topple this.
00:17:31,00:17:33,And a lot of people supposedly don't want to touch it.
00:17:33,00:17:36,">> There's a lot of enthusiasm, of course, for the idea, because it's a point of pride."
00:17:36,00:17:39,"I mean, she's substantially older than anyone else who's ever lived."
00:17:39,00:17:43,"But I should say, guys, we're not considering the other oldest person ever,"
00:17:43,00:17:48,"old Tom Parr, who was an Englishman who lived for 152 years,"
00:17:48,00:17:53,between the late 15th and middle 17th centuries.
00:17:53,00:17:57,"And I don't know why we're not talking about it more, because he's the champ."
00:17:57,00:18:01,">> He didn't do much, not after the age of about 130."
00:18:01,00:18:05,"He, this guy's clearly a fraud."
00:18:05,00:18:08,">> How dare, I know, I know, he lived in Shropshire."
00:18:08,00:18:11,">> You're working for the KGB, I can tell."
00:18:11,00:18:13,">> He got married at the age of 80, he had a couple of children."
00:18:13,00:18:16,He had an affair over the age of 100.
00:18:16,00:18:18,"Father, a new child with that affair."
00:18:18,00:18:19,>> At the age of 100.
00:18:19,00:18:23,">> I know, he remarried at age 110."
00:18:23,00:18:25,He was taken to London to meet Charles I.
00:18:25,00:18:30,"So he was taken seriously at the time, despite the fact he was manifestly only about 80."
00:18:30,00:18:34,"And he was taken to London, and he died within a few weeks after being too well fed."
00:18:34,00:18:35,>> I know.
00:18:35,00:18:39,>> Because he had only lived on rancid cheese and hard bread.
00:18:39,00:18:43,"And he was taken to London and given nice food, and it was too much."
00:18:43,00:18:47,">> If that was the key to living to 180, do you think you'd do it?"
00:18:47,00:18:51,"If it was rancid cheese and hard bread all the way, I think I'd just accept 75."
00:18:51,00:18:54,>> Or 45.
00:18:54,00:18:58,">> But he's married at Westminster Abbey, isn't he?"
00:18:58,00:18:59,>> Let's see.
00:18:59,00:19:02,">> Yeah, so he was a big deal in his day."
00:19:02,00:19:03,>> Wow.
00:19:03,00:19:04,>> He was a big cheese.
00:19:04,00:19:11,">> Do you guys know, so there's a list on Wikipedia which gets updated all the time of world's"
00:19:11,00:19:12,oldest people.
00:19:12,00:19:19,So how many of the people in the top 10 of the world's oldest people would you say are
00:19:19,00:19:20,men?
00:19:20,00:19:23,">> Oh God, no men live till anywhere."
00:19:23,00:19:26,I would guess there aren't any men for hundreds.
00:19:26,00:19:29,">> There's one really old Japanese guy, wasn't there?"
00:19:29,00:19:30,>> Yes.
00:19:30,00:19:31,>> I'll say all 10.
00:19:31,00:19:32,>> Yeah.
00:19:32,00:19:36,">> Even though we know there shouldn't come on, it's a weapon."
00:19:36,00:19:37,">> No, no, living."
00:19:37,00:19:38,Currently living.
00:19:38,00:19:39,>> I'm currently living.
00:19:39,00:19:40,>> Currently living.
00:19:40,00:19:41,>> I'm still saying all 10.
00:19:41,00:19:42,>> Yeah.
00:19:42,00:19:43,So Andy's the wrong one here.
00:19:43,00:19:44,>> I've got the wrong one.
00:19:44,00:19:45,">> No, no."
00:19:45,00:19:46,None.
00:19:46,00:19:47,>> None.
00:19:47,00:19:49,>> Top 10 living oldest people in the world are women.
00:19:49,00:19:57,The youngest of which is 114 years old and the closest man is a bullshit 112.
00:19:57,00:19:59,So two years in between the top 10.
00:19:59,00:20:01,">> Yeah, sorry, you guys are going to die young."
00:20:01,00:20:02,I don't know.
00:20:02,00:20:03,>> Yeah.
00:20:03,00:20:04,>> I'm sad that you just learned this.
00:20:04,00:20:08,>> I'll tell you again to the example of old Tom Parr in the top 152.
00:20:08,00:20:15,">> I think the oldest person at the moment is Kanetanaka, maybe, Japanese woman."
00:20:15,00:20:21,She is 118 years and 281 days today.
00:20:21,00:20:27,"But actually she was born prematurely, so it seemed a bit longer."
00:20:27,00:20:33,She got pancreatic cancer when she was 45 years old and had to have surgery and then
00:20:33,00:20:37,"she lived on to, at time of recording, at least 118 years old."
00:20:37,00:20:38,>> Wow.
00:20:38,00:20:39,>> Isn't that amazing?
00:20:39,00:20:46,"You know the two oldest men in 2018 had exactly the same birthday and they never met, but"
00:20:46,00:20:49,they used to swap birthday cards every year because they thought it was funny that they
00:20:49,00:20:50,did.
00:20:50,00:20:55,And so they were both born on the same day in 1908 and then one of them sadly died in
00:20:55,00:21:01,"1919, but at almost that exact same moment, a new woman was crowned oldest woman in the"
00:21:01,00:21:05,UK and she too had exactly the same birthday as the oldest man.
00:21:05,00:21:06,>> Really?
00:21:06,00:21:07,Isn't that weird?
00:21:07,00:21:09,>> Did you start sending birthday cards to her?
00:21:09,00:21:11,>> I actually don't know if he did.
00:21:11,00:21:14,"You're running out of energy at 112, I suppose."
00:21:14,00:21:20,">> They all refused their cards from the Queen because they wanted to save public funds,"
00:21:20,00:21:26,"which is, I know, I know, as if that was going to be the straw that broke the camel's back."
00:21:26,00:21:29,">> Is it that you don't get something from the Queen these days, you get it from the"
00:21:29,00:21:30,work and pension secretary?
00:21:30,00:21:31,>> You get one from each?
00:21:31,00:21:32,>> Yeah.
00:21:32,00:21:33,>> You get one from each?
00:21:33,00:21:36,"So I can't remember who that is at the moment, but there was a time where you got a card from"
00:21:36,00:21:40,the Queen and then a card from me and Duncan Smith and that was Bleak.
00:21:40,00:21:47,">> Happy birthday, by the way, I've declared you fit for work."
00:21:47,00:21:55,">> Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James."
00:21:55,00:22:01,">> Okay, my fact this week is that the largest hailstone in Texan history was broken up by"
00:22:01,00:22:03,locals and turned into margaritas.
00:22:03,00:22:09,"So that's pretty cool, that's a fun way, that's a fun thing to do with it."
00:22:09,00:22:10,>> I think so.
00:22:10,00:22:11,>> Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:12,>> I think that's definitely the best thing to do.
00:22:12,00:22:15,>> How did they know it was the largest in Texan history?
00:22:15,00:22:17,">> Well, that's a great question, Andrew."
00:22:17,00:22:18,>> Okay.
00:22:18,00:22:23,">> It isn't the official biggest one, but it fell in the same storm as the official"
00:22:23,00:22:24,biggest one.
00:22:24,00:22:30,"So this was earlier this year in June, there was a massive hailstorm in Texas and all of"
00:22:30,00:22:34,these huge hailstones came down and they managed to save one of them and this is the
00:22:34,00:22:38,record one and amazingly they could use radar because it was big enough for radar to pick
00:22:38,00:22:42,it up so they could see when it fell and they could see it there.
00:22:42,00:22:47,But there was another social media post at the same time where people took a photo of
00:22:47,00:22:49,a hailstone.
00:22:49,00:22:53,You can tell by the size of the hands and by the size of the people and everything exactly
00:22:53,00:22:56,"how big it was, it would have been the biggest one, but we haven't been able to measure it"
00:22:56,00:22:59,"because they thought, fuck this, let's have some margaritas."
00:22:59,00:23:00,So cool.
00:23:00,00:23:05,>> So we can't be sure it wasn't just huge people with giant hands and actually quite
00:23:05,00:23:07,small hailstones.
00:23:07,00:23:08,">> And is it right, James?"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"I think I read this, that even the biggest one, they weren't properly able to verify"
00:23:12,00:23:16,"it because the people put it in a fridge, but they didn't put it in a plastic bag."
00:23:16,00:23:17,>> It's really hard.
00:23:17,00:23:18,">> And so it shrank, right?"
00:23:18,00:23:19,">> Yeah, exactly."
00:23:19,00:23:23,"So whenever you want to get a record hailstone, it's really hard to kind of work out exactly"
00:23:23,00:23:26,"how big it is because from the very second it lands, even when it's in the air, it's"
00:23:26,00:23:27,just melting.
00:23:27,00:23:31,"Apparently one good thing is to put athletes' foot powder on it, that stops it from melting."
00:23:31,00:23:37,>> You've got to have such presence of mind in the middle of a hailstorm when something
00:23:37,00:23:40,the size of a grapefruit has just smashed into the ground next to you to get your athletes'
00:23:40,00:23:43,foot powder out.
00:23:43,00:23:44,>> Hail is terrifying.
00:23:44,00:23:45,>> Yeah.
00:23:45,00:23:46,>> This big stuff is.
00:23:46,00:23:47,>> The big stuff is terrifying.
00:23:47,00:23:48,>> Yeah.
00:23:48,00:23:54,">> And get this, Richmond, the very place we're in tonight, was devastated 140 years ago by"
00:23:54,00:23:55,hail.
00:23:55,00:23:56,>> Really?
00:23:56,00:24:02,">> In 1779, there was a giant hailstorm, the stones were five inches around, which is"
00:24:02,00:24:03,"big, circumference."
00:24:03,00:24:08,It apparently looked like there had been a riot and the military had fired at the town.
00:24:08,00:24:09,>> Wow.
00:24:09,00:24:10,>> But that's how bad it was.
00:24:10,00:24:14,"There were craters in people's lawns in St. Margaret's, which is just nearby, which"
00:24:14,00:24:15,were three inches deep.
00:24:15,00:24:16,>> Wow.
00:24:16,00:24:21,">> Yeah, the place was absolutely destroyed by, and that's why it's such a horrible town"
00:24:21,00:24:22,today.
00:24:22,00:24:26,>> Lovely to be here.
00:24:26,00:24:28,>> That's got to be a Jonathan Creek episode.
00:24:28,00:24:32,"If it's not already, there's obviously been a gunman loose, everyone's been killed by"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"bullets through the heart, and yet all the bullets have disappeared."
00:24:35,00:24:36,>> Yes.
00:24:36,00:24:37,>> What has happened?
00:24:37,00:24:40,">> If you're listening, writers of that do it."
00:24:40,00:24:42,>> Or actors who are in it.
00:24:42,00:24:43,>> Yeah.
00:24:43,00:24:48,"There was one particularly bad hailstorm, which changed the course of human history,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,which I didn't know about.
00:24:50,00:24:54,"So this was Black Monday, and I really had no idea about the hailstorm."
00:24:54,00:25:01,"It was in the Hundred Years' War, so it was, I think it was in 1360, and it was the biggest"
00:25:01,00:25:05,"loss of life up until that point in the Hundred Years' War, so it was Phase One of the Hundred"
00:25:05,00:25:06,Years' War.
00:25:06,00:25:11,"It ended Phase One, because it was so bad, and it was Edward III, who was going to war"
00:25:11,00:25:16,"with France, as we did in the Hundred Years' War, and he was besieging the town of Chartres"
00:25:16,00:25:17,in France.
00:25:17,00:25:21,"He had an army of 10,000 people, which was like the biggest army that it ever had at"
00:25:21,00:25:22,that point.
00:25:22,00:25:27,"And on Easter Monday, this massive storm came, struck the camp, hailstones so large they"
00:25:27,00:25:29,were killing men and horses.
00:25:29,00:25:35,"Apparently, 1,000 men were killed, and up to 6,000 horses."
00:25:35,00:25:36,Some from hail.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Others from like lightening.
00:25:37,00:25:38,>> What?
00:25:38,00:25:41,Does this sound very like -- are we sure the French army had invented arrows made of ice
00:25:41,00:25:42,or something like that?
00:25:42,00:25:47,">> It could be, and they never used them again, so they didn't give away the secret."
00:25:47,00:25:50,"I think some people were trampled because there was a panic, some people froze to death."
00:25:50,00:25:54,"It had been 30 degrees in the daytime, and then suddenly at night, this hail."
00:25:54,00:25:58,"And Edward was so traumatised, plus he lost a tenth of his army, that he thought it was"
00:25:58,00:26:01,"a sign from God, and he made peace with the French straight away."
00:26:01,00:26:02,">> Yeah, absolutely."
00:26:02,00:26:03,That would be --
00:26:03,00:26:06,">> I think that could make you turn -- if you're an atheist, even, you could turn into thinking,"
00:26:06,00:26:08,"""Fucking hell, we're on the wrong side here."""
00:26:08,00:26:09,>> Yeah.
00:26:09,00:26:10,And what year did he say that was?
00:26:10,00:26:11,>> 1360.
00:26:11,00:26:12,>> I want to say 1360.
00:26:12,00:26:13,">> Oh, okay."
00:26:13,00:26:14,And he made peace.
00:26:14,00:26:17,>> The Hundred Years War ended 93 years later.
00:26:17,00:26:19,>> It was the end of phase one.
00:26:19,00:26:20,">> Phase three, you did say phase one."
00:26:20,00:26:21,>> I did.
00:26:21,00:26:22,I did say phase one.
00:26:22,00:26:25,"There's a brief respite, and then they did get back into it."
00:26:25,00:26:30,">> What happened was, Edward renounced his claim to the throne in France and said, ""Oh,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,I don't want any more parts of France.
00:26:32,00:26:33,I'll just have this little bit at the top.
00:26:33,00:26:35,"I won't have the rest of it."""
00:26:35,00:26:37,"And then a few years later, he went, ""Oh, maybe I'll have that bit."""
00:26:37,00:26:41,"And the French went, ""Okay, well, if the hail didn't work, we're going to have to try"
00:26:41,00:26:42,"something else."""
00:26:42,00:26:43,>> Yeah.
00:26:43,00:26:44,"So more-ish, isn't it, France?"
00:26:44,00:26:45,>> Yeah.
00:26:45,00:26:46,>> Like Ferrero Rocher.
00:26:46,00:26:48,Have you heard of a guy called Guy Merchie?
00:26:48,00:26:49,>> No.
00:26:49,00:26:50,>> Okay.
00:26:50,00:26:56,"He, in 1938, was in a glider plane in Germany, and he was caught in a powerful updraft, right?"
00:26:56,00:26:58,He was carried into a storm cloud.
00:26:58,00:26:59,I know.
00:26:59,00:27:03,He and his four colleagues were frozen by layer after layer of ice.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"His four colleagues very sadly perished, but he survived."
00:27:05,00:27:11,"Now, I haven't found- I found this story in one place online where he became a giant hailstone"
00:27:11,00:27:13,and smashed into the ground and then came out alive.
00:27:13,00:27:16,It's only in one place that I found online.
00:27:16,00:27:21,"So I'm suspecting he may be a bit of an old Tom Parr in this scenario, but it's such"
00:27:21,00:27:22,a great story.
00:27:22,00:27:23,">> Well, that's the genuine story."
00:27:23,00:27:27,He plummeted from the sky as an ice block and survived by-
00:27:27,00:27:28,>> I believe it.
00:27:28,00:27:32,">> That's the kind of shit I say on this show, I don't think."
00:27:32,00:27:36,"Hailstorms, it's kind of like a washing machine, isn't it?"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"So it's just a secular thing that's going on inside the cloud, and it gets bigger and"
00:27:40,00:27:45,"bigger, and the forces create the moisture that freezes, and eventually when they get"
00:27:45,00:27:47,"too heavy, that's when they come down."
00:27:47,00:27:51,"And so when you get these giants, sort of in America, when you get tornadoes, it's kind"
00:27:51,00:27:52,of a similar thing.
00:27:52,00:27:56,"When they're ginormous, that's why in America you get these volleyball-sized hailstorms"
00:27:56,00:27:58,that come out of the sky.
00:27:58,00:28:01,>> And why they're so damaging.
00:28:01,00:28:02,So they're the worst kind of weather.
00:28:02,00:28:06,"They must cause more- well, no, it's a huge claim, I'm going to retract before saying it,"
00:28:06,00:28:10,"but they cause billions of dollars worth of damage to farms, and it's because they're"
00:28:10,00:28:16,"not cold weather, weather, they're not cold weather weather, they're hot weather weather."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"So you get big hailstorms in summer, which I didn't realize, and that's when all the"
00:28:19,00:28:22,"crops are out, so they devastate all the crops."
00:28:22,00:28:26,"So difference between hail and sleet, thanks for asking, like you've always wondered, but"
00:28:26,00:28:31,"the hail is made up in the cloud, like Dan says, whereas sleet is made on a cold day,"
00:28:31,00:28:36,"the rain falls and it freezes on the way down, and hail tends to happen on like those really"
00:28:36,00:28:41,hot sort of monsoon storm kind of days when there's shed loads of wind stirring up the
00:28:41,00:28:42,clouds.
00:28:42,00:28:46,"And so, yeah, it's in summer when all the crops are lush and growing, and the hail comes"
00:28:46,00:28:49,"down, decimates them, and farmers are ruined by them."
00:28:49,00:28:54,">> Another reason they're so dangerous, especially in America, is because they form and they"
00:28:54,00:28:55,follow roads.
00:28:55,00:28:56,>> Not.
00:28:56,00:28:57,>> Yeah.
00:28:57,00:28:58,>> What?
00:28:58,00:29:05,">> There was one in 2001, the tri-state's hailstorm, and it caused $1.5 billion worth of damage,"
00:29:05,00:29:08,and it basically followed the interstate 70 road.
00:29:08,00:29:11,>> Why was it trying to get to?
00:29:11,00:29:12,>> Wow.
00:29:12,00:29:16,>> You really think God had something against you when you were just driving just ahead of
00:29:16,00:29:17,the hailstorm?
00:29:17,00:29:18,>> Fuck it out!
00:29:18,00:29:19,What?
00:29:19,00:29:25,">> The reason is that it's because American roads tend to go east to west or north to south,"
00:29:25,00:29:26,right?
00:29:26,00:29:31,"Also, the roads tend to follow the path of least resistance, so they tend to go around"
00:29:31,00:29:35,"kind of hills in the long river valleys, and also so do storms."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"They tend to take the path of least resistance, and so you tend to find that the storms just"
00:29:39,00:29:40,follow the roads around.
00:29:40,00:29:41,>> That's really funny.
00:29:41,00:29:42,>> Isn't it cool?
00:29:42,00:29:44,"And of course, where do you have people living?"
00:29:44,00:29:48,"They tend to live like the communities are on the roads, so, you know, that's why you"
00:29:48,00:29:49,get loads of damage for property.
00:29:49,00:29:51,">> Guys, we've got to move on in a sec."
00:29:51,00:29:53,">> Oh, gosh."
00:29:53,00:29:56,>> We're going to do some cocktail stuff really quickly.
00:29:56,00:30:02,Good place to go for cocktails if you are in Malmo in Sweden would be the Disgusting
00:30:02,00:30:03,Food Museum.
00:30:03,00:30:04,>> Which you've been to?
00:30:04,00:30:05,>> Which I've been to.
00:30:05,00:30:09,They emailed me the other day to say that they have a new alcohol exhibit at the Disgusting
00:30:09,00:30:15,"Food Museum, so they have a beer, which is 55% called End of History, which is sold in"
00:30:15,00:30:19,a taxidermied squirrel.
00:30:19,00:30:23,They have South Korean poo wine.
00:30:23,00:30:30,"They have Icelandic sheep dung smoked whale testicle beer, which they say is actually"
00:30:30,00:30:32,quite nice.
00:30:32,00:30:37,"They say they have some popcorn liqueur from Spain, which they say that the manufacturer"
00:30:37,00:30:42,"says it has a flavour of smooth and buttery freshly popped popcorn, but the guy who runs"
00:30:42,00:30:47,"the museum, Samuel West, said that actually it's more like licking the popcorn and soft"
00:30:47,00:30:53,"drink than it's in the soaked carpet of a rum-down movie theatre, but yeah, Disgusting"
00:30:53,00:30:58,"Food Museum, if you are there in Malmo, it's an amazing museum, and they struggled a little"
00:30:58,00:31:02,"bit due to COVID, so they're really struggling, but ironically, he does have another museum"
00:31:02,00:31:07,"called the Museum of Failure, which is going great guns, and the Museum of Failure has"
00:31:07,00:31:12,"just opened a new one in the US and another one in Taiwan, so it's absolutely amazing."
00:31:12,00:31:13,>> Amazing.
00:31:13,00:31:14,That's awesome.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"We do need to move on, guys, to our final fact."
00:31:16,00:31:21,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna."
00:31:21,00:31:27,>> My fact this week is that the average Londoner poos out 100th of a line of cocaine every
00:31:27,00:31:28,weekend.
00:31:28,00:31:29,>> Wow.
00:31:29,00:31:30,Okay.
00:31:30,00:31:31,How many Londoners are there in this room?
00:31:31,00:31:32,About 900?
00:31:32,00:31:33,">> 900, I think."
00:31:33,00:31:35,>> That's a hell of a weekend.
00:31:35,00:31:36,>> Yeah.
00:31:36,00:31:41,"I guess we've got nine lines of cocaine in here, in the toilets here, if you've all"
00:31:41,00:31:42,been once.
00:31:42,00:31:51,"I say poos out, excretes, evacuates from their nether regions, 100th of a line of cocaine,"
00:31:51,00:31:55,and this is this really interesting bunch of data that's collected by the European Monitoring
00:31:55,00:32:00,"Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and what it does is it goes through the sewage systems"
00:32:00,00:32:04,"of loads and loads of different cities in Europe, about 100 different cities, and it"
00:32:04,00:32:09,"does it every year, and it sifts through and it looks at all the drug residue that's there,"
00:32:09,00:32:14,"so the metabolites, the things that have been the remnants of a drug in your body."
00:32:14,00:32:19,"And for 2019, which is the last year that we have data for London, I reckon in 2020"
00:32:19,00:32:24,"London was omitted maybe because of COVID, maybe because of Brexit, that endless either"
00:32:24,00:32:27,or could be either debate.
00:32:27,00:32:35,"In 2019, I read the weekend average of cocaine is 700 milligrams per day at the weekend per"
00:32:35,00:32:40,"thousand people, which I worked out that I think that's about assuming that a line is"
00:32:40,00:32:43,"about 10th of a gram, and I know some people are like bigger lines, some people are like"
00:32:43,00:32:50,"smaller lines, assuming that it's actually about 1.4, 1.5% of a line a weekend."
00:32:50,00:32:54,"Okay, let's have a quick survey, who likes a bigger line later?"
00:32:54,00:32:59,"Obviously, probably the average is weighted more in the direction of people who've taken"
00:32:59,00:33:03,"cocaine, that it's not like we're all doing it, okay, but the average is being brought"
00:33:03,00:33:06,up by the people that are having massive binges.
00:33:06,00:33:09,"But it's such a cool thing to analyze, just going through sewage, finding out exactly"
00:33:09,00:33:10,what we've been up to.
00:33:10,00:33:13,"Yeah, it is amazing, and it's quite a new technology, isn't it?"
00:33:13,00:33:18,"It's only about 20 years old, so that we've been doing this as a species, wastewater epidemiology"
00:33:18,00:33:21,"is what it's called, and you can find diseases as well."
00:33:21,00:33:28,"So you can find COVID 10 days before an outbreak happens in terms, days and days before physical"
00:33:28,00:33:29,symptoms start appearing.
00:33:29,00:33:30,"Oh, wow."
00:33:30,00:33:33,"If you're analyzing wastewater, you will realize that something's going to happen, you can"
00:33:33,00:33:34,respond to it first.
00:33:34,00:33:36,"Yeah, and there was a guy who wasn't, I can't remember his name, but the person who basically"
00:33:36,00:33:41,"invented this field of study, when COVID started to happen, you know, wrote to lots"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"of people and said, ""We've got to start looking in the sewers,"" because that's going to allow"
00:33:44,00:33:49,"us to save loads of lives and stop COVID spreading, and only now they've actually started doing"
00:33:49,00:33:53,"it in America, and it's already really helped, because you can kind of spot an outbreak before"
00:33:53,00:33:56,"it properly happens, and then get your resources there."
00:33:56,00:33:57,Amazing.
00:33:57,00:34:02,Probably the first person to do this kind of epidemiology in wastewater was John Snow.
00:34:02,00:34:09,"That was in 1854, and that was when there was a cholera outbreak in London, and he decided,"
00:34:09,00:34:12,"he realized, you'll all know this story, a lot of you will, but he realized that it was"
00:34:12,00:34:17,"coming from a particular pump in SoHo, and he said, ""It's coming from here, can you take"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"the pump off?"""
00:34:18,00:34:20,"And they did, and then it kind of went away."
00:34:20,00:34:25,"But even after he'd done that, he couldn't convince everyone that this was true."
00:34:25,00:34:30,"They saw that people had stopped getting cholera, but they thought maybe it had been a coincidence."
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Like, you know nothing, John Snow."
00:34:31,00:34:33,Oh my gosh.
00:34:33,00:34:34,We were all waiting for it.
00:34:34,00:34:41,"It was either a batter or a swing gum, it's a joke, I'll tell you the rest."
00:34:41,00:34:44,Just does anyone want to know the kind of drug concentrations in the water of European
00:34:44,00:34:45,cities?
00:34:45,00:34:46,Sure.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"Yes, great."
00:34:47,00:34:50,"It's really predictable, actually."
00:34:50,00:34:54,"So London had the highest concentration of cocaine for one year, held the top spot 2015,"
00:34:54,00:34:58,"and we've plummeted since then, dropped our cocaine use by a third."
00:34:58,00:35:04,"Well done, and well done, you lot, and Antwerp is riding very high, it's all Antwerp and"
00:35:04,00:35:10,"Amsterdam really, and that's for cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, Amsterdam, like much higher"
00:35:10,00:35:15,"than anyone else for that, and Italy, bizarrely, is at the bottom of the league for everything,"
00:35:15,00:35:16,Italian cities.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Oh.
00:35:17,00:35:18,They're not taking many drugs.
00:35:18,00:35:19,Okay.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"I mean, lots of delicious pasta."
00:35:20,00:35:21,The drug of choice.
00:35:21,00:35:28,"In Italy, you do get those people who like the penne, the short lines, and the people"
00:35:28,00:35:31,"like spaghetti, the long lines, don't you?"
00:35:31,00:35:33,"I do, yeah."
00:35:33,00:35:40,"But yeah, it's so fascinating how it shows how, when we use cocaine, so there is, I"
00:35:40,00:35:41,think there's...
00:35:41,00:35:43,"And again, the collective ""we"" being deployed here, the royal ""we""."
00:35:43,00:35:48,I do want to make it really clear that neither I nor anyone in this room here tonight has
00:35:48,00:35:51,"ever touched cocaine, but we as a nation..."
00:35:51,00:35:53,Why are you talking so quickly?
00:35:53,00:36:00,"Sorry, I'm just sweating and shaking a bit."
00:36:00,00:36:04,"Yeah, it's on Sundays, there is more than twice as much cocaine in our sewers as on"
00:36:04,00:36:05,Wednesdays.
00:36:05,00:36:06,"Well, it's church, isn't it?"
00:36:06,00:36:12,"You stayed kneeling down for a long time after the end of that prayer, what's going"
00:36:12,00:36:13,on there?
00:36:13,00:36:16,"It's not, it's from some of the night before, isn't it?"
00:36:16,00:36:18,You do your first poo the morning after.
00:36:18,00:36:19,Okay.
00:36:19,00:36:21,Story checks out.
00:36:21,00:36:29,"Sewage in general, I think, things we can learn from sewage, and this is a very interesting"
00:36:29,00:36:30,thing.
00:36:30,00:36:35,"There are archaeologists who study coprolites, they study fossilized poo, and a few years"
00:36:35,00:36:40,"ago, a team from the Max Planck Institute last year, actually, they developed a cool"
00:36:40,00:36:46,"AI tool, which will allow them to tell human stools from dog stools, coprolites, these are"
00:36:46,00:36:47,all fossil poo.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"Oh, fossil."
00:36:48,00:36:50,And it's very hard to tell the two apart.
00:36:50,00:36:53,"It's really hard, actually, if you're studying an ancient settlement, because humans and"
00:36:53,00:36:57,"dogs both lived there, and not to put to find a point."
00:36:57,00:36:59,Usually the dog wants in a plastic bag.
00:36:59,00:37:00,"Yes, that's right."
00:37:00,00:37:01,Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:06,"But on the occasion of the day, it's not hanging from the tree, then you get, yeah, and the"
00:37:06,00:37:11,"problem is that they both contain a lot of the other's DNA, not to put to find a point"
00:37:11,00:37:15,"on it because dogs have no manners and will eat anything, and because also humans used"
00:37:15,00:37:17,to like to eat dogs a lot.
00:37:17,00:37:21,"So there's this complete muddle going on, but there is now, and I know you'll all have"
00:37:21,00:37:25,"been worried about this, a diagnostic tool to help you work out which is which."
00:37:25,00:37:28,And what is this going to cure cancer or anything?
00:37:28,00:37:30,"It's not going to cure cancer, obviously, it's a complete different field of study,"
00:37:30,00:37:34,but it will come handy at some point.
00:37:34,00:37:40,"I love that back in the day, the London Sewers, I read the story about a guy called John Hollingshead"
00:37:40,00:37:45,"who wanted to visit one, he was a journalist, and this was in 1862, and apparently there"
00:37:45,00:37:51,was this thing where he was given basically a menu of the experiences that you could have
00:37:51,00:37:57,at various bits of the sewage in the London Underground because of what was going on above
00:37:57,00:37:58,it.
00:37:58,00:38:03,"So the menu was sort of like, would you like to go to an underground tunnel where they"
00:38:03,00:38:07,"have the blood sewers, and the blood sewers would be, that would be running underneath"
00:38:07,00:38:09,the meat markets of London.
00:38:09,00:38:14,"So when you'd go in, it would be running with basically rivers of blood, and you could experience"
00:38:14,00:38:16,this weird thing that you could go in.
00:38:16,00:38:17,This is the worst.
00:38:17,00:38:18,Whoever has a blood speech I've ever heard.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"And then there was like the bakery areas where if there was a big bakery, you could go down,"
00:38:23,00:38:26,"and because the heating that was involved in doing the baking, that would flood down"
00:38:26,00:38:31,"into the sewers, and people who would go down there to fix it would use it kind of like"
00:38:31,00:38:35,"a Turkish bath, you would go and it would be a steam room for you."
00:38:35,00:38:36,No.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"Yeah, so it was like a, where would you like to go?"
00:38:37,00:38:38,Go down to enjoy it.
00:38:38,00:38:39,Yeah.
00:38:39,00:38:40,"Yeah, let it go."
00:38:40,00:38:45,"So the sewers of London before, what was the name, Joseph Basil Jeanette?"
00:38:45,00:38:48,"Before him, it was very dangerous and so on."
00:38:48,00:38:52,"But obviously it was also a place where people go to sleep to, you know, it was a whole different"
00:38:52,00:38:53,bit of London.
00:38:53,00:38:54,Obviously.
00:38:54,00:38:55,Yeah.
00:38:55,00:38:56,I didn't know that.
00:38:56,00:39:00,"Christ, next on my hotel set is we have a steam room, and it's in the basement floor."
00:39:00,00:39:02,And very careful.
00:39:02,00:39:05,Have you heard of the Tanzanian toilet bat?
00:39:05,00:39:07,This is incredible.
00:39:07,00:39:12,"There are these grasslands in Tanzania, which have these pit toilets, and it's just a concrete"
00:39:12,00:39:15,"slab with a hole in the middle, and that's where you go to go to the loo, and there's"
00:39:15,00:39:20,"an eight foot deep drop down into the pit of the loo, and unfortunately bats love living"
00:39:20,00:39:21,in there.
00:39:21,00:39:22,"Oh, right."
00:39:22,00:39:27,"So you will, you will sometimes get bats rocketing up past you while you're on the loo."
00:39:27,00:39:31,"And the scientist, the New York Times reported a Welsh scientist called Ligia Daward, who"
00:39:31,00:39:36,"said, ""I've had the soft leathery caress of a bat's wing against my buttocks while"
00:39:36,00:39:37,"having a poo."""
00:39:37,00:39:38,Wow.
00:39:38,00:39:42,Do you think that's nice?
00:39:42,00:39:43,It's not.
00:39:43,00:39:44,"It's exciting, isn't it?"
00:39:44,00:39:47,"It's exciting, but exciting and nice are two very different things."
00:39:47,00:39:52,I think I'll go for Andrex Quilted.
00:39:52,00:39:58,"What do you think if you have a note, a bank note, let's say a dollar bill, but it's probably"
00:39:58,00:39:59,the same here.
00:39:59,00:40:04,Do you think it's more likely to have cocaine on it or poo?
00:40:04,00:40:10,"Well, as we've established, they're one and the same."
00:40:10,00:40:13,I'll say cocaine.
00:40:13,00:40:14,Okay.
00:40:14,00:40:15,I'll say poo.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"Andre, do you care?"
00:40:17,00:40:22,"Again, it's difficult to, but I'll pick downside."
00:40:22,00:40:28,"So there are traces of cocaine, according to Dr Philip Tienow from New York School of Medicine."
00:40:28,00:40:31,You get cocaine on 80% of dollar bills.
00:40:31,00:40:32,What?
00:40:32,00:40:39,The 2002 report in the Southern Medical Journal reported that 94% of dollar bills tested positive
00:40:39,00:40:42,for fecal pathogens.
00:40:42,00:40:43,Wow.
00:40:43,00:40:47,"So, the answer was poo."
00:40:47,00:40:48,Congratulations poo.
00:40:48,00:40:49,Another quiz format.
00:40:49,00:40:59,I'm going to keep trying these quiz formats until one steps.
00:40:59,00:41:00,"We should wrap up, guys."
00:41:00,00:41:01,"Okay, that is it."
00:41:01,00:41:02,That is all of our facts.
