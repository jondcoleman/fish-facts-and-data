2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,420
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,380
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Richmond.

4
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,900
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,980
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,260
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,720
 favorite facts from the last seven days.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,480
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,280
 My fact is that spiny anteaters only use half their penis during sex.

12
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,140
 >> [LAUGH]

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,320
 >> Which half?

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,240
 >> The top half, yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,080
 >> [LAUGH]

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,060
 >> The left or the right half, believe it or not.

17
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,340
 The spiny anteater, so this is an animal, better known as a echidna.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,320
 And they're Australian, they're very cute little creatures.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,500
 They look sort of like- >> Like a hedgehog.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,960
 >> Weird hedgehogs basically, yeah.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,340
 Imagine a hedgehog, not that, but not far off.

22
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,280
 And they have these penises which are foreheaded, which have really, really-

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,180
 >> As if they're like a forehead.

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,800
 >> So, well, yeah, they've got four heads on their penises.

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,940
 It's really, they are dickheads.

26
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,960
 No, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're lovely.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,140
 So, yeah, they've got four sort of ends of the penis, but

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,400
 they only use two at any one time.

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,580
 It's really, it's a really, really bizarre animal, and it's either the left or

30
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,940
 the right, and they switch.

31
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,200
 So, only two ends get an erection at any one time.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,240
 >> Really?

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,480
 >> And do we know, it seems weird to have one side of something getting an erection

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,800
 without taking the other side with it.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,300
 >> It's very hard to imagine how you wouldn't be dragged along.

36
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,820
 >> Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,580
 >> I mean, if the right-hand side of your penis is erect,

38
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,660
 you, it's, I can't imagine where else the left side is gonna be.

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,380
 >> It's gonna look like your penis has had a stroke, isn't it, basically?

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,540
 >> Yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,580
 >> And it probably has an erection, yeah, yeah, there we go.

42
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,540
 Anyway, look, to steer us gently towards safe territory, they found this out in 2007.

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,140
 And it was really hard to see a kid in his breeding, because they, in captivity,

44
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,280
 they don't really, they don't breed much.

45
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,240
 And some scientists in Queensland led by a guy called Steve Johnston.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,800
 They inherited a male echidna, which had lived in a zoo, but

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 it had been retired from the zoo, because it kept getting erections at public

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,760
 viewing sessions.

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,840
 >> That's the word, retired, being used very euphemistically, isn't it?

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,000
 If you get retired from your job because you keep getting inappropriate erections.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,120
 >> Yeah, he was just promoted to somewhere completely different when no

52
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,160
 members of the public would see him, he was moved back off his stuff.

53
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,220
 >> Wow, that's great.

54
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,980
 >> And the Me4 movement with the kidneys, right?

55
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,720
 >> [LAUGH]

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,440
 >> Wow.

57
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,720
 >> [LAUGH]

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,240
 >> Yeah.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,860
 >> They were very readily, well, this particular echidna seemed very ready to

60
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,100
 have an erection, didn't it?

61
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,620
 It was kind of a gift from God, no one had ever seen the mate.

62
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,580
 And then suddenly the zookeeper said they had a captive echidna which,

63
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,220
 on handling, readily produced an erection.

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,980
 And they were able to condition the echidna to have an erection to

65
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,120
 the point where it would ejaculate whenever they wanted to.

66
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
 >> Whenever they wanted to.

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,640
 >> Whenever they fancied it, which is useful,

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
 because you also want to know about its sperm, what's in its sperm.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,840
 And so all they had to do was sort of push its abdomen.

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
 >> How interesting.

71
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,920
 >> It went for it.

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,840
 >> One thing we know about the sperm is that they're all very cooperative.

73
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,880
 You always think of sperm like as a swimming race where they're all fighting

74
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,360
 against each other.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,960
 But in this case, you get about 100 sperms at once, all kind of gather together in

76
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,220
 a little sphere and kind of swim.

77
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,460
 And apparently they can swim faster because of that.

78
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,300
 >> So that's amazing.

79
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,460
 >> After you, no, I insist.

80
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,980
 After you, no, please.

81
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,460
 >> It's like a peloton.

82
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,700
 >> Exactly, exactly.

83
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,060
 >> Or like in triathlon, all the swimmers often swim next to each other.

84
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,140
 Because you get, yeah, yeah.

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,340
 >> Do they swim in the shape of a giant sperm?

86
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,660
 As in, is that a more efficient shape to swim in?

87
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,300
 That'd be cool.

88
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,060
 >> Would that be cool?

89
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,500
 >> Yeah. >> Spear-like.

90
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
 >> Oh, sphere, sorry, okay, okay.

91
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,060
 >> But I think unlike a peloton, their heads are actually cemented together

92
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,160
 when they swim, which I don't think is how cycling works.

93
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,800
 Although I have not really watched cycling.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
 >> [LAUGH]

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
 >> But there's a special kind of cementing material,

96
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,960
 which literally joins all their heads together.

97
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,240
 And they wag their tails as they swim along.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,040
 And yeah, they think it might be for speed, but it seems like they're not really

99
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,160
 sure, it's just speculation as to why on earth they're bundling up like this.

100
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,560
 Could be that thing where I think penguins do it.

101
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,240
 Where the person in the middle has the greatest advantage,

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,520
 because they're not gonna get buffeted around by the outside.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,320
 So you just, if you go as a group, then the guy in the middle will survive.

104
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,380
 >> It's amazing the whole sex life of the echidna seems to be shrouded in theory and

105
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,820
 mystery.

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,100
 Like we don't know, there are so many things we don't know.

107
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,860
 Like you just said, why did they do that?

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,140
 Why are they using two penises rather than the four available ones at the time?

109
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:03,180
 Also, they do this weird thing where when they're courting a female,

110
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,780
 they form what's kind of, it's called the love train.

111
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:06,620
 >> [LAUGH]

112
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,140
 >> It's basically a conga line of echidnas that just follow in a line,

113
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,520
 the female for up to a month, and they're just behind her wherever she goes.

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
 They're just snaking around with her.

115
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,400
 >> That's a long conga.

116
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,040
 >> It is a long conga, and at the end of the month,

117
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,000
 a decision is made, which we don't know what the decision is.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,080
 Like with those theories, is it the dominant male?

119
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,200
 Because they've noticed that kind of like a Russian doll, the biggest is at the top,

120
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,560
 and they get smaller and smaller and smaller as they go along.

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
 So the smallest is at the back, but we don't.

122
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,720
 >> They sometimes have a little fight at the end.

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 We have seen that, whether that always happens, we're not sure.

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,860
 But then also sometimes if there's two congas, two rival congas going along,

125
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,740
 you might be doing your conga along.

126
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,500
 But then if you go near to the other congas, sometimes you might swap to the other one.

127
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,220
 >> Oh, really?

128
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,380
 >> If you fancy the head of the other conga a bit more, you might go over there.

129
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,500
 >> Wow, does that ever happen in real conga, that there's a rival line?

130
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,580
 And you're like, I'm gonna take everyone behind me into that line.

131
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,060
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, what will happen is there's a conga going along, and

132
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,100
 then one person will go a bit too fast and someone's not paying attention.

133
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,620
 And then suddenly that person who wasn't paying attention serves

134
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,640
 them right, they're the head of the conga now, and

135
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,880
 they have all the responsibility that entails.

136
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,560
 >> That's so funny.

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,520
 >> It would be so cool if you could hear the echidnas doing their conga line in

138
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
 Australia.

139
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,360
 I'd appreciate that on the outback if you just heard a little [MUSIC]

140
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,880
 They're coming, the echidnas are coming.

141
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,720
 >> It does sound terrifying.

142
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
 So one of the, you mentioned this fight, James, that they have.

143
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,640
 One possible, or one way it sometimes goes, is that when the female finally says

144
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,000
 right, I am ready to mate, the males dig a trench and then compete by pushing

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,180
 each other out of the trench, and the last remaining echidna in the trench is

146
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,520
 the one who gets to mate with the female.

147
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,740
 >> Yeah, incredible.

148
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,340
 >> Is it like a moat around the female, or is it just a singular trench?

149
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,700
 >> I don't know how developed they are.

150
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,540
 >> I think it's a- >> They invented the conga,

151
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,820
 but have they invented the moat?

152
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,300
 Which is more sophisticated?

153
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,820
 >> They're like a little horseshoe.

154
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,700
 >> Okay, right. >> That go all the way around, yeah, yeah.

155
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,780
 >> Wow. >> Are they?

156
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,660
 I thought it was kind of like your own sleeping bag.

157
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,180
 You divot yourself into the ground, cuz they mate side by side, don't they?

158
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:12,400
 Well, they sort of make, she mates face down, which sounds fine each to their own.

159
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,720
 But every time, she's face down, and he's on his side, but either side, apparently.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
 So if he doesn't like the look of her, he can turn his back and

161
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,000
 mate sort of from, like, bent himself around to get to her.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,160
 But so that would be very insulting if you're, so if you're the female,

163
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,520
 you're lying down, and you can check if the male is facing you, I guess you're in.

164
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,420
 And if he's not, I think that's insulting, isn't that insulting?

165
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,300
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it seems like it.

166
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,760
 >> They sometimes, after they've mated, they'll hibernate the females,

167
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,300
 straight after they've mated.

168
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,220
 And in the hibernation part, their whole body kind of stops kind of doing stuff.

169
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,220
 So it means that the pregnancy won't really start properly for

170
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
 a little while until they wake up.

171
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,460
 And this is because what they might want to do is if they've mated with someone

172
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,020
 that isn't quite the best echidna in the area, they can hibernate and

173
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,900
 hope that someone else comes along while they're asleep.

174
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:14,020
 A bit like Snow White waiting for the Prince Charming to come and wake her up.

175
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,220
 >> I don't recall.

176
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,080
 >> It's that bit.

177
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,100
 >> [LAUGH]

178
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,980
 >> She's asleep and she just kind of half awake, she hears.

179
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,620
 >> [LAUGH]

180
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,340
 >> The dwarves all behind him, kicking their legs up.

181
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,300
 >> There's only one other mammal that we know that does this that hibernates

182
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,180
 after straight after sex, the female, and it is the Hori bat.

183
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,420
 >> How dare you.

184
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,200
 >> [LAUGH]

185
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,260
 >> That's so funny.

186
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,500
 They're remarkable for a number of reasons.

187
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,260
 They're a mammal that lays eggs, which is, it's very Australian.

188
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,540
 There's, you know, we've got- >> Very Australian?

189
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,780
 >> Well, yeah, the platypus, and then that's it.

190
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,580
 >> It's just those.

191
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,140
 >> Yeah, you know.

192
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,580
 >> But they are both only found mostly in Australia.

193
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,580
 >> Mostly in Australia.

194
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,060
 >> Well, can I just interject there?

195
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,580
 Because I think Australia gets a lot of credit for the echidna.

196
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,420
 >> Uh-huh. >> And there are four species of echidna.

197
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,060
 And one of them is in Australia.

198
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,100
 >> Yeah. >> And all the other three are in Papua New Guinea.

199
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,700
 >> Okay. >> And I just don't think the Papua New

200
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,180
 Guinea is getting as much air time.

201
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,460
 And actually, they're way cooler echidna.

202
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,100
 And I've seen the Australian one, I love it.

203
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,340
 I've stalked an echidna up on Australian Hill for a long period of time.

204
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,140
 >> For a month.

205
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,980
 >> [LAUGH]

206
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,820
 >> Where's Anagon?

207
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,100
 Just, shh, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

208
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,540
 >> She's up over there, let's move on.

209
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,820
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

210
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,300
 My fact this week is that in the 1960s, a 47-year-old man paid a 90-year-old woman

211
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,460
 2,500 francs a month so that he could own her apartment when she passed away.

212
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,620
 Unfortunately for him, she outlived him by not dying and

213
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,940
 making it to be 122 years old.

214
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,580
 >> [LAUGH]

215
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,620
 >> Imagine it.

216
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:06,540
 So this is actually quite a famous old person who has set the record for

217
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,780
 the oldest person ever.

218
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,060
 Her name was Jean Calment, and she was a French person.

219
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 You might have heard of her.

220
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,980
 And this was a deal, and this is a thing that does happen in France.

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,380
 When someone's getting a bit old, someone says, I'll pay you a certain amount.

222
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,700
 It might be the mortgage amount or the rent amount or whatever it is.

223
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,780
 And in this case, it was 2,500.

224
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,820
 And it was a guy called Andre Francois Rafferty.

225
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,460
 And he paid the money, and he kept paying and kept paying.

226
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,020
 And she kept not dying and not dying.

227
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,860
 And then he dies, she still lives.

228
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,020
 But because of the French law of what they were doing,

229
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,660
 the widow and family then have to continue paying her.

230
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,740
 >> [LAUGH]

231
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,940
 >> Yeah, the ages are incredible.

232
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,620
 It was only a few more years, wasn't it, after he died?

233
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,460
 Because in theory, if she was still alive in her 170, 180,

234
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,300
 his kids would have to have paid her as well.

235
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,180
 >> Exactly.

236
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,420
 But by the time he died, he had paid twice the apartment's market value.

237
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,020
 Like that's how much he had paid.

238
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,980
 >> That's incredible.

239
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,460
 >> He was 47 when he arranged this, and she was 90.

240
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,620
 So he would have had really good odds, he thought.

241
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,100
 But then he died at age 77, and she was still going.

242
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,060
 She was 120 at that point.

243
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,820
 >> That's just amazing.

244
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,220
 >> They're called Vigets in France.

245
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,780
 These are really interesting, kind of a mechanism of releasing.

246
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,500
 You get a lump sum, you get about a third of the cost of your home in cash.

247
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,220
 And then you get these monthly payments.

248
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,420
 But the ads for these arrangements, they come with details of the age of

249
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,100
 the person selling, so you can kind of assess it.

250
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,260
 And there was a piece about it in The Economist which said some elderly

251
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,980
 French widows looking to sell their home via this method.

252
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,540
 They've been known to light cigarettes before reviewing to imply that they

253
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,900
 have a very unhealthy lifestyle.

254
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,260
 >> And they can't be long for this world.

255
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,740
 >> That's amazing, a little bit of a sniffle, that's so cool.

256
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,260
 Yeah, she had come on, was the oldest ever movie star.

257
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,060
 She was in a movie called Vincent and Me, that way she was 114.

258
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,340
 >> Star's a strong word, isn't it, for what she did in that film?

259
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,020
 >> I suppose so.

260
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,420
 >> Would you say she was the lead role in Vincent and Me?

261
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,940
 >> It was named after her.

262
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,860
 >> Okay. >> Okay.

263
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,220
 >> You know, Vincent and Me, I went the time she supposedly met Vincent Van Gogh.

264
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,740
 And she appeared in a sort of, as a self in a later scene, right?

265
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,740
 >> Yeah, exactly.

266
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,800
 And quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song.

267
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,780
 >> Ah!

268
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,780
 >> And again, she wasn't really in it much.

269
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,980
 You just hear her going, je m'appelle, je m'commande.

270
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,020
 >> [LAUGH]

271
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,420
 >> And then another rapper just going, you're gonna hear an old lady talk.

272
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,140
 >> [LAUGH]

273
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,740
 >> Really?

274
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,100
 >> But it's, no, I was gonna say it's quite good.

275
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,020
 It's not quite good, it's quite bad.

276
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,220
 But you can listen to it online if you'd like.

277
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,660
 >> And you did genuinely claim an association with Van Gogh, didn't she?

278
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,740
 Which is quite weird.

279
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,260
 It's a bit like, you know, when you're watching Doctor Who or something, and

280
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,540
 wherever he travels in time, he always happens to land in the drawing room of

281
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,500
 the most famous person you've heard of at that time.

282
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,380
 There's Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare, or Jesus.

283
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,620
 >> Sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there.

284
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,420
 The tortoise brings him to lands that are in need, and

285
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,940
 often the most pivotal humans of their era are the people who were central to a

286
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,540
 moment where a time fracture is happening.

287
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,060
 >> He's never just helping that.

288
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,140
 >> He's never just helping thousands of peasants slowly improve their economic

289
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,940
 conditions, is he?

290
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,340
 >> No, no, no, no.

291
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,420
 >> So much like Doctor Who, Jean Calmore said that she knew

292
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,500
 Vincent Van Gogh in the 1880s.

293
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,100
 It was 1888, and he came into her family's dry goods store.

294
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,700
 I don't know if dry goods store is just something that sells anything that's not

295
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,620
 wet, but wanted to buy a canvas, and she said her father waited on him.

296
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,700
 And she described him as very ugly like a louse.

297
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,020
 >> Wow.

298
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,340
 >> Now, the big problem is that her father didn't own a dry goods store.

299
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,140
 >> That is the one slight problem with that story.

300
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,380
 Yes, her husband did, or her husband's family did, I think.

301
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,700
 >> Yeah, that's where we get into something a little bit dodgy about this story.

302
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,940
 >> Yeah, okay, first off though, before we get into it,

303
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
 when did she tell this story?

304
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,820
 Because if she was 120 at the time, I think you're allowed to fuck up a bit of

305
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,020
 timeline in your life.

306
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,540
 >> Agreed.

307
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,660
 >> Yeah, so there's a theory, isn't there?

308
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,180
 There's a theory that maybe she didn't live to 122 years old and

309
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,020
 that she didn't die in 1997, but in 1934.

310
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,700
 >> Yes.

311
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,940
 >> Yeah.

312
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,420
 >> But you would have been much younger.

313
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,260
 >> But there's a theory, I can't stress enough theory, but that her daughter had

314
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,820
 died, no, wait, her daughter hadn't died.

315
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,780
 Okay, you're all with me, great, her daughter hadn't died.

316
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:29,820
 But it was a pretend that she had, at which point, the daughter assumed the

317
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,980
 identity of her own mother, so therefore gained another 20, 30 years on the clock.

318
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,580
 And the idea was that they did it because they would have to pay tax on the

319
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,500
 inheritance when she got the house, and they thought that maybe she pretended to

320
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,580
 be her mother.

321
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,060
 There's a few problems with the theory.

322
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,940
 One, she would have had to have lived with her father as her husband for

323
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,520
 quite a few years.

324
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,620
 >> I mean, no one's checking up on their copulation levels, are they?

325
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,740
 Probably.

326
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,180
 I just think that's an easier bit to fake than when you meet your friends a week

327
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,780
 later and they go, my God, you've sort of lost 30 years.

328
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:10,260
 >> But there is one main guy who is kind of pushes this theory and he's called

329
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,220
 Nicolaj Zak.

330
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,660
 And we came, we did a gig in Nottingham yesterday and our train back was, I think,

331
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,140
 about two and a half hours.

332
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,940
 I spent the entire time talking to Nicolaj Zak.

333
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,860
 He is very keen to tell us his theories.

334
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,660
 But by the end of it, I must admit, by the time we're pulling into London, I, you

335
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,740
 know, I think, well, he has a few good points, I think.

336
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,780
 And really, like for instance, there was an interview with the family where they

337
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,580
 kept confusing Jim with her daughter, Yvonne, and they just kept getting the

338
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,540
 names wrong all the way through.

339
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,260
 >> Again, though, that's like, my mom calls me the dog's name all the time, right?

340
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,940
 Like, that's, that's a very classic thing to get a name right.

341
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,100
 >> He's a mathematician, this guy, and he used Bayesian statistics to work out the

342
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,060
 chances that this could be true.

343
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,860
 And he reckons it's well in the 10 millions to one that this is true.

344
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,620
 So that's his main bit of evidence that statistically, he doesn't think this is

345
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,420
 true.

346
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,340
 He's shown the signatures over the years, and he shows that around the 1930s,

347
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,260
 the signature changes really, really quite differently.

348
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,540
 It's kind of similar, but the T is very different and the J is very different.

349
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,380
 >> This coming from a man who we should say does change his signature every

350
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,300
 single year.

351
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,340
 >> I do do that, yeah.

352
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,700
 >> Maybe she was just taking after you.

353
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,460
 >> Only 50 years before me.

354
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
 >> That's right.

355
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,020
 Well, you know, she knew Dr. Hoopat, I don't know.

356
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,260
 But the thing is that this guy is saying, right, we have the blood of Jean Calment,

357
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,020
 right, so it's really easy to test.

358
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,020
 You can just test the blood and you'll know exactly how old she is.

359
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,940
 But the people, her family are refusing to let them do it.

360
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,140
 And they're saying they're not going to let him do that, or let anyone do that,

361
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,900
 in fact.

362
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,100
 And they always kind of say, oh, he's just working for the KGB.

363
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,420
 That's how they started.

364
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,380
 And when they realized it couldn't be that, they were like, oh, no,

365
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,980
 he's in the pocket of rich billionaires who want the secret of eternal life.

366
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,260
 So they're kind of attacking on this side.

367
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,460
 He says that he's just looking for the truth.

368
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,700
 He's not trying to prove anyone wrong.

369
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,780
 He's just trying to look for the truth.

370
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,140
 And that's my TED talk.

371
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,940
 >> Is it fair to say, so the family refusing to do it, partially a reason,

372
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:18,420
 I'm guessing, is in France, Jean Calment is quite a sort of household name to people.

373
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,580
 Like, we don't necessarily know them, know her over here, them, I thought into the theory.

374
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,220
 But she's in books, and she's part of the culture.

375
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,420
 So let's not topple this.

376
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,660
 And a lot of people supposedly don't want to touch it.

377
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,980
 >> There's a lot of enthusiasm, of course, for the idea, because it's a point of pride.

378
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,380
 I mean, she's substantially older than anyone else who's ever lived.

379
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,500
 But I should say, guys, we're not considering the other oldest person ever,

380
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,660
 old Tom Parr, who was an Englishman who lived for 152 years,

381
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,540
 between the late 15th and middle 17th centuries.

382
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,460
 And I don't know why we're not talking about it more, because he's the champ.

383
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:01,540
 >> He didn't do much, not after the age of about 130.

384
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,060
 He, this guy's clearly a fraud.

385
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,580
 >> How dare, I know, I know, he lived in Shropshire.

386
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,500
 >> You're working for the KGB, I can tell.

387
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,860
 >> He got married at the age of 80, he had a couple of children.

388
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,660
 He had an affair over the age of 100.

389
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,740
 Father, a new child with that affair.

390
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,860
 >> At the age of 100.

391
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,060
 >> I know, he remarried at age 110.

392
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,860
 He was taken to London to meet Charles I.

393
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,420
 So he was taken seriously at the time, despite the fact he was manifestly only about 80.

394
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,540
 And he was taken to London, and he died within a few weeks after being too well fed.

395
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,820
 >> I know.

396
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,380
 >> Because he had only lived on rancid cheese and hard bread.

397
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,020
 And he was taken to London and given nice food, and it was too much.

398
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,460
 >> If that was the key to living to 180, do you think you'd do it?

399
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,580
 If it was rancid cheese and hard bread all the way, I think I'd just accept 75.

400
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,460
 >> Or 45.

401
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,900
 >> But he's married at Westminster Abbey, isn't he?

402
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
 >> Let's see.

403
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,380
 >> Yeah, so he was a big deal in his day.

404
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,380
 >> Wow.

405
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,380
 >> He was a big cheese.

406
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,460
 >> Do you guys know, so there's a list on Wikipedia which gets updated all the time of world's

407
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,900
 oldest people.

408
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,580
 So how many of the people in the top 10 of the world's oldest people would you say are

409
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,580
 men?

410
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,020
 >> Oh God, no men live till anywhere.

411
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,420
 I would guess there aren't any men for hundreds.

412
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,100
 >> There's one really old Japanese guy, wasn't there?

413
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,100
 >> Yes.

414
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
 >> I'll say all 10.

415
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
 >> Yeah.

416
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,300
 >> Even though we know there shouldn't come on, it's a weapon.

417
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
 >> No, no, living.

418
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
 Currently living.

419
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,300
 >> I'm currently living.

420
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,300
 >> Currently living.

421
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,300
 >> I'm still saying all 10.

422
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
 >> Yeah.

423
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
 So Andy's the wrong one here.

424
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
 >> I've got the wrong one.

425
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
 >> No, no.

426
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
 None.

427
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
 >> None.

428
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,620
 >> Top 10 living oldest people in the world are women.

429
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:57,460
 The youngest of which is 114 years old and the closest man is a bullshit 112.

430
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,620
 So two years in between the top 10.

431
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,140
 >> Yeah, sorry, you guys are going to die young.

432
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
 I don't know.

433
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
 >> Yeah.

434
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,140
 >> I'm sad that you just learned this.

435
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,180
 >> I'll tell you again to the example of old Tom Parr in the top 152.

436
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:15,060
 >> I think the oldest person at the moment is Kanetanaka, maybe, Japanese woman.

437
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:21,740
 She is 118 years and 281 days today.

438
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,380
 But actually she was born prematurely, so it seemed a bit longer.

439
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,100
 She got pancreatic cancer when she was 45 years old and had to have surgery and then

440
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,700
 she lived on to, at time of recording, at least 118 years old.

441
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
 >> Wow.

442
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
 >> Isn't that amazing?

443
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,220
 You know the two oldest men in 2018 had exactly the same birthday and they never met, but

444
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,860
 they used to swap birthday cards every year because they thought it was funny that they

445
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
 did.

446
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,820
 And so they were both born on the same day in 1908 and then one of them sadly died in

447
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:01,300
 1919, but at almost that exact same moment, a new woman was crowned oldest woman in the

448
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,620
 UK and she too had exactly the same birthday as the oldest man.

449
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,620
 >> Really?

450
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,620
 Isn't that weird?

451
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,020
 >> Did you start sending birthday cards to her?

452
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,020
 >> I actually don't know if he did.

453
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
 You're running out of energy at 112, I suppose.

454
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:20,260
 >> They all refused their cards from the Queen because they wanted to save public funds,

455
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,860
 which is, I know, I know, as if that was going to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

456
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,740
 >> Is it that you don't get something from the Queen these days, you get it from the

457
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
 work and pension secretary?

458
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
 >> You get one from each?

459
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
 >> Yeah.

460
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,740
 >> You get one from each?

461
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,740
 So I can't remember who that is at the moment, but there was a time where you got a card from

462
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,460
 the Queen and then a card from me and Duncan Smith and that was Bleak.

463
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:47,060
 >> Happy birthday, by the way, I've declared you fit for work.

464
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:55,020
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

465
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:01,100
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that the largest hailstone in Texan history was broken up by

466
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,820
 locals and turned into margaritas.

467
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,980
 So that's pretty cool, that's a fun way, that's a fun thing to do with it.

468
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,980
 >> I think so.

469
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,980
 >> Yeah.

470
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
 >> I think that's definitely the best thing to do.

471
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,260
 >> How did they know it was the largest in Texan history?

472
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,780
 >> Well, that's a great question, Andrew.

473
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,780
 >> Okay.

474
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,260
 >> It isn't the official biggest one, but it fell in the same storm as the official

475
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,260
 biggest one.

476
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,460
 So this was earlier this year in June, there was a massive hailstorm in Texas and all of

477
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,860
 these huge hailstones came down and they managed to save one of them and this is the

478
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,900
 record one and amazingly they could use radar because it was big enough for radar to pick

479
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,540
 it up so they could see when it fell and they could see it there.

480
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,220
 But there was another social media post at the same time where people took a photo of

481
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,780
 a hailstone.

482
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,220
 You can tell by the size of the hands and by the size of the people and everything exactly

483
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,780
 how big it was, it would have been the biggest one, but we haven't been able to measure it

484
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,980
 because they thought, fuck this, let's have some margaritas.

485
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
 So cool.

486
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,220
 >> So we can't be sure it wasn't just huge people with giant hands and actually quite

487
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
 small hailstones.

488
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,540
 >> And is it right, James?

489
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,780
 I think I read this, that even the biggest one, they weren't properly able to verify

490
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,020
 it because the people put it in a fridge, but they didn't put it in a plastic bag.

491
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,020
 >> It's really hard.

492
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,020
 >> And so it shrank, right?

493
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
 >> Yeah, exactly.

494
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,420
 So whenever you want to get a record hailstone, it's really hard to kind of work out exactly

495
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,700
 how big it is because from the very second it lands, even when it's in the air, it's

496
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
 just melting.

497
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,700
 Apparently one good thing is to put athletes' foot powder on it, that stops it from melting.

498
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:37,060
 >> You've got to have such presence of mind in the middle of a hailstorm when something

499
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,900
 the size of a grapefruit has just smashed into the ground next to you to get your athletes'

500
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,820
 foot powder out.

501
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
 >> Hail is terrifying.

502
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 >> Yeah.

503
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
 >> This big stuff is.

504
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,820
 >> The big stuff is terrifying.

505
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,820
 >> Yeah.

506
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:54,620
 >> And get this, Richmond, the very place we're in tonight, was devastated 140 years ago by

507
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,620
 hail.

508
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
 >> Really?

509
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,340
 >> In 1779, there was a giant hailstorm, the stones were five inches around, which is

510
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,580
 big, circumference.

511
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:08,460
 It apparently looked like there had been a riot and the military had fired at the town.

512
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
 >> Wow.

513
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,460
 >> But that's how bad it was.

514
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,100
 There were craters in people's lawns in St. Margaret's, which is just nearby, which

515
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,420
 were three inches deep.

516
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
 >> Wow.

517
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,660
 >> Yeah, the place was absolutely destroyed by, and that's why it's such a horrible town

518
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
 today.

519
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:26,020
 >> Lovely to be here.

520
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,380
 >> That's got to be a Jonathan Creek episode.

521
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,420
 If it's not already, there's obviously been a gunman loose, everyone's been killed by

522
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,180
 bullets through the heart, and yet all the bullets have disappeared.

523
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
 >> Yes.

524
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,180
 >> What has happened?

525
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,380
 >> If you're listening, writers of that do it.

526
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,580
 >> Or actors who are in it.

527
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,580
 >> Yeah.

528
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,500
 There was one particularly bad hailstorm, which changed the course of human history,

529
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,820
 which I didn't know about.

530
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,460
 So this was Black Monday, and I really had no idea about the hailstorm.

531
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:01,820
 It was in the Hundred Years' War, so it was, I think it was in 1360, and it was the biggest

532
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:05,980
 loss of life up until that point in the Hundred Years' War, so it was Phase One of the Hundred

533
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
 Years' War.

534
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,860
 It ended Phase One, because it was so bad, and it was Edward III, who was going to war

535
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,980
 with France, as we did in the Hundred Years' War, and he was besieging the town of Chartres

536
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,980
 in France.

537
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,260
 He had an army of 10,000 people, which was like the biggest army that it ever had at

538
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
 that point.

539
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,740
 And on Easter Monday, this massive storm came, struck the camp, hailstones so large they

540
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,820
 were killing men and horses.

541
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,740
 Apparently, 1,000 men were killed, and up to 6,000 horses.

542
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
 Some from hail.

543
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
 Others from like lightening.

544
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,740
 >> What?

545
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,780
 Does this sound very like -- are we sure the French army had invented arrows made of ice

546
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
 or something like that?

547
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:47,180
 >> It could be, and they never used them again, so they didn't give away the secret.

548
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,380
 I think some people were trampled because there was a panic, some people froze to death.

549
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,900
 It had been 30 degrees in the daytime, and then suddenly at night, this hail.

550
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,700
 And Edward was so traumatised, plus he lost a tenth of his army, that he thought it was

551
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,540
 a sign from God, and he made peace with the French straight away.

552
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
 >> Yeah, absolutely.

553
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
 That would be --

554
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,420
 >> I think that could make you turn -- if you're an atheist, even, you could turn into thinking,

555
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,340
 "Fucking hell, we're on the wrong side here."

556
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
 >> Yeah.

557
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,940
 And what year did he say that was?

558
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
 >> 1360.

559
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
 >> I want to say 1360.

560
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
 >> Oh, okay.

561
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
 And he made peace.

562
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,380
 >> The Hundred Years War ended 93 years later.

563
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,180
 >> It was the end of phase one.

564
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,580
 >> Phase three, you did say phase one.

565
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
 >> I did.

566
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
 I did say phase one.

567
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,100
 There's a brief respite, and then they did get back into it.

568
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,260
 >> What happened was, Edward renounced his claim to the throne in France and said, "Oh,

569
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,100
 I don't want any more parts of France.

570
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,580
 I'll just have this little bit at the top.

571
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,060
 I won't have the rest of it."

572
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,140
 And then a few years later, he went, "Oh, maybe I'll have that bit."

573
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,140
 And the French went, "Okay, well, if the hail didn't work, we're going to have to try

574
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
 something else."

575
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
 >> Yeah.

576
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
 So more-ish, isn't it, France?

577
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,140
 >> Yeah.

578
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
 >> Like Ferrero Rocher.

579
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,980
 Have you heard of a guy called Guy Merchie?

580
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
 >> No.

581
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
 >> Okay.

582
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,460
 He, in 1938, was in a glider plane in Germany, and he was caught in a powerful updraft, right?

583
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,300
 He was carried into a storm cloud.

584
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,300
 I know.

585
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,260
 He and his four colleagues were frozen by layer after layer of ice.

586
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,860
 His four colleagues very sadly perished, but he survived.

587
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:11,540
 Now, I haven't found- I found this story in one place online where he became a giant hailstone

588
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,860
 and smashed into the ground and then came out alive.

589
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,620
 It's only in one place that I found online.

590
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,300
 So I'm suspecting he may be a bit of an old Tom Parr in this scenario, but it's such

591
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,300
 a great story.

592
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,620
 >> Well, that's the genuine story.

593
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,980
 He plummeted from the sky as an ice block and survived by-

594
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,980
 >> I believe it.

595
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,300
 >> That's the kind of shit I say on this show, I don't think.

596
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,540
 Hailstorms, it's kind of like a washing machine, isn't it?

597
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:40,460
 So it's just a secular thing that's going on inside the cloud, and it gets bigger and

598
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,140
 bigger, and the forces create the moisture that freezes, and eventually when they get

599
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,580
 too heavy, that's when they come down.

600
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,500
 And so when you get these giants, sort of in America, when you get tornadoes, it's kind

601
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
 of a similar thing.

602
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,740
 When they're ginormous, that's why in America you get these volleyball-sized hailstorms

603
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,700
 that come out of the sky.

604
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,100
 >> And why they're so damaging.

605
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,740
 So they're the worst kind of weather.

606
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,060
 They must cause more- well, no, it's a huge claim, I'm going to retract before saying it,

607
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,860
 but they cause billions of dollars worth of damage to farms, and it's because they're

608
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,380
 not cold weather, weather, they're not cold weather weather, they're hot weather weather.

609
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,960
 So you get big hailstorms in summer, which I didn't realize, and that's when all the

610
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,180
 crops are out, so they devastate all the crops.

611
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,740
 So difference between hail and sleet, thanks for asking, like you've always wondered, but

612
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,740
 the hail is made up in the cloud, like Dan says, whereas sleet is made on a cold day,

613
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,340
 the rain falls and it freezes on the way down, and hail tends to happen on like those really

614
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,140
 hot sort of monsoon storm kind of days when there's shed loads of wind stirring up the

615
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
 clouds.

616
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,660
 And so, yeah, it's in summer when all the crops are lush and growing, and the hail comes

617
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,540
 down, decimates them, and farmers are ruined by them.

618
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,740
 >> Another reason they're so dangerous, especially in America, is because they form and they

619
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
 follow roads.

620
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
 >> Not.

621
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,740
 >> Yeah.

622
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
 >> What?

623
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:05,620
 >> There was one in 2001, the tri-state's hailstorm, and it caused $1.5 billion worth of damage,

624
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,980
 and it basically followed the interstate 70 road.

625
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,300
 >> Why was it trying to get to?

626
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
 >> Wow.

627
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,060
 >> You really think God had something against you when you were just driving just ahead of

628
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,060
 the hailstorm?

629
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,060
 >> Fuck it out!

630
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,060
 What?

631
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:25,180
 >> The reason is that it's because American roads tend to go east to west or north to south,

632
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,180
 right?

633
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,380
 Also, the roads tend to follow the path of least resistance, so they tend to go around

634
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,340
 kind of hills in the long river valleys, and also so do storms.

635
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,660
 They tend to take the path of least resistance, and so you tend to find that the storms just

636
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
 follow the roads around.

637
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
 >> That's really funny.

638
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,660
 >> Isn't it cool?

639
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,100
 And of course, where do you have people living?

640
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,180
 They tend to live like the communities are on the roads, so, you know, that's why you

641
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,700
 get loads of damage for property.

642
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,980
 >> Guys, we've got to move on in a sec.

643
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,780
 >> Oh, gosh.

644
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,540
 >> We're going to do some cocktail stuff really quickly.

645
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:02,140
 Good place to go for cocktails if you are in Malmo in Sweden would be the Disgusting

646
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,140
 Food Museum.

647
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,140
 >> Which you've been to?

648
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,140
 >> Which I've been to.

649
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,420
 They emailed me the other day to say that they have a new alcohol exhibit at the Disgusting

650
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,220
 Food Museum, so they have a beer, which is 55% called End of History, which is sold in

651
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,900
 a taxidermied squirrel.

652
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,620
 They have South Korean poo wine.

653
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:30,140
 They have Icelandic sheep dung smoked whale testicle beer, which they say is actually

654
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,100
 quite nice.

655
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,780
 They say they have some popcorn liqueur from Spain, which they say that the manufacturer

656
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,980
 says it has a flavour of smooth and buttery freshly popped popcorn, but the guy who runs

657
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,460
 the museum, Samuel West, said that actually it's more like licking the popcorn and soft

658
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,580
 drink than it's in the soaked carpet of a rum-down movie theatre, but yeah, Disgusting

659
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:58,300
 Food Museum, if you are there in Malmo, it's an amazing museum, and they struggled a little

660
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,780
 bit due to COVID, so they're really struggling, but ironically, he does have another museum

661
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,740
 called the Museum of Failure, which is going great guns, and the Museum of Failure has

662
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,140
 just opened a new one in the US and another one in Taiwan, so it's absolutely amazing.

663
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,140
 >> Amazing.

664
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,500
 That's awesome.

665
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,820
 We do need to move on, guys, to our final fact.

666
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,420
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

667
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:27,220
 >> My fact this week is that the average Londoner poos out 100th of a line of cocaine every

668
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,220
 weekend.

669
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,220
 >> Wow.

670
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
 Okay.

671
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,900
 How many Londoners are there in this room?

672
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,900
 About 900?

673
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,900
 >> 900, I think.

674
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,700
 >> That's a hell of a weekend.

675
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
 >> Yeah.

676
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,260
 I guess we've got nine lines of cocaine in here, in the toilets here, if you've all

677
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,260
 been once.

678
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:51,020
 I say poos out, excretes, evacuates from their nether regions, 100th of a line of cocaine,

679
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:55,500
 and this is this really interesting bunch of data that's collected by the European Monitoring

680
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,580
 Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and what it does is it goes through the sewage systems

681
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:04,300
 of loads and loads of different cities in Europe, about 100 different cities, and it

682
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,020
 does it every year, and it sifts through and it looks at all the drug residue that's there,

683
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:14,300
 so the metabolites, the things that have been the remnants of a drug in your body.

684
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:19,060
 And for 2019, which is the last year that we have data for London, I reckon in 2020

685
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,100
 London was omitted maybe because of COVID, maybe because of Brexit, that endless either

686
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,100
 or could be either debate.

687
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:35,340
 In 2019, I read the weekend average of cocaine is 700 milligrams per day at the weekend per

688
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,380
 thousand people, which I worked out that I think that's about assuming that a line is

689
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,260
 about 10th of a gram, and I know some people are like bigger lines, some people are like

690
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:50,340
 smaller lines, assuming that it's actually about 1.4, 1.5% of a line a weekend.

691
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:54,020
 Okay, let's have a quick survey, who likes a bigger line later?

692
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,580
 Obviously, probably the average is weighted more in the direction of people who've taken

693
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,700
 cocaine, that it's not like we're all doing it, okay, but the average is being brought

694
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,100
 up by the people that are having massive binges.

695
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,500
 But it's such a cool thing to analyze, just going through sewage, finding out exactly

696
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,500
 what we've been up to.

697
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,980
 Yeah, it is amazing, and it's quite a new technology, isn't it?

698
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,300
 It's only about 20 years old, so that we've been doing this as a species, wastewater epidemiology

699
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,660
 is what it's called, and you can find diseases as well.

700
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:28,540
 So you can find COVID 10 days before an outbreak happens in terms, days and days before physical

701
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
 symptoms start appearing.

702
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,540
 Oh, wow.

703
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,220
 If you're analyzing wastewater, you will realize that something's going to happen, you can

704
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
 respond to it first.

705
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,860
 Yeah, and there was a guy who wasn't, I can't remember his name, but the person who basically

706
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,980
 invented this field of study, when COVID started to happen, you know, wrote to lots

707
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,860
 of people and said, "We've got to start looking in the sewers," because that's going to allow

708
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:49,020
 us to save loads of lives and stop COVID spreading, and only now they've actually started doing

709
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,260
 it in America, and it's already really helped, because you can kind of spot an outbreak before

710
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,380
 it properly happens, and then get your resources there.

711
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
 Amazing.

712
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:02,260
 Probably the first person to do this kind of epidemiology in wastewater was John Snow.

713
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:09,540
 That was in 1854, and that was when there was a cholera outbreak in London, and he decided,

714
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:12,900
 he realized, you'll all know this story, a lot of you will, but he realized that it was

715
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:17,260
 coming from a particular pump in SoHo, and he said, "It's coming from here, can you take

716
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
 the pump off?"

717
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,660
 And they did, and then it kind of went away.

718
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:25,620
 But even after he'd done that, he couldn't convince everyone that this was true.

719
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,060
 They saw that people had stopped getting cholera, but they thought maybe it had been a coincidence.

720
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,940
 Like, you know nothing, John Snow.

721
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,780
 Oh my gosh.

722
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,780
 We were all waiting for it.

723
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:41,340
 It was either a batter or a swing gum, it's a joke, I'll tell you the rest.

724
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,540
 Just does anyone want to know the kind of drug concentrations in the water of European

725
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
 cities?

726
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
 Sure.

727
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,540
 Yes, great.

728
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:50,420
 It's really predictable, actually.

729
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,860
 So London had the highest concentration of cocaine for one year, held the top spot 2015,

730
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,780
 and we've plummeted since then, dropped our cocaine use by a third.

731
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,540
 Well done, and well done, you lot, and Antwerp is riding very high, it's all Antwerp and

732
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:10,900
 Amsterdam really, and that's for cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, Amsterdam, like much higher

733
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,460
 than anyone else for that, and Italy, bizarrely, is at the bottom of the league for everything,

734
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,460
 Italian cities.

735
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,460
 Oh.

736
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,460
 They're not taking many drugs.

737
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
 Okay.

738
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,460
 I mean, lots of delicious pasta.

739
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,460
 The drug of choice.

740
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,540
 In Italy, you do get those people who like the penne, the short lines, and the people

741
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,620
 like spaghetti, the long lines, don't you?

742
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,500
 I do, yeah.

743
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:40,460
 But yeah, it's so fascinating how it shows how, when we use cocaine, so there is, I

744
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,460
 think there's...

745
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,580
 And again, the collective "we" being deployed here, the royal "we".

746
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,340
 I do want to make it really clear that neither I nor anyone in this room here tonight has

747
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,340
 ever touched cocaine, but we as a nation...

748
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,740
 Why are you talking so quickly?

749
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,020
 Sorry, I'm just sweating and shaking a bit.

750
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:04,580
 Yeah, it's on Sundays, there is more than twice as much cocaine in our sewers as on

751
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,580
 Wednesdays.

752
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,900
 Well, it's church, isn't it?

753
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:12,540
 You stayed kneeling down for a long time after the end of that prayer, what's going

754
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,540
 on there?

755
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,340
 It's not, it's from some of the night before, isn't it?

756
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,660
 You do your first poo the morning after.

757
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,660
 Okay.

758
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,660
 Story checks out.

759
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:29,740
 Sewage in general, I think, things we can learn from sewage, and this is a very interesting

760
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,740
 thing.

761
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,740
 There are archaeologists who study coprolites, they study fossilized poo, and a few years

762
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,100
 ago, a team from the Max Planck Institute last year, actually, they developed a cool

763
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:46,780
 AI tool, which will allow them to tell human stools from dog stools, coprolites, these are

764
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
 all fossil poo.

765
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,780
 Oh, fossil.

766
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,980
 And it's very hard to tell the two apart.

767
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,620
 It's really hard, actually, if you're studying an ancient settlement, because humans and

768
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,140
 dogs both lived there, and not to put to find a point.

769
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,060
 Usually the dog wants in a plastic bag.

770
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,860
 Yes, that's right.

771
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
 Yeah.

772
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:06,100
 But on the occasion of the day, it's not hanging from the tree, then you get, yeah, and the

773
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:11,700
 problem is that they both contain a lot of the other's DNA, not to put to find a point

774
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,540
 on it because dogs have no manners and will eat anything, and because also humans used

775
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,420
 to like to eat dogs a lot.

776
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:21,700
 So there's this complete muddle going on, but there is now, and I know you'll all have

777
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,940
 been worried about this, a diagnostic tool to help you work out which is which.

778
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,140
 And what is this going to cure cancer or anything?

779
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,740
 It's not going to cure cancer, obviously, it's a complete different field of study,

780
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,820
 but it will come handy at some point.

781
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,300
 I love that back in the day, the London Sewers, I read the story about a guy called John Hollingshead

782
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,740
 who wanted to visit one, he was a journalist, and this was in 1862, and apparently there

783
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,660
 was this thing where he was given basically a menu of the experiences that you could have

784
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:57,380
 at various bits of the sewage in the London Underground because of what was going on above

785
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,380
 it.

786
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,060
 So the menu was sort of like, would you like to go to an underground tunnel where they

787
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,220
 have the blood sewers, and the blood sewers would be, that would be running underneath

788
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,460
 the meat markets of London.

789
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,980
 So when you'd go in, it would be running with basically rivers of blood, and you could experience

790
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,180
 this weird thing that you could go in.

791
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,180
 This is the worst.

792
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,180
 Whoever has a blood speech I've ever heard.

793
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,300
 And then there was like the bakery areas where if there was a big bakery, you could go down,

794
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,700
 and because the heating that was involved in doing the baking, that would flood down

795
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,620
 into the sewers, and people who would go down there to fix it would use it kind of like

796
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,140
 a Turkish bath, you would go and it would be a steam room for you.

797
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
 No.

798
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,300
 Yeah, so it was like a, where would you like to go?

799
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,460
 Go down to enjoy it.

800
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
 Yeah.

801
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,460
 Yeah, let it go.

802
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,300
 So the sewers of London before, what was the name, Joseph Basil Jeanette?

803
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,340
 Before him, it was very dangerous and so on.

804
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:52,740
 But obviously it was also a place where people go to sleep to, you know, it was a whole different

805
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,740
 bit of London.

806
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,740
 Obviously.

807
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
 Yeah.

808
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,740
 I didn't know that.

809
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,860
 Christ, next on my hotel set is we have a steam room, and it's in the basement floor.

810
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,980
 And very careful.

811
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,220
 Have you heard of the Tanzanian toilet bat?

812
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,180
 This is incredible.

813
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:12,140
 There are these grasslands in Tanzania, which have these pit toilets, and it's just a concrete

814
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,300
 slab with a hole in the middle, and that's where you go to go to the loo, and there's

815
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,540
 an eight foot deep drop down into the pit of the loo, and unfortunately bats love living

816
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,540
 in there.

817
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,540
 Oh, right.

818
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,180
 So you will, you will sometimes get bats rocketing up past you while you're on the loo.

819
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:31,580
 And the scientist, the New York Times reported a Welsh scientist called Ligia Daward, who

820
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,140
 said, "I've had the soft leathery caress of a bat's wing against my buttocks while

821
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
 having a poo."

822
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
 Wow.

823
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,140
 Do you think that's nice?

824
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
 It's not.

825
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
 It's exciting, isn't it?

826
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:47,580
 It's exciting, but exciting and nice are two very different things.

827
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:52,300
 I think I'll go for Andrex Quilted.

828
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,660
 What do you think if you have a note, a bank note, let's say a dollar bill, but it's probably

829
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
 the same here.

830
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:04,420
 Do you think it's more likely to have cocaine on it or poo?

831
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:10,100
 Well, as we've established, they're one and the same.

832
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
 I'll say cocaine.

833
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
 Okay.

834
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
 I'll say poo.

835
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
 Andre, do you care?

836
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,500
 Again, it's difficult to, but I'll pick downside.

837
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,660
 So there are traces of cocaine, according to Dr Philip Tienow from New York School of Medicine.

838
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,420
 You get cocaine on 80% of dollar bills.

839
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,420
 What?

840
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:39,860
 The 2002 report in the Southern Medical Journal reported that 94% of dollar bills tested positive

841
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,020
 for fecal pathogens.

842
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,020
 Wow.

843
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,540
 So, the answer was poo.

844
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
 Congratulations poo.

845
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,540
 Another quiz format.

846
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:59,460
 I'm going to keep trying these quiz formats until one steps.

847
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,460
 We should wrap up, guys.

848
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,460
 Okay, that is it.

849
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,460
 That is all of our facts.

850
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,460

869
