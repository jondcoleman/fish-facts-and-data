00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.420
 >> Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.380
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Richmond.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.900
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.980
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.260
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720
 favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.040
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.480
 Starting with fact number one, that is Andy.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 My fact is that spiny anteaters only use half their penis during sex.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.140
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.320
 >> Which half?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.240
 >> The top half, yeah, yeah.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.080
 >> [LAUGH]

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.060
 >> The left or the right half, believe it or not.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.340
 The spiny anteater, so this is an animal, better known as a echidna.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.320
 And they're Australian, they're very cute little creatures.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.500
 They look sort of like- >> Like a hedgehog.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.960
 >> Weird hedgehogs basically, yeah.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
 Imagine a hedgehog, not that, but not far off.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.280
 And they have these penises which are foreheaded, which have really, really-

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.180
 >> As if they're like a forehead.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.800
 >> So, well, yeah, they've got four heads on their penises.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.940
 It's really, they are dickheads.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.960
 No, they're not, they're not, they're not, they're lovely.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.140
 So, yeah, they've got four sort of ends of the penis, but

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.400
 they only use two at any one time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.580
 It's really, it's a really, really bizarre animal, and it's either the left or

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.940
 the right, and they switch.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.200
 So, only two ends get an erection at any one time.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.240
 >> Really?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.480
 >> And do we know, it seems weird to have one side of something getting an erection

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 without taking the other side with it.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.300
 >> It's very hard to imagine how you wouldn't be dragged along.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.820
 >> Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.580
 >> I mean, if the right-hand side of your penis is erect,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.660
 you, it's, I can't imagine where else the left side is gonna be.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.380
 >> It's gonna look like your penis has had a stroke, isn't it, basically?

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.540
 >> Yeah, yeah.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.580
 >> And it probably has an erection, yeah, yeah, there we go.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.540
 Anyway, look, to steer us gently towards safe territory, they found this out in 2007.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.140
 And it was really hard to see a kid in his breeding, because they, in captivity,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 they don't really, they don't breed much.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.240
 And some scientists in Queensland led by a guy called Steve Johnston.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.800
 They inherited a male echidna, which had lived in a zoo, but

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 it had been retired from the zoo, because it kept getting erections at public

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.760
 viewing sessions.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.840
 >> That's the word, retired, being used very euphemistically, isn't it?

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.000
 If you get retired from your job because you keep getting inappropriate erections.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.120
 >> Yeah, he was just promoted to somewhere completely different when no

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.160
 members of the public would see him, he was moved back off his stuff.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.220
 >> Wow, that's great.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.980
 >> And the Me4 movement with the kidneys, right?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.440
 >> Wow.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.720
 >> [LAUGH]

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.240
 >> Yeah.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.860
 >> They were very readily, well, this particular echidna seemed very ready to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.100
 have an erection, didn't it?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.620
 It was kind of a gift from God, no one had ever seen the mate.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.580
 And then suddenly the zookeeper said they had a captive echidna which,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.220
 on handling, readily produced an erection.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.980
 And they were able to condition the echidna to have an erection to

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.120
 the point where it would ejaculate whenever they wanted to.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.560
 >> Whenever they wanted to.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.640
 >> Whenever they fancied it, which is useful,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.400
 because you also want to know about its sperm, what's in its sperm.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.840
 And so all they had to do was sort of push its abdomen.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.960
 >> How interesting.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.920
 >> It went for it.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.840
 >> One thing we know about the sperm is that they're all very cooperative.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.880
 You always think of sperm like as a swimming race where they're all fighting

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.360
 against each other.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.960
 But in this case, you get about 100 sperms at once, all kind of gather together in

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.220
 a little sphere and kind of swim.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.460
 And apparently they can swim faster because of that.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.300
 >> So that's amazing.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.460
 >> After you, no, I insist.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.980
 After you, no, please.

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.460
 >> It's like a peloton.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.700
 >> Exactly, exactly.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.060
 >> Or like in triathlon, all the swimmers often swim next to each other.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.140
 Because you get, yeah, yeah.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.340
 >> Do they swim in the shape of a giant sperm?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.660
 As in, is that a more efficient shape to swim in?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.300
 That'd be cool.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.060
 >> Would that be cool?

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.500
 >> Yeah. >> Spear-like.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.700
 >> Oh, sphere, sorry, okay, okay.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.060
 >> But I think unlike a peloton, their heads are actually cemented together

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.160
 when they swim, which I don't think is how cycling works.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.800
 Although I have not really watched cycling.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.640
 >> [LAUGH]

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.640
 >> But there's a special kind of cementing material,

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.960
 which literally joins all their heads together.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.240
 And they wag their tails as they swim along.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.040
 And yeah, they think it might be for speed, but it seems like they're not really

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.160
 sure, it's just speculation as to why on earth they're bundling up like this.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.560
 Could be that thing where I think penguins do it.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.240
 Where the person in the middle has the greatest advantage,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.520
 because they're not gonna get buffeted around by the outside.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.320
 So you just, if you go as a group, then the guy in the middle will survive.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.380
 >> It's amazing the whole sex life of the echidna seems to be shrouded in theory and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.820
 mystery.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.100
 Like we don't know, there are so many things we don't know.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.860
 Like you just said, why did they do that?

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.140
 Why are they using two penises rather than the four available ones at the time?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.180
 Also, they do this weird thing where when they're courting a female,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.780
 they form what's kind of, it's called the love train.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:06.620
 >> [LAUGH]

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.140
 >> It's basically a conga line of echidnas that just follow in a line,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.520
 the female for up to a month, and they're just behind her wherever she goes.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.120
 They're just snaking around with her.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.400
 >> That's a long conga.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.040
 >> It is a long conga, and at the end of the month,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.000
 a decision is made, which we don't know what the decision is.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.080
 Like with those theories, is it the dominant male?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.200
 Because they've noticed that kind of like a Russian doll, the biggest is at the top,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.560
 and they get smaller and smaller and smaller as they go along.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.960
 So the smallest is at the back, but we don't.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.720
 >> They sometimes have a little fight at the end.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.720
 We have seen that, whether that always happens, we're not sure.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.860
 But then also sometimes if there's two congas, two rival congas going along,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.740
 you might be doing your conga along.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.500
 But then if you go near to the other congas, sometimes you might swap to the other one.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.220
 >> Oh, really?

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.380
 >> If you fancy the head of the other conga a bit more, you might go over there.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.500
 >> Wow, does that ever happen in real conga, that there's a rival line?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.580
 And you're like, I'm gonna take everyone behind me into that line.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.060
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, what will happen is there's a conga going along, and

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.100
 then one person will go a bit too fast and someone's not paying attention.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.620
 And then suddenly that person who wasn't paying attention serves

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.640
 them right, they're the head of the conga now, and

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.880
 they have all the responsibility that entails.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.560
 >> That's so funny.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.520
 >> It would be so cool if you could hear the echidnas doing their conga line in

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.360
 Australia.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 I'd appreciate that on the outback if you just heard a little [MUSIC]

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.880
 They're coming, the echidnas are coming.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.720
 >> It does sound terrifying.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.360
 So one of the, you mentioned this fight, James, that they have.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.640
 One possible, or one way it sometimes goes, is that when the female finally says

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.000
 right, I am ready to mate, the males dig a trench and then compete by pushing

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.180
 each other out of the trench, and the last remaining echidna in the trench is

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.520
 the one who gets to mate with the female.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.740
 >> Yeah, incredible.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.340
 >> Is it like a moat around the female, or is it just a singular trench?

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.700
 >> I don't know how developed they are.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.540
 >> I think it's a- >> They invented the conga,

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.820
 but have they invented the moat?

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.300
 Which is more sophisticated?

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.820
 >> They're like a little horseshoe.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.700
 >> Okay, right. >> That go all the way around, yeah, yeah.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.780
 >> Wow. >> Are they?

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.660
 I thought it was kind of like your own sleeping bag.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.180
 You divot yourself into the ground, cuz they mate side by side, don't they?

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.400
 Well, they sort of make, she mates face down, which sounds fine each to their own.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.720
 But every time, she's face down, and he's on his side, but either side, apparently.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.800
 So if he doesn't like the look of her, he can turn his back and

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.000
 mate sort of from, like, bent himself around to get to her.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.160
 But so that would be very insulting if you're, so if you're the female,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.520
 you're lying down, and you can check if the male is facing you, I guess you're in.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.420
 And if he's not, I think that's insulting, isn't that insulting?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.300
 >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it seems like it.

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.760
 >> They sometimes, after they've mated, they'll hibernate the females,

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.300
 straight after they've mated.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:52.220
 And in the hibernation part, their whole body kind of stops kind of doing stuff.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.220
 So it means that the pregnancy won't really start properly for

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.220
 a little while until they wake up.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.460
 And this is because what they might want to do is if they've mated with someone

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.020
 that isn't quite the best echidna in the area, they can hibernate and

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.900
 hope that someone else comes along while they're asleep.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:14.020
 A bit like Snow White waiting for the Prince Charming to come and wake her up.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.220
 >> I don't recall.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.080
 >> It's that bit.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.100
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.980
 >> She's asleep and she just kind of half awake, she hears.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.620
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.340
 >> The dwarves all behind him, kicking their legs up.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.300
 >> There's only one other mammal that we know that does this that hibernates

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.180
 after straight after sex, the female, and it is the Hori bat.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.420
 >> How dare you.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.200
 >> [LAUGH]

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.260
 >> That's so funny.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.500
 They're remarkable for a number of reasons.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:47.260
 They're a mammal that lays eggs, which is, it's very Australian.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.540
 There's, you know, we've got- >> Very Australian?

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.780
 >> Well, yeah, the platypus, and then that's it.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.580
 >> It's just those.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.140
 >> Yeah, you know.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.580
 >> But they are both only found mostly in Australia.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.580
 >> Mostly in Australia.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.060
 >> Well, can I just interject there?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.580
 Because I think Australia gets a lot of credit for the echidna.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.420
 >> Uh-huh. >> And there are four species of echidna.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.060
 And one of them is in Australia.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.100
 >> Yeah. >> And all the other three are in Papua New Guinea.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.700
 >> Okay. >> And I just don't think the Papua New

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.180
 Guinea is getting as much air time.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.460
 And actually, they're way cooler echidna.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.100
 And I've seen the Australian one, I love it.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.340
 I've stalked an echidna up on Australian Hill for a long period of time.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.140
 >> For a month.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.980
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.820
 >> Where's Anagon?

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.100
 Just, shh, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.540
 >> She's up over there, let's move on.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:35.820
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:42.300
 My fact this week is that in the 1960s, a 47-year-old man paid a 90-year-old woman

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:48.460
 2,500 francs a month so that he could own her apartment when she passed away.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.620
 Unfortunately for him, she outlived him by not dying and

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.940
 making it to be 122 years old.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.580
 >> [LAUGH]

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.620
 >> Imagine it.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:06.540
 So this is actually quite a famous old person who has set the record for

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.780
 the oldest person ever.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.060
 Her name was Jean Calment, and she was a French person.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060
 You might have heard of her.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.980
 And this was a deal, and this is a thing that does happen in France.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.380
 When someone's getting a bit old, someone says, I'll pay you a certain amount.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.700
 It might be the mortgage amount or the rent amount or whatever it is.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.780
 And in this case, it was 2,500.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.820
 And it was a guy called Andre Francois Rafferty.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.460
 And he paid the money, and he kept paying and kept paying.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.020
 And she kept not dying and not dying.

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.860
 And then he dies, she still lives.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.020
 But because of the French law of what they were doing,

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.660
 the widow and family then have to continue paying her.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.740
 >> [LAUGH]

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.940
 >> Yeah, the ages are incredible.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.620
 It was only a few more years, wasn't it, after he died?

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.460
 Because in theory, if she was still alive in her 170, 180,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.300
 his kids would have to have paid her as well.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.180
 >> Exactly.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.420
 But by the time he died, he had paid twice the apartment's market value.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.020
 Like that's how much he had paid.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:03.980
 >> That's incredible.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.460
 >> He was 47 when he arranged this, and she was 90.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.620
 So he would have had really good odds, he thought.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.100
 But then he died at age 77, and she was still going.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.060
 She was 120 at that point.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.820
 >> That's just amazing.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.220
 >> They're called Vigets in France.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.780
 These are really interesting, kind of a mechanism of releasing.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.500
 You get a lump sum, you get about a third of the cost of your home in cash.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.220
 And then you get these monthly payments.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.420
 But the ads for these arrangements, they come with details of the age of

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.100
 the person selling, so you can kind of assess it.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.260
 And there was a piece about it in The Economist which said some elderly

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.980
 French widows looking to sell their home via this method.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.540
 They've been known to light cigarettes before reviewing to imply that they

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.900
 have a very unhealthy lifestyle.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.260
 >> And they can't be long for this world.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.740
 >> That's amazing, a little bit of a sniffle, that's so cool.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.260
 Yeah, she had come on, was the oldest ever movie star.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.060
 She was in a movie called Vincent and Me, that way she was 114.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.340
 >> Star's a strong word, isn't it, for what she did in that film?

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.020
 >> I suppose so.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.420
 >> Would you say she was the lead role in Vincent and Me?

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.940
 >> It was named after her.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.860
 >> Okay. >> Okay.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.220
 >> You know, Vincent and Me, I went the time she supposedly met Vincent Van Gogh.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.740
 And she appeared in a sort of, as a self in a later scene, right?

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.740
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.800
 And quite similarly, she was the oldest person ever in a rap song.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.780
 >> Ah!

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.780
 >> And again, she wasn't really in it much.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.980
 You just hear her going, je m'appelle, je m'commande.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.020
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.420
 >> And then another rapper just going, you're gonna hear an old lady talk.

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.140
 >> [LAUGH]

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.740
 >> Really?

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:36.100
 >> But it's, no, I was gonna say it's quite good.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.020
 It's not quite good, it's quite bad.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.220
 But you can listen to it online if you'd like.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.660
 >> And you did genuinely claim an association with Van Gogh, didn't she?

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.740
 Which is quite weird.

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.260
 It's a bit like, you know, when you're watching Doctor Who or something, and

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.540
 wherever he travels in time, he always happens to land in the drawing room of

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.500
 the most famous person you've heard of at that time.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.380
 There's Charles Dickens or William Shakespeare, or Jesus.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.620
 >> Sorry, I'm gonna have to stop you there.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:02.420
 The tortoise brings him to lands that are in need, and

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.940
 often the most pivotal humans of their era are the people who were central to a

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.540
 moment where a time fracture is happening.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.060
 >> He's never just helping that.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.140
 >> He's never just helping thousands of peasants slowly improve their economic

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.940
 conditions, is he?

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.340
 >> No, no, no, no.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.420
 >> So much like Doctor Who, Jean Calmore said that she knew

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.500
 Vincent Van Gogh in the 1880s.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.100
 It was 1888, and he came into her family's dry goods store.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.700
 I don't know if dry goods store is just something that sells anything that's not

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.620
 wet, but wanted to buy a canvas, and she said her father waited on him.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.700
 And she described him as very ugly like a louse.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.020
 >> Wow.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.340
 >> Now, the big problem is that her father didn't own a dry goods store.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.140
 >> That is the one slight problem with that story.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.380
 Yes, her husband did, or her husband's family did, I think.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.700
 >> Yeah, that's where we get into something a little bit dodgy about this story.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.940
 >> Yeah, okay, first off though, before we get into it,

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:53.940
 when did she tell this story?

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.820
 Because if she was 120 at the time, I think you're allowed to fuck up a bit of

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.020
 timeline in your life.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:13:59.540
 >> Agreed.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:01.660
 >> Yeah, so there's a theory, isn't there?

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.180
 There's a theory that maybe she didn't live to 122 years old and

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.020
 that she didn't die in 1997, but in 1934.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:09.700
 >> Yes.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.940
 >> Yeah.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.420
 >> But you would have been much younger.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:18.260
 >> But there's a theory, I can't stress enough theory, but that her daughter had

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.820
 died, no, wait, her daughter hadn't died.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.780
 Okay, you're all with me, great, her daughter hadn't died.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.820
 But it was a pretend that she had, at which point, the daughter assumed the

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.980
 identity of her own mother, so therefore gained another 20, 30 years on the clock.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.580
 And the idea was that they did it because they would have to pay tax on the

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:42.500
 inheritance when she got the house, and they thought that maybe she pretended to

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.580
 be her mother.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.060
 There's a few problems with the theory.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.940
 One, she would have had to have lived with her father as her husband for

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.520
 quite a few years.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.620
 >> I mean, no one's checking up on their copulation levels, are they?

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.740
 Probably.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.180
 I just think that's an easier bit to fake than when you meet your friends a week

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.780
 later and they go, my God, you've sort of lost 30 years.

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:10.260
 >> But there is one main guy who is kind of pushes this theory and he's called

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.220
 Nicolaj Zak.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.660
 And we came, we did a gig in Nottingham yesterday and our train back was, I think,

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.140
 about two and a half hours.

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.940
 I spent the entire time talking to Nicolaj Zak.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.860
 He is very keen to tell us his theories.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:29.660
 But by the end of it, I must admit, by the time we're pulling into London, I, you

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:32.740
 know, I think, well, he has a few good points, I think.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.780
 And really, like for instance, there was an interview with the family where they

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:41.580
 kept confusing Jim with her daughter, Yvonne, and they just kept getting the

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.540
 names wrong all the way through.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.260
 >> Again, though, that's like, my mom calls me the dog's name all the time, right?

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.940
 Like, that's, that's a very classic thing to get a name right.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:55.100
 >> He's a mathematician, this guy, and he used Bayesian statistics to work out the

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.060
 chances that this could be true.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.860
 And he reckons it's well in the 10 millions to one that this is true.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.620
 So that's his main bit of evidence that statistically, he doesn't think this is

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.420
 true.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.340
 He's shown the signatures over the years, and he shows that around the 1930s,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.260
 the signature changes really, really quite differently.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:17.540
 It's kind of similar, but the T is very different and the J is very different.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.380
 >> This coming from a man who we should say does change his signature every

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:21.300
 single year.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.340
 >> I do do that, yeah.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.700
 >> Maybe she was just taking after you.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.460
 >> Only 50 years before me.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.300
 >> That's right.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.020
 Well, you know, she knew Dr. Hoopat, I don't know.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:34.260
 But the thing is that this guy is saying, right, we have the blood of Jean Calment,

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.020
 right, so it's really easy to test.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.020
 You can just test the blood and you'll know exactly how old she is.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.940
 But the people, her family are refusing to let them do it.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.140
 And they're saying they're not going to let him do that, or let anyone do that,

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.900
 in fact.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.100
 And they always kind of say, oh, he's just working for the KGB.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.420
 That's how they started.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.380
 And when they realized it couldn't be that, they were like, oh, no,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.980
 he's in the pocket of rich billionaires who want the secret of eternal life.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.260
 So they're kind of attacking on this side.

00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:01.460
 He says that he's just looking for the truth.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.700
 He's not trying to prove anyone wrong.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.780
 He's just trying to look for the truth.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.140
 And that's my TED talk.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:11.940
 >> Is it fair to say, so the family refusing to do it, partially a reason,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:18.420
 I'm guessing, is in France, Jean Calment is quite a sort of household name to people.

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:24.580
 Like, we don't necessarily know them, know her over here, them, I thought into the theory.

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.220
 But she's in books, and she's part of the culture.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.420
 So let's not topple this.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.660
 And a lot of people supposedly don't want to touch it.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:36.980
 >> There's a lot of enthusiasm, of course, for the idea, because it's a point of pride.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.380
 I mean, she's substantially older than anyone else who's ever lived.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.500
 But I should say, guys, we're not considering the other oldest person ever,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.660
 old Tom Parr, who was an Englishman who lived for 152 years,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:53.540
 between the late 15th and middle 17th centuries.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.460
 And I don't know why we're not talking about it more, because he's the champ.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.540
 >> He didn't do much, not after the age of about 130.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.060
 He, this guy's clearly a fraud.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.580
 >> How dare, I know, I know, he lived in Shropshire.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:11.500
 >> You're working for the KGB, I can tell.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.860
 >> He got married at the age of 80, he had a couple of children.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.660
 He had an affair over the age of 100.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.740
 Father, a new child with that affair.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.860
 >> At the age of 100.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.060
 >> I know, he remarried at age 110.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.860
 He was taken to London to meet Charles I.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.420
 So he was taken seriously at the time, despite the fact he was manifestly only about 80.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:34.540
 And he was taken to London, and he died within a few weeks after being too well fed.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.820
 >> I know.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.380
 >> Because he had only lived on rancid cheese and hard bread.

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.020
 And he was taken to London and given nice food, and it was too much.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.460
 >> If that was the key to living to 180, do you think you'd do it?

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.580
 If it was rancid cheese and hard bread all the way, I think I'd just accept 75.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.460
 >> Or 45.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.900
 >> But he's married at Westminster Abbey, isn't he?

00:18:58.900 --> 00:18:59.900
 >> Let's see.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.380
 >> Yeah, so he was a big deal in his day.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:03.380
 >> Wow.

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.380
 >> He was a big cheese.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:11.460
 >> Do you guys know, so there's a list on Wikipedia which gets updated all the time of world's

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.900
 oldest people.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:19.580
 So how many of the people in the top 10 of the world's oldest people would you say are

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.580
 men?

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:23.020
 >> Oh God, no men live till anywhere.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.420
 I would guess there aren't any men for hundreds.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.100
 >> There's one really old Japanese guy, wasn't there?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.100
 >> Yes.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.100
 >> I'll say all 10.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.100
 >> Yeah.

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.300
 >> Even though we know there shouldn't come on, it's a weapon.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.300
 >> No, no, living.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.300
 Currently living.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:39.300
 >> I'm currently living.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.300
 >> Currently living.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.300
 >> I'm still saying all 10.

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.300
 >> Yeah.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.300
 So Andy's the wrong one here.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.300
 >> I've got the wrong one.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.300
 >> No, no.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.300
 None.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.300
 >> None.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.620
 >> Top 10 living oldest people in the world are women.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:57.460
 The youngest of which is 114 years old and the closest man is a bullshit 112.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.620
 So two years in between the top 10.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.140
 >> Yeah, sorry, you guys are going to die young.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.140
 I don't know.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.140
 >> Yeah.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.140
 >> I'm sad that you just learned this.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.180
 >> I'll tell you again to the example of old Tom Parr in the top 152.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:15.060
 >> I think the oldest person at the moment is Kanetanaka, maybe, Japanese woman.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:21.740
 She is 118 years and 281 days today.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.380
 But actually she was born prematurely, so it seemed a bit longer.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:33.100
 She got pancreatic cancer when she was 45 years old and had to have surgery and then

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.700
 she lived on to, at time of recording, at least 118 years old.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.700
 >> Wow.

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:39.700
 >> Isn't that amazing?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:46.220
 You know the two oldest men in 2018 had exactly the same birthday and they never met, but

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.860
 they used to swap birthday cards every year because they thought it was funny that they

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:50.860
 did.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.820
 And so they were both born on the same day in 1908 and then one of them sadly died in

00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.300
 1919, but at almost that exact same moment, a new woman was crowned oldest woman in the

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.620
 UK and she too had exactly the same birthday as the oldest man.

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.620
 >> Really?

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.620
 Isn't that weird?

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.020
 >> Did you start sending birthday cards to her?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:11.020
 >> I actually don't know if he did.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.020
 You're running out of energy at 112, I suppose.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:20.260
 >> They all refused their cards from the Queen because they wanted to save public funds,

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:26.860
 which is, I know, I know, as if that was going to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.740
 >> Is it that you don't get something from the Queen these days, you get it from the

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.740
 work and pension secretary?

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.740
 >> You get one from each?

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.740
 >> Yeah.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.740
 >> You get one from each?

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.740
 So I can't remember who that is at the moment, but there was a time where you got a card from

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.460
 the Queen and then a card from me and Duncan Smith and that was Bleak.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:47.060
 >> Happy birthday, by the way, I've declared you fit for work.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:55.020
 >> Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is James.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:01.100
 >> Okay, my fact this week is that the largest hailstone in Texan history was broken up by

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.820
 locals and turned into margaritas.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.980
 So that's pretty cool, that's a fun way, that's a fun thing to do with it.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:10.980
 >> I think so.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.980
 >> Yeah.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:12.980
 >> I think that's definitely the best thing to do.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:15.260
 >> How did they know it was the largest in Texan history?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.780
 >> Well, that's a great question, Andrew.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.780
 >> Okay.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.260
 >> It isn't the official biggest one, but it fell in the same storm as the official

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.260
 biggest one.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:30.460
 So this was earlier this year in June, there was a massive hailstorm in Texas and all of

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.860
 these huge hailstones came down and they managed to save one of them and this is the

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.900
 record one and amazingly they could use radar because it was big enough for radar to pick

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.540
 it up so they could see when it fell and they could see it there.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.220
 But there was another social media post at the same time where people took a photo of

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.780
 a hailstone.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:53.220
 You can tell by the size of the hands and by the size of the people and everything exactly

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.780
 how big it was, it would have been the biggest one, but we haven't been able to measure it

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:59.980
 because they thought, fuck this, let's have some margaritas.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980
 So cool.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.220
 >> So we can't be sure it wasn't just huge people with giant hands and actually quite

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.220
 small hailstones.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.540
 >> And is it right, James?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.780
 I think I read this, that even the biggest one, they weren't properly able to verify

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.020
 it because the people put it in a fridge, but they didn't put it in a plastic bag.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.020
 >> It's really hard.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.020
 >> And so it shrank, right?

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.020
 >> Yeah, exactly.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.420
 So whenever you want to get a record hailstone, it's really hard to kind of work out exactly

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.700
 how big it is because from the very second it lands, even when it's in the air, it's

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.700
 just melting.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.700
 Apparently one good thing is to put athletes' foot powder on it, that stops it from melting.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.060
 >> You've got to have such presence of mind in the middle of a hailstorm when something

00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.900
 the size of a grapefruit has just smashed into the ground next to you to get your athletes'

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.820
 foot powder out.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.820
 >> Hail is terrifying.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.820
 >> Yeah.

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.820
 >> This big stuff is.

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.820
 >> The big stuff is terrifying.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.820
 >> Yeah.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:54.620
 >> And get this, Richmond, the very place we're in tonight, was devastated 140 years ago by

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:55.620
 hail.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:56.620
 >> Really?

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:02.340
 >> In 1779, there was a giant hailstorm, the stones were five inches around, which is

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.580
 big, circumference.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.460
 It apparently looked like there had been a riot and the military had fired at the town.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.460
 >> Wow.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:10.460
 >> But that's how bad it was.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.100
 There were craters in people's lawns in St. Margaret's, which is just nearby, which

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.420
 were three inches deep.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.420
 >> Wow.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:21.660
 >> Yeah, the place was absolutely destroyed by, and that's why it's such a horrible town

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.660
 today.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:26.020
 >> Lovely to be here.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.380
 >> That's got to be a Jonathan Creek episode.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.420
 If it's not already, there's obviously been a gunman loose, everyone's been killed by

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.180
 bullets through the heart, and yet all the bullets have disappeared.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.180
 >> Yes.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.180
 >> What has happened?

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:40.380
 >> If you're listening, writers of that do it.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.580
 >> Or actors who are in it.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.580
 >> Yeah.

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:48.500
 There was one particularly bad hailstorm, which changed the course of human history,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.820
 which I didn't know about.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.460
 So this was Black Monday, and I really had no idea about the hailstorm.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:01.820
 It was in the Hundred Years' War, so it was, I think it was in 1360, and it was the biggest

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.980
 loss of life up until that point in the Hundred Years' War, so it was Phase One of the Hundred

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:06.980
 Years' War.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:11.860
 It ended Phase One, because it was so bad, and it was Edward III, who was going to war

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:16.980
 with France, as we did in the Hundred Years' War, and he was besieging the town of Chartres

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.980
 in France.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.260
 He had an army of 10,000 people, which was like the biggest army that it ever had at

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.260
 that point.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:27.740
 And on Easter Monday, this massive storm came, struck the camp, hailstones so large they

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.820
 were killing men and horses.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:35.740
 Apparently, 1,000 men were killed, and up to 6,000 horses.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.740
 Some from hail.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.740
 Others from like lightening.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.740
 >> What?

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.780
 Does this sound very like -- are we sure the French army had invented arrows made of ice

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.780
 or something like that?

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:47.180
 >> It could be, and they never used them again, so they didn't give away the secret.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.380
 I think some people were trampled because there was a panic, some people froze to death.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.900
 It had been 30 degrees in the daytime, and then suddenly at night, this hail.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.700
 And Edward was so traumatised, plus he lost a tenth of his army, that he thought it was

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.540
 a sign from God, and he made peace with the French straight away.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.540
 >> Yeah, absolutely.

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.540
 That would be --

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.420
 >> I think that could make you turn -- if you're an atheist, even, you could turn into thinking,

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.340
 "Fucking hell, we're on the wrong side here."

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.340
 >> Yeah.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.940
 And what year did he say that was?

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:11.940
 >> 1360.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:12.940
 >> I want to say 1360.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:13.940
 >> Oh, okay.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.940
 And he made peace.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.380
 >> The Hundred Years War ended 93 years later.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.180
 >> It was the end of phase one.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.580
 >> Phase three, you did say phase one.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.580
 >> I did.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580
 I did say phase one.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.100
 There's a brief respite, and then they did get back into it.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.260
 >> What happened was, Edward renounced his claim to the throne in France and said, "Oh,

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.100
 I don't want any more parts of France.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.580
 I'll just have this little bit at the top.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.060
 I won't have the rest of it."

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.140
 And then a few years later, he went, "Oh, maybe I'll have that bit."

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.140
 And the French went, "Okay, well, if the hail didn't work, we're going to have to try

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.140
 something else."

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140
 >> Yeah.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.140
 So more-ish, isn't it, France?

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.140
 >> Yeah.

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.140
 >> Like Ferrero Rocher.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.980
 Have you heard of a guy called Guy Merchie?

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.980
 >> No.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.980
 >> Okay.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:56.460
 He, in 1938, was in a glider plane in Germany, and he was caught in a powerful updraft, right?

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.300
 He was carried into a storm cloud.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.300
 I know.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.260
 He and his four colleagues were frozen by layer after layer of ice.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.860
 His four colleagues very sadly perished, but he survived.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:11.540
 Now, I haven't found- I found this story in one place online where he became a giant hailstone

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.860
 and smashed into the ground and then came out alive.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.620
 It's only in one place that I found online.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:21.300
 So I'm suspecting he may be a bit of an old Tom Parr in this scenario, but it's such

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.300
 a great story.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.620
 >> Well, that's the genuine story.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.980
 He plummeted from the sky as an ice block and survived by-

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:28.980
 >> I believe it.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.300
 >> That's the kind of shit I say on this show, I don't think.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:36.540
 Hailstorms, it's kind of like a washing machine, isn't it?

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:40.460
 So it's just a secular thing that's going on inside the cloud, and it gets bigger and

00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:45.140
 bigger, and the forces create the moisture that freezes, and eventually when they get

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.580
 too heavy, that's when they come down.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:51.500
 And so when you get these giants, sort of in America, when you get tornadoes, it's kind

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.500
 of a similar thing.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.740
 When they're ginormous, that's why in America you get these volleyball-sized hailstorms

00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:58.700
 that come out of the sky.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:01.100
 >> And why they're so damaging.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.740
 So they're the worst kind of weather.

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:06.060
 They must cause more- well, no, it's a huge claim, I'm going to retract before saying it,

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:10.860
 but they cause billions of dollars worth of damage to farms, and it's because they're

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:16.380
 not cold weather, weather, they're not cold weather weather, they're hot weather weather.

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.960
 So you get big hailstorms in summer, which I didn't realize, and that's when all the

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.180
 crops are out, so they devastate all the crops.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:26.740
 So difference between hail and sleet, thanks for asking, like you've always wondered, but

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.740
 the hail is made up in the cloud, like Dan says, whereas sleet is made on a cold day,

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:36.340
 the rain falls and it freezes on the way down, and hail tends to happen on like those really

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.140
 hot sort of monsoon storm kind of days when there's shed loads of wind stirring up the

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.140
 clouds.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.660
 And so, yeah, it's in summer when all the crops are lush and growing, and the hail comes

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.540
 down, decimates them, and farmers are ruined by them.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:54.740
 >> Another reason they're so dangerous, especially in America, is because they form and they

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.740
 follow roads.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740
 >> Not.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.740
 >> Yeah.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.740
 >> What?

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:05.620
 >> There was one in 2001, the tri-state's hailstorm, and it caused $1.5 billion worth of damage,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.980
 and it basically followed the interstate 70 road.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.300
 >> Why was it trying to get to?

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.300
 >> Wow.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:16.060
 >> You really think God had something against you when you were just driving just ahead of

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.060
 the hailstorm?

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.060
 >> Fuck it out!

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.060
 What?

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:25.180
 >> The reason is that it's because American roads tend to go east to west or north to south,

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.180
 right?

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:31.380
 Also, the roads tend to follow the path of least resistance, so they tend to go around

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.340
 kind of hills in the long river valleys, and also so do storms.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.660
 They tend to take the path of least resistance, and so you tend to find that the storms just

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.660
 follow the roads around.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.660
 >> That's really funny.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.660
 >> Isn't it cool?

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.100
 And of course, where do you have people living?

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.180
 They tend to live like the communities are on the roads, so, you know, that's why you

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.700
 get loads of damage for property.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.980
 >> Guys, we've got to move on in a sec.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.780
 >> Oh, gosh.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.540
 >> We're going to do some cocktail stuff really quickly.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:02.140
 Good place to go for cocktails if you are in Malmo in Sweden would be the Disgusting

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.140
 Food Museum.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:04.140
 >> Which you've been to?

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.140
 >> Which I've been to.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.420
 They emailed me the other day to say that they have a new alcohol exhibit at the Disgusting

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:15.220
 Food Museum, so they have a beer, which is 55% called End of History, which is sold in

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.900
 a taxidermied squirrel.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.620
 They have South Korean poo wine.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:30.140
 They have Icelandic sheep dung smoked whale testicle beer, which they say is actually

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.100
 quite nice.

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.780
 They say they have some popcorn liqueur from Spain, which they say that the manufacturer

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:42.980
 says it has a flavour of smooth and buttery freshly popped popcorn, but the guy who runs

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:47.460
 the museum, Samuel West, said that actually it's more like licking the popcorn and soft

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:53.580
 drink than it's in the soaked carpet of a rum-down movie theatre, but yeah, Disgusting

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.300
 Food Museum, if you are there in Malmo, it's an amazing museum, and they struggled a little

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.780
 bit due to COVID, so they're really struggling, but ironically, he does have another museum

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.740
 called the Museum of Failure, which is going great guns, and the Museum of Failure has

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.140
 just opened a new one in the US and another one in Taiwan, so it's absolutely amazing.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.140
 >> Amazing.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.500
 That's awesome.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.820
 We do need to move on, guys, to our final fact.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:21.420
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Anna.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:27.220
 >> My fact this week is that the average Londoner poos out 100th of a line of cocaine every

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.220
 weekend.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.220
 >> Wow.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.220
 Okay.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.900
 How many Londoners are there in this room?

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.900
 About 900?

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.900
 >> 900, I think.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.700
 >> That's a hell of a weekend.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:36.700
 >> Yeah.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:41.260
 I guess we've got nine lines of cocaine in here, in the toilets here, if you've all

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.260
 been once.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:51.020
 I say poos out, excretes, evacuates from their nether regions, 100th of a line of cocaine,

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:55.500
 and this is this really interesting bunch of data that's collected by the European Monitoring

00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:00.580
 Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and what it does is it goes through the sewage systems

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:04.300
 of loads and loads of different cities in Europe, about 100 different cities, and it

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.020
 does it every year, and it sifts through and it looks at all the drug residue that's there,

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:14.300
 so the metabolites, the things that have been the remnants of a drug in your body.

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:19.060
 And for 2019, which is the last year that we have data for London, I reckon in 2020

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:24.100
 London was omitted maybe because of COVID, maybe because of Brexit, that endless either

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.100
 or could be either debate.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:35.340
 In 2019, I read the weekend average of cocaine is 700 milligrams per day at the weekend per

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:40.380
 thousand people, which I worked out that I think that's about assuming that a line is

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.260
 about 10th of a gram, and I know some people are like bigger lines, some people are like

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:50.340
 smaller lines, assuming that it's actually about 1.4, 1.5% of a line a weekend.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:54.020
 Okay, let's have a quick survey, who likes a bigger line later?

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:59.580
 Obviously, probably the average is weighted more in the direction of people who've taken

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.700
 cocaine, that it's not like we're all doing it, okay, but the average is being brought

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.100
 up by the people that are having massive binges.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.500
 But it's such a cool thing to analyze, just going through sewage, finding out exactly

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:10.500
 what we've been up to.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.980
 Yeah, it is amazing, and it's quite a new technology, isn't it?

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.300
 It's only about 20 years old, so that we've been doing this as a species, wastewater epidemiology

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.660
 is what it's called, and you can find diseases as well.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:28.540
 So you can find COVID 10 days before an outbreak happens in terms, days and days before physical

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.540
 symptoms start appearing.

00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:30.540
 Oh, wow.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.220
 If you're analyzing wastewater, you will realize that something's going to happen, you can

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.220
 respond to it first.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:36.860
 Yeah, and there was a guy who wasn't, I can't remember his name, but the person who basically

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.980
 invented this field of study, when COVID started to happen, you know, wrote to lots

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.860
 of people and said, "We've got to start looking in the sewers," because that's going to allow

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.020
 us to save loads of lives and stop COVID spreading, and only now they've actually started doing

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.260
 it in America, and it's already really helped, because you can kind of spot an outbreak before

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.380
 it properly happens, and then get your resources there.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.380
 Amazing.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:02.260
 Probably the first person to do this kind of epidemiology in wastewater was John Snow.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:09.540
 That was in 1854, and that was when there was a cholera outbreak in London, and he decided,

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.900
 he realized, you'll all know this story, a lot of you will, but he realized that it was

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:17.260
 coming from a particular pump in SoHo, and he said, "It's coming from here, can you take

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.260
 the pump off?"

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.660
 And they did, and then it kind of went away.

00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:25.620
 But even after he'd done that, he couldn't convince everyone that this was true.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.060
 They saw that people had stopped getting cholera, but they thought maybe it had been a coincidence.

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:31.940
 Like, you know nothing, John Snow.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.780
 Oh my gosh.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.780
 We were all waiting for it.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:41.340
 It was either a batter or a swing gum, it's a joke, I'll tell you the rest.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.540
 Just does anyone want to know the kind of drug concentrations in the water of European

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.540
 cities?

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.540
 Sure.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.540
 Yes, great.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:50.420
 It's really predictable, actually.

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.860
 So London had the highest concentration of cocaine for one year, held the top spot 2015,

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:58.780
 and we've plummeted since then, dropped our cocaine use by a third.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:04.540
 Well done, and well done, you lot, and Antwerp is riding very high, it's all Antwerp and

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:10.900
 Amsterdam really, and that's for cocaine, MDMA, cannabis, Amsterdam, like much higher

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:15.460
 than anyone else for that, and Italy, bizarrely, is at the bottom of the league for everything,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.460
 Italian cities.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.460
 Oh.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.460
 They're not taking many drugs.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.460
 Okay.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.460
 I mean, lots of delicious pasta.

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.460
 The drug of choice.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:28.540
 In Italy, you do get those people who like the penne, the short lines, and the people

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.620
 like spaghetti, the long lines, don't you?

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.500
 I do, yeah.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:40.460
 But yeah, it's so fascinating how it shows how, when we use cocaine, so there is, I

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:41.460
 think there's...

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.580
 And again, the collective "we" being deployed here, the royal "we".

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:48.340
 I do want to make it really clear that neither I nor anyone in this room here tonight has

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.340
 ever touched cocaine, but we as a nation...

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.740
 Why are you talking so quickly?

00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:00.020
 Sorry, I'm just sweating and shaking a bit.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.580
 Yeah, it's on Sundays, there is more than twice as much cocaine in our sewers as on

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:05.580
 Wednesdays.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.900
 Well, it's church, isn't it?

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:12.540
 You stayed kneeling down for a long time after the end of that prayer, what's going

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.540
 on there?

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:16.340
 It's not, it's from some of the night before, isn't it?

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.660
 You do your first poo the morning after.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:19.660
 Okay.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.660
 Story checks out.

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:29.740
 Sewage in general, I think, things we can learn from sewage, and this is a very interesting

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:30.740
 thing.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:35.740
 There are archaeologists who study coprolites, they study fossilized poo, and a few years

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:40.100
 ago, a team from the Max Planck Institute last year, actually, they developed a cool

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:46.780
 AI tool, which will allow them to tell human stools from dog stools, coprolites, these are

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:47.780
 all fossil poo.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.780
 Oh, fossil.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.980
 And it's very hard to tell the two apart.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.620
 It's really hard, actually, if you're studying an ancient settlement, because humans and

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.140
 dogs both lived there, and not to put to find a point.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.060
 Usually the dog wants in a plastic bag.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.860
 Yes, that's right.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:01.860
 Yeah.

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.100
 But on the occasion of the day, it's not hanging from the tree, then you get, yeah, and the

00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.700
 problem is that they both contain a lot of the other's DNA, not to put to find a point

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.540
 on it because dogs have no manners and will eat anything, and because also humans used

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.420
 to like to eat dogs a lot.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.700
 So there's this complete muddle going on, but there is now, and I know you'll all have

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.940
 been worried about this, a diagnostic tool to help you work out which is which.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.140
 And what is this going to cure cancer or anything?

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.740
 It's not going to cure cancer, obviously, it's a complete different field of study,

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.820
 but it will come handy at some point.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:40.300
 I love that back in the day, the London Sewers, I read the story about a guy called John Hollingshead

00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:45.740
 who wanted to visit one, he was a journalist, and this was in 1862, and apparently there

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:51.660
 was this thing where he was given basically a menu of the experiences that you could have

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:57.380
 at various bits of the sewage in the London Underground because of what was going on above

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:58.380
 it.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:03.060
 So the menu was sort of like, would you like to go to an underground tunnel where they

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:07.220
 have the blood sewers, and the blood sewers would be, that would be running underneath

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:09.460
 the meat markets of London.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.980
 So when you'd go in, it would be running with basically rivers of blood, and you could experience

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:16.180
 this weird thing that you could go in.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.180
 This is the worst.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180
 Whoever has a blood speech I've ever heard.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:23.300
 And then there was like the bakery areas where if there was a big bakery, you could go down,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.700
 and because the heating that was involved in doing the baking, that would flood down

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.620
 into the sewers, and people who would go down there to fix it would use it kind of like

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:35.140
 a Turkish bath, you would go and it would be a steam room for you.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140
 No.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.300
 Yeah, so it was like a, where would you like to go?

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.460
 Go down to enjoy it.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:39.460
 Yeah.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.460
 Yeah, let it go.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:45.300
 So the sewers of London before, what was the name, Joseph Basil Jeanette?

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.340
 Before him, it was very dangerous and so on.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:52.740
 But obviously it was also a place where people go to sleep to, you know, it was a whole different

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.740
 bit of London.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.740
 Obviously.

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.740
 Yeah.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:56.740
 I didn't know that.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.860
 Christ, next on my hotel set is we have a steam room, and it's in the basement floor.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.980
 And very careful.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.220
 Have you heard of the Tanzanian toilet bat?

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.180
 This is incredible.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:12.140
 There are these grasslands in Tanzania, which have these pit toilets, and it's just a concrete

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.300
 slab with a hole in the middle, and that's where you go to go to the loo, and there's

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.540
 an eight foot deep drop down into the pit of the loo, and unfortunately bats love living

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:21.540
 in there.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.540
 Oh, right.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.180
 So you will, you will sometimes get bats rocketing up past you while you're on the loo.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.580
 And the scientist, the New York Times reported a Welsh scientist called Ligia Daward, who

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:36.140
 said, "I've had the soft leathery caress of a bat's wing against my buttocks while

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.140
 having a poo."

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.140
 Wow.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.140
 Do you think that's nice?

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.140
 It's not.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140
 It's exciting, isn't it?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.580
 It's exciting, but exciting and nice are two very different things.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.300
 I think I'll go for Andrex Quilted.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:58.660
 What do you think if you have a note, a bank note, let's say a dollar bill, but it's probably

00:39:58.660 --> 00:39:59.660
 the same here.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:04.420
 Do you think it's more likely to have cocaine on it or poo?

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:10.100
 Well, as we've established, they're one and the same.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.100
 I'll say cocaine.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:14.100
 Okay.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:15.100
 I'll say poo.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.100
 Andre, do you care?

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.500
 Again, it's difficult to, but I'll pick downside.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:28.660
 So there are traces of cocaine, according to Dr Philip Tienow from New York School of Medicine.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.420
 You get cocaine on 80% of dollar bills.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.420
 What?

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:39.860
 The 2002 report in the Southern Medical Journal reported that 94% of dollar bills tested positive

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:42.020
 for fecal pathogens.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.020
 Wow.

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.540
 So, the answer was poo.

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.540
 Congratulations poo.

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540
 Another quiz format.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:59.460
 I'm going to keep trying these quiz formats until one steps.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:00.460
 We should wrap up, guys.

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.460
 Okay, that is it.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:02.460
 That is all of our facts.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:04.460
