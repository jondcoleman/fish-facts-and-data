00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:12.020
 - Hi.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.320
 - Right, let's do some emails.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.400
 (laughing)

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 - No wasting time on it.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.240
 - Awesome.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.320
 - Let's trim the fat so we can have more emails.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.160
 - Great idea.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.200
 - But if you are listening to this,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.760
 and it's your first time, this is Drop As A Line,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.360
 we talk about your facts.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.400
 - You're spiling it now.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.240
 - You're right.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.080
 - Commit.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.640
 - Let's start again.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.860
 - Hi.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
 - All right, let's do it.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.840
 (laughing)

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 - What would you like?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.000
 First of all, you can have a bonus info,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 you can have a bonus fact, or you can have a complaint.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.560
 - What happened to the excellent new names for the wall?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.400
 - Yeah.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.240
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.080
 - I've been ditched.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.560
 - No, no, no, no, actually of the week,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.080
 that's bonus info, but it's bonus info

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.280
 that's correcting us in a slightly finicky way,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 or you can have you get yourself off the hook,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.400
 which is the correction one.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.840
 - Well, I think we've just finished quite a long recording.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.680
 I feel like a nice fact.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.280
 - Lovely, okay, here we go.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.800
 This is a fact phrased in a QI format of a question, lovely.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.640
 In which month in the UK is the longest day?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.480
 - July.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.160
 - April.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.520
 - The day when the clocks go back off.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.360
 - Is that actually?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.200
 - October.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.680
 25 hours, the clocks go back.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.800
 You've got 25 hours to play with.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.560
 - That's good, that's good.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.120
 - That's Chris Boot, I should say.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.000
 - That's not an interesting fact, though.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.440
 That's just a trick question.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.360
 James asked for an interesting fact.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.160
 - Okay, some mutant ears broke out.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.120
 - I think, cool, I think they weren't

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.280
 operating within the remit.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 - No, fair enough, fair enough, all right.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.640
 - That's a good question, though.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.280
 - Yeah, I like it.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.560
 - I think it's quite a good fact, isn't it?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 - I'd like to say this is the longest day of the year.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.440
 - No, that's not, 'cause everyone knows

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.800
 that that happened, that's just a trick question.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.640
 - I see.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.320
 - You know, you're not like, oh wow, really,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.920
 did the clocks go back in October?

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.400
 - No, but did you ever think of 25 hours?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.240
 Is the point of it?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.080
 - I don't think you did, Anna.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.920
 Otherwise you would have said--

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 - But it's not an interesting fact.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.720
 - Isn't it?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 - It's a clever question.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.520
 - She's just feeling sad 'cause she didn't get the answer.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.360
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.240
 Anna, maybe, you know, just think more out there, you know.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080
 - Okay, sorry.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.400
 - All right, well, let's have a fact

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.120
 about the old mill in Kennewood.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.960
 - Brilliant.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.800
 - We spoke about this, which is the ride

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.240
 where you'd have the plastic bats.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.840
 - Yeah, it was like a tunnel of love, wasn't it?

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.680
 - Bingo.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.080
 - And people would make out there and, yeah.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.520
 - Also, the paddles to whack the bums.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 - Exactly, yes.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.400
 - People having sex.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.240
 - Yes.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.400
 - We really dragged out the explanation of that fact.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.040
 We all had a go, we all played.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
 - And that's it for this week's Bob's Alive.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.480
 We'll see you next time.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.880
 Chris Messer writes,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.200
 - Yeah.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.200
 - I live in New York, but grew up in Appalachia,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
 and Kennewood was a big destination for the area.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360
 The community I grew up in was relatively far away

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.200
 from Kennewood, enough so that we wouldn't be hip

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.440
 to any of the CD law, per se.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.320
 And still, the old mill was infamous in my community.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.880
 People were always making out on it,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.840
 and very scandalously, in middle school,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.280
 two of my classmates' reputations were absolutely shattered

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.640
 because of the quite adult behavior

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.160
 they engaged in on the ride.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.680
 Brackets, we call it third base in America.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.520
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.840
 - We call it third base in the UK too.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.720
 - But do we think we've got that from America?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.200
 No, it's rounders.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.120
 (all laughing)

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.960
 - And he goes on, this is the first thing I thought of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.760
 when a smutty amusement park ride was mentioned,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 and I was delighted to find out it was the same

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760
 weird smelly old ride from 1901.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.080
 (all laughing)

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.800
 I had no inkling that anyone besides the horny kids

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.400
 from my tiny coal mining town near West Virginia

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.440
 got down like that, but it was a known activity to us.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.760
 You go on the old mill to fool around.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.520
 And he says, he just adds a bit of clarification.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.560
 This is the bonus detail.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.400
 There is nothing romantic about the ride.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.840
 It is a facsimile of perhaps the least sexy place

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480
 you could imagine, a haunted lumber mill.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.800
 It is full of ghosts, skeletons, spiders, logs,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.640
 and the whole place.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.480
 - Do you not think a haunted lumber mill is quite sexy?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320
 - I didn't think it was sexy.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.480
 - Like, on our honeymoon, my wife and I went

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.320
 to a haunted hotel, like, deliberately,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.480
 because it was haunted.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.520
 - Mmm.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.360
 - Oh, yes.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.480
 Wasn't that haunted by the guy who was a,

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.960
 he brought all the chihuahuas across the,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.040
 no, the sausage dogs?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.880
 No, Andy, you had a dog.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.240
 - It was called the drover's inn.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.080
 - Yeah, the drover's inn.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.360
 It was the ghost of a guy who was at one of the places

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.440
 where these dogs were just went off on their own

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.520
 and had bar tabs. - The corgis.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.360
 - The corgis.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.120
 - Corgis who used to arrive at the pub

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.960
 a day before their master.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.800
 - Without their master.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.560
 - So anyway, I think haunted things can be sexy.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.440
 - Me too, it's dark, there are property candles,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.800
 there's a lot of wood, it's a lumber.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.640
 - Completely.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.240
 I'll just give you Chris's description of it

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.120
 and see if you still find it as sexy.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.560
 - It is full of ghosts, skeletons, spiders, logs,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.200
 and the whole place smells like mildew.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.520
 - Yummy.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.640
 - Mildew.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.760
 - I actually don't really know what mildew smells like.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.600
 - Yeah, what is mildew?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.440
 - It's just that kind of mould.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.440
 - Mould, it's a kind of mould.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.760
 - Oh, it sounds like your kind of place.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.920
 - I like moss not mould.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.040
 - Is moss and mould not pretty much similar?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.200
 - Dude, are you kidding?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.040
 - No.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.880
 - Are you joking?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.360
 - I thought that was like a subspecies of mould.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.920
 - Do you get people growing moss in their walls

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.560
 when it's a bit damp in winter?

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.360
 - I just thought it was part of the same family.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.440
 - Dude, it's like you haven't paid attention

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.120
 to multiple space, but I can't see a thing.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.600
 - Well, so it has no connection.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.960
 Mould and moss are just completely separate.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.120
 - The things that grow.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.960
 - Yeah.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.800
 - Well, there we go.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.640
 There's a starting point.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.680
 - The parts of different kingdoms.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.480
 - Okay, they're very far apart.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.960
 - The kingdoms is pretty much the highest up cast we use.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.000
 - Yep, yep, yep.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.840
 That was a--

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.680
 - Wow.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.520
 - Why didn't I know that?

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 - There is differences you are to a strawberry.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.360
 - Sometimes.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.200
 - More so.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.240
 - Do you have a moment where you just think,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.800
 what's the point of anything I've been doing?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.080
 (laughing)

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.200
 What's the point of even,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.960
 if even the people sitting next to me

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960
 haven't been listening?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.720
 I'm not sure what the people at home have been turning off.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.800
 They've just been doing 30 seconds on, on, on, on.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.760
 They're still talking about moss?

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.600
 On, on, on, on.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.000
 - To be fair though, you haven't been trying to push

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.960
 the point that they're separate from each other.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.000
 - I didn't think I needed to.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.840
 - No, no, I know.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.720
 - It's very, you know, Rick explains to me

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.680
 that moss was different to a puppy.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.000
 - Yeah, but I'm saying.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.840
 - You emphasized that.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.320
 - I'm saying all your hard work hasn't gone amiss.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.760
 I'm still taking in the beauty of moss.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.520
 I just thought it was connected to another species.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.280
 - It was Malt, yeah, yeah, okay.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.120
 - Well, no, I didn't think it was Malt.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.040
 I thought the same family.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.960
 - We still don't know what Mildew is, unfortunately.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.800
 - I've got a lot of it in the upstairs of my house right now.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.720
 If you want to smell Mildew, come around to my house.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.560
 - Sexy.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.400
 - Sexy offer.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.240
 - Yeah.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.400
 - Whoa.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.840
 Okay, here's another one.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:31.800
 Thank you, Chris.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.040
 (laughing)

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.360
 You got some feedback on it.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.440
 This wasn't an episode that I did,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.400
 but it was when you had Reson.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.240
 - Oh yeah.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.280
 - Talked about moose.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.120
 - Yeah.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.640
 - Is that the same as moss?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.480
 (laughing)

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.040
 - Same kingdom, definitely.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.560
 - Just two Canadians, Andrew and Emma Gilchrist

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.440
 have written in saying moose are very difficult to spot.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.280
 - Really?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.120
 - Yeah.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.120
 - So, Rhys said that if you're in Canada,

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.760
 one could be 50 meters in front of you in a plain field

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.200
 and you wouldn't be able to see it.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.120
 - Yeah.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.080
 - Well, it sounds quite likely.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:05.920
 - Really?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.840
 - So, Emma says, "As a Canadian who lives in the woods,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.200
 "I would like to confirm moss is very hard to see."

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.040
 - Moose.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.880
 - Moose.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.320
 (laughing)

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.160
 - Okay, okay.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.920
 Moose.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.760
 (laughing)

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.160
 - Very hard to see.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.560
 They pop out of wooded areas on the sides of the road

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.240
 and end up in the middle before the driver even notices.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.080
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.360
 - And we have signs on the road to one of moose crossing

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.160
 so the drivers can watch the ditches

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.880
 'cause they hang out in the ditches.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.360
 - Oh, and then jump up like a jack in a box.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.200
 - Pretty much.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.440
 And then despite their huge antlers,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.040
 they are very quiet too.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.400
 - I will say that being in a wooded area is very different

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.360
 and I wouldn't deny that it's probably easy to hide

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.960
 in a wooded area as a moose,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.360
 but Rhys has claimed that he could be on an open meadow

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.160
 gallivanting towards moss or a moose and not see it.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.440
 - I'll refer you to Andrew's email,

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.840
 who lives in a small town.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.400
 So in rural British Columbia,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.280
 he says I live in a small town in rural British Columbia

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.760
 where moose are bound,

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.600
 but I've only ever seen a handful.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.640
 (laughing)

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.980
 - There we go.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.820
 - Well, maybe.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.880
 - Do you notice them in photos later?

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.760
 They're sort of like a dinner party shot

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.320
 and just there's a moose standing behind the dining table.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.440
 - It's like that basketball game

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.040
 with the gorilla that walks behind it.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.880
 (laughing)

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.360
 You actually never notice it.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.280
 But it's all moose.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.880
 There's one gorilla at 18 moose.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.600
 You can't see any of the moose, you actually see the gorilla.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600
 All right, here's another one.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.600
 You talked about goats on this podcast as well with Rhys.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.640
 - Yeah, we did, yeah.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.480
 At length.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.800
 (laughing)

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.840
 - I know, I listened to it.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.600
 Steve Mellon writes, "This is a great email.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.820
 "I thought if anyone would appreciate

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:35.560
 "an additional bit on goats, it would be you guys.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:38.680
 "I'm on the Ogwin Valley Mountain Rescue Team

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.840
 "in North Wales."

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.680
 - Cool.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.480
 - "Of our approximately 150 to 200 call-outs a year,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.280
 "around five to 10 of these are triggered

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.520
 "by people hearing shouts for help,

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.680
 "which is in fact goats calling each other."

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.520
 (laughing)

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.360
 - Really?

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.200
 - Really?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.120
 - Their bleeds sound remarkably like a human shouting,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120
 "Help!"

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.160
 - Yes, they do actually.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.200
 - Help, help!

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.480
 - Doing their pranking us.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.360
 - It says, "We always send a small team to investigate

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.480
 "and the best way to ascertain if it is goats

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.000
 "is to shout questions that help is not the answer to."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.160
 (laughing)

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.440
 - What's your favourite sandwich?

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.480
 - That's amazing.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.960
 - "What do you call a place that sells lots of drinks?"

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.220
 (laughing)

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.920
 - Anyway, thank you Steve Mellon.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.760
 - Great.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.600
 - What a great bit of bonus info.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.440
 - Yeah, lovely.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.560
 - There's been quite,

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.560
 I'm sort of reluctant to bring this up again.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560
 - Oh no.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.400
 - Do we miss a joke?

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.760
 - No, there's been quite a lot of,

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:33.160
 I mean, yeah, with loads.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.600
 But there's been quite a lot of urine discourse

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.440
 in the inbox.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.280
 - Yeah.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.120
 - Up peeing in the shower.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.260
 - Oh, yes, yes, yes.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.100
 - I was just listening

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.080
 to the most recent Clubfish episode.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.840
 This is from David.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.280
 And you were talking about peeing in the shower

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.080
 and also the potential use of urine as a skin treatment.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.880
 And I have a fact that you didn't mention

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.800
 that I can't help myself from sharing.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 Can't help myself.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.280
 - That's always a bad sign, isn't it?

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.080
 - Isn't it good.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.480
 Graham Swan, the early 2000s vintage England off spinner.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.320
 - Yeah.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.000
 - This is cricket for American listeners.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.520
 Used to prepare for cricket matches

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.120
 by soaking his bowling hand,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.120
 or really his bowling fingers in a bucket of urine.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.960
 - Okay.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.780
 - Oh, I think I've read this.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.400
 Is that to make it stick more or something to the ball?

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.460
 What was that?

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.280
 - Well, he says it seems to have been for the same reason

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.600
 that you referenced on the podcast

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.880
 for new guitar players to tend to the skin

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.340
 where the ball would be consistently rubbing

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.680
 against the fingers.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.520
 - How interesting.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.600
 - Somebody does it before it.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.200
 I was suggesting doing it post-guitar playing,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.600
 but that makes sense, right?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.920
 Get prep, prep the hands.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.760
 - Yeah.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.720
 - It's about avoidance rather than treatment.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.600
 - I didn't Monty Panasar, who was the spinner

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.400
 before Graham Swan, I think, might be wrong.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.200
 But didn't he get arrested for public urination

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.200
 a few years ago?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200
 - Was it onto his own hands?

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.240
 - I was wondering if that might have been the reason.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.320
 Like he was just.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.320
 - Did he really?

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.600
 - It was into Graham Swan's bucket, that was it.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.880
 (all laughing)

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.120
 - It's a ritual you do to pass on the mantle.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.440
 - Yeah.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.080
 - I was actually talking with some advice

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.680
 about urinating in the shower the other day.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.120
 Which got anyone off the hook who maybe does it.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.880
 But it's more female focus,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.680
 but saying that if you've got a sore front bum,

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.840
 for whatever reason,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.480
 might be though that you've just given birth.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.280
 Often leaves you a bit sore.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.920
 And urinating in the shower, much less painful,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.600
 'cause it dilutes it as it comes out, apparently.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.200
 This was actively recommended.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.960
 So that's when you can get away with it.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.680
 And imagine that's why you were doing it.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.760
 (all laughing)

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.880
 - Sovereign bum landing.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.040
 - Yeah.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.960
 - It's agony.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.000
 (all laughing)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.080
 - Wow, okay, well, good tip.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.560
 - Hot tip, yeah.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.760
 - This is becoming a nice lifestyle section,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.520
 I would say, to drop us a line.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.440
 It's a community.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.400
 - If you have any tips for urine or otherwise,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.720
 then do let us know.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.800
 - Let's keep it urine though.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.120
 - Let's be exclusively a urine wellness podcast.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.320
 - We've done peeing on your feet.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.720
 We've done peeing on your hands.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.560
 So now, if there's another part of the body

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.960
 that you think we should be peeing on,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960
 - Yes.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.800
 - Drops a line.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.320
 (all laughing)

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.480
 This is really fascinating.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.320
 It's from Sarah Willards.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.360
 She says, "I was really interested to hear you

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.640
 "mention Tintin's lack of aging in the episode,

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.400
 "saying it could have been due to repeated blows

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.160
 "to the head causing the problem.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.120
 "There is also quite a rare syndrome called Kalman's

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.280
 "syndrome which causes puberty to be inhibited

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.960
 "and it can come accompanied by an impaired sense of smell.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.480
 "I know this as my son actually has Kalman's syndrome

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.000
 "and has to have daily testosterone

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.600
 "to replace the hormone that should be produced.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.840
 "It often isn't diagnosed until the late teens

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.240
 "as it can be really hard to notice the subtle symptoms

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.720
 "and it only becomes obvious once the male

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.760
 "has failed to go through puberty."

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.600
 - That's so interesting.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.480
 - So if Tintin has a dodgy olfactory sense,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.760
 he probably has Kalman's syndrome.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.600
 - That's great.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.480
 - Please write in if you know the comics well enough

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.840
 to know that one plate where he can't smell delicious.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.800
 - Well, he hangs out with that sailor.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.720
 Doesn't he captain Banacol or whatever he's called?

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.800
 - No, not Steve.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.960
 - Captain Banacol is from Octonauts.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:03.800
 - Octonauts, yeah.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.120
 - Kitschers.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.200
 - But yeah, Captain Haggard.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200
 So maybe he's like, yeah, he would never hang out with him

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.920
 if he had a full olfactory system.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.560
 - Is the first friend Captain Haggard's ever made?

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.400
 It's very sad.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.240
 - Yeah.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.080
 - Yeah.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.920
 - Well, it's lovely.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.740
 It's as lovely as they're meant to be.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.760
 He's finally found the person for him.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.440
 - Yeah, possibly, yeah.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.760
 All right, you guys, you put it off long enough.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.720
 I'm afraid we've got to have some get yourself off the hooks.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.560
 - Oh, okay.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.920
 Just quick one before we finish.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.520
 - Okay, three people from New Zealand have written to say

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.720
 that you pronounce the name of the bird wrong.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.560
 - Oh, which one?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.400
 - Kokako.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.800
 - Kokako, yeah, you did say that you didn't know

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.760
 how to pronounce it, though, in fairness.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.600
 - Apologies.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.440
 - Yeah, sorry.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.840
 - How are they saying that we should have pronounced it?

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.000
 - I think like I just did.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.840
 - Kokako.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.800
 - Yeah, yeah, I looked up the pronunciation.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.840
 - Hard to put in an email the correct pronunciation,

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840
 isn't it?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.680
 (laughing)

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.520
 - That's interesting.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.960
 I think I said in the background, Kokako,

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.080
 because you said the O had a line over.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.920
 - Yeah.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.080
 - End of Tokyo.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.240
 - Someone else wrote in, they said,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.920
 "I think reset it quietly and correctly in the background,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.600
 "but it didn't get in the airways."

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
 Maybe that was you instead, okay, so here we go.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.920
 Anyway, look, that's a brief one.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.640
 - Apologies, yeah, no, I should have got that right.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.440
 I think generally, this is a horrible thing to say,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.240
 but because I can't really speak many words correctly,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.000
 I care less about pronunciation.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.400
 I understand that it can offend people,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.880
 so I apologize for that, but on a personal level,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.720
 I just think--

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.120
 - You're saying things.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.920
 - Oh my God, the audiobook that I had to do

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.400
 for my own book, every three sentences,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.400
 I was like, how the hell fuck, how'd you say that?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.640
 - Sounds like they put a lot of effort

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.920
 into that audiobook though, so I imagine it's worth buying.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.640
 - Yeah, it was four weeks of audio recording.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.720
 (laughing)

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.280
 - Where can you get this audiobook from?

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.840
 - Audible's a good place to get it from.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.200
 Yeah, it's called the theory of everything else,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.720
 it's sort of fantastic.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.560
 - And you're dubbed over in the end, aren't you?

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.400
 (laughing)

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.600
 - It's by Reese, actually, yeah.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.200
 One last thing, just because it's a correction,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.760
 but it comes with a little bonus fact, which is lovely.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.080
 It's from Oliver Tickham.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:01.280
 He says, "In one of your previous podcasts,

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.760
 "Anna made some comment about the difference

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.800
 "between towns and cities being the cathedral."

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.120
 - Oh, what?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.680
 That was a throw away, and we know it's not true.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.480
 - In the UK, Oliver continues,

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.680
 "That is not the difference between towns and cities."

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.520
 - Oh, Oliver.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.840
 - The difference is whether or not it has a royal charter.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.760
 (laughing)

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.800
 - There are so many different definitions,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.760
 there are so many different documents you can read

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.680
 going back all the way, and I'm sorry,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.320
 it is, of course, not as simple as the cathedral thing.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.000
 - Oliver continues, this is a nice, cool bonus fact.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.880
 My fact this week is that Guilford was considered

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.200
 for city status in time for the new millennium.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.320
 The football team prepared for this

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.080
 by renaming itself Guilford City FC.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.400
 It then didn't happen, Guilford is still not a city,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.600
 so the football team is now just named Guilford City,

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.480
 even though it's just in Guilford.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.320
 - That's great.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.160
 - That's brilliant.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.280
 - So there you go, thank you, Oliver, for sending that in.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.000
 And don't forget, royal charter is the thing.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.840
 Bye!

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.080
 (laughing)

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.200
 Thanks so much, everybody,

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.040
 for all your emails, your corrections,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040
 your bonus bits of information.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.000
 We genuinely love hearing it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.040
 If you have listened to the podcast

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.800
 and you have anything relevant or irrelevant to add,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.320
 please do send it to podcast@qi.com.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.120
 All emails are read.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.400
 - That's it for this time.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.400
 - I just said it's so threatening.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.120
 (laughing)

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.800
 - All emails are read.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.560
 - Okay, that's it for this time.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.400
 Thank you so much.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.880
 See you next time on Drop As A Line.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:36.720
 Bye.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.300
 (upbeat music)

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.880
 (upbeat music)

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.460
 (upbeat music)

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.040
 (upbeat music)
