1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,020
 - Hi.

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,320
 - Right, let's do some emails.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,400
 (laughing)

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
 - No wasting time on it.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,240
 - Awesome.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,320
 - Let's trim the fat so we can have more emails.

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,160
 - Great idea.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,200
 - But if you are listening to this,

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,760
 and it's your first time, this is Drop As A Line,

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,360
 we talk about your facts.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,400
 - You're spiling it now.

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,240
 - You're right.

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,080
 - Commit.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,640
 - Let's start again.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,860
 - Hi.

17
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,860
 - All right, let's do it.

18
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:35,840
 (laughing)

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,640
 - What would you like?

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,000
 First of all, you can have a bonus info,

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,760
 you can have a bonus fact, or you can have a complaint.

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,560
 - What happened to the excellent new names for the wall?

23
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,400
 - Yeah.

24
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,240
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,080
 - I've been ditched.

26
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,560
 - No, no, no, no, actually of the week,

27
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,080
 that's bonus info, but it's bonus info

28
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,280
 that's correcting us in a slightly finicky way,

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,320
 or you can have you get yourself off the hook,

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,400
 which is the correction one.

31
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,840
 - Well, I think we've just finished quite a long recording.

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,680
 I feel like a nice fact.

33
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,280
 - Lovely, okay, here we go.

34
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,800
 This is a fact phrased in a QI format of a question, lovely.

35
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,640
 In which month in the UK is the longest day?

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,480
 - July.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,160
 - April.

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,520
 - The day when the clocks go back off.

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,360
 - Is that actually?

40
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
 - October.

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,680
 25 hours, the clocks go back.

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,800
 You've got 25 hours to play with.

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,560
 - That's good, that's good.

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,120
 - That's Chris Boot, I should say.

45
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
 - That's not an interesting fact, though.

46
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,440
 That's just a trick question.

47
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,360
 James asked for an interesting fact.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,160
 - Okay, some mutant ears broke out.

49
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,120
 - I think, cool, I think they weren't

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,280
 operating within the remit.

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,600
 - No, fair enough, fair enough, all right.

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,640
 - That's a good question, though.

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,280
 - Yeah, I like it.

54
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
 - I think it's quite a good fact, isn't it?

55
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,640
 - I'd like to say this is the longest day of the year.

56
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,440
 - No, that's not, 'cause everyone knows

57
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,800
 that that happened, that's just a trick question.

58
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,640
 - I see.

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,320
 - You know, you're not like, oh wow, really,

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,920
 did the clocks go back in October?

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,400
 - No, but did you ever think of 25 hours?

62
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,240
 Is the point of it?

63
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,080
 - I don't think you did, Anna.

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,920
 Otherwise you would have said--

65
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,880
 - But it's not an interesting fact.

66
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,720
 - Isn't it?

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,560
 - It's a clever question.

68
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,520
 - She's just feeling sad 'cause she didn't get the answer.

69
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,360
 - Yeah, exactly.

70
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,240
 Anna, maybe, you know, just think more out there, you know.

71
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
 - Okay, sorry.

72
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,400
 - All right, well, let's have a fact

73
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
 about the old mill in Kennewood.

74
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
 - Brilliant.

75
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,800
 - We spoke about this, which is the ride

76
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
 where you'd have the plastic bats.

77
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,840
 - Yeah, it was like a tunnel of love, wasn't it?

78
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
 - Bingo.

79
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,080
 - And people would make out there and, yeah.

80
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
 - Also, the paddles to whack the bums.

81
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,840
 - Exactly, yes.

82
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,400
 - People having sex.

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,240
 - Yes.

84
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,400
 - We really dragged out the explanation of that fact.

85
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,040
 We all had a go, we all played.

86
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
 - And that's it for this week's Bob's Alive.

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,480
 We'll see you next time.

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,880
 Chris Messer writes,

89
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,200
 - Yeah.

90
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
 - I live in New York, but grew up in Appalachia,

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,520
 and Kennewood was a big destination for the area.

92
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,360
 The community I grew up in was relatively far away

93
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,200
 from Kennewood, enough so that we wouldn't be hip

94
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,440
 to any of the CD law, per se.

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,320
 And still, the old mill was infamous in my community.

96
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,880
 People were always making out on it,

97
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,840
 and very scandalously, in middle school,

98
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,280
 two of my classmates' reputations were absolutely shattered

99
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,640
 because of the quite adult behavior

100
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,160
 they engaged in on the ride.

101
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,680
 Brackets, we call it third base in America.

102
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,520
 - Oh, yeah.

103
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,840
 - We call it third base in the UK too.

104
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,720
 - But do we think we've got that from America?

105
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,200
 No, it's rounders.

106
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,120
 (all laughing)

107
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,960
 - And he goes on, this is the first thing I thought of

108
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,760
 when a smutty amusement park ride was mentioned,

109
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,760
 and I was delighted to find out it was the same

110
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,760
 weird smelly old ride from 1901.

111
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,080
 (all laughing)

112
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
 I had no inkling that anyone besides the horny kids

113
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
 from my tiny coal mining town near West Virginia

114
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,440
 got down like that, but it was a known activity to us.

115
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,760
 You go on the old mill to fool around.

116
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,520
 And he says, he just adds a bit of clarification.

117
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,560
 This is the bonus detail.

118
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,400
 There is nothing romantic about the ride.

119
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,840
 It is a facsimile of perhaps the least sexy place

120
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,480
 you could imagine, a haunted lumber mill.

121
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,800
 It is full of ghosts, skeletons, spiders, logs,

122
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,640
 and the whole place.

123
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,480
 - Do you not think a haunted lumber mill is quite sexy?

124
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,320
 - I didn't think it was sexy.

125
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,480
 - Like, on our honeymoon, my wife and I went

126
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,320
 to a haunted hotel, like, deliberately,

127
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
 because it was haunted.

128
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,520
 - Mmm.

129
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
 - Oh, yes.

130
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,480
 Wasn't that haunted by the guy who was a,

131
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,960
 he brought all the chihuahuas across the,

132
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,040
 no, the sausage dogs?

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
 No, Andy, you had a dog.

134
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,240
 - It was called the drover's inn.

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,080
 - Yeah, the drover's inn.

136
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,360
 It was the ghost of a guy who was at one of the places

137
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,440
 where these dogs were just went off on their own

138
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,520
 and had bar tabs. - The corgis.

139
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
 - The corgis.

140
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,120
 - Corgis who used to arrive at the pub

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,960
 a day before their master.

142
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,800
 - Without their master.

143
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,160
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
 - So anyway, I think haunted things can be sexy.

145
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,440
 - Me too, it's dark, there are property candles,

146
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,800
 there's a lot of wood, it's a lumber.

147
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,640
 - Completely.

148
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,240
 I'll just give you Chris's description of it

149
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,120
 and see if you still find it as sexy.

150
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,560
 - It is full of ghosts, skeletons, spiders, logs,

151
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,200
 and the whole place smells like mildew.

152
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,520
 - Yummy.

153
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
 - Mildew.

154
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,760
 - I actually don't really know what mildew smells like.

155
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,600
 - Yeah, what is mildew?

156
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,440
 - It's just that kind of mould.

157
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,440
 - Mould, it's a kind of mould.

158
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,760
 - Oh, it sounds like your kind of place.

159
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920
 - I like moss not mould.

160
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,040
 - Is moss and mould not pretty much similar?

161
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,200
 - Dude, are you kidding?

162
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
 - No.

163
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,880
 - Are you joking?

164
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,360
 - I thought that was like a subspecies of mould.

165
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,920
 - Do you get people growing moss in their walls

166
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,560
 when it's a bit damp in winter?

167
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,360
 - I just thought it was part of the same family.

168
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,440
 - Dude, it's like you haven't paid attention

169
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,120
 to multiple space, but I can't see a thing.

170
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,600
 - Well, so it has no connection.

171
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,960
 Mould and moss are just completely separate.

172
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,120
 - The things that grow.

173
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,960
 - Yeah.

174
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,800
 - Well, there we go.

175
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,640
 There's a starting point.

176
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,680
 - The parts of different kingdoms.

177
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,480
 - Okay, they're very far apart.

178
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,960
 - The kingdoms is pretty much the highest up cast we use.

179
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,000
 - Yep, yep, yep.

180
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,840
 That was a--

181
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,680
 - Wow.

182
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,520
 - Why didn't I know that?

183
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 - There is differences you are to a strawberry.

184
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,360
 - Sometimes.

185
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,200
 - More so.

186
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,240
 - Do you have a moment where you just think,

187
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,800
 what's the point of anything I've been doing?

188
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,080
 (laughing)

189
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,200
 What's the point of even,

190
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,960
 if even the people sitting next to me

191
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 haven't been listening?

192
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,720
 I'm not sure what the people at home have been turning off.

193
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,800
 They've just been doing 30 seconds on, on, on, on.

194
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,760
 They're still talking about moss?

195
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,600
 On, on, on, on.

196
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
 - To be fair though, you haven't been trying to push

197
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
 the point that they're separate from each other.

198
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
 - I didn't think I needed to.

199
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
 - No, no, I know.

200
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
 - It's very, you know, Rick explains to me

201
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,680
 that moss was different to a puppy.

202
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,000
 - Yeah, but I'm saying.

203
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,840
 - You emphasized that.

204
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,320
 - I'm saying all your hard work hasn't gone amiss.

205
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,760
 I'm still taking in the beauty of moss.

206
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,520
 I just thought it was connected to another species.

207
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,280
 - It was Malt, yeah, yeah, okay.

208
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,120
 - Well, no, I didn't think it was Malt.

209
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,040
 I thought the same family.

210
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,960
 - We still don't know what Mildew is, unfortunately.

211
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,800
 - I've got a lot of it in the upstairs of my house right now.

212
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,720
 If you want to smell Mildew, come around to my house.

213
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,560
 - Sexy.

214
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,400
 - Sexy offer.

215
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,240
 - Yeah.

216
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,400
 - Whoa.

217
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,840
 Okay, here's another one.

218
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,800
 Thank you, Chris.

219
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,040
 (laughing)

220
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,360
 You got some feedback on it.

221
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,440
 This wasn't an episode that I did,

222
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,400
 but it was when you had Reson.

223
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,240
 - Oh yeah.

224
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,280
 - Talked about moose.

225
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,120
 - Yeah.

226
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,640
 - Is that the same as moss?

227
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
 (laughing)

228
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,040
 - Same kingdom, definitely.

229
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,560
 - Just two Canadians, Andrew and Emma Gilchrist

230
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,440
 have written in saying moose are very difficult to spot.

231
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
 - Really?

232
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,120
 - Yeah.

233
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
 - So, Rhys said that if you're in Canada,

234
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,760
 one could be 50 meters in front of you in a plain field

235
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,200
 and you wouldn't be able to see it.

236
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,120
 - Yeah.

237
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,080
 - Well, it sounds quite likely.

238
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
 - Really?

239
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,840
 - So, Emma says, "As a Canadian who lives in the woods,

240
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,200
 "I would like to confirm moss is very hard to see."

241
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,040
 - Moose.

242
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,880
 - Moose.

243
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,320
 (laughing)

244
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,160
 - Okay, okay.

245
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,920
 Moose.

246
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,760
 (laughing)

247
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,160
 - Very hard to see.

248
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
 They pop out of wooded areas on the sides of the road

249
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,240
 and end up in the middle before the driver even notices.

250
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
 - Oh yeah.

251
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,360
 - And we have signs on the road to one of moose crossing

252
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,160
 so the drivers can watch the ditches

253
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,880
 'cause they hang out in the ditches.

254
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,360
 - Oh, and then jump up like a jack in a box.

255
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,200
 - Pretty much.

256
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,440
 And then despite their huge antlers,

257
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,040
 they are very quiet too.

258
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,400
 - I will say that being in a wooded area is very different

259
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,360
 and I wouldn't deny that it's probably easy to hide

260
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,960
 in a wooded area as a moose,

261
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,360
 but Rhys has claimed that he could be on an open meadow

262
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,160
 gallivanting towards moss or a moose and not see it.

263
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,440
 - I'll refer you to Andrew's email,

264
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,840
 who lives in a small town.

265
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,400
 So in rural British Columbia,

266
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,280
 he says I live in a small town in rural British Columbia

267
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,760
 where moose are bound,

268
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,600
 but I've only ever seen a handful.

269
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,640
 (laughing)

270
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,980
 - There we go.

271
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,820
 - Well, maybe.

272
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,880
 - Do you notice them in photos later?

273
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,760
 They're sort of like a dinner party shot

274
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,320
 and just there's a moose standing behind the dining table.

275
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
 - It's like that basketball game

276
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,040
 with the gorilla that walks behind it.

277
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,880
 (laughing)

278
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,360
 You actually never notice it.

279
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,280
 But it's all moose.

280
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,880
 There's one gorilla at 18 moose.

281
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,600
 You can't see any of the moose, you actually see the gorilla.

282
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
 All right, here's another one.

283
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 You talked about goats on this podcast as well with Rhys.

284
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,640
 - Yeah, we did, yeah.

285
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
 At length.

286
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
 (laughing)

287
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,840
 - I know, I listened to it.

288
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,600
 Steve Mellon writes, "This is a great email.

289
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,820
 "I thought if anyone would appreciate

290
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,560
 "an additional bit on goats, it would be you guys.

291
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,680
 "I'm on the Ogwin Valley Mountain Rescue Team

292
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,840
 "in North Wales."

293
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,680
 - Cool.

294
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,480
 - "Of our approximately 150 to 200 call-outs a year,

295
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,280
 "around five to 10 of these are triggered

296
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,520
 "by people hearing shouts for help,

297
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,680
 "which is in fact goats calling each other."

298
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,520
 (laughing)

299
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,360
 - Really?

300
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,200
 - Really?

301
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,120
 - Their bleeds sound remarkably like a human shouting,

302
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
 "Help!"

303
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,160
 - Yes, they do actually.

304
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,200
 - Help, help!

305
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,480
 - Doing their pranking us.

306
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,360
 - It says, "We always send a small team to investigate

307
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,480
 "and the best way to ascertain if it is goats

308
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,000
 "is to shout questions that help is not the answer to."

309
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,160
 (laughing)

310
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,440
 - What's your favourite sandwich?

311
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
 - That's amazing.

312
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,960
 - "What do you call a place that sells lots of drinks?"

313
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,220
 (laughing)

314
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,920
 - Anyway, thank you Steve Mellon.

315
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,760
 - Great.

316
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,600
 - What a great bit of bonus info.

317
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
 - Yeah, lovely.

318
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,560
 - There's been quite,

319
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
 I'm sort of reluctant to bring this up again.

320
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,560
 - Oh no.

321
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,400
 - Do we miss a joke?

322
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,760
 - No, there's been quite a lot of,

323
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,160
 I mean, yeah, with loads.

324
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,600
 But there's been quite a lot of urine discourse

325
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
 in the inbox.

326
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
 - Yeah.

327
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,120
 - Up peeing in the shower.

328
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,260
 - Oh, yes, yes, yes.

329
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,100
 - I was just listening

330
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,080
 to the most recent Clubfish episode.

331
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
 This is from David.

332
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
 And you were talking about peeing in the shower

333
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,080
 and also the potential use of urine as a skin treatment.

334
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
 And I have a fact that you didn't mention

335
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,800
 that I can't help myself from sharing.

336
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 Can't help myself.

337
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,280
 - That's always a bad sign, isn't it?

338
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,080
 - Isn't it good.

339
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,480
 Graham Swan, the early 2000s vintage England off spinner.

340
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,320
 - Yeah.

341
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,000
 - This is cricket for American listeners.

342
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,520
 Used to prepare for cricket matches

343
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,120
 by soaking his bowling hand,

344
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
 or really his bowling fingers in a bucket of urine.

345
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,960
 - Okay.

346
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,780
 - Oh, I think I've read this.

347
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,400
 Is that to make it stick more or something to the ball?

348
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,460
 What was that?

349
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,280
 - Well, he says it seems to have been for the same reason

350
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
 that you referenced on the podcast

351
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,880
 for new guitar players to tend to the skin

352
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,340
 where the ball would be consistently rubbing

353
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,680
 against the fingers.

354
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,520
 - How interesting.

355
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,600
 - Somebody does it before it.

356
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,200
 I was suggesting doing it post-guitar playing,

357
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600
 but that makes sense, right?

358
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,920
 Get prep, prep the hands.

359
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,760
 - Yeah.

360
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,720
 - It's about avoidance rather than treatment.

361
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,600
 - I didn't Monty Panasar, who was the spinner

362
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,400
 before Graham Swan, I think, might be wrong.

363
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,200
 But didn't he get arrested for public urination

364
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
 a few years ago?

365
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 - Was it onto his own hands?

366
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,240
 - I was wondering if that might have been the reason.

367
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
 Like he was just.

368
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
 - Did he really?

369
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,600
 - It was into Graham Swan's bucket, that was it.

370
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,880
 (all laughing)

371
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,120
 - It's a ritual you do to pass on the mantle.

372
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,440
 - Yeah.

373
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,080
 - I was actually talking with some advice

374
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,680
 about urinating in the shower the other day.

375
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,120
 Which got anyone off the hook who maybe does it.

376
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,880
 But it's more female focus,

377
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,680
 but saying that if you've got a sore front bum,

378
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,840
 for whatever reason,

379
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,480
 might be though that you've just given birth.

380
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,280
 Often leaves you a bit sore.

381
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,920
 And urinating in the shower, much less painful,

382
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,600
 'cause it dilutes it as it comes out, apparently.

383
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,200
 This was actively recommended.

384
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,960
 So that's when you can get away with it.

385
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,680
 And imagine that's why you were doing it.

386
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,760
 (all laughing)

387
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,880
 - Sovereign bum landing.

388
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,040
 - Yeah.

389
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
 - It's agony.

390
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,000
 (all laughing)

391
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,080
 - Wow, okay, well, good tip.

392
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,560
 - Hot tip, yeah.

393
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,760
 - This is becoming a nice lifestyle section,

394
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,520
 I would say, to drop us a line.

395
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,440
 It's a community.

396
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,400
 - If you have any tips for urine or otherwise,

397
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,720
 then do let us know.

398
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
 - Let's keep it urine though.

399
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,120
 - Let's be exclusively a urine wellness podcast.

400
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,320
 - We've done peeing on your feet.

401
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,720
 We've done peeing on your hands.

402
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,560
 So now, if there's another part of the body

403
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,960
 that you think we should be peeing on,

404
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
 - Yes.

405
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
 - Drops a line.

406
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,320
 (all laughing)

407
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,480
 This is really fascinating.

408
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,320
 It's from Sarah Willards.

409
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,360
 She says, "I was really interested to hear you

410
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,640
 "mention Tintin's lack of aging in the episode,

411
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,400
 "saying it could have been due to repeated blows

412
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,160
 "to the head causing the problem.

413
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,120
 "There is also quite a rare syndrome called Kalman's

414
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,280
 "syndrome which causes puberty to be inhibited

415
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,960
 "and it can come accompanied by an impaired sense of smell.

416
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,480
 "I know this as my son actually has Kalman's syndrome

417
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
 "and has to have daily testosterone

418
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
 "to replace the hormone that should be produced.

419
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,840
 "It often isn't diagnosed until the late teens

420
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,240
 "as it can be really hard to notice the subtle symptoms

421
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,720
 "and it only becomes obvious once the male

422
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,760
 "has failed to go through puberty."

423
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,600
 - That's so interesting.

424
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
 - So if Tintin has a dodgy olfactory sense,

425
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,760
 he probably has Kalman's syndrome.

426
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,600
 - That's great.

427
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,480
 - Please write in if you know the comics well enough

428
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,840
 to know that one plate where he can't smell delicious.

429
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,800
 - Well, he hangs out with that sailor.

430
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,720
 Doesn't he captain Banacol or whatever he's called?

431
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,800
 - No, not Steve.

432
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,960
 - Captain Banacol is from Octonauts.

433
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,800
 - Octonauts, yeah.

434
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,120
 - Kitschers.

435
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,200
 - But yeah, Captain Haggard.

436
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 So maybe he's like, yeah, he would never hang out with him

437
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,920
 if he had a full olfactory system.

438
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,560
 - Is the first friend Captain Haggard's ever made?

439
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,400
 It's very sad.

440
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,240
 - Yeah.

441
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,080
 - Yeah.

442
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,920
 - Well, it's lovely.

443
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,740
 It's as lovely as they're meant to be.

444
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,760
 He's finally found the person for him.

445
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,440
 - Yeah, possibly, yeah.

446
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,760
 All right, you guys, you put it off long enough.

447
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,720
 I'm afraid we've got to have some get yourself off the hooks.

448
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,560
 - Oh, okay.

449
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,920
 Just quick one before we finish.

450
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

451
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,520
 - Okay, three people from New Zealand have written to say

452
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,720
 that you pronounce the name of the bird wrong.

453
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
 - Oh, which one?

454
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,400
 - Kokako.

455
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,800
 - Kokako, yeah, you did say that you didn't know

456
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,760
 how to pronounce it, though, in fairness.

457
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,600
 - Apologies.

458
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,440
 - Yeah, sorry.

459
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,840
 - How are they saying that we should have pronounced it?

460
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,000
 - I think like I just did.

461
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,840
 - Kokako.

462
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,800
 - Yeah, yeah, I looked up the pronunciation.

463
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,840
 - Hard to put in an email the correct pronunciation,

464
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
 isn't it?

465
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
 (laughing)

466
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,520
 - That's interesting.

467
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,960
 I think I said in the background, Kokako,

468
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,080
 because you said the O had a line over.

469
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
 - Yeah.

470
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,080
 - End of Tokyo.

471
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
 - Someone else wrote in, they said,

472
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,920
 "I think reset it quietly and correctly in the background,

473
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
 "but it didn't get in the airways."

474
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 Maybe that was you instead, okay, so here we go.

475
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,920
 Anyway, look, that's a brief one.

476
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,640
 - Apologies, yeah, no, I should have got that right.

477
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,440
 I think generally, this is a horrible thing to say,

478
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,240
 but because I can't really speak many words correctly,

479
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,000
 I care less about pronunciation.

480
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
 I understand that it can offend people,

481
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,880
 so I apologize for that, but on a personal level,

482
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,720
 I just think--

483
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,120
 - You're saying things.

484
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,920
 - Oh my God, the audiobook that I had to do

485
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,400
 for my own book, every three sentences,

486
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
 I was like, how the hell fuck, how'd you say that?

487
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,640
 - Sounds like they put a lot of effort

488
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,920
 into that audiobook though, so I imagine it's worth buying.

489
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,640
 - Yeah, it was four weeks of audio recording.

490
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
 (laughing)

491
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
 - Where can you get this audiobook from?

492
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,840
 - Audible's a good place to get it from.

493
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,200
 Yeah, it's called the theory of everything else,

494
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,720
 it's sort of fantastic.

495
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,560
 - And you're dubbed over in the end, aren't you?

496
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,400
 (laughing)

497
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
 - It's by Reese, actually, yeah.

498
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,200
 One last thing, just because it's a correction,

499
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,760
 but it comes with a little bonus fact, which is lovely.

500
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
 It's from Oliver Tickham.

501
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,280
 He says, "In one of your previous podcasts,

502
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
 "Anna made some comment about the difference

503
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,800
 "between towns and cities being the cathedral."

504
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,120
 - Oh, what?

505
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,680
 That was a throw away, and we know it's not true.

506
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
 - In the UK, Oliver continues,

507
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,680
 "That is not the difference between towns and cities."

508
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,520
 - Oh, Oliver.

509
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,840
 - The difference is whether or not it has a royal charter.

510
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,760
 (laughing)

511
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,800
 - There are so many different definitions,

512
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,760
 there are so many different documents you can read

513
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,680
 going back all the way, and I'm sorry,

514
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,320
 it is, of course, not as simple as the cathedral thing.

515
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
 - Oliver continues, this is a nice, cool bonus fact.

516
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,880
 My fact this week is that Guilford was considered

517
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
 for city status in time for the new millennium.

518
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,320
 The football team prepared for this

519
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,080
 by renaming itself Guilford City FC.

520
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,400
 It then didn't happen, Guilford is still not a city,

521
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,600
 so the football team is now just named Guilford City,

522
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,480
 even though it's just in Guilford.

523
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,320
 - That's great.

524
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,160
 - That's brilliant.

525
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,280
 - So there you go, thank you, Oliver, for sending that in.

526
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,000
 And don't forget, royal charter is the thing.

527
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
 Bye!

528
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,080
 (laughing)

529
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,200
 Thanks so much, everybody,

530
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,040
 for all your emails, your corrections,

531
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
 your bonus bits of information.

532
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,000
 We genuinely love hearing it.

533
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,040
 If you have listened to the podcast

534
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,800
 and you have anything relevant or irrelevant to add,

535
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
 please do send it to podcast@qi.com.

536
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,120
 All emails are read.

537
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,400
 - That's it for this time.

538
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 - I just said it's so threatening.

539
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,120
