1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we wanted to really highly recommend to you

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,960
 a new book that's just about to come out on the market.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,160
 It's called The Theory of Everything Else and it is by an author you may have heard

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,160
 of.

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
 Oh, Lee Child.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,400
 It's so close.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
 Richard Osman.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,720
 You're a bit further away now actually.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,040
 Go back to the Lee Child direction.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,120
 It's Dan Schreiber's book, ladies and gentlemen.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
 Yay!

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,800
 Dan has written a book, it's called The Theory of Everything Else and if you listen to fish,

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,160
 you already know what it's about.

14
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,960
 It's about all the craziest, strangest theories that people have believed about all sorts of

15
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
 things around the world.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,680
 You want the Titanic, it's in there.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,400
 You want aliens, they're in there.

18
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,680
 You want Nicholas Wichelt, the BBC's royal correspondent, living on the banks of Loch

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,240
 Ness, trying to find Nessie for several months earlier in his career.

20
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
 That's in there.

21
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,240
 And who doesn't want that?

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,720
 It's what we've always wanted.

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,600
 Dan's been cooking up this book for as long as I've known him.

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
 Genuinely, it's been absolutely worth the wait.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,920
 Every single page is a story that you absolutely won't believe.

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,280
 So it's about these weird ideas, people with these bizarre beliefs, but who somehow end

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
 up changing the world.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
 It's about how these beliefs end up to have been logical.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,880
 It's basically about how we should never dismiss what seems like lunacy because sometimes

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,480
 it can turn out to be genius and it is the most incredible read.

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,400
 Yeah, and that is the motto actually for recording episodes of the podcast with Dan.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,960
 So you already know what you're going to get.

33
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,440
 If you want to check it out, just find The Theory of Everything Else.

34
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,040
 There is also a website attached which will have all the additional notes and videos and

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
 updates.

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,600
 That's theoryofeverythingelse.co.uk.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
 Guys, this is Dan's first book.

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,320
 We'd love it to be a monster hit, so get yourself a copy right now.

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
 Yes, please do.

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,960
 I kind of want to just read your transcript of the whole thing because all the characters,

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,840
 all the stories in it are incredible.

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
 So please go there, help out Dan and read, you know, the most interesting book of your

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
 year.

44
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,640
 If you want to see The Theory of Everything Else, you can pre-order it now, or it's out

45
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,320
 next week, October the 13th.

46
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,440
 Get to a bookshop and buy it.

47
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
 On with the show!

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,440
 On with the podcast.

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:20,880
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,600
 this week, coming to you live from Inverness!

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,520
 My name is Dan Shriver.

52
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,400
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

53
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
 the last seven days.

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,400
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is James.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,680
 Okay, my fact this week is that you can catch chlamydia from dead parrots.

57
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
 Darling!

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:05,680
 What do you have to do with dead parrots to catch chlamydia from them?

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,560
 Well, it's a bacterium, chlamydia.

60
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
 This is actually called Cytocosis, and it's kind of known as parrot fever, but it's a

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,640
 type of chlamydia, and the bacterium can come from the parrot to you through mouth to beak

62
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
 contact.

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,640
 Mm-hmm.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 Yeah.

65
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
 Yeah.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
 Sexy stuff.

67
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,200
 Or the airborne inhalation of feather dust, feces, or respiratory secretions.

68
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
 Less sexy stuff.

69
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 Yeah.

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,680
 So it can come from mouth to beak.

71
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,600
 There was actually, I was looking in some old newspaper archives about this, and I found

72
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,000
 a 1992 cutting from the Press and Journal that reported on a teacher from Inverness who

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,760
 caught chlamydia from a dead parrot that he apparently found in his garden.

74
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640
 Don't have a parrot in you, why are you suggesting?

75
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,960
 He might have been giving it life because of life by then.

76
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,200
 Well, the article said that he said that he didn't touch it with his hands.

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:12,600
 I don't know why you need to specify that, and also that he didn't want to be named.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
 Okay.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
 Wow.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 Is he in?

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,240
 Are you in?

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,440
 Everyone knows him in this room, I think.

83
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
 Yeah.

84
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
 Wow.

85
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 Wow.

86
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
 So do we know if he recovered?

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
 Yeah, he did.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
 Oh, great.

89
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,320
 And to be honest, it can be quite serious.

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,320
 Yeah.

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,520
 Certainly when it first came about, Citicosis, and became like a bit of a pandemic or an

92
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,600
 epidemic really in America and as few other places, but it was in various parts of the

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 world.

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 This was in the 1920s.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,200
 It had a really high death rate.

96
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,880
 If you were over 35 and you caught it, it was something like 25% of people died.

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 Yeah, it was crazy.

98
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
 And it was a proper panic, wasn't it?

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
 Oh, yeah.

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
 The freak's out.

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,360
 Yeah, and the papers, to begin with, they said that it was found initially, sort of like

102
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,600
 the first case that was mentioned was in Argentina, and it was on a sailor who wasn't really a

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 sailor.

104
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
 He was an actor, and it was his stage parrot that gave it to him, and that, so they traced

105
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
 it to that.

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,280
 But then it was all these cases in America where people were trying to work out why these

107
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,480
 people were suddenly dying.

108
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,520
 But that's a good contact to have, isn't it, as in if you're a stage, did he say he was

109
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
 a sailor?

110
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,360
 He was a sailor with a stage parrot on his shoulder.

111
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
 But he was a stage sailor.

112
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,440
 You said he was a sailor, but then you said he wasn't an actual sailor, right?

113
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,760
 He was just a sailor on stage.

114
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
 I know.

115
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,280
 I delivered it in my head like it was a cool Dan Brown plot twist, but then I realised.

116
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,640
 In actual fact, it wasn't on his shoulder.

117
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,760
 In this play, it was in a cage, but all of the people in the play had to go and stroke

118
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
 the parrot.

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,760
 So it wasn't on his shoulder.

120
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,400
 He kept going over and stroking it.

121
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,720
 Eight of the cast got sick, and two of them died after this play.

122
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
 How do you know?

123
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,280
 This was in 1930, and as a result, 90% of Argentina's parrots were killed.

124
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,280
 Rough.

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
 What?

126
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
 Really rough.

127
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,560
 And this was, the rumor always was that the Argentinians brought it over.

128
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,000
 It was the classic, you know, like the Chinese disease.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,200
 It was, as you know, Donald Trump was referred to the Chinese disease, that wasn't me doing

130
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
 that.

131
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 Yeah.

132
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,920
 He said that quite a long time ago now, so that just came across as a year.

133
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,880
 You've got to be careful with these references, don't you?

134
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,280
 Make sure they're up to date.

135
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,320
 So on the East Coast, there were all these rumors that had come from Argentina, and in

136
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:24,480
 fact, the outbreak began, they think, in December 1929, and it was a man in Maryland who bought

137
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,920
 a parrot as a present for his wife, and not only that, he stored it with his daughter

138
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,000
 and son-in-law before he gave it to his wife.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,040
 You know, can I hide this parrot with you?

140
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,200
 Anyway, three of them got seriously ill.

141
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,040
 Not the guy who bought the parrot, actually, just the other three.

142
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,000
 And this guy, Dr. Martin, went and visited them.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,720
 And he said, "I had the weirdest case today.

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,200
 These three people are sick."

145
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,780
 And she asked him about it, and he eventually said, "Yeah, weirdly, the only other person

146
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,160
 who was sick in the room was their pet parrot, who I think is about to die."

147
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,720
 And his wife said, "Do you know what, that's so weird, because I was just reading the sort

148
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,120
 of gossip pages of my magazine, and apparently there's this parrot sickness in Argentina."

149
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,180
 And it was that conversation, she'd been happened to read this obscure article, and

150
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,600
 I asked them, "That sounds like nonsense, but whatever, we'll chase it up."

151
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,480
 And it was that parrot sickness that kicked it all off.

152
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
 Of course, their magazine has got...

153
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,680
 He magazine was very different.

154
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,320
 She says it wasn't no fair with Katie Price.

155
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,520
 He says it was Chlamydia from a dead parrot.

156
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,520
 It's called...

157
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,520
 Hello!

158
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
 Hello!

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
 Very good.

160
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,600
 They always talk in the end.

161
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,720
 That was a hugely significant parrot fever outbreak, because the doctor who'd been working

162
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,400
 on it, it was a guy called Charles Armstrong.

163
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,160
 He fell really ill after treating the patients who'd got it, the guy who'd bought it, Mr.

164
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,160
 Martin.

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,680
 He was almost going to die, the doctor, Charles Armstrong.

166
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,080
 Another doctor injected him with the blood of a patient who had survived parrot fever,

167
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
 not doing any of the tests about, you know, the...

168
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
 I think the blood type or anything like that was a very primitive procedure, but he lived.

169
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,320
 Charles Armstrong, the doctor, lived, and that entire incident led to the founding of

170
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,680
 America's National Institute of Health.

171
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
 No.

172
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,000
 So it's a big result from one parrot fever outbreak.

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,320
 I should also say, actually, just going back to the original fact, which is that you can

174
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,480
 catch it from dead parrots.

175
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,000
 This came from a study at the University of Adelaide and the University of the Sunshine

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Coast, which sounds quite amazing, by Annalise Chaber and Et Al, and they've described sometimes

177
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,160
 when people have been dissecting parrots and then got pneumonia a little bit later, and

178
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,280
 then they checked the bodies and found that they actually caught it from the parrots when

179
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
 they were dead already.

180
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Yeah, right.

181
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,960
 So most of these people were talking about they were catching it from quite a sickly

182
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,920
 parrot, but these people have been catching it from an actual dead parrot and the guy

183
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,400
 from Inverness as well.

184
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,280
 I remember every dead parrot I've ever kissed, I have to say, so I'd know because it was

185
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,520
 known as Old Maid's Pneumonia because, you know, parrots were all the rage then.

186
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,040
 People used to go door-to-door selling parrots to sad women whose husbands had died.

187
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,480
 Again, this was the stereotype, that's what Donald Trump would have called them, that's

188
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,920
 not what I'm calling them.

189
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,360
 And the rumor was that they'd all been snogging their parrots because they were so sad and

190
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,360
 lonely and widowed.

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
 What?

192
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,320
 And so that's why it was called Old Maid's Pneumonia, it said they were all getting chlamydia

193
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,880
 from them, and it's not, you're just breathing in the air around the parrot, okay?

194
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,640
 Well, 63% of the people who got the citicosis at the time of the big outbreak were women.

195
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,840
 They did own parrots much more often, but we don't know that they were sticking their

196
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
 tongues down their throats.

197
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,040
 And this was devastating for parrots, like the panic really hit and everyone took it

198
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,640
 seriously, so there were stories about how in the US Navy the admirals were ordering

199
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
 anyone who had a parrot on board just to let them off over.

200
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,400
 Why have you got a parrot on a serious Navy vessel?

201
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
 They're at sea.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 It's not...

203
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 Who doesn't bring a parrot to sea?

204
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,960
 It's not a pirate ship, where do you think pirates get their parrots?

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,280
 Pirates have parrots, sailors don't have parrots, that should be how you can tell the difference

206
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,560
 between a pirate and a normal, law-abiding sailor.

207
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,560
 Very good point.

208
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
 Yeah, you check the leg, you check the pieces of eight, and then you check the parrot.

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,480
 Can't chlamydia kind of damage your eyes as well, can it?

210
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
 You check for...

211
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 Eyepatches.

212
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 Eyepatches.

213
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 Eyepatches.

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 Exactly.

215
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
 Okay.

216
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,400
 So what do you say it was devastating for parrots because they could no longer accompany sailors

217
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
 on their journey?

218
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,800
 No, it was a sort of mass death of parrots who were just thrown out to sea was more the

219
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 angle.

220
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,280
 I want to thank you, the poor sailors, and their pirate credentials.

221
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,680
 Those poor parrots, which can fly, they'll be fine.

222
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,560
 They can't fly a hundred miles back to land.

223
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,160
 Do you know you can get chlamydia from house flies?

224
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
 Really?

225
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,160
 Yeah.

226
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,040
 How do you do, what do you have to do with them?

227
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,480
 Well, annoyingly, I don't know if you guys saw what you want to see, but I dropped my

228
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,520
 notes just before we came out here and I can't, it's on the next page and I can't find the

229
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
 reason for it.

230
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,340
 It was the worst excuse in eight years of podcasting we've had for why you can't back

231
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,880
 up one of your outlandish plays.

232
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
 It's of experience.

233
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
 You dropped your notes.

234
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
 Oh yeah.

235
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 And then the dog ran off with the page.

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,880
 No, I swear to God.

237
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
 I've been trying to find it.

238
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
 No, absolutely.

239
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,880
 It might be backstage.

240
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,080
 I've got a line that says with guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis as an animal model,

241
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,920
 jokes about wives it seems, have always been fair game, so that's the next page.

242
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
 So yeah.

243
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
 But apparently you can get chlamydia from house flies.

244
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
 That's a rumour going round.

245
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,920
 Good to know.

246
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,520
 Careful what you do with those blue bottles.

247
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,880
 Do you want to hear another parrot thing?

248
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
 Oh yeah.

249
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
 Okay.

250
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,000
 Are you guys familiar with a guy called Noel Fitzpatrick?

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Noel Fitzpatrick.

252
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,600
 He's on a show called Super Vet.

253
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,940
 Anyway, he has a book which is sort of memoirs of a career, a vetting career and there was

254
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,360
 a time when he had to operate on a parrot, but the problem was he couldn't anesthetise

255
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
 it.

256
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,520
 You know, the anesthetic wasn't suitable.

257
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,800
 It might have died if you tried to put it under, so he had to just hold it on the X-ray

258
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
 machine.

259
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,680
 I'm quoting him directly here.

260
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,480
 He kept looking up at me and asking, "What are you doing?

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
 What are you doing?"

262
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,320
 I kept trying to keep him quiet and maybe a few choice phrases escaped from my big Irish

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,880
 mouth in the process.

264
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,560
 We completed the radiographs, gave the medication and as I was handing him back to the dear,

265
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,960
 sweet elderly lady who was his companion, he jumped on the lady's arm, craved his neck

266
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,960
 and shouted merrily, "Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up!"

267
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:25,360
 I can't tell you how scared I am that that's going to be my daughter's first word.

268
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,540
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

269
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,320
 My fact this week is that the head of the AA keeps his car keys in the microwave and

270
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,800
 I've just realised that I should specify which of the AA's I mean this fact is because he's

271
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
 constantly shit-faced.

272
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:56,120
 It's a safety thing in both instances and then it's just too pissed to open it.

273
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
 No, because the head of the AA wouldn't be drunk.

274
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,760
 But this is the head of the automobile association, it's a guy called Edmund King and he's very

275
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
 safety conscious.

276
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,000
 He's emerging on paranoid I would say, he did an interview recently with the Telegraph

277
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,960
 where he says he's got one of these car keys that remotely unlocks your car.

278
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
 A fob.

279
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
 A fob.

280
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
 Yeah.

281
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,880
 A fob and he keeps it in a Faraday cage, so in this leather bag with a wire mesh lining

282
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,440
 and a red metal box, so a cage that can't let through any electromagnetic field and

283
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,080
 after he's got it in that Faraday cage he puts it inside a microwave and he's put the

284
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,640
 microwave right at the back of the house as far away from the car as possible and so every

285
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,840
 time he wants to drive somewhere it's a real hassle for him.

286
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,120
 He either he or his wife had their car next.

287
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
 It's his wife.

288
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
 Yeah.

289
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
 Yeah.

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,640
 If you have one of the keyless keys basically, that's not, you know what I mean.

291
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
 Yeah, yeah.

292
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
 A keyless fob.

293
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
 Yeah, yeah.

294
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,200
 It's sort of something like 50 times likely to have your car stolen because it's easier

295
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 to hack the thing.

296
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,800
 Do you not think you would wait until like lunchtime when he's making a baked potato or

297
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,280
 something in a microwave and just steal his car?

298
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
 Exactly.

299
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
 Yeah.

300
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,400
 So it's an amplifier and transmitter thing.

301
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,720
 This is how they get your car.

302
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,820
 So most people if they have this key fob they might leave it near the front door just sitting

303
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,240
 in on a console table or something like that and two criminals will be involved.

304
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,920
 One will go next to the door and they'll have an amplifier while the other stands next to

305
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,600
 the door with a transmitter.

306
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
 I can't remember which way.

307
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
 One goes next to the house door near the key.

308
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,600
 One goes next to the car door.

309
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 One goes next to the car door.

310
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 One goes next to the car door.

311
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 They amplify the signal.

312
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
 It comes to the car door.

313
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
 They can open it and steal it.

314
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
 Yeah.

315
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
 But that happens a lot as you were saying.

316
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,800
 Take a wheel into the house.

317
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
 That's what I would advise.

318
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,680
 The steering wheel are one of the actual wheels.

319
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
 Just so I take both.

320
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,400
 I pop the steering wheel into one of the main wheels and then I go.

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,040
 Actually his wife's key was in a Faraday cage when her car got stolen.

322
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
 I know.

323
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
 What's that?

324
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
 Which I don't really know.

325
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
 How they've done it.

326
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
 The problem with this is it's not the criminals.

327
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
 It's not the cars.

328
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
 It's not the microwaves.

329
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
 Okay.

330
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,520
 It's the keyless, bloody fobs.

331
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,520
 Why do they exist?

332
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
 It's the maddest system ever.

333
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
 My mum has it.

334
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,840
 And it's like what is the point in this?

335
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,320
 If you can't get up the energy or the wherewithal to insert some keys into your ignition.

336
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
 It's pretty cool though.

337
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,200
 Whenever I walk past my car, it just opens even if I don't want to go in it.

338
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 It's cool.

339
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
 Can you turn that off?

340
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
 It does it automatically.

341
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
 You can disable it and he wants to make you aware that if you want to disable it, you

342
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
 can disable it.

343
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 All right.

344
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,720
 I was reading a website that said, you know, the advantages of it, why you should get a

345
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 keyless fog.

346
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,600
 And the only bullet point is it allows you to start your car without being in the vehicle.

347
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,240
 That's true.

348
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,200
 Also, it does the coolest, I don't drive and I don't have this fob key.

349
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,200
 So I don't know.

350
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,240
 I mean, it would be insane for you to start with the key and work your way up to having

351
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
 a car.

352
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
 I got the key.

353
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,080
 It's just for those parties where you chuck them in the bar.

354
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
 Oh God.

355
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,320
 It's not actually a car that goes with that, I just got the key.

356
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:56,920
 But here's what she'll be incredibly disappointed in, getting onto your unicycle.

357
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,160
 She's already drawn the short straw.

358
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,440
 So when you have one of these fobs, if you're at a certain distance and you try to open

359
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,960
 it, the signal's too far for it to work, right?

360
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
 Okay.

361
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,480
 It's got a distance that it can go.

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,760
 So if you were standing at a distance, let's say just far away enough where it couldn't

363
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,240
 work, you can still stand at that same spot and make it work by using one simple trick.

364
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,880
 And that is holding the key to your head.

365
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 What?

366
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,160
 Who here knows that by round of cheers?

367
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
 Okay.

368
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,240
 So what does it do?

369
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,320
 So the idea is that our head is full of fluids, right?

370
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,680
 We have a lot of water in our heads.

371
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,000
 Some are the others.

372
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And water is a great conductor.

373
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 So when you hold it to your head, the signals that are being passed through are using that

374
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,760
 water to amplify the signal and you can open it from that spot you're standing at.

375
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,480
 No, it's like wearing metal boots in a lightning storm if you want to get struck.

376
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
 Yes.

377
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
 I think.

378
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 Wait, say it again.

379
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,280
 So it's something that conducts well in a lightning storm if you want to get hit by

380
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,280
 lightning, right?

381
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,000
 It's like a giant spike on your head or something.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Exactly.

383
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Holding another.

384
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,120
 Officers from Sheffield's Southeast neighborhood policing team came up with a way of stopping

385
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,640
 people from doing this key fob trick and their idea is to buy a second car that doesn't

386
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,200
 have keyless entry and use it to block in the other one.

387
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
 That's good.

388
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
 Oh, that's wonderful.

389
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
 That's great.

390
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
 Very clever.

391
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,040
 I'm very clever.

392
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,400
 Okay, here's a quiz.

393
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
 Oh, great.

394
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
 Oh, great.

395
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
 Okay.

396
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
 Answer the question as quickly as you can, right?

397
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
 Yeah.

398
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
 Okay, as quickly as you can.

399
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
 Just complete the sentence.

400
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,400
 That's the quiz.

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
 Yeah.

402
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,600
 If you switch off all the lights along the street, the number of thefts from people's

403
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,600
 cars increases.

404
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
 Increases.

405
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
 Right.

406
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
 It halves.

407
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
 This is so weird.

408
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,000
 If you turn off all the lights along the road.

409
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,480
 Because they can't find your car?

410
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,680
 Well, they know the cars are there.

411
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,000
 So there have been trials done into this.

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,560
 They're like turning off street lights after midnight.

413
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,000
 And it turned out that the thefts, not thefts of cars, theft from cars, right?

414
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,200
 So people breaking in, stealing the stuff.

415
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,760
 The thefts went from 12 per street per month to six per street per month.

416
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
 How come?

417
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:10,320
 Well, the thing is that it's really hard to see in the dark, and if you're waggling

418
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
 around the torch after midnight, that's quite conspicuous.

419
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,680
 It makes thieves feel a bit self-conscious.

420
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,080
 And they just sort of gravitate away towards other nearby streets which do have street

421
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 lights.

422
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 It's not just embarrassed.

423
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,080
 They're embarrassed.

424
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,640
 But then other nearby streets got more thefts during this trial period.

426
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,840
 So it is like you're just pushing the problem elsewhere.

427
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
 Okay.

428
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
 Yeah, but that works.

429
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
 Is that weird?

430
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
 Yeah, that's weird.

431
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
 Great quiz.

432
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
 Thank you.

433
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:40,040
 Do you know there's another way of protecting your car?

434
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,040
 The super rich do this in Singapore.

435
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,000
 So Andy, you said before, why not take a wheel inside?

436
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,280
 What they do in Singapore, and this is for people who live in high-rise buildings, they

437
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,360
 take the whole car inside.

438
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,880
 So this is for the super rich, because the super rich, they've got lots of perks and

439
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,520
 ways that they can hide their cars.

440
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,880
 When you're rich, you've got a few perks.

441
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,400
 One of these perks is that there are now buildings in Singapore whereby you go into an underground

442
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,280
 garage and you park your car there, and it goes on a slab.

443
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,160
 The slab goes into an elevator, and it's a special elevator that goes up to the floor

444
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
 of your building.

445
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,240
 It goes up to 40 floors up, goes up there, and then you have a glass partition between

446
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,240
 your house lounge room and then this extra garage room that hangs up there in the sky

447
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
 with you.

448
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,920
 The car on the slab gets put on there, and you can just see your car in your lounge

449
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,920
 room.

450
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,040
 And no one can get to it because it's 40 floors up.

451
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
 That's like Batman style.

452
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
 It really is.

453
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,160
 It's reverse Batman because he lives underground.

454
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
 In a cave.

455
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
 In a cave.

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 Upside down Batman.

457
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,960
 You could also remove your own kitchen and living room instead and knock down your front

458
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,840
 wall and make that a nice place to hide your car if you want to emulate these people.

459
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,440
 Just another way to keep your car safe.

460
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:57,280
 Did you guys read about the car thief a couple of weeks ago who hit the news it was in Rochdale

461
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
 for the clue?

462
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,720
 He stole a car and then he did that really stupid thing of going to a petrol station

463
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
 and then driving off without paying for petrol.

464
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,800
 Just don't draw attention to yourself.

465
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,800
 So the police are looking for him.

466
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,280
 They found the house where they thought he was.

467
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,760
 They searched the house and one of the police officers noticed a large teddy bear breathing

468
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,560
 and turned it upside down and he was inside the bear.

469
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:28,400
 It's the weirdest thing because the police, it was managed to police and they tweeted

470
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,400
 a picture of the bear.

471
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,400
 I saw it.

472
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,960
 It's got a little hole in its bum.

473
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,440
 Not big enough for even a baby.

474
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,440
 I would have thought.

475
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,240
 I don't know how he was getting in there.

476
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,240
 It was extraordinary.

477
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
 He must have really wriggled in among the stuffing.

478
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,880
 How long do you think you try and keep it up for once they say there's someone in that

479
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
 bear, isn't there?

480
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,120
 You just pretend to be one of those talking bears.

481
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
 That's what the movie Ted was.

482
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
 There was actually a man in there.

483
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,280
 The first ever vehicle alarm immobiliser system for a car was invented in 1921.

484
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,680
 There wasn't really, that technology didn't exist.

485
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,480
 It was just a freelance effort by an army captain who lived in Victoria in London and

486
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,400
 his motorbike kept being nicked and he was quite annoyed about it.

487
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
 His initial innovation was he would take out almost all the fuel so that if it was nicked

488
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,640
 it could go about a mile and then he'd just search a mile radius and he got the motorbike

489
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
 back.

490
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
 That's a good idea.

491
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
 That's a good idea.

492
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,920
 He thought he didn't want even that to happen again.

493
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:35,640
 So he attached a grenade to the motorbike and connected the pin to a nearby railing,

494
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,400
 meaning that if anyone ever drove off on the motorbike it would set off the grenade.

495
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
 Oh my God.

496
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,120
 Unfortunately for him the wind just blew the bike over one day.

497
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,480
 The explosion destroyed his bike and destroyed his car and destroyed a lot of the flat downstairs

498
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
 from him.

499
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
 Oh my God.

500
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,720
 There's one really advanced thing is a new Toyota patent.

501
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,920
 Basically when you walk into your car, or you walk into a car, the car can tell what

502
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,160
 your phone is, but like if it's in your pocket it can kind of detect your phone and then

503
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,600
 it will release a fragrance of your choosing.

504
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,280
 So if you're like, well I really like the smell of freshly mowed lawn, then whenever

505
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,520
 you get in the car it'll know you're there and it'll give you that.

506
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,760
 Has this car got like just a big bank of every cent possibly?

507
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,480
 At the moment it's a patent, so they might not have all of them.

508
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
 But like presumably...

509
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
 But you can mix it.

510
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 It's like printer ink, isn't it?

511
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
 Yeah, yeah.

512
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
 You can just combine, you know, like mowed grass, plush.

513
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
 Or you could just buy all of the scents that you want.

514
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,360
 Oh yeah, just get a big thing of toner for steak or whatever.

515
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,800
 You can't get a cart that smells like a steak, but you might do, right?

516
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 Yeah.

517
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,560
 But if he walks in the car it smells of steak, if I walk in it smells of fresh...

518
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,280
 What if we both get in the same car though, and then it's like a freshly mowed steak?

519
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
 That's going to be a weird crash.

520
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,920
 Like a cow in a field.

521
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
 Oh yeah, perfect.

522
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,360
 Everyone's favourite of smell, cows in fields.

523
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,480
 Anyway, the idea of this and one of the things that's genuinely in this patent is if someone

524
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,440
 gets in the car with a different phone so they realise that it's someone who shouldn't

525
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,480
 be there, then it can give tear gas instead of perfume.

526
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,160
 That's incredible.

527
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,600
 When you borrow your husband's phone for the day, that's a horrible journey.

528
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 Oh my God.

529
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,200
 So there's another thing with the key fobs, there's a Volvo whereby it can tell you,

530
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,120
 it's got a sensor that can tell you if there's a heartbeat in the car, so it can alert you

531
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
 to intruders.

532
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
 No, that's horrible.

533
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,520
 Is there someone hiding in your car?

534
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,400
 It's just like a huge teddy bear that's just appeared to your left-hand side.

535
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,040
 I think possibly there's two reasons for it.

536
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,000
 One is that if you closed the car door and you're in a rush and you've left your child

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,360
 in there, or your dog or something and you know how you forget leaving your child in

538
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,360
 a car.

539
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,440
 Just check in the car.

540
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,440
 That's why I'm not allowed to drive.

541
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,480
 I've lost six kids.

542
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,440
 But it's been used for intruders as well, it can just sort of say there's a heartbeat

543
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
 in your car.

544
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
 That's quite clever.

545
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,440
 Another very weird law that was passed, car-based, it was in 1928, Ministry of Transport passed

546
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
 an order.

547
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,120
 It made it illegal to lock your car if it was parked in public.

548
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
 It made it illegal.

549
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 Okay.

550
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 Illegal.

551
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
 Is that so?

552
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,240
 Because I know that in Manitoba or somewhere that you're not supposed to lock your cars

553
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,640
 in case there's like a polar bear and someone can hide in the car.

554
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 Is it?

555
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 Bingo.

556
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 Yeah, yeah.

557
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,000
 What it is is because there was so much traffic that was stopping people getting around because

558
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
 cars were taking off and cities weren't adapted for them, so it would be easier for the police

559
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,600
 to just move your car on if it was getting in people's way, so it was illegal to lock

560
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,240
 your car in public.

561
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,120
 Oh, so it wasn't the bear thing?

562
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,680
 It was similar to the bear thing.

563
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,080
 Because you made it sound like James had given the right arm.

564
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
 I did.

565
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
 I think I said the word...

566
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
 I was counting my points.

567
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
 I said the word bingo at one point.

568
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,840
 It's not a slam dunk bingo, but other people might need to use your car or move it around.

569
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,280
 Anyway, great quiz Andy.

570
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:11,760
 I can't believe I didn't get the university challenge.

571
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

572
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,560
 My fact this week is that scientists have successfully made a human hamster hybrid.

573
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,000
 They call it a hamster.

574
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,640
 So talk to us about your interpretation of the word successfully, scientists have successfully

575
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
 made the hybrid.

576
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,640
 Yeah, cool.

577
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,720
 Okay, so this is called the hamster test, and it is a scientific way of testing male infertility.

578
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,160
 So this came about because scientists, there's a lot of ethical questions and issues that

579
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,080
 you have when you're trying to test for infertility by using a human sperm and a human egg.

580
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,160
 So we needed alternatives for that.

581
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
 And fortunately...

582
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,560
 And this is a test of sperm as fertile, right?

583
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,840
 Yeah, it's testing of male sperm as fertile, and this goes for IVF and all that sort of

584
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
 stuff.

585
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,000
 And so using a female egg is not allowed, there's a lot of ethical questions with that.

586
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,240
 And so what happens is that they need another way of doing it, and fortunately our mammalian

587
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,560
 reproduction makeup means that there are a few animals that we can do that with.

588
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,360
 So one of the things that they do it with is hamster eggs, and when they use the hamster

589
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,520
 eggs what they do is they inject the sperm into it, but sometimes the sperm penetrates

590
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,040
 the hamster egg, and when it penetrates a hybrid embryo is created, a single cell embryo

591
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,680
 is created, and that's what scientists call the hamster.

592
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,800
 So when you say it's like a hybrid of a human and a hamster, it's not like a tiny human

593
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,960
 that can keep stuff in its cheeks on a massive hamster.

594
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,400
 I actually wrote to a bunch of scientists to ask if maybe one day hamsters will rule

595
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
 the earth.

596
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,800
 And a lot of them got back to me and said no.

597
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:59,400
 Well, actually there was one NHS doctor who's doing amazing, like really cutting edge stuff

598
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,680
 on trying to cure cancer, and he was like, give me five minutes.

599
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,480
 And he went off to find out, and he thinks that there is a way that you could eventually

600
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,040
 manufacture it to accommodate the cell, because the problem is that it just, it will die after

601
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,000
 a few days, or it'll split into two cells or something.

602
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,080
 That's not necessarily a problem.

603
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,400
 You need it to split into two cells.

604
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,400
 We're not single celled, are we?

605
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 No.

606
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,600
 The key is it needs to split, but they kill it before it splits, because that's bad.

607
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
 That's the point.

608
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,080
 But the point is we sometimes kill it before seeing if it can split into two, but the belief

609
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,640
 is it can split into two.

610
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,080
 So they quickly go, ooh, before it splits into three, that's my theory.

611
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
 But the reality is that it couldn't live, it just couldn't live.

612
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,440
 This doesn't happen whenever we have a sperm test, does it?

613
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,720
 They don't take, they don't go to the hamster lab.

614
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,200
 This is one way of doing it.

615
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,840
 I think there are other ways of checking it.

616
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,840
 Thank God.

617
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,600
 And I think it's not necessarily because the ethical things of using a human egg entirely,

618
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,760
 it's largely because human eggs are few and far between, because you can easily get a donor

619
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,080
 egg from a hamster, because you don't as often ask their permission, whereas it's quite hard.

620
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,880
 But yeah, it is also ethically easier, because it's a hamster.

621
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,760
 But also, there's a lot of question about when life begins, and that is one of the issues.

622
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,640
 If what happens here, what happens with the hamster, which is also, that's slightly an

623
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,160
 ethical debate, because I say, I've been asking scientists, so is that for just a second

624
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
 while it's alive?

625
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
 Is that a hamster?

626
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,160
 Is that a real thing?

627
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,960
 And they've all refused to answer, because it's a dodgy question, but it's also exciting

628
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,960
 that we could one day have hamsters.

629
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
 Because we don't have...

630
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,280
 I'm not going to wait for the version of Jurassic Park.

631
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,120
 Well, did you see, there was a script that was leaked, where Jurassic Park 4 was meant

632
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,280
 to be human dinosaur hybrids?

633
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,800
 No, I didn't see that.

634
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,760
 Well, you missed out, because there was conceptual art, and it looks awesome.

635
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,520
 It's like a man with dino legs running around, and that's what it was meant to be.

636
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,960
 I think technically Andy might be a hamster.

637
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,920
 Oh, yeah?

638
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,280
 We always put him in that wheel in the dressing room.

639
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
 Oh, my God!

640
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,400
 And the amount of shit you can get in your cheeks is insane.

641
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,480
 The reason being, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary for the word "humpster",

642
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 it does exist.

643
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,560
 There's one citation from 1670, and it's a person who expresses their approval by humming

644
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
 "hmmm".

645
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,720
 So if you ever do that, which you do do sometimes, you're a hamster.

646
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,800
 God, imagine if that's what a scientist created.

647
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,440
 How disappointed would we be?

648
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,440
 Wow.

649
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,440
 Andy.

650
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
 What an other name.

651
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
 What I find really interesting about this process of creating the hamster is that the

652
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,200
 sperm need to be incubated for 20 hours before they're introduced formally to the egg.

653
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,440
 Like a society ball.

654
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,240
 Yeah, they go to the dance, they've got little dance cards, but yeah, they're incubated

655
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
 before they are introduced.

656
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,360
 And this is because I didn't realise that inside a woman's body when a sperm is introduced

657
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:56,240
 in a conventional way, they have to capacitate for about 10 hours, which is the opposite

658
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
 of incapacitate, really.

659
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,840
 It takes them about 10 hours to get ready to fertilise, so they don't zoom in and they're

660
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,840
 all set.

661
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,080
 They zoom in and then they, well, it's a process called capacitation.

662
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,960
 Well, they just kind of hovered near the egg or what?

663
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,280
 So they hang around near the egg and they sort of like put a suit on and they get themselves

664
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,400
 all beefed up and ready to fertilise before doing it.

665
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,720
 Another part of it, which is quite interesting, is to get the eggs from the hamster in the

666
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 first place.

667
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,640
 And one way that they do that is that they treat the hamster with pregnant horse serum

668
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,720
 and you put some pregnant horse serum into the hamster and that will simultaneously make

669
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,760
 them produce about 40 eggs.

670
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,760
 Wow.

671
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,000
 So it's not only a human hamster hybrid, but then there's also a bit of horse in there

672
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 as well.

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
 Do you ever just think science doesn't do itself any favours?

674
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,360
 I feel a bit eckey about this.

675
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
 No.

676
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
 I mean, this is a kind of crossbred species.

677
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,440
 I mean, not one that's viable, but I've just been reading about hybrids and, you know,

678
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
 crosses between species.

679
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,120
 It's been going since 2,500 BC, the crossing of species with each other, but specifically

680
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,280
 by humans.

681
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
 So this was the thing that was found in Syria.

682
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,720
 It was a burial complex and they found about 25 skeletons and there weren't horses.

683
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,280
 They were kind of nearly horses, but they weren't quite.

684
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:15,400
 And they were a cross between a domestic donkey and a wild ass.

685
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
 Okay.

686
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,840
 So quite similar, very similar species, but not identical.

687
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,200
 And they were these mysterious creatures called kungas, which we don't have anymore,

688
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,960
 but they were highly prized.

689
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,160
 They were calmer than wild asses, but they were faster than donkeys.

690
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,480
 So they were useful for battles and they were used as royal vehicles.

691
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,760
 They used as dowries and marriages.

692
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,400
 And kungas just were a thing.

693
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,400
 Yeah.

694
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
 Four and a half thousand years ago.

695
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
 And a huge thing, right?

696
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
 They're all over the paintings and artworks.

697
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
 They're Mesopotamia.

698
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,400
 They were a big deal.

699
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,080
 The other thing about it is they're hard to make because they're infertile, so you

700
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,920
 create them and then they're sterile.

701
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,120
 So if you want a second kunga, you need to go out into the woods again and chase down

702
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,600
 one of these very fast, very strong wild asses again.

703
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
 And then somehow make it mate with a donkey.

704
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,160
 I mean, that's, that's difficult at the best of times.

705
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
 Have you heard of the country singer, American country singer?

706
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,440
 She's called Taylor Mu.

707
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,920
 And she, this is really interesting.

708
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,680
 She has a chunk of skin on her body, which is a different color to the rest of her.

709
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,680
 It was way darker.

710
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
 Oh, wow.

711
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,680
 She didn't know why for years.

712
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,680
 She was told it was a birthmark by doctors, seemed like the obvious explanation.

713
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,280
 Anyway, she found out she is her own twin sister.

714
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
 Okay.

715
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,920
 So in the womb, she was going to be twins, but the egg which would have become her

716
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:33,920
 sister fused with her egg, you know, while both of them were right at the tiny, tiny

717
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,920
 embryos stage.

718
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,240
 So that darker skin is from her sister's DNA.

719
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,320
 She's got two sets of DNA in her body basically, but she has two immune systems, two bloodstreams

720
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
 I wrote down.

721
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,960
 I'm not exactly clear on that.

722
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,520
 But she, she hasn't, yeah, I don't know, just move on past it.

723
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,800
 But she has, she also has lots of allergies because her body thinks that her sister's

724
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,520
 DNA is foreign DNA inside her body.

725
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,240
 But the weird thing is, remember I said her name at the start, Taylor Mule.

726
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
 Taylor Mule.

727
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,360
 A Mule is a hybridised.

728
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
 How did she not know?

729
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,240
 The clue was there.

730
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:22,000
 She was tailored, yeah.

731
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,040
 You can have human pig hybrids and these exist.

732
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:34,520
 The hope with these is that they'll be able to grow human-like organs inside pigs and

733
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,320
 then we'll be able to take them out of the pigs and put them into us and you'll be able

734
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,000
 to have that kind of thing.

735
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
 Have they got a fun name?

736
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
 What are they called?

737
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,520
 Well, see if you can guess.

738
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
 Oh, okay.

739
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,040
 So part human, part pig, anyone?

740
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
 Okay.

741
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
 Poo man.

742
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
 Poo man.

743
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
 Poo man.

744
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
 Poo man.

745
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
 Poo man.

746
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
 Poo man as in pee for pig and human.

747
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
 Yeah.

748
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
 Poo man.

749
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
 Poo man.

750
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
 Poo man.

751
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
 Poo man.

752
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
 Poo man.

753
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
 Poo man.

754
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
 Poo man.

755
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,040
 Poo man.

756
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,040
 Poo man.

757
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
 Poo man.

758
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
 Poo man.

759
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
 Poo man.

760
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
 Poo man.

761
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
 Poo man.

762
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,040
 Poo man.

763
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
 Poo man.

764
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
 Poo man.

765
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
 Poo man.

766
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
 Poo man.

767
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
 Poo man.

768
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
 Poo man.

769
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
 Poo man.

770
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
 Poo man.

771
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,040
 Poo man.

772
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,040
 Poo man.

773
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
 Poo man.

774
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
 Oh, yeah.

775
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
 Any suggestions?

776
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,040
 Hug.

777
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
 Yeah, exactly.

778
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 So Anna's got one point, James's got one point.

779
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
 I've only got two.

780
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
 Sorry, Dan.

781
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
 Great quiz, Andy.

782
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 Oh, wait.

783
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 I've got one more.

784
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 Yes.

785
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
 A rabbit.

786
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,040
 It's a rabbit and a cabbage.

787
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,040
 No, it's a radish and a cabbage.

788
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
 Sorry.

789
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
 A cabbage.

790
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,040
 It's the only animal that eats its own ears.

791
00:34:49,040 --> 00:35:01,040
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

792
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,040
 My fact is that cardboard is so valuable on the black market that it is nicknamed beige

793
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
 gold.

794
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
 Strap in.

795
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,040
 We're going to do 15 minutes on cardboard.

796
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,040
 Yeah.

797
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,040
 20 if you're unlucky.

798
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,040
 Beige gold.

799
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
 Beige gold price.

800
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,040
 So cardboard is incredibly valuable at the moment.

801
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,040
 Incredibly valuable.

802
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
 Incredibly valuable.

803
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,040
 More.

804
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 Okay.

805
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,040
 Prices were 70 pounds per ton.

806
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
 Give or take recently.

807
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
 Not very much.

808
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
 A ton of cardboard is a lot.

809
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
 Yeah.

810
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
 70 pounds is not very much.

811
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:36,040
 But when coronavirus started, the price shot up of cardboard.

812
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,040
 It doubled because there was so much more demand.

813
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
 Lots of people were stuck at home.

814
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
 Lots of people were doing online shopping.

815
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
 And the price just absolutely rocketed.

816
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
 And as a result of the price being very high, demand being massive, there have been cardboard

817
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
 heists.

818
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
 There have been cardboard -- wow.

819
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,040
 There's a cardboard mafia who were in operation in Europe.

820
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,040
 There's a whole cardboard crime network whose job is to steal cardboard.

821
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,040
 When you think you've cornered as the police, the cardboard mafia, and you get up close to

822
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,040
 them, does it turn out it's just a cut out of them that made their getaway minutes ago?

823
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,040
 That would be great.

824
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,040
 I did some maths.

825
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,040
 Oh, yeah.

826
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:19,040
 And for one kilogram of gold, if you wanted to have enough cardboard to be worth the same

827
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,040
 amount as one kilogram of gold, it would have to weigh about as much as the Statue of Liberty.

828
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
 Okay.

829
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 Okay.

830
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,040
 So valuable.

831
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,040
 Gold smuggling is still more valuable.

832
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,040
 If you want to set up a crime syndicate, drugs are still the way to go.

833
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,040
 But if you're a small timer, cardboard is the way.

834
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
 There was a thing in Madrid in 2018 to '19.

835
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
 This is even pre-COVID.

836
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,040
 Half the cardboard that people were putting out for recycling was stolen.

837
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
 But I would say, is that a problem?

838
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
 Yeah.

839
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,040
 If you're putting out cardboard to be recycled as someone else is stealing it rather than

840
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
 a normal recycling people --

841
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
 Well, who should --

842
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
 To me personally, the job's being done, right?

843
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
 Well, that's true.

844
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,040
 But it's in the hands of the gangs, then, I guess, who are going to -- they control the

845
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
 cardboard trade now.

846
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,040
 I don't know.

847
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,040
 And they'll corner the market.

848
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
 I don't know what they'll do with it.

849
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
 Well, they're making money out of it, basically.

850
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
 They would travel around the city basically before the cardboard recycling truck.

851
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
 And they would just go to every stop.

852
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
 They'd learn the routes.

853
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 They had dozens of people involved.

854
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
 Because they do sound like do-gooders.

855
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,040
 They sound like they've made more --

856
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,040
 I've made them sound wrong.

857
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,040
 They're hardcore criminals.

858
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,040
 If someone drives around collecting my rubbish, I don't care who does it.

859
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,040
 I know you don't care, but it's a big problem.

860
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
 Right.

861
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
 They're getting bullied in prison, is all I'm saying.

862
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
 They're fellow inmates.

863
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
 What are you in for?

864
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
 Voluntary recycling?

865
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,040
 So why don't the garbage men start half an hour early?

866
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,040
 They start early enough already, don't they?

867
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
 What's your answer?

868
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,040
 It's just the garbage men have to start earlier.

869
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,040
 That's not the way to deal with crime.

870
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
 It's for the victims to adapt.

871
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,040
 Do you have to have hard, tough, rough justice for these crooks?

872
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
 Yeah.

873
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
 Madrid, the city of Madrid, where this was happening.

874
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
 I would export it to Southeast Asia for pulping.

875
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,040
 So they're stealing other people's cardboard.

876
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,040
 I feel like there's not enough anger in the room about this.

877
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,040
 I just kind of feel like there might be other problems.

878
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
 I know.

879
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,040
 Madrid deliberately introduced dumpsters with tiny holes for cardboard so that the gangs

880
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,040
 couldn't climb in and get the cardboard out.

881
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
 They don't need to climb in.

882
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,040
 They got there half an hour before the actual fucking truck got there.

883
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
 What are you talking about?

884
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
 I'm just saying.

885
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,040
 Did the price go up because there was a shortage, because we were all ordering loads of stuff.

886
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
 That was part of it.

887
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
 Uncording cardboard, basically.

888
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,040
 And then Amazon bought a load of the available cardboard.

889
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
 So for a while at the start of COVID, people couldn't get eggs.

890
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,040
 That was because there were enough eggs going around, but there weren't the cardboard containers for the eggs.

891
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,040
 And you can't just drop eggs on people's doorsteps.

892
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
 Eggs are the worst thing to buy loose.

893
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
 So that was why you couldn't get eggs, right?

894
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,040
 But I don't remember there being an egg shortage during those.

895
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
 There was.

896
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
 That was a huge egg shortage.

897
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
 I didn't remember that.

898
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
 How was the divide?

899
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
 I would say egg and loo roll were the two big ones.

900
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
 Really?

901
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
 Hell yeah.

902
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:12,040
 I was in the countryside and the farmhouse next to us used to put freshly laid chicken eggs out every morning.

903
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
 Six of them.

904
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
 And I used to go about 7am already gone.

905
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,040
 Have you tried going a bit earlier?

906
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,040
 What was he putting the eggs out for?

907
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
 Sorry, for you.

908
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,040
 Well, in the country, people always put eggs if they've got chickens outside and say,

909
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
 "Hey, drop a pound in and take four eggs."

910
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
 All gone.

911
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,040
 But speaking of eggs, Easter eggs used to be made of cardboard.

912
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
 What?

913
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,040
 In very disappointing times for children at Easter before they were made of chocolate.

914
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,040
 And they were actually really beautiful.

915
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,040
 So in the 19th century, they would have beautiful scenes kind of drawn on them.

916
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,040
 So shortly after the kind of invention of cardboard.

917
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:53,040
 And then they'd be covered in satin and they'd still be in two halves and you get your sweets inside.

918
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,040
 But yeah, the egg itself, don't eat it.

919
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,040
 Do you know what the first thing you ever put in a cardboard box was?

920
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,040
 Oh, great.

921
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
 Good question though, isn't it?

922
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
 Can we work it out?

923
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,040
 Oh, no.

924
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 I would say not in a thousand years.

925
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
 Another smaller cardboard box.

926
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
 Oh great, that's no.

927
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,040
 Okay.

928
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
 Something small.

929
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
 Was it?

930
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
 Fly.

931
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,040
 Animals, yeah.

932
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
 Oh no, a moth, it was a moth.

933
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
 No.

934
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,040
 Yes, it was.

935
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,040
 Wow.

936
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
 There's a new tactic here.

937
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
 Just on right.

938
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
 Very close.

939
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,040
 It was a silkworm.

940
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
 Oh, cool.

941
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,040
 They were invented apparently in Valriac in Provence.

942
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,040
 Silkworms.

943
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
 You know, cardboard boxes.

944
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,040
 Because there was a guy who was, he was making silk and he was in bringing the silkworms over from China.

945
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,040
 And his silkworms kept dying.

946
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:48,040
 And so he went to a local wig maker and asked him if there was anything that he could do.

947
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,040
 And this wig maker made these kind of cardboard boxes with holes in which he invented.

948
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,040
 And this is according to the cardboard box museum in France.

949
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,040
 It sounds amazing.

950
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,040
 Yeah.

951
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
 It does sound really interesting.

952
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
 Yeah, Valriac.

953
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,040
 And it says it's the historical capital of French cardboard.

954
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,040
 It's quite a lot of qualifications.

955
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,040
 I don't think there are any other cardboard museums.

956
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
 So just on the invention of cardboard.

957
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
 Yeah.

958
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
 Did you guys come across Malcolm Thornhill in your research?

959
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
 Malcolm?

960
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
 No.

961
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
 Okay.

962
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
 There's this fact all over the internet, right?

963
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,040
 And it's that cardboard was invented in 1817 when Sir Malcolm Thornhill started using thick sheets of paper to make boxes.

964
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
 And they weren't like modern cardboard.

965
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
 They were just single sheets of cardboard.

966
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,040
 So they weren't corrugated and, you know, firm and great like modern cardboard boxes.

967
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,040
 And if that is true, that means that theoretically Jane Austen could have used a cardboard box.

968
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,040
 Because that was the year she died, 1817.

969
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
 That's huge.

970
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,040
 That's huge.

971
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,040
 The only problem is, it is definitely not true.

972
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
 It's all over the internet.

973
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
 It's on Wikipedia.

974
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
 It's been taken off the internet and put into books as a result of which...

975
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,040
 And what's your evidence that it's not true?

976
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,040
 There's no evidence of Malcolm Thornhill being real.

977
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
 Oh, your sister.

978
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
 There's just no...

979
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,040
 You search for Malcolm Thornhill in 19th century sources.

980
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
 There's nothing.

981
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,040
 But the problem is, now that it's been taken off Wikipedia, where it was with no evidence.

982
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,040
 There wasn't any resource and put in a book.

983
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
 It's now been sourced on Wikipedia to the books.

984
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,040
 Which say that Malcolm Thornhill invented it in 1817.

985
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,040
 It's a thing called cytogenesis on Wikipedia.

986
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,040
 Which is where something is this awful circular loop.

987
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,040
 But no, there's no way of getting rid of it.

988
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,040
 You're exploding this very little known myth.

989
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
 That's my thing now.

990
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,040
 Don't go home tonight and tell each other Malcolm Thornhill invented cardboard in 1817.

991
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
 Yeah, yeah.

992
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
 If there's one thing you don't say to each other after the show tonight, don't say that.

993
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,040
 I don't say that even if it was true, to be honest.

994
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,040
 As a conversation starter over dinner.

995
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,040
 I got a good one-question quiz.

996
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,040
 Wow, it's been a real quiz episode tonight, hasn't it?

997
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,040
 Yeah, so here we go.

998
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
 Yeah, so it's one quiz question.

999
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
 Fingers on buzzers.

1000
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:47,040
 This is a kind of cardboard.

1001
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,040
 What is it used for?

1002
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
 It's called a zarf.

1003
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,040
 Scarfs.

1004
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
 Buzz.

1005
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
 Oh, it didn't buzz.

1006
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,040
 Ah.

1007
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,040
 Putting scarves in.

1008
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 Putting scarves in.

1009
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 No, yeah, no.

1010
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,040
 I was going to say scarves for zebras.

1011
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,040
 Zebra scarves.

1012
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,040
 Zarf.

1013
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,040
 Oh, we're going back into hybrids.

1014
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1015
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
 Yeah.

1016
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
 It's not that, is it?

1017
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,040
 It's absolutely that.

1018
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,040
 You guys just jammed some crazy fucking idea.

1019
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
 No, it's obviously not that.

1020
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,040
 What is it?

1021
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,040
 A zarf is, and everyone's used zarfs,

1022
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,040
 but you just didn't know what it was called.

1023
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
 You know, when you go to a coffee shop,

1024
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,040
 and you get a coffee, and it's a bit too hot,

1025
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 and they put a little sleeve of cardboard over it?

1026
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,040
 That's a zarf.

1027
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,040
 It's a scarf for a cup.

1028
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,040
 A zarf.

1029
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,040
 That's brilliant.

1030
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,040
 Okay, great.

1031
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
 And where's that come from?

1032
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,040
 Just made up by someone.

1033
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:33,040
 Yeah, I mean, it's been,

1034
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,040
 zarfs have been used apparently.

1035
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,040
 So there's an amazing writer who is called,

1036
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
 what's his name again?

1037
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,040
 I've read so many of his books, A.J. Jacobs.

1038
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,040
 Is it on the next page?

1039
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
 Yeah, I got it.

1040
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
 Whereas, I think his name's A.J. Jacobs.

1041
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 He wrote the book where he read the entire Encyclopedia,

1042
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,040
 and he did this book where he went around thanking people

1043
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
 who had anyway played a part

1044
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
 in making a cup of coffee that you would drink.

1045
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,040
 So he went around the world going,

1046
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,040
 thank you for this.

1047
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,040
 And one of the people he went to thank was,

1048
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,040
 were makers of zarfs, which was this item.

1049
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
 So, but he says that they were used as far back

1050
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
 as ancient China, just they were,

1051
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,040
 or they were different material.

1052
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
 They weren't necessarily thick.

1053
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,040
 Malcolm Thornhill hadn't even been born yet.

1054
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,040
 I think they would have been like a marble or something,

1055
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,040
 but you would put it around a hot drink,

1056
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,040
 and it would be a holder.

1057
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,040
 I don't know.

1058
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,040
 You think they were making coffee holders out of marble?

1059
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
 I don't know.

1060
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,040
 It just wasn't cardboard.

1061
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,040
 Thornhill didn't.

1062
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,040
 That's amazing.

1063
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,040
 How many Starbucks do you think you'd have to go into

1064
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,040
 and ask to have a zarf around my coffee?

1065
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,040
 One of them to know what the fuck you were talking about.

1066
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,040
 Cardboard was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame

1067
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,040
 in 2005.

1068
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
 Ah, the cardboard box.

1069
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,040
 The cardboard box.

1070
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,040
 Obviously the idea being, if you get a present,

1071
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
 the cardboard box is often more interesting to a kid

1072
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
 than the actual toy itself.

1073
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,040
 And it's such a fun,

1074
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,040
 I love how lateral they think when they induct the toys

1075
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,040
 into the Hall of Fame.

1076
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,040
 So last year's toys that went in,

1077
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,040
 one of the things that were inducted as one of the great toys

1078
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 was sand.

1079
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,040
 They're running low on the toys, aren't they?

1080
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,040
 I think a stick was one of the first.

1081
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,040
 Yeah, a stick was once put in.

1082
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,040
 So last year was sand, risk, and American girl dolls.

1083
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,040
 Is it so that when you give your kids presents at Christmas,

1084
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:17,040
 you can say, "Well, I got you something from the Hall of Fame."

1085
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
 It's award-winning.

1086
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,040
 Do you want to hear one more cardboard crime?

1087
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,040
 Yeah, go on.

1088
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:22,040
 Sure.

1089
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,040
 You can use cardboard to smuggle a cocaine.

1090
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,040
 Sure, okay.

1091
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,040
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

1092
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
 Sure you can, just put the cocaine in the box.

1093
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
 Or what's the point of smuggling cocaine

1094
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
 when cardboard's so fucking expensive?

1095
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,040
 Yeah, okay.

1096
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,040
 In 2020, the Spanish police, also Spain,

1097
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,040
 like the Madrid cardboard smuggling ring,

1098
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040
 the Spanish police, they smashed a gang

1099
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,040
 who had put cocaine into cardboard boxes to smuggle it.

1100
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,040
 Now, they hadn't just put cocaine into the boxes,

1101
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,040
 they put it into the box.

1102
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,040
 The cardboard box was partly made of cocaine.

1103
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,040
 That's clever.

1104
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
 They had liquefied the cocaine

1105
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,040
 and then kind of impregnated it into the cardboard boxes.

1106
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,040
 But then the problem was they put actual cocaine

1107
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,040
 inside the cocaine cowboy box.

1108
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
 That's really clever.

1109
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
 And then once you get the box to the other end,

1110
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
 you just extract it chemically, cocaine.

1111
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
 Perfect.

1112
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,040
 A fun toy for the kid, a fun toy for the pair.

1113
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
 That's not sand!

1114
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,040
 Guys, we're going to have to wrap up really soon.

1115
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,040
 Do you remember the anti-sex beds?

1116
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,040
 Speaking of cardboard.

1117
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,040
 Oh, I think I got one by mistake.

1118
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
 Sorry.

1119
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,040
 I was just possessed by a comedian from the '70s

1120
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,040
 for a second there.

1121
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,040
 What was that?

1122
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,040
 The ghost of Les Dawson has blessed me with his presence.

1123
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,040
 We're honoured to have him here.

1124
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,040
 The anti-sex beds were the Tokyo Olympics.

1125
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,040
 You alright, Dan?

1126
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,040
 That's the weirdest thing I've seen how to do.

1127
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,040
 He genuinely looked suggestive.

1128
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,040
 He looked...

1129
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,040
 Sorry.

1130
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,040
 It was a character.

1131
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
 And then it was a really good joke.

1132
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,040
 Come on, Dan. We're so near the end.

1133
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,040
 Tokyo Olympics, they had anti-sex beds,

1134
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
 and they weren't actually anti-sex beds.

1135
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,040
 They were just made of cardboard.

1136
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,040
 And the idea of anti-sex was that it was so flimsy

1137
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,040
 you couldn't have sex in them.

1138
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
 But the reason they had them at the Olympics

1139
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
 was to discourage the athletes from having sex

1140
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,040
 because it damages your game.

1141
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
 But they were fine for sex anyway, so it wouldn't have discouraged it.

1142
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,040
 They were good for sex.

1143
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:51,040
 They definitely did not get an anti-sex bed.

1144
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,040
 There are so many reasons.

1145
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:04,040
 OK, that's it.

1146
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,040
 That is all of our facts.
