WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we wanted to really highly recommend to you

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.960
 a new book that's just about to come out on the market.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.160
 It's called The Theory of Everything Else and it is by an author you may have heard

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.160
 of.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.160
 Oh, Lee Child.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.400
 It's so close.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.400
 Richard Osman.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 You're a bit further away now actually.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.040
 Go back to the Lee Child direction.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.120
 It's Dan Schreiber's book, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.120
 Yay!

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.800
 Dan has written a book, it's called The Theory of Everything Else and if you listen to fish,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.160
 you already know what it's about.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.960
 It's about all the craziest, strangest theories that people have believed about all sorts of

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.040
 things around the world.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.680
 You want the Titanic, it's in there.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.400
 You want aliens, they're in there.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.680
 You want Nicholas Wichelt, the BBC's royal correspondent, living on the banks of Loch

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.240
 Ness, trying to find Nessie for several months earlier in his career.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 That's in there.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.240
 And who doesn't want that?

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.720
 It's what we've always wanted.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.600
 Dan's been cooking up this book for as long as I've known him.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.280
 Genuinely, it's been absolutely worth the wait.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.920
 Every single page is a story that you absolutely won't believe.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.280
 So it's about these weird ideas, people with these bizarre beliefs, but who somehow end

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.560
 up changing the world.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.600
 It's about how these beliefs end up to have been logical.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.880
 It's basically about how we should never dismiss what seems like lunacy because sometimes

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.480
 it can turn out to be genius and it is the most incredible read.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.400
 Yeah, and that is the motto actually for recording episodes of the podcast with Dan.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.960
 So you already know what you're going to get.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.440
 If you want to check it out, just find The Theory of Everything Else.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.040
 There is also a website attached which will have all the additional notes and videos and

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.040
 updates.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.600
 That's theoryofeverythingelse.co.uk.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.600
 Guys, this is Dan's first book.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.320
 We'd love it to be a monster hit, so get yourself a copy right now.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.320
 Yes, please do.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.960
 I kind of want to just read your transcript of the whole thing because all the characters,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.840
 all the stories in it are incredible.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.920
 So please go there, help out Dan and read, you know, the most interesting book of your

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.920
 year.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.640
 If you want to see The Theory of Everything Else, you can pre-order it now, or it's out

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.320
 next week, October the 13th.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.440
 Get to a bookshop and buy it.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.440
 On with the show!

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.440
 On with the podcast.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:20.880
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:28.600
 this week, coming to you live from Inverness!

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.520
 My name is Dan Shriver.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.400
 I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.280
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.840
 the last seven days.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is James.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.680
 Okay, my fact this week is that you can catch chlamydia from dead parrots.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.680
 Darling!

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:05.680
 What do you have to do with dead parrots to catch chlamydia from them?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.560
 Well, it's a bacterium, chlamydia.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120
 This is actually called Cytocosis, and it's kind of known as parrot fever, but it's a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.640
 type of chlamydia, and the bacterium can come from the parrot to you through mouth to beak

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640
 contact.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.640
 Mm-hmm.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640
 Yeah.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640
 Yeah.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.640
 Sexy stuff.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200
 Or the airborne inhalation of feather dust, feces, or respiratory secretions.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200
 Less sexy stuff.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 Yeah.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.680
 So it can come from mouth to beak.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.600
 There was actually, I was looking in some old newspaper archives about this, and I found

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.000
 a 1992 cutting from the Press and Journal that reported on a teacher from Inverness who

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.760
 caught chlamydia from a dead parrot that he apparently found in his garden.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.640
 Don't have a parrot in you, why are you suggesting?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.960
 He might have been giving it life because of life by then.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.200
 Well, the article said that he said that he didn't touch it with his hands.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:12.600
 I don't know why you need to specify that, and also that he didn't want to be named.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600
 Okay.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600
 Wow.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600
 Is he in?

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.240
 Are you in?

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.440
 Everyone knows him in this room, I think.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440
 Yeah.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 Wow.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 Wow.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440
 So do we know if he recovered?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440
 Yeah, he did.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.440
 Oh, great.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.320
 And to be honest, it can be quite serious.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320
 Yeah.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.520
 Certainly when it first came about, Citicosis, and became like a bit of a pandemic or an

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.600
 epidemic really in America and as few other places, but it was in various parts of the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600
 world.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600
 This was in the 1920s.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.200
 It had a really high death rate.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.880
 If you were over 35 and you caught it, it was something like 25% of people died.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880
 Yeah, it was crazy.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.320
 And it was a proper panic, wasn't it?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.320
 The freak's out.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.360
 Yeah, and the papers, to begin with, they said that it was found initially, sort of like

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.600
 the first case that was mentioned was in Argentina, and it was on a sailor who wasn't really a

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 sailor.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 He was an actor, and it was his stage parrot that gave it to him, and that, so they traced

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600
 it to that.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.280
 But then it was all these cases in America where people were trying to work out why these

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.480
 people were suddenly dying.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.520
 But that's a good contact to have, isn't it, as in if you're a stage, did he say he was

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520
 a sailor?

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.360
 He was a sailor with a stage parrot on his shoulder.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.040
 But he was a stage sailor.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.440
 You said he was a sailor, but then you said he wasn't an actual sailor, right?

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.760
 He was just a sailor on stage.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:23.760
 I know.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.280
 I delivered it in my head like it was a cool Dan Brown plot twist, but then I realised.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.640
 In actual fact, it wasn't on his shoulder.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.760
 In this play, it was in a cage, but all of the people in the play had to go and stroke

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760
 the parrot.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760
 So it wasn't on his shoulder.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.400
 He kept going over and stroking it.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.720
 Eight of the cast got sick, and two of them died after this play.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720
 How do you know?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.280
 This was in 1930, and as a result, 90% of Argentina's parrots were killed.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280
 Rough.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.280
 What?

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
 Really rough.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.560
 And this was, the rumor always was that the Argentinians brought it over.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.000
 It was the classic, you know, like the Chinese disease.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.200
 It was, as you know, Donald Trump was referred to the Chinese disease, that wasn't me doing

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200
 that.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200
 Yeah.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.920
 He said that quite a long time ago now, so that just came across as a year.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.880
 You've got to be careful with these references, don't you?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.280
 Make sure they're up to date.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.320
 So on the East Coast, there were all these rumors that had come from Argentina, and in

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:24.480
 fact, the outbreak began, they think, in December 1929, and it was a man in Maryland who bought

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.920
 a parrot as a present for his wife, and not only that, he stored it with his daughter

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.000
 and son-in-law before he gave it to his wife.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.040
 You know, can I hide this parrot with you?

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.200
 Anyway, three of them got seriously ill.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.040
 Not the guy who bought the parrot, actually, just the other three.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.000
 And this guy, Dr. Martin, went and visited them.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.720
 And he said, "I had the weirdest case today.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.200
 These three people are sick."

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.780
 And she asked him about it, and he eventually said, "Yeah, weirdly, the only other person

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.160
 who was sick in the room was their pet parrot, who I think is about to die."

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.720
 And his wife said, "Do you know what, that's so weird, because I was just reading the sort

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.120
 of gossip pages of my magazine, and apparently there's this parrot sickness in Argentina."

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.180
 And it was that conversation, she'd been happened to read this obscure article, and

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.600
 I asked them, "That sounds like nonsense, but whatever, we'll chase it up."

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.480
 And it was that parrot sickness that kicked it all off.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.680
 Of course, their magazine has got...

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680
 He magazine was very different.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.320
 She says it wasn't no fair with Katie Price.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.520
 He says it was Chlamydia from a dead parrot.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.520
 It's called...

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.520
 Hello!

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520
 Hello!

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520
 Very good.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.600
 They always talk in the end.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.720
 That was a hugely significant parrot fever outbreak, because the doctor who'd been working

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.400
 on it, it was a guy called Charles Armstrong.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.160
 He fell really ill after treating the patients who'd got it, the guy who'd bought it, Mr.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160
 Martin.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.680
 He was almost going to die, the doctor, Charles Armstrong.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:48.080
 Another doctor injected him with the blood of a patient who had survived parrot fever,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.080
 not doing any of the tests about, you know, the...

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.400
 I think the blood type or anything like that was a very primitive procedure, but he lived.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.320
 Charles Armstrong, the doctor, lived, and that entire incident led to the founding of

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.680
 America's National Institute of Health.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680
 No.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.000
 So it's a big result from one parrot fever outbreak.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.320
 I should also say, actually, just going back to the original fact, which is that you can

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:12.480
 catch it from dead parrots.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.000
 This came from a study at the University of Adelaide and the University of the Sunshine

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 Coast, which sounds quite amazing, by Annalise Chaber and Et Al, and they've described sometimes

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.160
 when people have been dissecting parrots and then got pneumonia a little bit later, and

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.280
 then they checked the bodies and found that they actually caught it from the parrots when

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280
 they were dead already.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280
 Yeah, right.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.960
 So most of these people were talking about they were catching it from quite a sickly

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.920
 parrot, but these people have been catching it from an actual dead parrot and the guy

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.400
 from Inverness as well.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.280
 I remember every dead parrot I've ever kissed, I have to say, so I'd know because it was

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.520
 known as Old Maid's Pneumonia because, you know, parrots were all the rage then.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.040
 People used to go door-to-door selling parrots to sad women whose husbands had died.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.480
 Again, this was the stereotype, that's what Donald Trump would have called them, that's

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.920
 not what I'm calling them.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.360
 And the rumor was that they'd all been snogging their parrots because they were so sad and

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360
 lonely and widowed.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360
 What?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.320
 And so that's why it was called Old Maid's Pneumonia, it said they were all getting chlamydia

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.880
 from them, and it's not, you're just breathing in the air around the parrot, okay?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:23.640
 Well, 63% of the people who got the citicosis at the time of the big outbreak were women.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.840
 They did own parrots much more often, but we don't know that they were sticking their

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840
 tongues down their throats.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:34.040
 And this was devastating for parrots, like the panic really hit and everyone took it

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.640
 seriously, so there were stories about how in the US Navy the admirals were ordering

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.440
 anyone who had a parrot on board just to let them off over.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.400
 Why have you got a parrot on a serious Navy vessel?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400
 They're at sea.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.400
 It's not...

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.400
 Who doesn't bring a parrot to sea?

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.960
 It's not a pirate ship, where do you think pirates get their parrots?

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.280
 Pirates have parrots, sailors don't have parrots, that should be how you can tell the difference

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.560
 between a pirate and a normal, law-abiding sailor.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560
 Very good point.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.000
 Yeah, you check the leg, you check the pieces of eight, and then you check the parrot.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.480
 Can't chlamydia kind of damage your eyes as well, can it?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480
 You check for...

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 Eyepatches.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 Eyepatches.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 Eyepatches.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
 Exactly.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480
 Okay.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.400
 So what do you say it was devastating for parrots because they could no longer accompany sailors

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400
 on their journey?

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.800
 No, it was a sort of mass death of parrots who were just thrown out to sea was more the

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.800
 angle.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.280
 I want to thank you, the poor sailors, and their pirate credentials.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.680
 Those poor parrots, which can fly, they'll be fine.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.560
 They can't fly a hundred miles back to land.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.160
 Do you know you can get chlamydia from house flies?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160
 Really?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.160
 Yeah.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.040
 How do you do, what do you have to do with them?

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:46.480
 Well, annoyingly, I don't know if you guys saw what you want to see, but I dropped my

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:51.520
 notes just before we came out here and I can't, it's on the next page and I can't find the

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520
 reason for it.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.340
 It was the worst excuse in eight years of podcasting we've had for why you can't back

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.880
 up one of your outlandish plays.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880
 It's of experience.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.880
 You dropped your notes.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:01.880
 Oh yeah.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880
 And then the dog ran off with the page.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880
 No, I swear to God.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880
 I've been trying to find it.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880
 No, absolutely.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880
 It might be backstage.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.080
 I've got a line that says with guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis as an animal model,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.920
 jokes about wives it seems, have always been fair game, so that's the next page.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920
 So yeah.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.920
 But apparently you can get chlamydia from house flies.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 That's a rumour going round.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.920
 Good to know.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.520
 Careful what you do with those blue bottles.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.880
 Do you want to hear another parrot thing?

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.880
 Oh yeah.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880
 Okay.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.000
 Are you guys familiar with a guy called Noel Fitzpatrick?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 Noel Fitzpatrick.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.600
 He's on a show called Super Vet.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:38.940
 Anyway, he has a book which is sort of memoirs of a career, a vetting career and there was

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.360
 a time when he had to operate on a parrot, but the problem was he couldn't anesthetise

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360
 it.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.520
 You know, the anesthetic wasn't suitable.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.800
 It might have died if you tried to put it under, so he had to just hold it on the X-ray

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.800
 machine.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.680
 I'm quoting him directly here.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.480
 He kept looking up at me and asking, "What are you doing?

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.480
 What are you doing?"

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.320
 I kept trying to keep him quiet and maybe a few choice phrases escaped from my big Irish

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.880
 mouth in the process.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:06.560
 We completed the radiographs, gave the medication and as I was handing him back to the dear,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.960
 sweet elderly lady who was his companion, he jumped on the lady's arm, craved his neck

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:17.960
 and shouted merrily, "Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up!"

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:25.360
 I can't tell you how scared I am that that's going to be my daughter's first word.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:33.540
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:39.320
 My fact this week is that the head of the AA keeps his car keys in the microwave and

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:45.800
 I've just realised that I should specify which of the AA's I mean this fact is because he's

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.400
 constantly shit-faced.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:56.120
 It's a safety thing in both instances and then it's just too pissed to open it.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.120
 No, because the head of the AA wouldn't be drunk.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.760
 But this is the head of the automobile association, it's a guy called Edmund King and he's very

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.760
 safety conscious.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.000
 He's emerging on paranoid I would say, he did an interview recently with the Telegraph

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.960
 where he says he's got one of these car keys that remotely unlocks your car.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:13.960
 A fob.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960
 A fob.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960
 Yeah.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.880
 A fob and he keeps it in a Faraday cage, so in this leather bag with a wire mesh lining

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.440
 and a red metal box, so a cage that can't let through any electromagnetic field and

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.080
 after he's got it in that Faraday cage he puts it inside a microwave and he's put the

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.640
 microwave right at the back of the house as far away from the car as possible and so every

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.840
 time he wants to drive somewhere it's a real hassle for him.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.120
 He either he or his wife had their car next.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120
 It's his wife.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120
 Yeah.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120
 Yeah.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.640
 If you have one of the keyless keys basically, that's not, you know what I mean.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:49.640
 A keyless fob.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.200
 It's sort of something like 50 times likely to have your car stolen because it's easier

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 to hack the thing.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.800
 Do you not think you would wait until like lunchtime when he's making a baked potato or

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.280
 something in a microwave and just steal his car?

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.280
 Exactly.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.280
 Yeah.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.400
 So it's an amplifier and transmitter thing.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.720
 This is how they get your car.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.820
 So most people if they have this key fob they might leave it near the front door just sitting

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:14.240
 in on a console table or something like that and two criminals will be involved.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.920
 One will go next to the door and they'll have an amplifier while the other stands next to

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.600
 the door with a transmitter.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600
 I can't remember which way.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600
 One goes next to the house door near the key.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600
 One goes next to the car door.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600
 One goes next to the car door.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
 One goes next to the car door.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600
 They amplify the signal.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.600
 It comes to the car door.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600
 They can open it and steal it.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600
 Yeah.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
 But that happens a lot as you were saying.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.800
 Take a wheel into the house.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.400
 That's what I would advise.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.680
 The steering wheel are one of the actual wheels.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.200
 Just so I take both.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.400
 I pop the steering wheel into one of the main wheels and then I go.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.040
 Actually his wife's key was in a Faraday cage when her car got stolen.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.040
 I know.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.040
 What's that?

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.040
 Which I don't really know.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040
 How they've done it.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040
 The problem with this is it's not the criminals.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.040
 It's not the cars.

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040
 It's not the microwaves.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.040
 Okay.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.520
 It's the keyless, bloody fobs.

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.520
 Why do they exist?

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.520
 It's the maddest system ever.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.520
 My mum has it.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.840
 And it's like what is the point in this?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.320
 If you can't get up the energy or the wherewithal to insert some keys into your ignition.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.320
 It's pretty cool though.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.200
 Whenever I walk past my car, it just opens even if I don't want to go in it.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200
 It's cool.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.200
 Can you turn that off?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.200
 It does it automatically.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.200
 You can disable it and he wants to make you aware that if you want to disable it, you

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200
 can disable it.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200
 All right.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.720
 I was reading a website that said, you know, the advantages of it, why you should get a

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:22.720
 keyless fog.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.600
 And the only bullet point is it allows you to start your car without being in the vehicle.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.240
 That's true.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:34.200
 Also, it does the coolest, I don't drive and I don't have this fob key.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
 So I don't know.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.240
 I mean, it would be insane for you to start with the key and work your way up to having

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.240
 a car.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.240
 I got the key.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.080
 It's just for those parties where you chuck them in the bar.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.080
 Oh God.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.320
 It's not actually a car that goes with that, I just got the key.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:56.920
 But here's what she'll be incredibly disappointed in, getting onto your unicycle.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.160
 She's already drawn the short straw.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:05.440
 So when you have one of these fobs, if you're at a certain distance and you try to open

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.960
 it, the signal's too far for it to work, right?

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960
 Okay.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.480
 It's got a distance that it can go.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.760
 So if you were standing at a distance, let's say just far away enough where it couldn't

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:20.240
 work, you can still stand at that same spot and make it work by using one simple trick.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.880
 And that is holding the key to your head.

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880
 What?

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.160
 Who here knows that by round of cheers?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.160
 Okay.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.240
 So what does it do?

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.320
 So the idea is that our head is full of fluids, right?

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.680
 We have a lot of water in our heads.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.000
 Some are the others.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
 And water is a great conductor.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
 So when you hold it to your head, the signals that are being passed through are using that

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.760
 water to amplify the signal and you can open it from that spot you're standing at.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.480
 No, it's like wearing metal boots in a lightning storm if you want to get struck.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 Yes.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.480
 I think.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480
 Wait, say it again.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.280
 So it's something that conducts well in a lightning storm if you want to get hit by

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.280
 lightning, right?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.000
 It's like a giant spike on your head or something.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
 Exactly.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 Holding another.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.120
 Officers from Sheffield's Southeast neighborhood policing team came up with a way of stopping

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.640
 people from doing this key fob trick and their idea is to buy a second car that doesn't

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.200
 have keyless entry and use it to block in the other one.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.200
 That's good.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.200
 Oh, that's wonderful.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200
 That's great.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200
 Very clever.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.040
 I'm very clever.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.400
 Okay, here's a quiz.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.400
 Oh, great.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.400
 Oh, great.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.400
 Okay.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400
 Answer the question as quickly as you can, right?

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400
 Yeah.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.400
 Okay, as quickly as you can.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.400
 Just complete the sentence.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.400
 That's the quiz.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.400
 Yeah.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.600
 If you switch off all the lights along the street, the number of thefts from people's

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.600
 cars increases.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.600
 Increases.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600
 Right.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600
 It halves.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600
 This is so weird.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.000
 If you turn off all the lights along the road.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.480
 Because they can't find your car?

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.680
 Well, they know the cars are there.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.000
 So there have been trials done into this.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.560
 They're like turning off street lights after midnight.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.000
 And it turned out that the thefts, not thefts of cars, theft from cars, right?

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.200
 So people breaking in, stealing the stuff.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.760
 The thefts went from 12 per street per month to six per street per month.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760
 How come?

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:10.320
 Well, the thing is that it's really hard to see in the dark, and if you're waggling

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.160
 around the torch after midnight, that's quite conspicuous.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.680
 It makes thieves feel a bit self-conscious.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.080
 And they just sort of gravitate away towards other nearby streets which do have street

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.080
 lights.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.080
 It's not just embarrassed.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.080
 They're embarrassed.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.640
 But then other nearby streets got more thefts during this trial period.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.840
 So it is like you're just pushing the problem elsewhere.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840
 Okay.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840
 Yeah, but that works.

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840
 Is that weird?

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840
 Yeah, that's weird.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840
 Great quiz.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840
 Thank you.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.040
 Do you know there's another way of protecting your car?

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.040
 The super rich do this in Singapore.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.000
 So Andy, you said before, why not take a wheel inside?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.280
 What they do in Singapore, and this is for people who live in high-rise buildings, they

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.360
 take the whole car inside.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.880
 So this is for the super rich, because the super rich, they've got lots of perks and

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.520
 ways that they can hide their cars.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.880
 When you're rich, you've got a few perks.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.400
 One of these perks is that there are now buildings in Singapore whereby you go into an underground

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.280
 garage and you park your car there, and it goes on a slab.

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:12.160
 The slab goes into an elevator, and it's a special elevator that goes up to the floor

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 of your building.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.240
 It goes up to 40 floors up, goes up there, and then you have a glass partition between

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.240
 your house lounge room and then this extra garage room that hangs up there in the sky

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
 with you.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.920
 The car on the slab gets put on there, and you can just see your car in your lounge

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920
 room.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.040
 And no one can get to it because it's 40 floors up.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.040
 That's like Batman style.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
 It really is.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.160
 It's reverse Batman because he lives underground.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160
 In a cave.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.160
 In a cave.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.160
 Upside down Batman.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:43.960
 You could also remove your own kitchen and living room instead and knock down your front

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.840
 wall and make that a nice place to hide your car if you want to emulate these people.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.440
 Just another way to keep your car safe.

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:57.280
 Did you guys read about the car thief a couple of weeks ago who hit the news it was in Rochdale

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.280
 for the clue?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.720
 He stole a car and then he did that really stupid thing of going to a petrol station

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.720
 and then driving off without paying for petrol.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.800
 Just don't draw attention to yourself.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.800
 So the police are looking for him.

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.280
 They found the house where they thought he was.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.760
 They searched the house and one of the police officers noticed a large teddy bear breathing

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:22.560
 and turned it upside down and he was inside the bear.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.400
 It's the weirdest thing because the police, it was managed to police and they tweeted

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400
 a picture of the bear.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
 I saw it.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.960
 It's got a little hole in its bum.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.440
 Not big enough for even a baby.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.440
 I would have thought.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.240
 I don't know how he was getting in there.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.240
 It was extraordinary.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.240
 He must have really wriggled in among the stuffing.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.880
 How long do you think you try and keep it up for once they say there's someone in that

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.880
 bear, isn't there?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.120
 You just pretend to be one of those talking bears.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.960
 That's what the movie Ted was.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.400
 There was actually a man in there.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.280
 The first ever vehicle alarm immobiliser system for a car was invented in 1921.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:05.680
 There wasn't really, that technology didn't exist.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:11.480
 It was just a freelance effort by an army captain who lived in Victoria in London and

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.400
 his motorbike kept being nicked and he was quite annoyed about it.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.200
 His initial innovation was he would take out almost all the fuel so that if it was nicked

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.640
 it could go about a mile and then he'd just search a mile radius and he got the motorbike

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.640
 back.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640
 That's a good idea.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.640
 That's a good idea.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.920
 He thought he didn't want even that to happen again.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:35.640
 So he attached a grenade to the motorbike and connected the pin to a nearby railing,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.400
 meaning that if anyone ever drove off on the motorbike it would set off the grenade.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400
 Oh my God.

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:46.120
 Unfortunately for him the wind just blew the bike over one day.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:52.480
 The explosion destroyed his bike and destroyed his car and destroyed a lot of the flat downstairs

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480
 from him.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480
 Oh my God.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.720
 There's one really advanced thing is a new Toyota patent.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.920
 Basically when you walk into your car, or you walk into a car, the car can tell what

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.160
 your phone is, but like if it's in your pocket it can kind of detect your phone and then

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.600
 it will release a fragrance of your choosing.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.280
 So if you're like, well I really like the smell of freshly mowed lawn, then whenever

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.520
 you get in the car it'll know you're there and it'll give you that.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.760
 Has this car got like just a big bank of every cent possibly?

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.480
 At the moment it's a patent, so they might not have all of them.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.480
 But like presumably...

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480
 But you can mix it.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480
 It's like printer ink, isn't it?

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.480
 You can just combine, you know, like mowed grass, plush.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.960
 Or you could just buy all of the scents that you want.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.360
 Oh yeah, just get a big thing of toner for steak or whatever.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.800
 You can't get a cart that smells like a steak, but you might do, right?

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800
 Yeah.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.560
 But if he walks in the car it smells of steak, if I walk in it smells of fresh...

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.280
 What if we both get in the same car though, and then it's like a freshly mowed steak?

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:58.280
 That's going to be a weird crash.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.920
 Like a cow in a field.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920
 Oh yeah, perfect.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.360
 Everyone's favourite of smell, cows in fields.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:09.480
 Anyway, the idea of this and one of the things that's genuinely in this patent is if someone

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.440
 gets in the car with a different phone so they realise that it's someone who shouldn't

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.480
 be there, then it can give tear gas instead of perfume.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.160
 That's incredible.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.600
 When you borrow your husband's phone for the day, that's a horrible journey.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.600
 Oh my God.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.200
 So there's another thing with the key fobs, there's a Volvo whereby it can tell you,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.120
 it's got a sensor that can tell you if there's a heartbeat in the car, so it can alert you

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120
 to intruders.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.120
 No, that's horrible.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.520
 Is there someone hiding in your car?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.400
 It's just like a huge teddy bear that's just appeared to your left-hand side.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.040
 I think possibly there's two reasons for it.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.000
 One is that if you closed the car door and you're in a rush and you've left your child

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.360
 in there, or your dog or something and you know how you forget leaving your child in

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.360
 a car.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.440
 Just check in the car.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.440
 That's why I'm not allowed to drive.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.480
 I've lost six kids.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.440
 But it's been used for intruders as well, it can just sort of say there's a heartbeat

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440
 in your car.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440
 That's quite clever.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.440
 Another very weird law that was passed, car-based, it was in 1928, Ministry of Transport passed

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.440
 an order.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.120
 It made it illegal to lock your car if it was parked in public.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.120
 It made it illegal.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.120
 Okay.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120
 Illegal.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.120
 Is that so?

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.240
 Because I know that in Manitoba or somewhere that you're not supposed to lock your cars

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.640
 in case there's like a polar bear and someone can hide in the car.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640
 Is it?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640
 Bingo.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640
 Yeah, yeah.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.000
 What it is is because there was so much traffic that was stopping people getting around because

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.480
 cars were taking off and cities weren't adapted for them, so it would be easier for the police

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.600
 to just move your car on if it was getting in people's way, so it was illegal to lock

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.240
 your car in public.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.120
 Oh, so it wasn't the bear thing?

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.680
 It was similar to the bear thing.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.080
 Because you made it sound like James had given the right arm.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.080
 I did.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.080
 I think I said the word...

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080
 I was counting my points.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.080
 I said the word bingo at one point.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:00.840
 It's not a slam dunk bingo, but other people might need to use your car or move it around.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.280
 Anyway, great quiz Andy.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:11.760
 I can't believe I didn't get the university challenge.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.600
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.560
 My fact this week is that scientists have successfully made a human hamster hybrid.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.000
 They call it a hamster.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.640
 So talk to us about your interpretation of the word successfully, scientists have successfully

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640
 made the hybrid.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640
 Yeah, cool.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.720
 Okay, so this is called the hamster test, and it is a scientific way of testing male infertility.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:46.160
 So this came about because scientists, there's a lot of ethical questions and issues that

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.080
 you have when you're trying to test for infertility by using a human sperm and a human egg.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.160
 So we needed alternatives for that.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.160
 And fortunately...

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.560
 And this is a test of sperm as fertile, right?

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.840
 Yeah, it's testing of male sperm as fertile, and this goes for IVF and all that sort of

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840
 stuff.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:06.000
 And so using a female egg is not allowed, there's a lot of ethical questions with that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.240
 And so what happens is that they need another way of doing it, and fortunately our mammalian

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.560
 reproduction makeup means that there are a few animals that we can do that with.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:18.360
 So one of the things that they do it with is hamster eggs, and when they use the hamster

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:23.520
 eggs what they do is they inject the sperm into it, but sometimes the sperm penetrates

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:30.040
 the hamster egg, and when it penetrates a hybrid embryo is created, a single cell embryo

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.680
 is created, and that's what scientists call the hamster.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.800
 So when you say it's like a hybrid of a human and a hamster, it's not like a tiny human

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.960
 that can keep stuff in its cheeks on a massive hamster.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.400
 I actually wrote to a bunch of scientists to ask if maybe one day hamsters will rule

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.400
 the earth.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.800
 And a lot of them got back to me and said no.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.400
 Well, actually there was one NHS doctor who's doing amazing, like really cutting edge stuff

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.680
 on trying to cure cancer, and he was like, give me five minutes.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.480
 And he went off to find out, and he thinks that there is a way that you could eventually

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.040
 manufacture it to accommodate the cell, because the problem is that it just, it will die after

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.000
 a few days, or it'll split into two cells or something.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.080
 That's not necessarily a problem.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.400
 You need it to split into two cells.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.400
 We're not single celled, are we?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 No.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.600
 The key is it needs to split, but they kill it before it splits, because that's bad.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.600
 That's the point.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.080
 But the point is we sometimes kill it before seeing if it can split into two, but the belief

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.640
 is it can split into two.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:36.080
 So they quickly go, ooh, before it splits into three, that's my theory.

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.960
 But the reality is that it couldn't live, it just couldn't live.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.440
 This doesn't happen whenever we have a sperm test, does it?

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.720
 They don't take, they don't go to the hamster lab.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.200
 This is one way of doing it.

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.840
 I think there are other ways of checking it.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840
 Thank God.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:54.600
 And I think it's not necessarily because the ethical things of using a human egg entirely,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.760
 it's largely because human eggs are few and far between, because you can easily get a donor

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:03.080
 egg from a hamster, because you don't as often ask their permission, whereas it's quite hard.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.880
 But yeah, it is also ethically easier, because it's a hamster.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.760
 But also, there's a lot of question about when life begins, and that is one of the issues.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.640
 If what happens here, what happens with the hamster, which is also, that's slightly an

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.160
 ethical debate, because I say, I've been asking scientists, so is that for just a second

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 while it's alive?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160
 Is that a hamster?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.160
 Is that a real thing?

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:24.960
 And they've all refused to answer, because it's a dodgy question, but it's also exciting

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.960
 that we could one day have hamsters.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.960
 Because we don't have...

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:32.280
 I'm not going to wait for the version of Jurassic Park.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.120
 Well, did you see, there was a script that was leaked, where Jurassic Park 4 was meant

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.280
 to be human dinosaur hybrids?

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.800
 No, I didn't see that.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.760
 Well, you missed out, because there was conceptual art, and it looks awesome.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.520
 It's like a man with dino legs running around, and that's what it was meant to be.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.960
 I think technically Andy might be a hamster.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.920
 Oh, yeah?

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.280
 We always put him in that wheel in the dressing room.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280
 Oh, my God!

00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.400
 And the amount of shit you can get in your cheeks is insane.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.480
 The reason being, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary for the word "humpster",

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480
 it does exist.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.560
 There's one citation from 1670, and it's a person who expresses their approval by humming

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560
 "hmmm".

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:18.720
 So if you ever do that, which you do do sometimes, you're a hamster.

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.800
 God, imagine if that's what a scientist created.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.440
 How disappointed would we be?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.440
 Wow.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:26.440
 Andy.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.440
 What an other name.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:32.480
 What I find really interesting about this process of creating the hamster is that the

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:38.200
 sperm need to be incubated for 20 hours before they're introduced formally to the egg.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.440
 Like a society ball.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.240
 Yeah, they go to the dance, they've got little dance cards, but yeah, they're incubated

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.880
 before they are introduced.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.360
 And this is because I didn't realise that inside a woman's body when a sperm is introduced

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.240
 in a conventional way, they have to capacitate for about 10 hours, which is the opposite

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.240
 of incapacitate, really.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.840
 It takes them about 10 hours to get ready to fertilise, so they don't zoom in and they're

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:02.840
 all set.

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.080
 They zoom in and then they, well, it's a process called capacitation.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.960
 Well, they just kind of hovered near the egg or what?

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:14.280
 So they hang around near the egg and they sort of like put a suit on and they get themselves

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.400
 all beefed up and ready to fertilise before doing it.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.720
 Another part of it, which is quite interesting, is to get the eggs from the hamster in the

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.720
 first place.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.640
 And one way that they do that is that they treat the hamster with pregnant horse serum

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.720
 and you put some pregnant horse serum into the hamster and that will simultaneously make

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.760
 them produce about 40 eggs.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.760
 Wow.

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.000
 So it's not only a human hamster hybrid, but then there's also a bit of horse in there

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
 as well.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.120
 Do you ever just think science doesn't do itself any favours?

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.360
 I feel a bit eckey about this.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.360
 No.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.480
 I mean, this is a kind of crossbred species.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.440
 I mean, not one that's viable, but I've just been reading about hybrids and, you know,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440
 crosses between species.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.120
 It's been going since 2,500 BC, the crossing of species with each other, but specifically

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.280
 by humans.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:03.240
 So this was the thing that was found in Syria.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.720
 It was a burial complex and they found about 25 skeletons and there weren't horses.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.280
 They were kind of nearly horses, but they weren't quite.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:15.400
 And they were a cross between a domestic donkey and a wild ass.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400
 Okay.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.840
 So quite similar, very similar species, but not identical.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.200
 And they were these mysterious creatures called kungas, which we don't have anymore,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.960
 but they were highly prized.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.160
 They were calmer than wild asses, but they were faster than donkeys.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.480
 So they were useful for battles and they were used as royal vehicles.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.760
 They used as dowries and marriages.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.400
 And kungas just were a thing.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400
 Yeah.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400
 Four and a half thousand years ago.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400
 And a huge thing, right?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.400
 They're all over the paintings and artworks.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.400
 They're Mesopotamia.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400
 They were a big deal.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.080
 The other thing about it is they're hard to make because they're infertile, so you

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.920
 create them and then they're sterile.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.120
 So if you want a second kunga, you need to go out into the woods again and chase down

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.600
 one of these very fast, very strong wild asses again.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.000
 And then somehow make it mate with a donkey.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.160
 I mean, that's, that's difficult at the best of times.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.920
 Have you heard of the country singer, American country singer?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.440
 She's called Taylor Mu.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.920
 And she, this is really interesting.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:14.680
 She has a chunk of skin on her body, which is a different color to the rest of her.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680
 It was way darker.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680
 Oh, wow.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680
 She didn't know why for years.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.680
 She was told it was a birthmark by doctors, seemed like the obvious explanation.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.280
 Anyway, she found out she is her own twin sister.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280
 Okay.

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.920
 So in the womb, she was going to be twins, but the egg which would have become her

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.920
 sister fused with her egg, you know, while both of them were right at the tiny, tiny

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.920
 embryos stage.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.240
 So that darker skin is from her sister's DNA.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.320
 She's got two sets of DNA in her body basically, but she has two immune systems, two bloodstreams

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320
 I wrote down.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.960
 I'm not exactly clear on that.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:50.520
 But she, she hasn't, yeah, I don't know, just move on past it.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.800
 But she has, she also has lots of allergies because her body thinks that her sister's

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.520
 DNA is foreign DNA inside her body.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.240
 But the weird thing is, remember I said her name at the start, Taylor Mule.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:03.240
 Taylor Mule.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.360
 A Mule is a hybridised.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.360
 How did she not know?

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.240
 The clue was there.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:22.000
 She was tailored, yeah.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.040
 You can have human pig hybrids and these exist.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:34.520
 The hope with these is that they'll be able to grow human-like organs inside pigs and

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.320
 then we'll be able to take them out of the pigs and put them into us and you'll be able

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.000
 to have that kind of thing.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.600
 Have they got a fun name?

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600
 What are they called?

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.520
 Well, see if you can guess.

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520
 Oh, okay.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.040
 So part human, part pig, anyone?

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040
 Okay.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.040
 Poo man.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:50.040
 Poo man.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040
 Poo man.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.040
 Poo man.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.040
 Poo man.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.040
 Poo man as in pee for pig and human.

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040
 Yeah.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040
 Poo man.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.040
 Poo man.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.040
 Poo man.

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040
 Poo man.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040
 Poo man.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040
 Poo man.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.040
 Poo man.

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.040
 Poo man.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040
 Poo man.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.040
 Poo man.

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.040
 Poo man.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
 Poo man.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040
 Poo man.

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040
 Poo man.

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040
 Poo man.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040
 Poo man.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
 Poo man.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040
 Poo man.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040
 Poo man.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.040
 Poo man.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.040
 Poo man.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040
 Poo man.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.040
 Poo man.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.040
 Poo man.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.040
 Poo man.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.040
 Poo man.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.040
 Any suggestions?

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:24.040
 Hug.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.040
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.040
 So Anna's got one point, James's got one point.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.040
 I've only got two.

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.040
 Sorry, Dan.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040
 Great quiz, Andy.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040
 Oh, wait.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040
 I've got one more.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040
 Yes.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040
 A rabbit.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.040
 It's a rabbit and a cabbage.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.040
 No, it's a radish and a cabbage.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040
 Sorry.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.040
 A cabbage.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:49.040
 It's the only animal that eats its own ears.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:35:01.040
 It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:08.040
 My fact is that cardboard is so valuable on the black market that it is nicknamed beige

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.040
 gold.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.040
 Strap in.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.040
 We're going to do 15 minutes on cardboard.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040
 Yeah.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040
 20 if you're unlucky.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040
 Beige gold.

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040
 Beige gold price.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.040
 So cardboard is incredibly valuable at the moment.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040
 Incredibly valuable.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040
 Incredibly valuable.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040
 More.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.040
 Okay.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.040
 Prices were 70 pounds per ton.

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.040
 Give or take recently.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.040
 Not very much.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.040
 A ton of cardboard is a lot.

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:31.040
 Yeah.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.040
 70 pounds is not very much.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.040
 But when coronavirus started, the price shot up of cardboard.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.040
 It doubled because there was so much more demand.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040
 Lots of people were stuck at home.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.040
 Lots of people were doing online shopping.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.040
 And the price just absolutely rocketed.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.040
 And as a result of the price being very high, demand being massive, there have been cardboard

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040
 heists.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.040
 There have been cardboard -- wow.

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.040
 There's a cardboard mafia who were in operation in Europe.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.040
 There's a whole cardboard crime network whose job is to steal cardboard.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:04.040
 When you think you've cornered as the police, the cardboard mafia, and you get up close to

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:09.040
 them, does it turn out it's just a cut out of them that made their getaway minutes ago?

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.040
 That would be great.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.040
 I did some maths.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.040
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:19.040
 And for one kilogram of gold, if you wanted to have enough cardboard to be worth the same

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:25.040
 amount as one kilogram of gold, it would have to weigh about as much as the Statue of Liberty.

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040
 Okay.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040
 Okay.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040
 So valuable.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.040
 Gold smuggling is still more valuable.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:35.040
 If you want to set up a crime syndicate, drugs are still the way to go.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.040
 But if you're a small timer, cardboard is the way.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:42.040
 There was a thing in Madrid in 2018 to '19.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.040
 This is even pre-COVID.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.040
 Half the cardboard that people were putting out for recycling was stolen.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.040
 But I would say, is that a problem?

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.040
 Yeah.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.040
 If you're putting out cardboard to be recycled as someone else is stealing it rather than

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.040
 a normal recycling people --

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.040
 Well, who should --

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.040
 To me personally, the job's being done, right?

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.040
 Well, that's true.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.040
 But it's in the hands of the gangs, then, I guess, who are going to -- they control the

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040
 cardboard trade now.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.040
 I don't know.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.040
 And they'll corner the market.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.040
 I don't know what they'll do with it.

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.040
 Well, they're making money out of it, basically.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.040
 They would travel around the city basically before the cardboard recycling truck.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:17.040
 And they would just go to every stop.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040
 They'd learn the routes.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.040
 They had dozens of people involved.

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:22.040
 Because they do sound like do-gooders.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.040
 They sound like they've made more --

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.040
 I've made them sound wrong.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.040
 They're hardcore criminals.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:33.040
 If someone drives around collecting my rubbish, I don't care who does it.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.040
 I know you don't care, but it's a big problem.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040
 Right.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.040
 They're getting bullied in prison, is all I'm saying.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.040
 They're fellow inmates.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.040
 What are you in for?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.040
 Voluntary recycling?

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.040
 So why don't the garbage men start half an hour early?

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.040
 They start early enough already, don't they?

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.040
 What's your answer?

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.040
 It's just the garbage men have to start earlier.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040
 That's not the way to deal with crime.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.040
 It's for the victims to adapt.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:59.040
 Do you have to have hard, tough, rough justice for these crooks?

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.040
 Yeah.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.040
 Madrid, the city of Madrid, where this was happening.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.040
 I would export it to Southeast Asia for pulping.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.040
 So they're stealing other people's cardboard.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.040
 I feel like there's not enough anger in the room about this.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.040
 I just kind of feel like there might be other problems.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040
 I know.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:19.040
 Madrid deliberately introduced dumpsters with tiny holes for cardboard so that the gangs

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.040
 couldn't climb in and get the cardboard out.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040
 They don't need to climb in.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.040
 They got there half an hour before the actual fucking truck got there.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.040
 What are you talking about?

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.040
 I'm just saying.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.040
 Did the price go up because there was a shortage, because we were all ordering loads of stuff.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040
 That was part of it.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.040
 Uncording cardboard, basically.

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.040
 And then Amazon bought a load of the available cardboard.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.040
 So for a while at the start of COVID, people couldn't get eggs.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:48.040
 That was because there were enough eggs going around, but there weren't the cardboard containers for the eggs.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.040
 And you can't just drop eggs on people's doorsteps.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.040
 Eggs are the worst thing to buy loose.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:55.040
 So that was why you couldn't get eggs, right?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:58.040
 But I don't remember there being an egg shortage during those.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040
 There was.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.040
 That was a huge egg shortage.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040
 I didn't remember that.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.040
 How was the divide?

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.040
 I would say egg and loo roll were the two big ones.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.040
 Really?

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.040
 Hell yeah.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:12.040
 I was in the countryside and the farmhouse next to us used to put freshly laid chicken eggs out every morning.

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040
 Six of them.

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.040
 And I used to go about 7am already gone.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.040
 Have you tried going a bit earlier?

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.040
 What was he putting the eggs out for?

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.040
 Sorry, for you.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:26.040
 Well, in the country, people always put eggs if they've got chickens outside and say,

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:29.040
 "Hey, drop a pound in and take four eggs."

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.040
 All gone.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:34.040
 But speaking of eggs, Easter eggs used to be made of cardboard.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.040
 What?

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.040
 In very disappointing times for children at Easter before they were made of chocolate.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.040
 And they were actually really beautiful.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:47.040
 So in the 19th century, they would have beautiful scenes kind of drawn on them.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.040
 So shortly after the kind of invention of cardboard.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.040
 And then they'd be covered in satin and they'd still be in two halves and you get your sweets inside.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.040
 But yeah, the egg itself, don't eat it.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.040
 Do you know what the first thing you ever put in a cardboard box was?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
 Oh, great.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.040
 Good question though, isn't it?

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
 Can we work it out?

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040
 Oh, no.

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.040
 I would say not in a thousand years.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.040
 Another smaller cardboard box.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040
 Oh great, that's no.

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.040
 Okay.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040
 Something small.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040
 Was it?

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040
 Fly.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040
 Animals, yeah.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040
 Oh no, a moth, it was a moth.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040
 No.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040
 Yes, it was.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040
 Wow.

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.040
 There's a new tactic here.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.040
 Just on right.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040
 Very close.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040
 It was a silkworm.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040
 Oh, cool.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.040
 They were invented apparently in Valriac in Provence.

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040
 Silkworms.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.040
 You know, cardboard boxes.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.040
 Because there was a guy who was, he was making silk and he was in bringing the silkworms over from China.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:44.040
 And his silkworms kept dying.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.040
 And so he went to a local wig maker and asked him if there was anything that he could do.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:54.040
 And this wig maker made these kind of cardboard boxes with holes in which he invented.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:57.040
 And this is according to the cardboard box museum in France.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.040
 It sounds amazing.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:59.040
 Yeah.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:00.040
 It does sound really interesting.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.040
 Yeah, Valriac.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.040
 And it says it's the historical capital of French cardboard.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.040
 It's quite a lot of qualifications.

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.040
 I don't think there are any other cardboard museums.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.040
 So just on the invention of cardboard.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.040
 Yeah.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.040
 Did you guys come across Malcolm Thornhill in your research?

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.040
 Malcolm?

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.040
 No.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.040
 Okay.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.040
 There's this fact all over the internet, right?

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:25.040
 And it's that cardboard was invented in 1817 when Sir Malcolm Thornhill started using thick sheets of paper to make boxes.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.040
 And they weren't like modern cardboard.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:28.040
 They were just single sheets of cardboard.

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:32.040
 So they weren't corrugated and, you know, firm and great like modern cardboard boxes.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:37.040
 And if that is true, that means that theoretically Jane Austen could have used a cardboard box.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.040
 Because that was the year she died, 1817.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.040
 That's huge.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.040
 That's huge.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.040
 The only problem is, it is definitely not true.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.040
 It's all over the internet.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.040
 It's on Wikipedia.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.040
 It's been taken off the internet and put into books as a result of which...

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.040
 And what's your evidence that it's not true?

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.040
 There's no evidence of Malcolm Thornhill being real.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.040
 Oh, your sister.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.040
 There's just no...

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.040
 You search for Malcolm Thornhill in 19th century sources.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.040
 There's nothing.

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.040
 But the problem is, now that it's been taken off Wikipedia, where it was with no evidence.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.040
 There wasn't any resource and put in a book.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.040
 It's now been sourced on Wikipedia to the books.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:12.040
 Which say that Malcolm Thornhill invented it in 1817.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:15.040
 It's a thing called cytogenesis on Wikipedia.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.040
 Which is where something is this awful circular loop.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.040
 But no, there's no way of getting rid of it.

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.040
 You're exploding this very little known myth.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040
 That's my thing now.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.040
 Don't go home tonight and tell each other Malcolm Thornhill invented cardboard in 1817.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:29.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040
 If there's one thing you don't say to each other after the show tonight, don't say that.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.040
 I don't say that even if it was true, to be honest.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.040
 As a conversation starter over dinner.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.040
 I got a good one-question quiz.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:41.040
 Wow, it's been a real quiz episode tonight, hasn't it?

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040
 Yeah, so here we go.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.040
 Yeah, so it's one quiz question.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040
 Fingers on buzzers.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:47.040
 This is a kind of cardboard.

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040
 What is it used for?

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.040
 It's called a zarf.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.040
 Scarfs.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040
 Buzz.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040
 Oh, it didn't buzz.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.040
 Ah.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040
 Putting scarves in.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040
 Putting scarves in.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040
 No, yeah, no.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.040
 I was going to say scarves for zebras.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.040
 Zebra scarves.

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.040
 Zarf.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.040
 Oh, we're going back into hybrids.

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040
 Yeah.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040
 It's not that, is it?

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040
 It's absolutely that.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.040
 You guys just jammed some crazy fucking idea.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.040
 No, it's obviously not that.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.040
 What is it?

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.040
 A zarf is, and everyone's used zarfs,

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.040
 but you just didn't know what it was called.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.040
 You know, when you go to a coffee shop,

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.040
 and you get a coffee, and it's a bit too hot,

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.040
 and they put a little sleeve of cardboard over it?

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.040
 That's a zarf.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.040
 It's a scarf for a cup.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.040
 A zarf.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.040
 That's brilliant.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040
 Okay, great.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040
 And where's that come from?

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040
 Just made up by someone.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040
 Yeah, I mean, it's been,

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.040
 zarfs have been used apparently.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.040
 So there's an amazing writer who is called,

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.040
 what's his name again?

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.040
 I've read so many of his books, A.J. Jacobs.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040
 Is it on the next page?

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040
 Yeah, I got it.

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.040
 Whereas, I think his name's A.J. Jacobs.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.040
 He wrote the book where he read the entire Encyclopedia,

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.040
 and he did this book where he went around thanking people

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:53.040
 who had anyway played a part

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.040
 in making a cup of coffee that you would drink.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040
 So he went around the world going,

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040
 thank you for this.

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:59.040
 And one of the people he went to thank was,

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.040
 were makers of zarfs, which was this item.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.040
 So, but he says that they were used as far back

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040
 as ancient China, just they were,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040
 or they were different material.

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.040
 They weren't necessarily thick.

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.040
 Malcolm Thornhill hadn't even been born yet.

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.040
 I think they would have been like a marble or something,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.040
 but you would put it around a hot drink,

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040
 and it would be a holder.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040
 I don't know.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.040
 You think they were making coffee holders out of marble?

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.040
 I don't know.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.040
 It just wasn't cardboard.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040
 Thornhill didn't.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.040
 That's amazing.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.040
 How many Starbucks do you think you'd have to go into

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.040
 and ask to have a zarf around my coffee?

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040
 One of them to know what the fuck you were talking about.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.040
 Cardboard was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:39.040
 in 2005.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.040
 Ah, the cardboard box.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040
 The cardboard box.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.040
 Obviously the idea being, if you get a present,

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.040
 the cardboard box is often more interesting to a kid

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.040
 than the actual toy itself.

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040
 And it's such a fun,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.040
 I love how lateral they think when they induct the toys

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040
 into the Hall of Fame.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.040
 So last year's toys that went in,

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.040
 one of the things that were inducted as one of the great toys

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.040
 was sand.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.040
 They're running low on the toys, aren't they?

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:05.040
 I think a stick was one of the first.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.040
 Yeah, a stick was once put in.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:11.040
 So last year was sand, risk, and American girl dolls.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:14.040
 Is it so that when you give your kids presents at Christmas,

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:17.040
 you can say, "Well, I got you something from the Hall of Fame."

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.040
 It's award-winning.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.040
 Do you want to hear one more cardboard crime?

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.040
 Yeah, go on.

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040
 Sure.

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.040
 You can use cardboard to smuggle a cocaine.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.040
 Sure, okay.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.040
 Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.040
 Sure you can, just put the cocaine in the box.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:33.040
 Or what's the point of smuggling cocaine

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.040
 when cardboard's so fucking expensive?

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:37.040
 Yeah, okay.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.040
 In 2020, the Spanish police, also Spain,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.040
 like the Madrid cardboard smuggling ring,

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.040
 the Spanish police, they smashed a gang

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.040
 who had put cocaine into cardboard boxes to smuggle it.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.040
 Now, they hadn't just put cocaine into the boxes,

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.040
 they put it into the box.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.040
 The cardboard box was partly made of cocaine.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.040
 That's clever.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040
 They had liquefied the cocaine

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:04.040
 and then kind of impregnated it into the cardboard boxes.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:06.040
 But then the problem was they put actual cocaine

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.040
 inside the cocaine cowboy box.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.040
 That's really clever.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.040
 And then once you get the box to the other end,

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.040
 you just extract it chemically, cocaine.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.040
 Perfect.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.040
 A fun toy for the kid, a fun toy for the pair.

00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.040
 That's not sand!

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.040
 Guys, we're going to have to wrap up really soon.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.040
 Do you remember the anti-sex beds?

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.040
 Speaking of cardboard.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.040
 Oh, I think I got one by mistake.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.040
 Sorry.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.040
 I was just possessed by a comedian from the '70s

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.040
 for a second there.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.040
 What was that?

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:49.040
 The ghost of Les Dawson has blessed me with his presence.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.040
 We're honoured to have him here.

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.040
 The anti-sex beds were the Tokyo Olympics.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.040
 You alright, Dan?

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:03.040
 That's the weirdest thing I've seen how to do.

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.040
 He genuinely looked suggestive.

00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.040
 He looked...

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:13.040
 Sorry.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.040
 It was a character.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.040
 And then it was a really good joke.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.040
 Come on, Dan. We're so near the end.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.040
 Tokyo Olympics, they had anti-sex beds,

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.040
 and they weren't actually anti-sex beds.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.040
 They were just made of cardboard.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:36.040
 And the idea of anti-sex was that it was so flimsy

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.040
 you couldn't have sex in them.

00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.040
 But the reason they had them at the Olympics

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:42.040
 was to discourage the athletes from having sex

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.040
 because it damages your game.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.040
 But they were fine for sex anyway, so it wouldn't have discouraged it.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.040
 They were good for sex.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.040
 They definitely did not get an anti-sex bed.

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:56.040
 There are so many reasons.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:04.040
 OK, that's it.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.040
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.040
