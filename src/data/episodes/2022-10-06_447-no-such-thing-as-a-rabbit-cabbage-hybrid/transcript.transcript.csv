00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, just before we start the show, we wanted to really highly recommend to you"
00:00:04,00:00:07,a new book that's just about to come out on the market.
00:00:07,00:00:13,It's called The Theory of Everything Else and it is by an author you may have heard
00:00:13,00:00:14,of.
00:00:14,00:00:15,"Oh, Lee Child."
00:00:15,00:00:17,It's so close.
00:00:17,00:00:18,Richard Osman.
00:00:18,00:00:19,You're a bit further away now actually.
00:00:19,00:00:22,Go back to the Lee Child direction.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"It's Dan Schreiber's book, ladies and gentlemen."
00:00:25,00:00:26,Yay!
00:00:26,00:00:29,"Dan has written a book, it's called The Theory of Everything Else and if you listen to fish,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,you already know what it's about.
00:00:31,00:00:35,"It's about all the craziest, strangest theories that people have believed about all sorts of"
00:00:35,00:00:37,things around the world.
00:00:37,00:00:38,"You want the Titanic, it's in there."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"You want aliens, they're in there."
00:00:40,00:00:43,"You want Nicholas Wichelt, the BBC's royal correspondent, living on the banks of Loch"
00:00:43,00:00:47,"Ness, trying to find Nessie for several months earlier in his career."
00:00:47,00:00:48,That's in there.
00:00:48,00:00:49,And who doesn't want that?
00:00:49,00:00:50,It's what we've always wanted.
00:00:50,00:00:53,Dan's been cooking up this book for as long as I've known him.
00:00:53,00:00:56,"Genuinely, it's been absolutely worth the wait."
00:00:56,00:00:59,Every single page is a story that you absolutely won't believe.
00:00:59,00:01:05,"So it's about these weird ideas, people with these bizarre beliefs, but who somehow end"
00:01:05,00:01:06,up changing the world.
00:01:06,00:01:09,It's about how these beliefs end up to have been logical.
00:01:09,00:01:13,It's basically about how we should never dismiss what seems like lunacy because sometimes
00:01:13,00:01:17,it can turn out to be genius and it is the most incredible read.
00:01:17,00:01:21,"Yeah, and that is the motto actually for recording episodes of the podcast with Dan."
00:01:21,00:01:22,So you already know what you're going to get.
00:01:22,00:01:26,"If you want to check it out, just find The Theory of Everything Else."
00:01:26,00:01:30,There is also a website attached which will have all the additional notes and videos and
00:01:30,00:01:31,updates.
00:01:31,00:01:32,That's theoryofeverythingelse.co.uk.
00:01:32,00:01:34,"Guys, this is Dan's first book."
00:01:34,00:01:38,"We'd love it to be a monster hit, so get yourself a copy right now."
00:01:38,00:01:39,"Yes, please do."
00:01:39,00:01:42,"I kind of want to just read your transcript of the whole thing because all the characters,"
00:01:42,00:01:45,all the stories in it are incredible.
00:01:45,00:01:49,"So please go there, help out Dan and read, you know, the most interesting book of your"
00:01:49,00:01:50,year.
00:01:50,00:01:53,"If you want to see The Theory of Everything Else, you can pre-order it now, or it's out"
00:01:53,00:01:56,"next week, October the 13th."
00:01:56,00:01:58,Get to a bookshop and buy it.
00:01:58,00:01:59,On with the show!
00:01:59,00:02:02,On with the podcast.
00:02:02,00:02:20,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:20,00:02:28,"this week, coming to you live from Inverness!"
00:02:28,00:02:33,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:02:33,00:02:38,"I'm sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:02:38,00:02:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from"
00:02:42,00:02:43,the last seven days.
00:02:43,00:02:50,"And in no particular order, here we go, starting with fact number one, and that is James."
00:02:50,00:02:55,"Okay, my fact this week is that you can catch chlamydia from dead parrots."
00:02:55,00:02:56,Darling!
00:02:56,00:03:05,What do you have to do with dead parrots to catch chlamydia from them?
00:03:05,00:03:08,"Well, it's a bacterium, chlamydia."
00:03:08,00:03:13,"This is actually called Cytocosis, and it's kind of known as parrot fever, but it's a"
00:03:13,00:03:19,"type of chlamydia, and the bacterium can come from the parrot to you through mouth to beak"
00:03:19,00:03:20,contact.
00:03:20,00:03:21,Mm-hmm.
00:03:21,00:03:22,Yeah.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,Sexy stuff.
00:03:24,00:03:29,"Or the airborne inhalation of feather dust, feces, or respiratory secretions."
00:03:29,00:03:30,Less sexy stuff.
00:03:30,00:03:31,Yeah.
00:03:31,00:03:32,So it can come from mouth to beak.
00:03:32,00:03:37,"There was actually, I was looking in some old newspaper archives about this, and I found"
00:03:37,00:03:44,a 1992 cutting from the Press and Journal that reported on a teacher from Inverness who
00:03:44,00:03:49,caught chlamydia from a dead parrot that he apparently found in his garden.
00:03:49,00:03:53,"Don't have a parrot in you, why are you suggesting?"
00:03:53,00:03:57,He might have been giving it life because of life by then.
00:03:57,00:04:04,"Well, the article said that he said that he didn't touch it with his hands."
00:04:04,00:04:12,"I don't know why you need to specify that, and also that he didn't want to be named."
00:04:12,00:04:13,Okay.
00:04:13,00:04:14,Wow.
00:04:14,00:04:15,Is he in?
00:04:15,00:04:17,Are you in?
00:04:17,00:04:19,"Everyone knows him in this room, I think."
00:04:19,00:04:20,Yeah.
00:04:20,00:04:21,Wow.
00:04:21,00:04:22,Wow.
00:04:22,00:04:23,So do we know if he recovered?
00:04:23,00:04:24,"Yeah, he did."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"Oh, great."
00:04:25,00:04:27,"And to be honest, it can be quite serious."
00:04:27,00:04:28,Yeah.
00:04:28,00:04:32,"Certainly when it first came about, Citicosis, and became like a bit of a pandemic or an"
00:04:32,00:04:37,"epidemic really in America and as few other places, but it was in various parts of the"
00:04:37,00:04:38,world.
00:04:38,00:04:39,This was in the 1920s.
00:04:39,00:04:41,It had a really high death rate.
00:04:41,00:04:44,"If you were over 35 and you caught it, it was something like 25% of people died."
00:04:44,00:04:45,"Yeah, it was crazy."
00:04:45,00:04:47,"And it was a proper panic, wasn't it?"
00:04:47,00:04:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:48,00:04:49,The freak's out.
00:04:49,00:04:53,"Yeah, and the papers, to begin with, they said that it was found initially, sort of like"
00:04:53,00:04:58,"the first case that was mentioned was in Argentina, and it was on a sailor who wasn't really a"
00:04:58,00:04:59,sailor.
00:04:59,00:05:03,"He was an actor, and it was his stage parrot that gave it to him, and that, so they traced"
00:05:03,00:05:04,it to that.
00:05:04,00:05:08,But then it was all these cases in America where people were trying to work out why these
00:05:08,00:05:09,people were suddenly dying.
00:05:09,00:05:13,"But that's a good contact to have, isn't it, as in if you're a stage, did he say he was"
00:05:13,00:05:14,a sailor?
00:05:14,00:05:16,He was a sailor with a stage parrot on his shoulder.
00:05:16,00:05:18,But he was a stage sailor.
00:05:18,00:05:21,"You said he was a sailor, but then you said he wasn't an actual sailor, right?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,He was just a sailor on stage.
00:05:22,00:05:23,I know.
00:05:23,00:05:27,"I delivered it in my head like it was a cool Dan Brown plot twist, but then I realised."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"In actual fact, it wasn't on his shoulder."
00:05:30,00:05:35,"In this play, it was in a cage, but all of the people in the play had to go and stroke"
00:05:35,00:05:36,the parrot.
00:05:36,00:05:37,So it wasn't on his shoulder.
00:05:37,00:05:39,He kept going over and stroking it.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"Eight of the cast got sick, and two of them died after this play."
00:05:42,00:05:43,How do you know?
00:05:43,00:05:50,"This was in 1930, and as a result, 90% of Argentina's parrots were killed."
00:05:50,00:05:51,Rough.
00:05:51,00:05:52,What?
00:05:52,00:05:53,Really rough.
00:05:53,00:05:57,"And this was, the rumor always was that the Argentinians brought it over."
00:05:57,00:06:01,"It was the classic, you know, like the Chinese disease."
00:06:01,00:06:05,"It was, as you know, Donald Trump was referred to the Chinese disease, that wasn't me doing"
00:06:05,00:06:06,that.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Yeah.
00:06:07,00:06:10,"He said that quite a long time ago now, so that just came across as a year."
00:06:10,00:06:12,"You've got to be careful with these references, don't you?"
00:06:12,00:06:14,Make sure they're up to date.
00:06:14,00:06:17,"So on the East Coast, there were all these rumors that had come from Argentina, and in"
00:06:17,00:06:24,"fact, the outbreak began, they think, in December 1929, and it was a man in Maryland who bought"
00:06:24,00:06:28,"a parrot as a present for his wife, and not only that, he stored it with his daughter"
00:06:28,00:06:31,and son-in-law before he gave it to his wife.
00:06:31,00:06:33,"You know, can I hide this parrot with you?"
00:06:33,00:06:36,"Anyway, three of them got seriously ill."
00:06:36,00:06:39,"Not the guy who bought the parrot, actually, just the other three."
00:06:39,00:06:42,"And this guy, Dr. Martin, went and visited them."
00:06:42,00:06:43,"And he said, ""I had the weirdest case today."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"These three people are sick."""
00:06:45,00:06:49,"And she asked him about it, and he eventually said, ""Yeah, weirdly, the only other person"
00:06:49,00:06:54,"who was sick in the room was their pet parrot, who I think is about to die."""
00:06:54,00:06:57,"And his wife said, ""Do you know what, that's so weird, because I was just reading the sort"
00:06:57,00:07:03,"of gossip pages of my magazine, and apparently there's this parrot sickness in Argentina."""
00:07:03,00:07:07,"And it was that conversation, she'd been happened to read this obscure article, and"
00:07:07,00:07:10,"I asked them, ""That sounds like nonsense, but whatever, we'll chase it up."""
00:07:10,00:07:13,And it was that parrot sickness that kicked it all off.
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Of course, their magazine has got..."
00:07:15,00:07:16,He magazine was very different.
00:07:16,00:07:18,She says it wasn't no fair with Katie Price.
00:07:18,00:07:20,He says it was Chlamydia from a dead parrot.
00:07:20,00:07:21,It's called...
00:07:21,00:07:22,Hello!
00:07:22,00:07:23,Hello!
00:07:23,00:07:24,Very good.
00:07:24,00:07:26,They always talk in the end.
00:07:26,00:07:31,"That was a hugely significant parrot fever outbreak, because the doctor who'd been working"
00:07:31,00:07:33,"on it, it was a guy called Charles Armstrong."
00:07:33,00:07:39,"He fell really ill after treating the patients who'd got it, the guy who'd bought it, Mr."
00:07:39,00:07:40,Martin.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"He was almost going to die, the doctor, Charles Armstrong."
00:07:42,00:07:48,"Another doctor injected him with the blood of a patient who had survived parrot fever,"
00:07:48,00:07:50,"not doing any of the tests about, you know, the..."
00:07:50,00:07:54,"I think the blood type or anything like that was a very primitive procedure, but he lived."
00:07:54,00:07:59,"Charles Armstrong, the doctor, lived, and that entire incident led to the founding of"
00:07:59,00:08:01,America's National Institute of Health.
00:08:01,00:08:02,No.
00:08:02,00:08:06,So it's a big result from one parrot fever outbreak.
00:08:06,00:08:10,"I should also say, actually, just going back to the original fact, which is that you can"
00:08:10,00:08:12,catch it from dead parrots.
00:08:12,00:08:17,This came from a study at the University of Adelaide and the University of the Sunshine
00:08:17,00:08:24,"Coast, which sounds quite amazing, by Annalise Chaber and Et Al, and they've described sometimes"
00:08:24,00:08:29,"when people have been dissecting parrots and then got pneumonia a little bit later, and"
00:08:29,00:08:33,then they checked the bodies and found that they actually caught it from the parrots when
00:08:33,00:08:34,they were dead already.
00:08:34,00:08:35,"Yeah, right."
00:08:35,00:08:38,So most of these people were talking about they were catching it from quite a sickly
00:08:38,00:08:41,"parrot, but these people have been catching it from an actual dead parrot and the guy"
00:08:41,00:08:43,from Inverness as well.
00:08:43,00:08:48,"I remember every dead parrot I've ever kissed, I have to say, so I'd know because it was"
00:08:48,00:08:53,"known as Old Maid's Pneumonia because, you know, parrots were all the rage then."
00:08:53,00:08:58,People used to go door-to-door selling parrots to sad women whose husbands had died.
00:08:58,00:09:01,"Again, this was the stereotype, that's what Donald Trump would have called them, that's"
00:09:01,00:09:04,not what I'm calling them.
00:09:04,00:09:08,And the rumor was that they'd all been snogging their parrots because they were so sad and
00:09:08,00:09:09,lonely and widowed.
00:09:09,00:09:10,What?
00:09:10,00:09:13,"And so that's why it was called Old Maid's Pneumonia, it said they were all getting chlamydia"
00:09:13,00:09:16,"from them, and it's not, you're just breathing in the air around the parrot, okay?"
00:09:16,00:09:23,"Well, 63% of the people who got the citicosis at the time of the big outbreak were women."
00:09:23,00:09:26,"They did own parrots much more often, but we don't know that they were sticking their"
00:09:26,00:09:27,tongues down their throats.
00:09:27,00:09:34,"And this was devastating for parrots, like the panic really hit and everyone took it"
00:09:34,00:09:38,"seriously, so there were stories about how in the US Navy the admirals were ordering"
00:09:38,00:09:41,anyone who had a parrot on board just to let them off over.
00:09:41,00:09:44,Why have you got a parrot on a serious Navy vessel?
00:09:44,00:09:45,They're at sea.
00:09:45,00:09:46,It's not...
00:09:46,00:09:47,Who doesn't bring a parrot to sea?
00:09:47,00:09:52,"It's not a pirate ship, where do you think pirates get their parrots?"
00:09:52,00:09:56,"Pirates have parrots, sailors don't have parrots, that should be how you can tell the difference"
00:09:56,00:09:59,"between a pirate and a normal, law-abiding sailor."
00:09:59,00:10:00,Very good point.
00:10:00,00:10:04,"Yeah, you check the leg, you check the pieces of eight, and then you check the parrot."
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Can't chlamydia kind of damage your eyes as well, can it?"
00:10:07,00:10:08,You check for...
00:10:08,00:10:09,Eyepatches.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Eyepatches.
00:10:10,00:10:11,Eyepatches.
00:10:11,00:10:12,Exactly.
00:10:12,00:10:13,Okay.
00:10:13,00:10:15,So what do you say it was devastating for parrots because they could no longer accompany sailors
00:10:15,00:10:16,on their journey?
00:10:16,00:10:20,"No, it was a sort of mass death of parrots who were just thrown out to sea was more the"
00:10:20,00:10:21,angle.
00:10:21,00:10:25,"I want to thank you, the poor sailors, and their pirate credentials."
00:10:25,00:10:28,"Those poor parrots, which can fly, they'll be fine."
00:10:28,00:10:33,They can't fly a hundred miles back to land.
00:10:33,00:10:37,Do you know you can get chlamydia from house flies?
00:10:37,00:10:38,Really?
00:10:38,00:10:39,Yeah.
00:10:39,00:10:42,"How do you do, what do you have to do with them?"
00:10:42,00:10:46,"Well, annoyingly, I don't know if you guys saw what you want to see, but I dropped my"
00:10:46,00:10:51,"notes just before we came out here and I can't, it's on the next page and I can't find the"
00:10:51,00:10:52,reason for it.
00:10:52,00:10:56,It was the worst excuse in eight years of podcasting we've had for why you can't back
00:10:56,00:10:58,up one of your outlandish plays.
00:10:58,00:10:59,It's of experience.
00:10:59,00:11:00,You dropped your notes.
00:11:00,00:11:01,Oh yeah.
00:11:01,00:11:02,And then the dog ran off with the page.
00:11:02,00:11:03,"No, I swear to God."
00:11:03,00:11:04,I've been trying to find it.
00:11:04,00:11:05,"No, absolutely."
00:11:05,00:11:06,It might be backstage.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"I've got a line that says with guinea pig inclusion conjunctivitis as an animal model,"
00:11:10,00:11:15,"jokes about wives it seems, have always been fair game, so that's the next page."
00:11:15,00:11:16,So yeah.
00:11:16,00:11:18,But apparently you can get chlamydia from house flies.
00:11:18,00:11:19,That's a rumour going round.
00:11:19,00:11:20,Good to know.
00:11:20,00:11:23,Careful what you do with those blue bottles.
00:11:23,00:11:25,Do you want to hear another parrot thing?
00:11:25,00:11:26,Oh yeah.
00:11:26,00:11:27,Okay.
00:11:27,00:11:30,Are you guys familiar with a guy called Noel Fitzpatrick?
00:11:30,00:11:31,Noel Fitzpatrick.
00:11:31,00:11:32,He's on a show called Super Vet.
00:11:32,00:11:38,"Anyway, he has a book which is sort of memoirs of a career, a vetting career and there was"
00:11:38,00:11:42,"a time when he had to operate on a parrot, but the problem was he couldn't anesthetise"
00:11:42,00:11:43,it.
00:11:43,00:11:44,"You know, the anesthetic wasn't suitable."
00:11:44,00:11:48,"It might have died if you tried to put it under, so he had to just hold it on the X-ray"
00:11:48,00:11:49,machine.
00:11:49,00:11:51,I'm quoting him directly here.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"He kept looking up at me and asking, ""What are you doing?"
00:11:54,00:11:55,"What are you doing?"""
00:11:55,00:12:00,I kept trying to keep him quiet and maybe a few choice phrases escaped from my big Irish
00:12:00,00:12:01,mouth in the process.
00:12:01,00:12:06,"We completed the radiographs, gave the medication and as I was handing him back to the dear,"
00:12:06,00:12:10,"sweet elderly lady who was his companion, he jumped on the lady's arm, craved his neck"
00:12:10,00:12:17,"and shouted merrily, ""Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up!"""
00:12:17,00:12:25,I can't tell you how scared I am that that's going to be my daughter's first word.
00:12:25,00:12:33,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Anna."
00:12:33,00:12:39,My fact this week is that the head of the AA keeps his car keys in the microwave and
00:12:39,00:12:45,I've just realised that I should specify which of the AA's I mean this fact is because he's
00:12:45,00:12:47,constantly shit-faced.
00:12:47,00:12:56,It's a safety thing in both instances and then it's just too pissed to open it.
00:12:56,00:12:59,"No, because the head of the AA wouldn't be drunk."
00:12:59,00:13:04,"But this is the head of the automobile association, it's a guy called Edmund King and he's very"
00:13:04,00:13:05,safety conscious.
00:13:05,00:13:09,"He's emerging on paranoid I would say, he did an interview recently with the Telegraph"
00:13:09,00:13:12,where he says he's got one of these car keys that remotely unlocks your car.
00:13:12,00:13:13,A fob.
00:13:13,00:13:14,A fob.
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"A fob and he keeps it in a Faraday cage, so in this leather bag with a wire mesh lining"
00:13:19,00:13:25,"and a red metal box, so a cage that can't let through any electromagnetic field and"
00:13:25,00:13:29,after he's got it in that Faraday cage he puts it inside a microwave and he's put the
00:13:29,00:13:34,microwave right at the back of the house as far away from the car as possible and so every
00:13:34,00:13:37,time he wants to drive somewhere it's a real hassle for him.
00:13:37,00:13:40,He either he or his wife had their car next.
00:13:40,00:13:41,It's his wife.
00:13:41,00:13:42,Yeah.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:47,"If you have one of the keyless keys basically, that's not, you know what I mean."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:48,00:13:49,A keyless fob.
00:13:49,00:13:50,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:50,00:13:53,It's sort of something like 50 times likely to have your car stolen because it's easier
00:13:53,00:13:54,to hack the thing.
00:13:54,00:13:58,Do you not think you would wait until like lunchtime when he's making a baked potato or
00:13:58,00:14:01,something in a microwave and just steal his car?
00:14:01,00:14:02,Exactly.
00:14:02,00:14:03,Yeah.
00:14:03,00:14:04,So it's an amplifier and transmitter thing.
00:14:04,00:14:05,This is how they get your car.
00:14:05,00:14:09,So most people if they have this key fob they might leave it near the front door just sitting
00:14:09,00:14:14,in on a console table or something like that and two criminals will be involved.
00:14:14,00:14:18,One will go next to the door and they'll have an amplifier while the other stands next to
00:14:18,00:14:20,the door with a transmitter.
00:14:20,00:14:21,I can't remember which way.
00:14:21,00:14:22,One goes next to the house door near the key.
00:14:22,00:14:23,One goes next to the car door.
00:14:23,00:14:24,One goes next to the car door.
00:14:24,00:14:25,One goes next to the car door.
00:14:25,00:14:26,They amplify the signal.
00:14:26,00:14:27,It comes to the car door.
00:14:27,00:14:28,They can open it and steal it.
00:14:28,00:14:29,Yeah.
00:14:29,00:14:30,But that happens a lot as you were saying.
00:14:30,00:14:31,Take a wheel into the house.
00:14:31,00:14:33,That's what I would advise.
00:14:33,00:14:36,The steering wheel are one of the actual wheels.
00:14:36,00:14:38,Just so I take both.
00:14:38,00:14:42,I pop the steering wheel into one of the main wheels and then I go.
00:14:42,00:14:46,Actually his wife's key was in a Faraday cage when her car got stolen.
00:14:46,00:14:47,I know.
00:14:47,00:14:48,What's that?
00:14:48,00:14:49,Which I don't really know.
00:14:49,00:14:50,How they've done it.
00:14:50,00:14:51,The problem with this is it's not the criminals.
00:14:51,00:14:52,It's not the cars.
00:14:52,00:14:53,It's not the microwaves.
00:14:53,00:14:54,Okay.
00:14:54,00:14:55,"It's the keyless, bloody fobs."
00:14:55,00:14:56,Why do they exist?
00:14:56,00:14:57,It's the maddest system ever.
00:14:57,00:14:58,My mum has it.
00:14:58,00:15:00,And it's like what is the point in this?
00:15:00,00:15:05,If you can't get up the energy or the wherewithal to insert some keys into your ignition.
00:15:05,00:15:06,It's pretty cool though.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"Whenever I walk past my car, it just opens even if I don't want to go in it."
00:15:10,00:15:11,It's cool.
00:15:11,00:15:12,Can you turn that off?
00:15:12,00:15:13,It does it automatically.
00:15:13,00:15:17,"You can disable it and he wants to make you aware that if you want to disable it, you"
00:15:17,00:15:18,can disable it.
00:15:18,00:15:19,All right.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"I was reading a website that said, you know, the advantages of it, why you should get a"
00:15:21,00:15:22,keyless fog.
00:15:22,00:15:27,And the only bullet point is it allows you to start your car without being in the vehicle.
00:15:27,00:15:29,That's true.
00:15:29,00:15:34,"Also, it does the coolest, I don't drive and I don't have this fob key."
00:15:34,00:15:35,So I don't know.
00:15:35,00:15:39,"I mean, it would be insane for you to start with the key and work your way up to having"
00:15:39,00:15:40,a car.
00:15:40,00:15:41,I got the key.
00:15:41,00:15:44,It's just for those parties where you chuck them in the bar.
00:15:44,00:15:45,Oh God.
00:15:45,00:15:48,"It's not actually a car that goes with that, I just got the key."
00:15:48,00:15:56,"But here's what she'll be incredibly disappointed in, getting onto your unicycle."
00:15:56,00:16:01,She's already drawn the short straw.
00:16:01,00:16:05,"So when you have one of these fobs, if you're at a certain distance and you try to open"
00:16:05,00:16:08,"it, the signal's too far for it to work, right?"
00:16:08,00:16:09,Okay.
00:16:09,00:16:11,It's got a distance that it can go.
00:16:11,00:16:14,"So if you were standing at a distance, let's say just far away enough where it couldn't"
00:16:14,00:16:20,"work, you can still stand at that same spot and make it work by using one simple trick."
00:16:20,00:16:22,And that is holding the key to your head.
00:16:22,00:16:23,What?
00:16:23,00:16:26,Who here knows that by round of cheers?
00:16:26,00:16:27,Okay.
00:16:27,00:16:29,So what does it do?
00:16:29,00:16:32,"So the idea is that our head is full of fluids, right?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,We have a lot of water in our heads.
00:16:33,00:16:37,Some are the others.
00:16:37,00:16:39,And water is a great conductor.
00:16:39,00:16:43,"So when you hold it to your head, the signals that are being passed through are using that"
00:16:43,00:16:46,water to amplify the signal and you can open it from that spot you're standing at.
00:16:46,00:16:50,"No, it's like wearing metal boots in a lightning storm if you want to get struck."
00:16:50,00:16:51,Yes.
00:16:51,00:16:52,I think.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"Wait, say it again."
00:16:53,00:16:56,So it's something that conducts well in a lightning storm if you want to get hit by
00:16:56,00:16:57,"lightning, right?"
00:16:57,00:17:00,It's like a giant spike on your head or something.
00:17:00,00:17:01,Exactly.
00:17:01,00:17:02,Holding another.
00:17:02,00:17:07,Officers from Sheffield's Southeast neighborhood policing team came up with a way of stopping
00:17:07,00:17:12,people from doing this key fob trick and their idea is to buy a second car that doesn't
00:17:12,00:17:16,have keyless entry and use it to block in the other one.
00:17:16,00:17:17,That's good.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, that's wonderful."
00:17:18,00:17:19,That's great.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Very clever.
00:17:20,00:17:22,I'm very clever.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Okay, here's a quiz."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Oh, great."
00:17:25,00:17:26,"Oh, great."
00:17:26,00:17:27,Okay.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Answer the question as quickly as you can, right?"
00:17:28,00:17:29,Yeah.
00:17:29,00:17:30,"Okay, as quickly as you can."
00:17:30,00:17:31,Just complete the sentence.
00:17:31,00:17:32,That's the quiz.
00:17:32,00:17:33,Yeah.
00:17:33,00:17:37,"If you switch off all the lights along the street, the number of thefts from people's"
00:17:37,00:17:38,cars increases.
00:17:38,00:17:39,Increases.
00:17:39,00:17:40,Right.
00:17:40,00:17:41,It halves.
00:17:41,00:17:42,This is so weird.
00:17:42,00:17:44,If you turn off all the lights along the road.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Because they can't find your car?
00:17:45,00:17:47,"Well, they know the cars are there."
00:17:47,00:17:49,So there have been trials done into this.
00:17:49,00:17:51,They're like turning off street lights after midnight.
00:17:51,00:17:55,"And it turned out that the thefts, not thefts of cars, theft from cars, right?"
00:17:55,00:17:57,"So people breaking in, stealing the stuff."
00:17:57,00:18:01,The thefts went from 12 per street per month to six per street per month.
00:18:01,00:18:02,How come?
00:18:02,00:18:10,"Well, the thing is that it's really hard to see in the dark, and if you're waggling"
00:18:10,00:18:14,"around the torch after midnight, that's quite conspicuous."
00:18:14,00:18:16,It makes thieves feel a bit self-conscious.
00:18:16,00:18:21,And they just sort of gravitate away towards other nearby streets which do have street
00:18:21,00:18:22,lights.
00:18:22,00:18:23,It's not just embarrassed.
00:18:23,00:18:24,They're embarrassed.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:25,00:18:27,But then other nearby streets got more thefts during this trial period.
00:18:27,00:18:30,So it is like you're just pushing the problem elsewhere.
00:18:30,00:18:31,Okay.
00:18:31,00:18:32,"Yeah, but that works."
00:18:32,00:18:33,Is that weird?
00:18:33,00:18:34,"Yeah, that's weird."
00:18:34,00:18:35,Great quiz.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Thank you.
00:18:36,00:18:40,Do you know there's another way of protecting your car?
00:18:40,00:18:42,The super rich do this in Singapore.
00:18:42,00:18:45,"So Andy, you said before, why not take a wheel inside?"
00:18:45,00:18:48,"What they do in Singapore, and this is for people who live in high-rise buildings, they"
00:18:48,00:18:50,take the whole car inside.
00:18:50,00:18:55,"So this is for the super rich, because the super rich, they've got lots of perks and"
00:18:55,00:18:57,ways that they can hide their cars.
00:18:57,00:19:00,"When you're rich, you've got a few perks."
00:19:00,00:19:05,One of these perks is that there are now buildings in Singapore whereby you go into an underground
00:19:05,00:19:08,"garage and you park your car there, and it goes on a slab."
00:19:08,00:19:12,"The slab goes into an elevator, and it's a special elevator that goes up to the floor"
00:19:12,00:19:13,of your building.
00:19:13,00:19:18,"It goes up to 40 floors up, goes up there, and then you have a glass partition between"
00:19:18,00:19:23,your house lounge room and then this extra garage room that hangs up there in the sky
00:19:23,00:19:24,with you.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"The car on the slab gets put on there, and you can just see your car in your lounge"
00:19:27,00:19:28,room.
00:19:28,00:19:31,And no one can get to it because it's 40 floors up.
00:19:31,00:19:33,That's like Batman style.
00:19:33,00:19:34,It really is.
00:19:34,00:19:36,It's reverse Batman because he lives underground.
00:19:36,00:19:37,In a cave.
00:19:37,00:19:38,In a cave.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Upside down Batman.
00:19:39,00:19:43,You could also remove your own kitchen and living room instead and knock down your front
00:19:43,00:19:47,wall and make that a nice place to hide your car if you want to emulate these people.
00:19:47,00:19:50,Just another way to keep your car safe.
00:19:50,00:19:57,Did you guys read about the car thief a couple of weeks ago who hit the news it was in Rochdale
00:19:57,00:19:58,for the clue?
00:19:58,00:20:00,He stole a car and then he did that really stupid thing of going to a petrol station
00:20:00,00:20:02,and then driving off without paying for petrol.
00:20:02,00:20:04,Just don't draw attention to yourself.
00:20:04,00:20:09,So the police are looking for him.
00:20:09,00:20:11,They found the house where they thought he was.
00:20:11,00:20:16,They searched the house and one of the police officers noticed a large teddy bear breathing
00:20:16,00:20:22,and turned it upside down and he was inside the bear.
00:20:22,00:20:28,"It's the weirdest thing because the police, it was managed to police and they tweeted"
00:20:28,00:20:29,a picture of the bear.
00:20:29,00:20:30,I saw it.
00:20:30,00:20:32,It's got a little hole in its bum.
00:20:32,00:20:34,Not big enough for even a baby.
00:20:34,00:20:35,I would have thought.
00:20:35,00:20:37,I don't know how he was getting in there.
00:20:37,00:20:38,It was extraordinary.
00:20:38,00:20:41,He must have really wriggled in among the stuffing.
00:20:41,00:20:45,How long do you think you try and keep it up for once they say there's someone in that
00:20:45,00:20:46,"bear, isn't there?"
00:20:46,00:20:49,You just pretend to be one of those talking bears.
00:20:49,00:20:50,That's what the movie Ted was.
00:20:50,00:20:54,There was actually a man in there.
00:20:54,00:21:02,The first ever vehicle alarm immobiliser system for a car was invented in 1921.
00:21:02,00:21:05,"There wasn't really, that technology didn't exist."
00:21:05,00:21:11,It was just a freelance effort by an army captain who lived in Victoria in London and
00:21:11,00:21:14,his motorbike kept being nicked and he was quite annoyed about it.
00:21:14,00:21:18,His initial innovation was he would take out almost all the fuel so that if it was nicked
00:21:18,00:21:23,it could go about a mile and then he'd just search a mile radius and he got the motorbike
00:21:23,00:21:24,back.
00:21:24,00:21:25,That's a good idea.
00:21:25,00:21:26,That's a good idea.
00:21:26,00:21:28,He thought he didn't want even that to happen again.
00:21:28,00:21:35,"So he attached a grenade to the motorbike and connected the pin to a nearby railing,"
00:21:35,00:21:40,meaning that if anyone ever drove off on the motorbike it would set off the grenade.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Oh my God.
00:21:41,00:21:46,Unfortunately for him the wind just blew the bike over one day.
00:21:46,00:21:52,The explosion destroyed his bike and destroyed his car and destroyed a lot of the flat downstairs
00:21:52,00:21:53,from him.
00:21:53,00:21:54,Oh my God.
00:21:54,00:21:58,There's one really advanced thing is a new Toyota patent.
00:21:58,00:22:03,"Basically when you walk into your car, or you walk into a car, the car can tell what"
00:22:03,00:22:08,"your phone is, but like if it's in your pocket it can kind of detect your phone and then"
00:22:08,00:22:12,it will release a fragrance of your choosing.
00:22:12,00:22:17,"So if you're like, well I really like the smell of freshly mowed lawn, then whenever"
00:22:17,00:22:20,you get in the car it'll know you're there and it'll give you that.
00:22:20,00:22:26,Has this car got like just a big bank of every cent possibly?
00:22:26,00:22:30,"At the moment it's a patent, so they might not have all of them."
00:22:30,00:22:31,But like presumably...
00:22:31,00:22:32,But you can mix it.
00:22:32,00:22:33,"It's like printer ink, isn't it?"
00:22:33,00:22:34,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"You can just combine, you know, like mowed grass, plush."
00:22:36,00:22:38,Or you could just buy all of the scents that you want.
00:22:38,00:22:44,"Oh yeah, just get a big thing of toner for steak or whatever."
00:22:44,00:22:48,"You can't get a cart that smells like a steak, but you might do, right?"
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"But if he walks in the car it smells of steak, if I walk in it smells of fresh..."
00:22:52,00:22:56,"What if we both get in the same car though, and then it's like a freshly mowed steak?"
00:22:56,00:22:58,That's going to be a weird crash.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Like a cow in a field.
00:22:59,00:23:00,"Oh yeah, perfect."
00:23:00,00:23:04,"Everyone's favourite of smell, cows in fields."
00:23:04,00:23:09,"Anyway, the idea of this and one of the things that's genuinely in this patent is if someone"
00:23:09,00:23:13,gets in the car with a different phone so they realise that it's someone who shouldn't
00:23:13,00:23:17,"be there, then it can give tear gas instead of perfume."
00:23:17,00:23:20,That's incredible.
00:23:20,00:23:24,"When you borrow your husband's phone for the day, that's a horrible journey."
00:23:24,00:23:25,Oh my God.
00:23:25,00:23:30,"So there's another thing with the key fobs, there's a Volvo whereby it can tell you,"
00:23:30,00:23:34,"it's got a sensor that can tell you if there's a heartbeat in the car, so it can alert you"
00:23:34,00:23:35,to intruders.
00:23:35,00:23:36,"No, that's horrible."
00:23:36,00:23:37,Is there someone hiding in your car?
00:23:37,00:23:41,It's just like a huge teddy bear that's just appeared to your left-hand side.
00:23:41,00:23:44,I think possibly there's two reasons for it.
00:23:44,00:23:48,One is that if you closed the car door and you're in a rush and you've left your child
00:23:48,00:23:52,"in there, or your dog or something and you know how you forget leaving your child in"
00:23:52,00:23:53,a car.
00:23:53,00:23:54,Just check in the car.
00:23:54,00:23:56,That's why I'm not allowed to drive.
00:23:56,00:23:59,I've lost six kids.
00:23:59,00:24:03,"But it's been used for intruders as well, it can just sort of say there's a heartbeat"
00:24:03,00:24:04,in your car.
00:24:04,00:24:05,That's quite clever.
00:24:05,00:24:10,"Another very weird law that was passed, car-based, it was in 1928, Ministry of Transport passed"
00:24:10,00:24:11,an order.
00:24:11,00:24:16,It made it illegal to lock your car if it was parked in public.
00:24:16,00:24:17,It made it illegal.
00:24:17,00:24:18,Okay.
00:24:18,00:24:19,Illegal.
00:24:19,00:24:20,Is that so?
00:24:20,00:24:24,Because I know that in Manitoba or somewhere that you're not supposed to lock your cars
00:24:24,00:24:27,in case there's like a polar bear and someone can hide in the car.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Is it?
00:24:28,00:24:29,Bingo.
00:24:29,00:24:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:24:30,00:24:34,What it is is because there was so much traffic that was stopping people getting around because
00:24:34,00:24:38,"cars were taking off and cities weren't adapted for them, so it would be easier for the police"
00:24:38,00:24:42,"to just move your car on if it was getting in people's way, so it was illegal to lock"
00:24:42,00:24:44,your car in public.
00:24:44,00:24:47,"Oh, so it wasn't the bear thing?"
00:24:47,00:24:48,It was similar to the bear thing.
00:24:48,00:24:52,Because you made it sound like James had given the right arm.
00:24:52,00:24:53,I did.
00:24:53,00:24:54,I think I said the word...
00:24:54,00:24:55,I was counting my points.
00:24:55,00:24:56,I said the word bingo at one point.
00:24:56,00:25:00,"It's not a slam dunk bingo, but other people might need to use your car or move it around."
00:25:00,00:25:03,"Anyway, great quiz Andy."
00:25:03,00:25:11,I can't believe I didn't get the university challenge.
00:25:11,00:25:18,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:25:18,00:25:25,My fact this week is that scientists have successfully made a human hamster hybrid.
00:25:25,00:25:30,They call it a hamster.
00:25:30,00:25:33,"So talk to us about your interpretation of the word successfully, scientists have successfully"
00:25:33,00:25:34,made the hybrid.
00:25:34,00:25:35,"Yeah, cool."
00:25:35,00:25:41,"Okay, so this is called the hamster test, and it is a scientific way of testing male infertility."
00:25:41,00:25:46,"So this came about because scientists, there's a lot of ethical questions and issues that"
00:25:46,00:25:51,you have when you're trying to test for infertility by using a human sperm and a human egg.
00:25:51,00:25:53,So we needed alternatives for that.
00:25:53,00:25:54,And fortunately...
00:25:54,00:25:55,"And this is a test of sperm as fertile, right?"
00:25:55,00:25:59,"Yeah, it's testing of male sperm as fertile, and this goes for IVF and all that sort of"
00:25:59,00:26:00,stuff.
00:26:00,00:26:06,"And so using a female egg is not allowed, there's a lot of ethical questions with that."
00:26:06,00:26:11,"And so what happens is that they need another way of doing it, and fortunately our mammalian"
00:26:11,00:26:14,reproduction makeup means that there are a few animals that we can do that with.
00:26:14,00:26:18,"So one of the things that they do it with is hamster eggs, and when they use the hamster"
00:26:18,00:26:23,"eggs what they do is they inject the sperm into it, but sometimes the sperm penetrates"
00:26:23,00:26:30,"the hamster egg, and when it penetrates a hybrid embryo is created, a single cell embryo"
00:26:30,00:26:34,"is created, and that's what scientists call the hamster."
00:26:34,00:26:39,"So when you say it's like a hybrid of a human and a hamster, it's not like a tiny human"
00:26:39,00:26:43,that can keep stuff in its cheeks on a massive hamster.
00:26:43,00:26:48,I actually wrote to a bunch of scientists to ask if maybe one day hamsters will rule
00:26:48,00:26:49,the earth.
00:26:49,00:26:53,And a lot of them got back to me and said no.
00:26:53,00:26:59,"Well, actually there was one NHS doctor who's doing amazing, like really cutting edge stuff"
00:26:59,00:27:02,"on trying to cure cancer, and he was like, give me five minutes."
00:27:02,00:27:06,"And he went off to find out, and he thinks that there is a way that you could eventually"
00:27:06,00:27:12,"manufacture it to accommodate the cell, because the problem is that it just, it will die after"
00:27:12,00:27:15,"a few days, or it'll split into two cells or something."
00:27:15,00:27:17,That's not necessarily a problem.
00:27:17,00:27:18,You need it to split into two cells.
00:27:18,00:27:19,"We're not single celled, are we?"
00:27:19,00:27:20,No.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"The key is it needs to split, but they kill it before it splits, because that's bad."
00:27:23,00:27:24,That's the point.
00:27:24,00:27:28,"But the point is we sometimes kill it before seeing if it can split into two, but the belief"
00:27:28,00:27:30,is it can split into two.
00:27:30,00:27:36,"So they quickly go, ooh, before it splits into three, that's my theory."
00:27:36,00:27:38,"But the reality is that it couldn't live, it just couldn't live."
00:27:38,00:27:42,"This doesn't happen whenever we have a sperm test, does it?"
00:27:42,00:27:46,"They don't take, they don't go to the hamster lab."
00:27:46,00:27:48,This is one way of doing it.
00:27:48,00:27:49,I think there are other ways of checking it.
00:27:49,00:27:50,Thank God.
00:27:50,00:27:54,"And I think it's not necessarily because the ethical things of using a human egg entirely,"
00:27:54,00:27:58,"it's largely because human eggs are few and far between, because you can easily get a donor"
00:27:58,00:28:03,"egg from a hamster, because you don't as often ask their permission, whereas it's quite hard."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"But yeah, it is also ethically easier, because it's a hamster."
00:28:05,00:28:10,"But also, there's a lot of question about when life begins, and that is one of the issues."
00:28:10,00:28:14,"If what happens here, what happens with the hamster, which is also, that's slightly an"
00:28:14,00:28:19,"ethical debate, because I say, I've been asking scientists, so is that for just a second"
00:28:19,00:28:20,while it's alive?
00:28:20,00:28:21,Is that a hamster?
00:28:21,00:28:22,Is that a real thing?
00:28:22,00:28:24,"And they've all refused to answer, because it's a dodgy question, but it's also exciting"
00:28:24,00:28:26,that we could one day have hamsters.
00:28:26,00:28:28,Because we don't have...
00:28:28,00:28:32,I'm not going to wait for the version of Jurassic Park.
00:28:32,00:28:37,"Well, did you see, there was a script that was leaked, where Jurassic Park 4 was meant"
00:28:37,00:28:39,to be human dinosaur hybrids?
00:28:39,00:28:40,"No, I didn't see that."
00:28:40,00:28:43,"Well, you missed out, because there was conceptual art, and it looks awesome."
00:28:43,00:28:47,"It's like a man with dino legs running around, and that's what it was meant to be."
00:28:47,00:28:50,I think technically Andy might be a hamster.
00:28:50,00:28:52,"Oh, yeah?"
00:28:52,00:28:55,We always put him in that wheel in the dressing room.
00:28:55,00:28:56,"Oh, my God!"
00:28:56,00:29:00,And the amount of shit you can get in your cheeks is insane.
00:29:00,00:29:04,"The reason being, if you look in the Oxford English Dictionary for the word ""humpster"","
00:29:04,00:29:05,it does exist.
00:29:05,00:29:11,"There's one citation from 1670, and it's a person who expresses their approval by humming"
00:29:11,00:29:12,"""hmmm""."
00:29:12,00:29:18,"So if you ever do that, which you do do sometimes, you're a hamster."
00:29:18,00:29:21,"God, imagine if that's what a scientist created."
00:29:21,00:29:24,How disappointed would we be?
00:29:24,00:29:25,Wow.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Andy.
00:29:26,00:29:27,What an other name.
00:29:27,00:29:32,What I find really interesting about this process of creating the hamster is that the
00:29:32,00:29:38,sperm need to be incubated for 20 hours before they're introduced formally to the egg.
00:29:38,00:29:40,Like a society ball.
00:29:40,00:29:45,"Yeah, they go to the dance, they've got little dance cards, but yeah, they're incubated"
00:29:45,00:29:46,before they are introduced.
00:29:46,00:29:51,And this is because I didn't realise that inside a woman's body when a sperm is introduced
00:29:51,00:29:56,"in a conventional way, they have to capacitate for about 10 hours, which is the opposite"
00:29:56,00:29:57,"of incapacitate, really."
00:29:57,00:30:01,"It takes them about 10 hours to get ready to fertilise, so they don't zoom in and they're"
00:30:01,00:30:02,all set.
00:30:02,00:30:06,"They zoom in and then they, well, it's a process called capacitation."
00:30:06,00:30:08,"Well, they just kind of hovered near the egg or what?"
00:30:08,00:30:14,So they hang around near the egg and they sort of like put a suit on and they get themselves
00:30:14,00:30:18,all beefed up and ready to fertilise before doing it.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"Another part of it, which is quite interesting, is to get the eggs from the hamster in the"
00:30:21,00:30:22,first place.
00:30:22,00:30:28,And one way that they do that is that they treat the hamster with pregnant horse serum
00:30:28,00:30:32,and you put some pregnant horse serum into the hamster and that will simultaneously make
00:30:32,00:30:34,them produce about 40 eggs.
00:30:34,00:30:35,Wow.
00:30:35,00:30:39,"So it's not only a human hamster hybrid, but then there's also a bit of horse in there"
00:30:39,00:30:40,as well.
00:30:40,00:30:43,Do you ever just think science doesn't do itself any favours?
00:30:43,00:30:46,I feel a bit eckey about this.
00:30:46,00:30:47,No.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"I mean, this is a kind of crossbred species."
00:30:50,00:30:54,"I mean, not one that's viable, but I've just been reading about hybrids and, you know,"
00:30:54,00:30:55,crosses between species.
00:30:55,00:31:00,"It's been going since 2,500 BC, the crossing of species with each other, but specifically"
00:31:00,00:31:01,by humans.
00:31:01,00:31:03,So this was the thing that was found in Syria.
00:31:03,00:31:08,It was a burial complex and they found about 25 skeletons and there weren't horses.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"They were kind of nearly horses, but they weren't quite."
00:31:11,00:31:15,And they were a cross between a domestic donkey and a wild ass.
00:31:15,00:31:16,Okay.
00:31:16,00:31:19,"So quite similar, very similar species, but not identical."
00:31:19,00:31:25,"And they were these mysterious creatures called kungas, which we don't have anymore,"
00:31:25,00:31:26,but they were highly prized.
00:31:26,00:31:31,"They were calmer than wild asses, but they were faster than donkeys."
00:31:31,00:31:35,So they were useful for battles and they were used as royal vehicles.
00:31:35,00:31:37,They used as dowries and marriages.
00:31:37,00:31:39,And kungas just were a thing.
00:31:39,00:31:40,Yeah.
00:31:40,00:31:41,Four and a half thousand years ago.
00:31:41,00:31:42,"And a huge thing, right?"
00:31:42,00:31:43,They're all over the paintings and artworks.
00:31:43,00:31:44,They're Mesopotamia.
00:31:44,00:31:45,They were a big deal.
00:31:45,00:31:50,"The other thing about it is they're hard to make because they're infertile, so you"
00:31:50,00:31:51,create them and then they're sterile.
00:31:51,00:31:56,"So if you want a second kunga, you need to go out into the woods again and chase down"
00:31:56,00:31:59,"one of these very fast, very strong wild asses again."
00:31:59,00:32:02,And then somehow make it mate with a donkey.
00:32:02,00:32:05,"I mean, that's, that's difficult at the best of times."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"Have you heard of the country singer, American country singer?"
00:32:07,00:32:09,She's called Taylor Mu.
00:32:09,00:32:10,"And she, this is really interesting."
00:32:10,00:32:14,"She has a chunk of skin on her body, which is a different color to the rest of her."
00:32:14,00:32:15,It was way darker.
00:32:15,00:32:16,"Oh, wow."
00:32:16,00:32:17,She didn't know why for years.
00:32:17,00:32:20,"She was told it was a birthmark by doctors, seemed like the obvious explanation."
00:32:20,00:32:24,"Anyway, she found out she is her own twin sister."
00:32:24,00:32:25,Okay.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"So in the womb, she was going to be twins, but the egg which would have become her"
00:32:28,00:32:33,"sister fused with her egg, you know, while both of them were right at the tiny, tiny"
00:32:33,00:32:34,embryos stage.
00:32:34,00:32:38,So that darker skin is from her sister's DNA.
00:32:38,00:32:44,"She's got two sets of DNA in her body basically, but she has two immune systems, two bloodstreams"
00:32:44,00:32:45,I wrote down.
00:32:45,00:32:46,I'm not exactly clear on that.
00:32:46,00:32:50,"But she, she hasn't, yeah, I don't know, just move on past it."
00:32:50,00:32:54,"But she has, she also has lots of allergies because her body thinks that her sister's"
00:32:54,00:32:57,DNA is foreign DNA inside her body.
00:32:57,00:33:02,"But the weird thing is, remember I said her name at the start, Taylor Mule."
00:33:02,00:33:03,Taylor Mule.
00:33:03,00:33:06,A Mule is a hybridised.
00:33:06,00:33:08,How did she not know?
00:33:08,00:33:12,The clue was there.
00:33:12,00:33:22,"She was tailored, yeah."
00:33:22,00:33:27,You can have human pig hybrids and these exist.
00:33:27,00:33:34,The hope with these is that they'll be able to grow human-like organs inside pigs and
00:33:34,00:33:37,then we'll be able to take them out of the pigs and put them into us and you'll be able
00:33:37,00:33:39,to have that kind of thing.
00:33:39,00:33:40,Have they got a fun name?
00:33:40,00:33:41,What are they called?
00:33:41,00:33:43,"Well, see if you can guess."
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Oh, okay."
00:33:44,00:33:47,"So part human, part pig, anyone?"
00:33:47,00:33:48,Okay.
00:33:48,00:33:49,Poo man.
00:33:49,00:33:50,Poo man.
00:33:50,00:33:51,Poo man.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Poo man.
00:33:52,00:33:53,Poo man.
00:33:53,00:33:54,Poo man as in pee for pig and human.
00:33:54,00:33:55,Yeah.
00:33:55,00:33:56,Poo man.
00:33:56,00:33:57,Poo man.

00:34:21,00:34:22,"Oh, yeah."
00:34:22,00:34:23,Any suggestions?
00:34:23,00:34:24,Hug.
00:34:24,00:34:25,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"So Anna's got one point, James's got one point."
00:34:27,00:34:28,I've only got two.
00:34:28,00:34:29,"Sorry, Dan."
00:34:29,00:34:30,"Great quiz, Andy."
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Oh, wait."
00:34:31,00:34:32,I've got one more.
00:34:32,00:34:33,Yes.
00:34:33,00:34:34,A rabbit.
00:34:34,00:34:37,It's a rabbit and a cabbage.
00:34:37,00:34:42,"No, it's a radish and a cabbage."
00:34:42,00:34:43,Sorry.
00:34:43,00:34:44,A cabbage.
00:34:44,00:34:49,It's the only animal that eats its own ears.
00:34:49,00:35:01,"It is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:35:01,00:35:08,My fact is that cardboard is so valuable on the black market that it is nicknamed beige
00:35:08,00:35:09,gold.
00:35:09,00:35:10,Strap in.
00:35:10,00:35:14,We're going to do 15 minutes on cardboard.
00:35:14,00:35:15,Yeah.
00:35:15,00:35:16,20 if you're unlucky.
00:35:16,00:35:17,Beige gold.
00:35:17,00:35:18,Beige gold price.
00:35:18,00:35:21,So cardboard is incredibly valuable at the moment.
00:35:21,00:35:22,Incredibly valuable.
00:35:22,00:35:23,Incredibly valuable.
00:35:23,00:35:24,More.
00:35:24,00:35:25,Okay.
00:35:25,00:35:27,Prices were 70 pounds per ton.
00:35:27,00:35:28,Give or take recently.
00:35:28,00:35:29,Not very much.
00:35:29,00:35:30,A ton of cardboard is a lot.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Yeah.
00:35:31,00:35:32,70 pounds is not very much.
00:35:32,00:35:36,"But when coronavirus started, the price shot up of cardboard."
00:35:36,00:35:39,It doubled because there was so much more demand.
00:35:39,00:35:40,Lots of people were stuck at home.
00:35:40,00:35:42,Lots of people were doing online shopping.
00:35:42,00:35:44,And the price just absolutely rocketed.
00:35:44,00:35:49,"And as a result of the price being very high, demand being massive, there have been cardboard"
00:35:49,00:35:50,heists.
00:35:50,00:35:52,There have been cardboard -- wow.
00:35:52,00:35:55,There's a cardboard mafia who were in operation in Europe.
00:35:55,00:36:00,There's a whole cardboard crime network whose job is to steal cardboard.
00:36:00,00:36:04,"When you think you've cornered as the police, the cardboard mafia, and you get up close to"
00:36:04,00:36:09,"them, does it turn out it's just a cut out of them that made their getaway minutes ago?"
00:36:09,00:36:10,That would be great.
00:36:10,00:36:11,I did some maths.
00:36:11,00:36:12,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:12,00:36:19,"And for one kilogram of gold, if you wanted to have enough cardboard to be worth the same"
00:36:19,00:36:25,"amount as one kilogram of gold, it would have to weigh about as much as the Statue of Liberty."
00:36:25,00:36:26,Okay.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Okay.
00:36:27,00:36:28,So valuable.
00:36:28,00:36:32,Gold smuggling is still more valuable.
00:36:32,00:36:35,"If you want to set up a crime syndicate, drugs are still the way to go."
00:36:35,00:36:39,"But if you're a small timer, cardboard is the way."
00:36:39,00:36:42,There was a thing in Madrid in 2018 to '19.
00:36:42,00:36:43,This is even pre-COVID.
00:36:43,00:36:47,Half the cardboard that people were putting out for recycling was stolen.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"But I would say, is that a problem?"
00:36:49,00:36:50,Yeah.
00:36:50,00:36:54,If you're putting out cardboard to be recycled as someone else is stealing it rather than
00:36:54,00:36:55,a normal recycling people --
00:36:55,00:36:56,"Well, who should --"
00:36:56,00:36:58,"To me personally, the job's being done, right?"
00:36:58,00:36:59,"Well, that's true."
00:36:59,00:37:04,"But it's in the hands of the gangs, then, I guess, who are going to -- they control the"
00:37:04,00:37:05,cardboard trade now.
00:37:05,00:37:06,I don't know.
00:37:06,00:37:08,And they'll corner the market.
00:37:08,00:37:09,I don't know what they'll do with it.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"Well, they're making money out of it, basically."
00:37:11,00:37:15,They would travel around the city basically before the cardboard recycling truck.
00:37:15,00:37:17,And they would just go to every stop.
00:37:17,00:37:18,They'd learn the routes.
00:37:18,00:37:20,They had dozens of people involved.
00:37:20,00:37:22,Because they do sound like do-gooders.
00:37:22,00:37:24,They sound like they've made more --
00:37:24,00:37:26,I've made them sound wrong.
00:37:26,00:37:27,They're hardcore criminals.
00:37:27,00:37:33,"If someone drives around collecting my rubbish, I don't care who does it."
00:37:33,00:37:36,"I know you don't care, but it's a big problem."
00:37:36,00:37:37,Right.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"They're getting bullied in prison, is all I'm saying."
00:37:39,00:37:40,They're fellow inmates.
00:37:40,00:37:41,What are you in for?
00:37:41,00:37:42,Voluntary recycling?
00:37:42,00:37:46,So why don't the garbage men start half an hour early?
00:37:46,00:37:48,"They start early enough already, don't they?"
00:37:48,00:37:49,What's your answer?
00:37:49,00:37:51,It's just the garbage men have to start earlier.
00:37:51,00:37:52,That's not the way to deal with crime.
00:37:52,00:37:54,It's for the victims to adapt.
00:37:54,00:37:59,"Do you have to have hard, tough, rough justice for these crooks?"
00:37:59,00:38:00,Yeah.
00:38:00,00:38:02,"Madrid, the city of Madrid, where this was happening."
00:38:02,00:38:04,I would export it to Southeast Asia for pulping.
00:38:04,00:38:07,So they're stealing other people's cardboard.
00:38:07,00:38:10,I feel like there's not enough anger in the room about this.
00:38:10,00:38:13,I just kind of feel like there might be other problems.
00:38:13,00:38:14,I know.
00:38:14,00:38:19,Madrid deliberately introduced dumpsters with tiny holes for cardboard so that the gangs
00:38:19,00:38:22,couldn't climb in and get the cardboard out.
00:38:22,00:38:23,They don't need to climb in.
00:38:23,00:38:26,They got there half an hour before the actual fucking truck got there.
00:38:26,00:38:28,What are you talking about?
00:38:28,00:38:30,I'm just saying.
00:38:30,00:38:35,"Did the price go up because there was a shortage, because we were all ordering loads of stuff."
00:38:35,00:38:36,That was part of it.
00:38:36,00:38:37,"Uncording cardboard, basically."
00:38:37,00:38:40,And then Amazon bought a load of the available cardboard.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"So for a while at the start of COVID, people couldn't get eggs."
00:38:42,00:38:48,"That was because there were enough eggs going around, but there weren't the cardboard containers for the eggs."
00:38:48,00:38:51,And you can't just drop eggs on people's doorsteps.
00:38:51,00:38:53,Eggs are the worst thing to buy loose.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"So that was why you couldn't get eggs, right?"
00:38:55,00:38:58,But I don't remember there being an egg shortage during those.
00:38:58,00:38:59,There was.
00:38:59,00:39:00,That was a huge egg shortage.
00:39:00,00:39:01,I didn't remember that.
00:39:01,00:39:02,How was the divide?
00:39:02,00:39:04,I would say egg and loo roll were the two big ones.
00:39:04,00:39:05,Really?
00:39:05,00:39:06,Hell yeah.
00:39:06,00:39:12,I was in the countryside and the farmhouse next to us used to put freshly laid chicken eggs out every morning.
00:39:12,00:39:13,Six of them.
00:39:13,00:39:15,And I used to go about 7am already gone.
00:39:15,00:39:17,Have you tried going a bit earlier?
00:39:17,00:39:21,What was he putting the eggs out for?
00:39:21,00:39:22,"Sorry, for you."
00:39:22,00:39:26,"Well, in the country, people always put eggs if they've got chickens outside and say,"
00:39:26,00:39:29,"""Hey, drop a pound in and take four eggs."""
00:39:29,00:39:30,All gone.
00:39:30,00:39:34,"But speaking of eggs, Easter eggs used to be made of cardboard."
00:39:34,00:39:35,What?
00:39:35,00:39:39,In very disappointing times for children at Easter before they were made of chocolate.
00:39:39,00:39:41,And they were actually really beautiful.
00:39:41,00:39:47,"So in the 19th century, they would have beautiful scenes kind of drawn on them."
00:39:47,00:39:49,So shortly after the kind of invention of cardboard.
00:39:49,00:39:53,And then they'd be covered in satin and they'd still be in two halves and you get your sweets inside.
00:39:53,00:39:56,"But yeah, the egg itself, don't eat it."
00:39:56,00:39:59,Do you know what the first thing you ever put in a cardboard box was?
00:39:59,00:40:00,"Oh, great."
00:40:00,00:40:02,"Good question though, isn't it?"
00:40:02,00:40:03,Can we work it out?
00:40:03,00:40:04,"Oh, no."
00:40:04,00:40:08,I would say not in a thousand years.
00:40:08,00:40:10,Another smaller cardboard box.
00:40:10,00:40:11,"Oh great, that's no."
00:40:11,00:40:12,Okay.
00:40:12,00:40:13,Something small.
00:40:13,00:40:14,Was it?
00:40:14,00:40:15,Fly.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"Animals, yeah."
00:40:16,00:40:17,"Oh no, a moth, it was a moth."
00:40:17,00:40:18,No.
00:40:18,00:40:19,"Yes, it was."
00:40:19,00:40:20,Wow.
00:40:20,00:40:22,There's a new tactic here.
00:40:22,00:40:24,Just on right.
00:40:24,00:40:25,Very close.
00:40:25,00:40:26,It was a silkworm.
00:40:26,00:40:27,"Oh, cool."
00:40:27,00:40:31,They were invented apparently in Valriac in Provence.
00:40:31,00:40:32,Silkworms.
00:40:32,00:40:35,"You know, cardboard boxes."
00:40:35,00:40:41,"Because there was a guy who was, he was making silk and he was in bringing the silkworms over from China."
00:40:41,00:40:44,And his silkworms kept dying.
00:40:44,00:40:48,And so he went to a local wig maker and asked him if there was anything that he could do.
00:40:48,00:40:54,And this wig maker made these kind of cardboard boxes with holes in which he invented.
00:40:54,00:40:57,And this is according to the cardboard box museum in France.
00:40:57,00:40:58,It sounds amazing.
00:40:58,00:40:59,Yeah.
00:40:59,00:41:00,It does sound really interesting.
00:41:00,00:41:01,"Yeah, Valriac."
00:41:01,00:41:05,And it says it's the historical capital of French cardboard.
00:41:05,00:41:07,It's quite a lot of qualifications.
00:41:07,00:41:09,I don't think there are any other cardboard museums.
00:41:09,00:41:11,So just on the invention of cardboard.
00:41:11,00:41:12,Yeah.
00:41:12,00:41:14,Did you guys come across Malcolm Thornhill in your research?
00:41:14,00:41:15,Malcolm?
00:41:15,00:41:16,No.
00:41:16,00:41:17,Okay.
00:41:17,00:41:18,"There's this fact all over the internet, right?"
00:41:18,00:41:25,And it's that cardboard was invented in 1817 when Sir Malcolm Thornhill started using thick sheets of paper to make boxes.
00:41:25,00:41:26,And they weren't like modern cardboard.
00:41:26,00:41:28,They were just single sheets of cardboard.
00:41:28,00:41:32,"So they weren't corrugated and, you know, firm and great like modern cardboard boxes."
00:41:32,00:41:37,"And if that is true, that means that theoretically Jane Austen could have used a cardboard box."
00:41:37,00:41:39,"Because that was the year she died, 1817."
00:41:39,00:41:40,That's huge.
00:41:40,00:41:42,That's huge.
00:41:42,00:41:46,"The only problem is, it is definitely not true."
00:41:46,00:41:47,It's all over the internet.
00:41:47,00:41:49,It's on Wikipedia.
00:41:49,00:41:52,It's been taken off the internet and put into books as a result of which...
00:41:52,00:41:54,And what's your evidence that it's not true?
00:41:54,00:41:56,There's no evidence of Malcolm Thornhill being real.
00:41:56,00:41:57,"Oh, your sister."
00:41:57,00:41:58,There's just no...
00:41:58,00:42:00,You search for Malcolm Thornhill in 19th century sources.
00:42:00,00:42:01,There's nothing.
00:42:01,00:42:05,"But the problem is, now that it's been taken off Wikipedia, where it was with no evidence."
00:42:05,00:42:07,There wasn't any resource and put in a book.
00:42:07,00:42:09,It's now been sourced on Wikipedia to the books.
00:42:09,00:42:12,Which say that Malcolm Thornhill invented it in 1817.
00:42:12,00:42:15,It's a thing called cytogenesis on Wikipedia.
00:42:15,00:42:18,Which is where something is this awful circular loop.
00:42:18,00:42:20,"But no, there's no way of getting rid of it."
00:42:20,00:42:23,You're exploding this very little known myth.
00:42:23,00:42:24,That's my thing now.
00:42:24,00:42:28,Don't go home tonight and tell each other Malcolm Thornhill invented cardboard in 1817.
00:42:28,00:42:29,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:29,00:42:33,"If there's one thing you don't say to each other after the show tonight, don't say that."
00:42:33,00:42:35,"I don't say that even if it was true, to be honest."
00:42:35,00:42:37,As a conversation starter over dinner.
00:42:37,00:42:39,I got a good one-question quiz.
00:42:39,00:42:41,"Wow, it's been a real quiz episode tonight, hasn't it?"
00:42:41,00:42:42,"Yeah, so here we go."
00:42:42,00:42:44,"Yeah, so it's one quiz question."
00:42:44,00:42:45,Fingers on buzzers.
00:42:45,00:42:47,This is a kind of cardboard.
00:42:47,00:42:48,What is it used for?
00:42:48,00:42:50,It's called a zarf.
00:42:50,00:42:51,Scarfs.
00:42:51,00:42:52,Buzz.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"Oh, it didn't buzz."
00:42:53,00:42:54,Ah.
00:42:54,00:42:55,Putting scarves in.
00:42:55,00:42:56,Putting scarves in.
00:42:56,00:42:57,"No, yeah, no."
00:42:57,00:42:58,I was going to say scarves for zebras.
00:42:58,00:42:59,Zebra scarves.
00:42:59,00:43:00,Zarf.
00:43:00,00:43:01,"Oh, we're going back into hybrids."
00:43:01,00:43:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:02,00:43:03,Yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:04,"It's not that, is it?"
00:43:04,00:43:05,It's absolutely that.
00:43:05,00:43:08,You guys just jammed some crazy fucking idea.
00:43:08,00:43:10,"No, it's obviously not that."
00:43:10,00:43:11,What is it?
00:43:11,00:43:14,"A zarf is, and everyone's used zarfs,"
00:43:14,00:43:16,but you just didn't know what it was called.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"You know, when you go to a coffee shop,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,"and you get a coffee, and it's a bit too hot,"
00:43:20,00:43:24,and they put a little sleeve of cardboard over it?
00:43:24,00:43:25,That's a zarf.
00:43:25,00:43:27,It's a scarf for a cup.
00:43:27,00:43:28,A zarf.
00:43:28,00:43:29,That's brilliant.
00:43:29,00:43:30,"Okay, great."
00:43:30,00:43:31,And where's that come from?
00:43:31,00:43:32,Just made up by someone.
00:43:32,00:43:33,"Yeah, I mean, it's been,"
00:43:33,00:43:35,zarfs have been used apparently.
00:43:35,00:43:38,"So there's an amazing writer who is called,"
00:43:38,00:43:39,what's his name again?
00:43:39,00:43:41,"I've read so many of his books, A.J. Jacobs."
00:43:41,00:43:42,Is it on the next page?
00:43:42,00:43:43,"Yeah, I got it."
00:43:43,00:43:45,"Whereas, I think his name's A.J. Jacobs."
00:43:45,00:43:48,"He wrote the book where he read the entire Encyclopedia,"
00:43:48,00:43:51,and he did this book where he went around thanking people
00:43:51,00:43:53,who had anyway played a part
00:43:53,00:43:55,in making a cup of coffee that you would drink.
00:43:55,00:43:56,"So he went around the world going,"
00:43:56,00:43:57,thank you for this.
00:43:57,00:43:59,"And one of the people he went to thank was,"
00:43:59,00:44:02,"were makers of zarfs, which was this item."
00:44:02,00:44:04,"So, but he says that they were used as far back"
00:44:04,00:44:06,"as ancient China, just they were,"
00:44:06,00:44:07,or they were different material.
00:44:07,00:44:09,They weren't necessarily thick.
00:44:09,00:44:13,Malcolm Thornhill hadn't even been born yet.
00:44:13,00:44:16,"I think they would have been like a marble or something,"
00:44:16,00:44:18,"but you would put it around a hot drink,"
00:44:18,00:44:19,and it would be a holder.
00:44:19,00:44:20,I don't know.
00:44:20,00:44:22,You think they were making coffee holders out of marble?
00:44:22,00:44:23,I don't know.
00:44:23,00:44:24,It just wasn't cardboard.
00:44:24,00:44:25,Thornhill didn't.
00:44:25,00:44:26,That's amazing.
00:44:26,00:44:28,How many Starbucks do you think you'd have to go into
00:44:28,00:44:30,and ask to have a zarf around my coffee?
00:44:30,00:44:33,One of them to know what the fuck you were talking about.
00:44:33,00:44:38,Cardboard was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame
00:44:38,00:44:39,in 2005.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"Ah, the cardboard box."
00:44:41,00:44:42,The cardboard box.
00:44:42,00:44:45,"Obviously the idea being, if you get a present,"
00:44:45,00:44:47,the cardboard box is often more interesting to a kid
00:44:47,00:44:49,than the actual toy itself.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"And it's such a fun,"
00:44:50,00:44:53,I love how lateral they think when they induct the toys
00:44:53,00:44:54,into the Hall of Fame.
00:44:54,00:44:56,"So last year's toys that went in,"
00:44:56,00:44:58,one of the things that were inducted as one of the great toys
00:44:58,00:45:00,was sand.
00:45:00,00:45:03,"They're running low on the toys, aren't they?"
00:45:03,00:45:05,I think a stick was one of the first.
00:45:05,00:45:07,"Yeah, a stick was once put in."
00:45:07,00:45:11,"So last year was sand, risk, and American girl dolls."
00:45:11,00:45:14,"Is it so that when you give your kids presents at Christmas,"
00:45:14,00:45:17,"you can say, ""Well, I got you something from the Hall of Fame."""
00:45:17,00:45:18,It's award-winning.
00:45:18,00:45:20,Do you want to hear one more cardboard crime?
00:45:20,00:45:21,"Yeah, go on."
00:45:21,00:45:22,Sure.
00:45:22,00:45:25,You can use cardboard to smuggle a cocaine.
00:45:25,00:45:27,"Sure, okay."
00:45:27,00:45:29,"Now, I know what you're thinking."
00:45:29,00:45:31,"Sure you can, just put the cocaine in the box."
00:45:31,00:45:33,Or what's the point of smuggling cocaine
00:45:33,00:45:35,when cardboard's so fucking expensive?
00:45:35,00:45:37,"Yeah, okay."
00:45:37,00:45:40,"In 2020, the Spanish police, also Spain,"
00:45:40,00:45:42,"like the Madrid cardboard smuggling ring,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,"the Spanish police, they smashed a gang"
00:45:45,00:45:49,who had put cocaine into cardboard boxes to smuggle it.
00:45:49,00:45:52,"Now, they hadn't just put cocaine into the boxes,"
00:45:52,00:45:55,they put it into the box.
00:45:55,00:45:58,The cardboard box was partly made of cocaine.
00:45:58,00:45:59,That's clever.
00:45:59,00:46:01,They had liquefied the cocaine
00:46:01,00:46:04,and then kind of impregnated it into the cardboard boxes.
00:46:04,00:46:06,But then the problem was they put actual cocaine
00:46:06,00:46:08,inside the cocaine cowboy box.
00:46:08,00:46:10,That's really clever.
00:46:10,00:46:12,"And then once you get the box to the other end,"
00:46:12,00:46:14,"you just extract it chemically, cocaine."
00:46:14,00:46:15,Perfect.
00:46:15,00:46:18,"A fun toy for the kid, a fun toy for the pair."
00:46:18,00:46:20,That's not sand!
00:46:20,00:46:24,"Guys, we're going to have to wrap up really soon."
00:46:24,00:46:26,Do you remember the anti-sex beds?
00:46:26,00:46:28,Speaking of cardboard.
00:46:28,00:46:32,"Oh, I think I got one by mistake."
00:46:32,00:46:34,Sorry.
00:46:34,00:46:37,I was just possessed by a comedian from the '70s
00:46:37,00:46:40,for a second there.
00:46:40,00:46:43,What was that?
00:46:43,00:46:49,The ghost of Les Dawson has blessed me with his presence.
00:46:49,00:46:52,We're honoured to have him here.
00:46:52,00:46:55,The anti-sex beds were the Tokyo Olympics.
00:46:55,00:46:58,"You alright, Dan?"
00:46:58,00:47:03,That's the weirdest thing I've seen how to do.
00:47:03,00:47:06,He genuinely looked suggestive.
00:47:06,00:47:08,He looked...
00:47:08,00:47:13,Sorry.
00:47:13,00:47:14,It was a character.
00:47:14,00:47:16,And then it was a really good joke.
00:47:21,00:47:24,"Come on, Dan. We're so near the end."
00:47:24,00:47:29,"Tokyo Olympics, they had anti-sex beds,"
00:47:29,00:47:31,and they weren't actually anti-sex beds.
00:47:31,00:47:33,They were just made of cardboard.
00:47:33,00:47:36,And the idea of anti-sex was that it was so flimsy
00:47:36,00:47:38,you couldn't have sex in them.
00:47:38,00:47:40,But the reason they had them at the Olympics
00:47:40,00:47:42,was to discourage the athletes from having sex
00:47:42,00:47:44,because it damages your game.
00:47:44,00:47:46,"But they were fine for sex anyway, so it wouldn't have discouraged it."
00:47:46,00:47:48,They were good for sex.
00:47:48,00:47:51,They definitely did not get an anti-sex bed.
00:47:51,00:47:56,There are so many reasons.
00:47:56,00:48:04,"OK, that's it."
