00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.920
 Okay everybody, secret message alert.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.200
 This is Andy speaking.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.060
 This is a secret message only for clubfish members.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.160
 If you're listening to this

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.760
 and you're not a clubfish member, turn off your ears.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.840
 Stop listening right now.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.360
 This is extremely hush hush knowledge

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.680
 that we're about to tell you.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.060
 The fact is, when you signed up to clubfish,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.040
 we told you we'd give you a bit of advance warning

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.000
 of live shows.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.080
 Guess what?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 That's what I'm doing now.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.000
 We are doing some live, no such thing as a fish shows

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.880
 in London, in Swing in London at the Soho Theatre.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.040
 We're gonna be there from the 17th of July

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.620
 to the 21st of August.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.180
 If you can't make either of those two dates,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.800
 there are all sorts of dates in the middle.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.480
 We're doing 11 shows at the Soho Theatre this summer.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 Sometimes we're doing two in a night.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240
 It's gonna be insane.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.120
 There are gonna be special guests every single show.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.500
 It's gonna be off the hook.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.960
 And if you, with your clubfish membership gold card,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.760
 want to turn up at these shows,

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.080
 all you need to do to get tickets

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.160
 in advance of everyone else is go to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.200
 nosuchthingasafish.com/soho.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.920
 That'll take you to the theatre website.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.480
 You just need to register with the theatre.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.080
 And if you're asked for a password to get onto the page,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.880
 the password is yeti, all capitals, Y-E-T-I.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.320
 The password is yeti.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.160
 Good luck.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.160
 See you there.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.960
 We're counting on you.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 This message will end in a few seconds.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 Thank you.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.160
 Let's get started on with the drop as a line.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.880
 Hi.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.200
 No, I did it wrong.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.360
 (laughing)

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.540
 (phone ringing)

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.120
 (upbeat music)

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.360
 Hi.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 - Oh, that was much better.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.040
 - Yeah, that was it.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.880
 - That's the Andy Wing.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.720
 - Hi, everybody.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600
 Welcome to drop as a line.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.360
 This is the bit of clubfish where we talk about your emails

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.360
 and the things you've sent in,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.040
 which agree with what we've said

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.360
 or maybe disagree with it

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.000
 or maybe just offer your own perspectives.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.880
 It's a two way street podcasting.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.840
 - No, very much a one way street normally.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.500
 - It's, what it's like, it's like a highway,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.840
 but we have recently opened a small service channel

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.920
 running back the other way.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.320
 - We're driving the wrong way down a highway.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.200
 - Yeah, and so let's read the messages

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.640
 that are in your cars.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.480
 - It's getting good.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 - I quite like this torture.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.120
 I think starting every show with a tortured metaphor.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 - How have I done that before?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.120
 - No, but I like it.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.160
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, all right.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 Well, let's strap in, do opposite belts and set off.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.280
 - Strap in and do opposite belts.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.240
 - Cool.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.080
 - Here's a good one.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.640
 Okay, here's a nice procedural question.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 - Okay.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.120
 - This is from Pete from Bolton, right?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.960
 - Oh, great.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.120
 - Pete says, just a quick one that's all,

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.880
 oh, he says hello specifically to you, James,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.720
 'cause you're from Bolton as well.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.560
 - Hi, Pete.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.680
 - And then he asks also which bit of Bolton you're from.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.040
 - I was brought up in Black Rod,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.240
 which is just outside Bolton.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.960
 And then I grew up in Ladybridge.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.360
 And then I moved to Morris Green.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.760
 And then I moved out of Bolton.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.000
 - Is Black Rod anything to do with the Queens?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.720
 - Yeah, you know what, it is to do with it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.600
 in the fact that it has the same name.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.440
 - Yeah.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.280
 - Other than that, nothing to do with it.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.120
 - Do you know what?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.960
 That's why I asked.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.400
 (laughing)

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.960
 - Anyway, let's get on to the meat of Pete's message.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.800
 - Pete's?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.120
 (laughing)

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.040
 - To Pete's meat.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 Here we go.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.360
 Just a quick one that's always confused me a little bit.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.960
 And I was reminded of it on the latest podcast

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960
 with Hannah Fry.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.280
 "You know how you all inform each other

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.040
 "of your facts before the show has to be able to prepare.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.360
 "When you act surprised or impressed by someone's fact,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.560
 "is it A, you already know the fact,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.760
 "but still act like it's novel

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.360
 "to make it sound like a good fact,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.600
 "or B, you kind of know what the fact is about,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.280
 "but you don't know the whole fact.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.240
 "James is the biggest proprietor of the,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.520
 "ah, is that right?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.800
 "Interesting, or that's amazing."

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.960
 And I'm always left feeling like,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.360
 wait, didn't you already know that?

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.800
 (laughing)

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.760
 If you only know kind of what the fact is gonna be,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.920
 I'd love to see on what premise

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.720
 some of Dan's facts have been rejected.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.960
 (laughing)

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960
 - So okay, yeah, over to you.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.600
 - Well, I don't think missing words

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.000
 would help us choose a fact

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.160
 because we do need to know what the subject is.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 So if you're missing the subject from it,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.960
 that wouldn't work.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960
 The truth is it's a mixture, isn't it,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.760
 of acting and delivery.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.400
 When someone delivers their fact in a funny way,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400
 of course it makes you laugh, or--

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.280
 - I think it would be a problem with this podcast

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.960
 if every time someone said a fact

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.600
 that one of us already knew,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.440
 we replied with, "Yes, I already knew that."

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.560
 So I think it's just normal conversation

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.480
 with your friends, right?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.280
 If your friends sometimes tell you something

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.720
 and you already know some of it,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720
 you still act slightly surprised

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.880
 'cause you want a conversation with them.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.720
 - Definitely.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.560
 - It's just normal.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 - And it's worth saying that

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.920
 that's the only thing we do know.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 When you're listening to the show,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.360
 we don't share any of the other facts.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.040
 There's no plan jokes or anything.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.800
 It's all new.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.600
 Just the headline is the only thing we go off.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.440
 - That's true.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.680
 All right, thanks to Pete.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.120
 - And your meat.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.960
 - Okay.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.120
 (laughing)

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.280
 I quite like the procedural stuff.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.000
 There's another procedural question.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.120
 This is a spicy one.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.040
 - Spicy meat.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.000
 (laughing)

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.480
 - It's from Federico.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.560
 - Has this got a name?

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.000
 'Cause you've named some of the other sections.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.840
 - That's a good point.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840
 - Like get to the meat.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.400
 Do you think we can call it that?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.240
 - Meat cute.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.160
 - I think meat cute, but wow.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.600
 I think spicy meat.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.880
 Spicy meat is the bit of the pod

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.920
 where we open up a pepper army

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.760
 and we see what's inside.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.760
 Federico writes, "Hey guys,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.520
 "over the many, many years I've been listening to fish,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.520
 "never, not once has James hosted the show."

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520
 - No, true.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.200
 - I know this is the best kept secret,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.520
 not only of the podcast,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.120
 but the whole QI HQ Corporation,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 Inc. and Co. Global Entertainment giant.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.000
 I'm genuinely curious about this.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.760
 These are possible reasons I thought about.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.400
 Here's where we get to the spicy meat.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.800
 One, is it because he already has a senior position at QI?

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.280
 Thus he's paid more.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.480
 Thus hosting the podcast would be overkill.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.120
 (laughing)

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.000
 Number two, or is it because he hijacked the episode

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.560
 and turned it into a bottomless golf of golf quotes?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.880
 (laughing)

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.560
 Three, or is it rather because he really can't be bothered

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.720
 and when Dan's not there,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.440
 either Anna or Andy always rushed to volunteer.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.360
 I'm sure I'm touching on something so sensitive

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.840
 that you might refuse to answer

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.440
 and that's why I'll be waiting for your response

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.600
 with trepidation.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.560
 Best Federico.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.880
 - Lovely question.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.120
 - I don't really know why.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.640
 Well, I always thought of it as, I just wasn't a host

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.080
 and Dan was a host

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.160
 and then I always think that Anna's the next best host.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.000
 But,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.840
 (laughing)

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.160
 - What, sorry?

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.960
 - And so whenever Dan's not here,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.320
 I'm always like, Anna, why don't you host?

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.640
 And Anna's usually like, no, I'm the host, yeah.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.680
 So yeah, I think I'm just far down.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.400
 The pecking order really in hosts.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.040
 I don't feel like I'm a host.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.920
 I don't feel like I have that authority that Dan has.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.400
 - You feel like I'm a third best host?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.560
 - It's only 'cause you keep injecting

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.600
 those tortured metaphors right at the time.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.240
 The editing time is intense.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.520
 - It's the third best in a very, very high field.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.560
 - It's on the podium, isn't it?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.400
 - Yeah.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.240
 - Yep.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.000
 (laughing)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.920
 - Yeah, no, I just don't really see myself

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.680
 as the host of this show, so.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.320
 - I think as well it was sort of, to begin with,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.320
 you were seen as the, I was gonna, I was gonna,

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.920
 this is the origins of it.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.440
 - I was gonna host it.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.600
 You were gonna be, as it were, the Alan Davis,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.760
 but you were the clever one.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.280
 So I was the idiot hosting, but you were the clever one.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.560
 And so when, then when it became a four,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.200
 that still was in our head that you were like,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.280
 never the host, you were the guy who was always,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.600
 you were the oracle, you were the--

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.040
 - I feel like more like the Richard Osman

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.280
 than the Alan Davis maybe.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.200
 - That's a good point, yeah.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.120
 - Kind of the person who just has the facts

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.960
 and brings them in.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.680
 Then actually, of course, the actual show is

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.240
 we all end up having facts and stuff.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.960
 But yeah, that was kind of the thought in my head

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.160
 when we first started out the show.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.000
 - 'Cause I was never meant to have a fact.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.480
 What a mistake to change it.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.080
 What were we thinking?

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.120
 - Here's a bit of cross on something you said recently, Dan.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.320
 - Seth Sibesma, I hope I'm pronouncing it right.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.720
 I'm sorry if I'm not, Seth, says,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.520
 I don't mean to alarm you, but in episode 127,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:58.000
 Dan says that by the time the episode is launched

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.160
 into space, do you remember we were gonna do that?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.000
 There's a sort of digital upload to the moon.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.920
 And land on the moon in 2024,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.400
 all of the podcast crew will be dead

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.640
 due to a horrible explosion in the QI office

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.300
 in 2023.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.140
 - Oh.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:11.980
 That's really interesting.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.760
 - And you said this in about 2016.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.880
 Please all be extra cautious this year

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.080
 and perhaps hire an inspector to ensure the integrity

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.480
 of gas lines and other potentially explosive elements

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.560
 of your new offices.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.080
 - We have just moved into a new building

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.960
 and we weren't allowed to have a poo in the building

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.160
 because there were issues.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.480
 I wonder if some sort of drainage explosion

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.000
 is on the carbon. - I think we're safe.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.760
 Like because Anna's not coming into the office

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.600
 at the moment.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.440
 - Yes.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.640
 - So we're safe until Anna comes back.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.480
 - Okay.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.320
 - Oh, that's a point.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.000
 So Margaret Daniel wrote on the same subject.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.720
 She said, Dan quips in this episode

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.600
 that all the elves will disappear in 2023.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.440
 Ironically, Anna has disappeared.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.280
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.120
 - Then the rest of you disappeared

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.320
 from the original office.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.720
 - Oh yeah, maybe that's what you meant.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.760
 This is a bit of a Nostradamus thing, isn't it?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.600
 - It is.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.080
 - Nostradamus said something slightly vague

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.520
 and we're trying to shoehorn the facts into it.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.360
 - Nostradamus, these are my shit predictions.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.200
 - Nostradamus.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.160
 Here's a great fact that we got sent.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.220
 - We didn't go to the moon, by the way,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.060
 just to add that.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.280
 - Oh yeah, didn't that fall apart?

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.120
 - We did, yeah.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.920
 So we did a, in one of our tour shows,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.280
 that was my first half, I sort of mentioned the fact

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.680
 that we were meant to go to the moon

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.320
 and then our mission got canceled

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.160
 because the team that were funding it fell short.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.500
 Just short by a hundred million dollars.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.720
 (laughing)

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.200
 - It's like us giving them a tanner.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.040
 It's so weird.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.860
 - Yeah.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:28.700
 - It's really weird.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.760
 - So yeah, so we never made it to the moon.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.680
 - No.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.240
 Oh well.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.160
 Here's a fact from Christian Ryder.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.200
 This is a great one.

00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.440
 Christian was looking at the surname Sizzers,

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.780
 which apparently comes from the Latin word for a tailor,

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.320
 and there was a small family of Russian Jews

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.380
 with that surname that fled the pogrom of Alexander II

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.160
 to America in the 1870s or '80s.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.640
 And I got to thinking even more.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.720
 And after a lot of searching and many hours wasted

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.800
 on findagrave.com, I found the ultimate.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.240
 At the Jewish cemetery of Mount Sinai Memorial Park

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.600
 in the Hollywood Hills, there are three Jewish men

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.860
 who all lived at the same time in the area

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.520
 and may well have known each other.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.360
 They were--

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.200
 - Oh no, I've got it.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.040
 - Really?

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.520
 - Milton H. Rock.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.360
 - Beautiful.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.680
 - Harry W. Paper and Samuel Sizzers.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.160
 - No, that's brilliant.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.560
 That's so funny.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.160
 What bit of the show are we in right now, by the way?

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.280
 Are we still in Spicy Meat?

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.680
 - No, no, we've moved on from the Spicy Meat course

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.880
 to an amusing sorbet in between.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.720
 (laughing)

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.560
 - Amusing sorbet.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.920
 - And it was boot, yeah, yeah.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.960
 - And we've moved on to another tortured metaphor.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.680
 - Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.860
 - Wow, that's a brilliant fact.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.700
 - Isn't that incredible?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.540
 - That's incredible.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.380
 - Yeah, amazing.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.500
 - So good, and apparently he's tried to find out

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.340
 a bit more about them.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.700
 On Rock's grave, Milton Rock--

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.740
 - Rock killed the Sizzers, Sizzers killed Paper.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.140
 It's a triple homicide.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.660
 - Rock might have been a spy.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.140
 On Rock's grave, it says broke the Japanese code.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.180
 So he might have been part of the team

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.700
 working on the Japanese equivalent of the enigma code.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:56.540
 - Cool.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.380
 - Which is amazing.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:58.220
 But there's not much information.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.500
 Anyway, Christian, thank you so much.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.580
 What a stunning--

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.420
 - Yeah, incredible.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.260
 - What a fact.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.100
 - Incredible.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.280
 - That's good.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.400
 Ben writes about Hannah Fry's cabbie.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.240
 - Oh yeah?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.060
 - Oh yeah.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.360
 - So this was, Hannah came on the show

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.160
 and she has a personal cabbie who she uses

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.080
 and he can find any place in London

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.880
 from just a photograph.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.240
 He knows exactly where you are.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.080
 - Yeah.

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.160
 - Well, Ben writes, Hannah Fry's cabbie.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.200
 You do know that location data is included

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.000
 in the background of the most photos taken on a phone.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.200
 He might be clever or he might be devious.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.340
 (laughing)

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.160
 - Best wishes, Ben.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.840
 (laughing)

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.980
 - That would be devious if that was true.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.760
 (laughing)

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.600
 - Is that true?

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.940
 You can just, any photo I sent to you,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.400
 you can get the location data from my photo.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.660
 - I'm not sure I would have the skills to do it,

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.860
 but I think there would be metadata in there.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.700
 - Yeah.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.780
 - But not if I post on Twitter or something, right?

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.340
 - I don't, I think normally if you post it on Twitter,

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.180
 you're just posting the image.

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.200
 But I'm just looking at an image I took on my phone now

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.740
 and trying to get to the metadata.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.160
 - Oh no, I haven't added a location,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.640
 but it's got all the other data about how the photo was taken.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.800
 It's a photo of my car ownership certificate.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.120
 (laughing)

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.400
 - Oh, you own a car, doing all right for yourself?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.760
 (laughing)

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.880
 - I said I own a certificate, James.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720
 Not a car.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.200
 (laughing)

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.400
 I'm saving up for the car.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.240
 - Yeah?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.480
 (laughing)

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.280
 - I nearly gave away a personal fact about myself.

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.040
 (laughing)

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:28.880
 Okay, here's another one.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.760
 This is a really great one.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.000
 It's kind of based on the music,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.220
 'cause we were talking a lot about Dan's thing of music

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.560
 and people--

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.400
 - The suit players.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.460
 - The suit is, this is moving the conversation on a lot,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.820
 so it's a new field.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.000
 It's from Phil Boyd, who says,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.840
 "Leland Sklar, who is probably the most recorded

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.280
 "bass player ever due to his work with Phil Collins,

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.180
 "Toto, James Taylor, and many, many more.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.420
 "He's played on thousands of albums, apparently.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.100
 "He had a special switch placed on one of his bass guitars

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.280
 "that he regularly uses in the studio.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.840
 "The switch isn't connected to anything,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.980
 "and switching it does nothing at all,

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.720
 "except trick record producers who ask him

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.000
 "if he could change his tone to make it more muddy

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:06.840
 "or bright or whatever."

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.180
 - Brilliant, brilliant.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.180
 - So when a producer asks him,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.560
 he's flicks the producer switch

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.440
 and plays exactly the same as before.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.280
 (laughing)

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.760
 And then they say how much better it is than before.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.580
 - That's incredible.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.520
 - Yeah.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.920
 I'm really fascinated by--

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.440
 - When you get tricked by something,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.880
 but you're at a high end of your profession, right?

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.720
 Like you--

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.760
 - Like a wine expert who gets fooled by a--

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.000
 - Exactly.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.200
 - A really cheap bottle of wine,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.040
 and thinks it's great.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.200
 - Yeah, if you're, we were in the pub the other day

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.520
 with my friend, who's, I would say, a very clever person,

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.720
 and he had a beer downstairs, went upstairs,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.840
 and he said the beer was flat.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.840
 So they came over with two glasses of the same beer,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.000
 and what he didn't know was one was for me,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.840
 and one was for him.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.200
 He thought they were two different samples

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.200
 from upstairs and downstairs,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.240
 and he said, "Yes, you can clearly taste that

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.200
 "the one on the right is different to the one on the left,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.200
 "even though it was the exact same."

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.800
 And I just, I find that fascinating

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.400
 that our brains can, weirdly, he's a brain surgeon,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.640
 so you should know what his brain's doing.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.320
 But they play those tricks on us.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.400
 It's fascinating. - Yeah, that's really clever.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.440
 - Okay, here's another one.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.320
 It's from William Lay.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320
 Hi, everyone.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.160
 - Hi, William.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.000
 - Hello, William.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.440
 - Do you like bricks?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.280
 - Love 'em.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.480
 (laughing)

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.880
 - I don't really have an opinion on them.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.720
 - Do you like bricks so much you start a website

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.000
 dedicated to cataloging them,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.360
 but only if they have a word or name stamped into them?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.120
 - No. - Well, Dave Salary does.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.560
 It's a genuinely really interesting website

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.680
 to have a poke around, stumbled across it

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.680
 in the comments of Reddit thread,

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.520
 and immediately thought,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.640
 "This has Andrew Hunter Murray written all over it."

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.640
 (laughing)

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.480
 - What, one of the bricks has Andrew Hunter Murray

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.280
 written all over it?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.320
 - And, you know, I went to the website, Old Bricks,

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.760
 and it's bloody good.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.760
 - Okay, so the one you've just shown us says 007 on it.

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:45.200
 - I know.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.600
 It's nothing to do with James Bond.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.320
 It's possibly a refractory brick batch number.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.960
 Anyway, it's brocross.com/bricks.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.360
 - Okay, are we doing a new thing

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.480
 where people can send us interesting websites

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.080
 about really dull subjects now?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.800
 - And then you just look at it while we stare at you?

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.440
 (laughing)

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.560
 - I'm sorry for trying to advance the form

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.400
 of Drop As A Light.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.080
 I'm sorry for daring to innovate, you know?

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.840
 - Which part of the tortured food metaphor is this?

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.680
 'Cause it feels like--

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.520
 - It's a lull.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.200
 It's a lull. (laughing)

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.960
 The mains have taken quite a long time to come now, actually.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.600
 - Can I, sorry, can we get some more bread

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.120
 stuck to there while we're waiting?

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.800
 (laughing)

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:25.640
 - Okay, okay.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.480
 - Oh, just on food, actually.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.320
 I got sent a thing.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.000
 I annoyingly haven't written down the name of the person,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.400
 so I'm really sorry, but you'll know who you are.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.240
 She said, "I was telling my mum about tender stem broccoli

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.680
 "and how it was created by a Japanese company.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.360
 "I told her the next time she sees some

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:43.560
 "to look for a little copyright icon,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.840
 "she went to a fridge, pulled out a pack of tender stem

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.400
 "broccoli instead, looking for the symbol on the broccoli."

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.160
 (laughing)

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.000
 - Oh, that's so funny.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.240
 - Yeah, that's so good.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.240
 Here is a very cool thing.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.200
 So you know, this is the thing that's been going

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.880
 in droppers of line since February.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.480
 So it's quite an advanced conversation now,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:03.840
 but it's about the longest day?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.680
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.520
 - Okay.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.400
 - Okay, so yeah, we've said, someone sent in saying

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.400
 that when the clocks go back or forward,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.480
 that's the longest day,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.040
 and various pedants are giving different answers.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.880
 Is that right?

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.800
 - That's exactly right.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.520
 So Mark Jacobs writes,

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.200
 he's got a new variant of the theory, I love this.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.360
 - Great.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.760
 - I meant to send you this fact a few years ago,

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.680
 found it during, he was gonna be on a Radio 4 program

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.120
 about leap years.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.480
 The fact didn't make it onto that show,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.920
 and I fully expect it to meet the same fate here.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.680
 (laughing)

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.800
 - I'm excited.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.000
 - Can I just say, if you've ever meant to be

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.720
 on a radio show, and you had some amazing facts

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.280
 for that show, and they weren't good enough

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.920
 for that show, do send them on, please.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.760
 - Please do.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.560
 Okay, this is the fact.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.840
 The fact is that the claim for being historically

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.360
 the longest day of the year,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.840
 could be said to be held by the 24th of February,

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.440
 which every four years used to be 48 hours long.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.280
 - Okay.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.720
 - Because it was the original leap day

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.520
 in the Roman calendar.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.560
 It was the bisect style day.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.080
 So instead of there being a 29th of February,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.920
 you would do, February was still 28 days long,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.040
 but you'd have a really long 24th of February.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.880
 You'd have two 24s.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.860
 - Two 24s, yeah.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:19.000
 - That's ironic, isn't it?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.720
 Because if the TV show 24 was based on that day,

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.160
 they would have to have 48 episodes.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.520
 - That's true.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.560
 - Jack Bauer is, sorry, a Roman senator in this?

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.400
 - Yeah, okay.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.840
 - A very exhausted one by the end.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.680
 (laughing)

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.200
 - Yeah, and apparently this was used in Britain

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.680
 well into the 18th century.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.520
 - That's truly interesting.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.480
 - Probably the second 24th of February,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.880
 and it was officially replaced

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.960
 by an act of parliament in 1750.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.800
 - That's great, okay.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.640
 - Yeah.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.480
 - That's the longest day.

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.320
 - Thank you, Mark.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.160
 - Until next week's episode.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.980
 - Longest day, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:48.820
 - Definitely.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.540
 - Who can beat it?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:51.860
 - Well, Charlie Thompson just points

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.940
 a little bit of clarification.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.940
 Based on the trivia question about the longest day,

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:58.860
 I had a light bulb moment that I think was caused

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:02.100
 by listening to the show for too long, not possible.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.980
 Someone born at 1.59 AM on October the 29th of 2023

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.020
 would be younger than someone born at 1.01 AM on that day.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:10.860
 - Okay.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:11.700
 - That's cool.

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:12.520
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.360
 - Oh, I see.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.020
 - Quirk there?

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:15.860
 - Yeah.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.700
 - Quirk of time?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.480
 - Yeah, that's really that interesting in most cases.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.340
 But let's say it was Royal Twins.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.680
 - Oh!

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.040
 - That could be really interesting, couldn't it?

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.240
 - Yes, that's really good.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.800
 - You think you've won, and then, yeah.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.160
 - Yeah, well, like when you both turn 18 and then someone

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.500
 dies and you become the new king or queen,

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.440
 you look at your birth certificate.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:41.280
 One of them looks younger, but it's not actually,

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.760
 it's basically a new game of thrones, I think.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.600
 - That's brilliant.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.840
 - Just from that one fact we could extrapolate

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.140
 an entire universe.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.620
 - That is the best possible plot implication of that fact,

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.460
 I think.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.300
 - Yeah.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.420
 - Nice, genuinely, I really strongly mean that.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.300
 Just to briefly circle back to, like, spicy meat.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.700
 - Yeah, let's get back to the spicy meat.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:02.140
 - Connor Wagstaff writes, "Despite listening for so long,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.020
 "I had never seen the faces behind the voices

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.380
 "until browsing your website the other day."

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.180
 Those such things as fish.com.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.340
 I was really surprised.

00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:10.780
 I hope this doesn't sound rude.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.620
 - I'm sure it will.

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.460
 - It will.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:17.460
 Let's see how Andrew and James look, because, can you guess?

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.960
 - He thought we were both women.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.200
 (laughing)

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200
 - No, this is something we've had before.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.080
 - Yeah, people often mistake my voice for your voice

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.440
 or my face for your face.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.800
 - Your face and voice, should we swap?

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.640
 - That's it.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.040
 Apparently your face suits my voice better and vice versa.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.320
 - Yeah, Andrew looks as my mental image of James was

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.240
 and vice versa.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.760
 I wonder if this is something you've heard before

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.340
 or whether I'm just being exceedingly strange

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.120
 by thinking about it and then also emailing.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.040
 Not at all.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.480
 That's the main bit of feedback we get

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.120
 when people see us after listening.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.240
 - The thing is, I am from the north of England.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:58.460
 Andy, I don't think that you look like a northerner.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.180
 You don't look like someone who's come

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.300
 from the backwaters of Bolton.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.920
 So I don't know why people think that.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.560
 I think it might be that you have a deeper voice

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.180
 and I'm older.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.320
 - Maybe that's it.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.160
 Maybe that's it.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.000
 - Could be.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.840
 - Yeah.

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.440
 You're saying that my pocket square,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.760
 my triple breasted suit.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.880
 - All I'm saying is, do you remember when we talked

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.120
 about there was a group of people who did a survey

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.800
 of pubs in the north and they couldn't find

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.880
 any northerners to do it.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.560
 So they got a load of posh southerners

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.360
 to pretend to be northerners.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.120
 I'm saying you couldn't pull that off.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.360
 - I think you're right.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.280
 I think I wouldn't get down my first half

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.720
 of Shandy.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.540
 - I often see, there's a thing of, a lot of people say,

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:48.160
 oh, it's really nice having the four different

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.620
 distinctive voices we can tell who's talking.

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.980
 But I do often see that you and I,

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:57.420
 some people go, I can't tell between Dan and Andy.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.260
 - Really?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.140
 - Yeah, which feels really unfair on you.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:00.980
 Because that means--

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.940
 - It's not unfair, you've got a nice voice.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.900
 - Well no, it's the shit coming out of it.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:04.900
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.300
 You can be labeled with some of these inaccurate facts.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:10.140
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.720
 The posh people coming to the north,

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.400
 I don't think I've told this story before.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.880
 So Anna came, we did a show in Manchester.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.120
 And Anna stayed with my sister.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.800
 And so we had to drive from Bolton to Manchester.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.000
 And I drove, I can't remember why I was driving,

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.560
 but I was driving down.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.200
 And she was in the passenger seat.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.120
 And I was giving her the tour of Bolton.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.120
 So I was like, and on your right, you can see B&Q.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.800
 And on the left, you can see the old

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.880
 Bolton Wanderers Stadium and whatever.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.900
 And I drove down, I said, and on the left here,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.740
 it's the tip.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.780
 And Anna's like, oh, the tip.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.620
 That's interesting.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.140
 I didn't know Bolton was famous for that.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.460
 I'm like, what?

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.420
 I like the tip, you know, like where you throw away

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.140
 your old dishwashers and stuff.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.460
 And she went, oh, I thought it was like another name

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.980
 for a castle or something.

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.900
 - Is that a name for it?

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.780
 - I don't think so, but she thought that the Bolton tip

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.020
 might have been some kind of old, you know--

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.760
 - Yeah, the tip that's all this point.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.840
 - But it presumably looks like a tip.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.000
 - It was, you couldn't really see the tip itself.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
 You could see the gates.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.040
 - That's someone recently thrown away a castle.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.560
 (laughing)

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.720
 That would be confusing.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.760
 - Wow, yeah.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.880
 Here's a bit of interesting, really interesting

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.920
 bonus info from Louise who writes to say,

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.960
 "Howdy, that's not the interesting bit.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.440
 "I thought you'd like to know where the Natural History

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.380
 "museum storage warehouse is."

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.140
 - Oh, so this is the warehouse that has all the whale bones,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.880
 which is a secret, and Philip Piperi was particularly

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.500
 put out by the fact that we wouldn't know where it was.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.420
 - Yeah, so Louise writes, "Unless they have others

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.180
 "that aren't listed," which I guess is possible,

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.980
 "is this one in Wandsworth."

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.980
 (laughing)

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.580
 And she attaches a link, and it's on governmentbuildings.co.uk.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.900
 I used to live just by it, but there's nothing to give away

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.300
 the secrets inside.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:06.280
 - How big are the doors?

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.000
 'Cause they had noted big doors, didn't they?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.120
 - It's just a map, sadly.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.640
 It doesn't have the--

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.000
 - Could we get on Google Street View

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.480
 and see how big the doors are?

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.040
 - Oh yeah, we probably could.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.200
 Yeah, let me do that now.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.920
 - More from staring at Andy as he looks at websites.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.520
 - And I've just clicked on the bit

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.720
 that's marked on the field, and it's an empty field.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.360
 (laughing)

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.040
 It's an invisible warehouse.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.880
 - You know, if you ever go on Google Maps

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.480
 and you search for certain areas of America,

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.700
 it's all pixelated, and they don't let you see.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.260
 And Google are kind of in on it,

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.180
 and they will pixelate things

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.100
 that governments don't want you to see.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.780
 Do you think that Google Street View

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.700
 has put an image of an empty field here

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.140
 because it doesn't want people to know

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.980
 where the whale bones are?

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:50.820
 - Almost certainly.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.100
 And actually, looking at the outline of this field now,

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.900
 it's in the shape of a whale.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.380
 (laughing)

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.300
 - Well, it could be an underground warehouse.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.140
 - It could be.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.860
 - We could have been looking at the ceiling there, basically,

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.700
 the rooftop.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.540
 - What a good point.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:03.360
 - Yeah.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.200
 - Okay, thank you, Louise,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.800
 for that potentially criminally compromising

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.760
 bit of information.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.960
 She says, she adds, "If the whale bones get stolen,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.760
 don't blame me."

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.300
 Don't see who else will be responsible.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.060
 (laughing)

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.400
 (laughing)

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.240
 That's almost all.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.080
 That's almost all for this time.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.200
 We've got one last message from Toby Bird.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.440
 So I guess this is the after dinner mint.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.280
 - Okay.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.400
 - We skipped a few courses.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.240
 (laughing)

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.080
 - Which was--

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.400
 - I was still waiting for the make up.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.880
 (laughing)

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:32.720
 - Sorry.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.920
 Sorry.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.520
 Not at the drop of the line restaurant.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.160
 (laughing)

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.840
 That's all starters, soulmates, after dinner mints.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.480
 (laughing)

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.320
 - Wow, yeah.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.800
 Okay, well, this is from Toby Bird.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.440
 Hello, nice to think of the fish.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.240
 On the most recent podcast,

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.040
 Andy mentioned bimetallic strips.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.880
 - Oh, yeah.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.720
 Really cool.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.560
 Kettles, right?

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.320
 - And kettles, which work because the two metals

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.400
 expand at different rates

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.760
 when the water temperature increases.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.600
 - Yeah.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.200
 - And that's how kettles turn themselves off.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.360
 - Really, I can't believe anyone listening

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.320
 didn't already know that, I have to say.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.160
 - Really?

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.680
 - I do think that bimetallic strips

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.840
 are quite a well-known thing.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.160
 - You're a man of science, though.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.000
 - I guess so.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.920
 - And you did physics, didn't you, at uni.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.120
 So you know, I mean, you're--

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.960
 - Okay, maybe.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.680
 - You worked on that kettle shop for years as well.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.640
 (laughing)

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.120
 - Just putting two bits of metal together.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.320
 That was my whole job.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.160
 - Yeah.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.080
 - It's an incredibly unsexy dance, isn't it?

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.320
 The bimetallic strip.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.580
 (laughing)

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.460
 (laughing)

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.380
 Well, Toby writes, "I thought you would find it interesting,"

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.180
 and I don't think he's writing to James here, clearly,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.220
 "that there are some materials that shrink

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.300
 when you heat them up."

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.140
 - Okay.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:40.980
 - Oh, that is interesting.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:41.820
 - Yeah.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.660
 - Yeah.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:43.500
 - Thanks to physics.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.340
 - Thanks to physics.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.180
 (laughing)

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.420
 - Well, now he's explained that.

00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.260
 Let's move on.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.060
 I think that's the end of the show, is it?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.380
 - No, it's a slightly complicated explanation,

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.100
 which I would not do justice to,

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:57.460
 but just take it from Toby Bird and from us,

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:58.860
 that you get some materials that shrink

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.780
 when you heat them up and enjoy that.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:01.780
 - That's physics.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:02.860
 - That's physics.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:03.700
 (laughing)

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.020
 And there's the slogan of this week's episode

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.020
 of "Drop Us a Line."

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.860
 Bye.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.440
 (upbeat music)

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.780
 Okay, and that's it.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.860
 On that bombshell about bimetallic strips,

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:16.700
 we're gonna end it.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.380
 Thank you so much for all of your correspondence.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.860
 It genuinely, it makes us laugh.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:20.940
 It makes us think.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.100
 It sometimes makes us cry.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.340
 So please do send us more of it.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.500
 Podcast at qi.com.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.540
 If you want to send us anything, please do.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.540
 And we'll be back in a month with another one of these.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.060
 And in a couple of weeks with...

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.340
 - Something new.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.700
 - Alternate format.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.940
 (laughing)

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.660
 Bye.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.240
 (upbeat music)

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.820
 (upbeat music)

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.400
 (upbeat music)

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.980
 (upbeat music)

00:26:51.980 --> 00:27:01.980
