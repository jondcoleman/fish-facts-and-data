1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,920
 Okay everybody, secret message alert.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,200
 This is Andy speaking.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,060
 This is a secret message only for clubfish members.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,160
 If you're listening to this

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,760
 and you're not a clubfish member, turn off your ears.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,840
 Stop listening right now.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,360
 This is extremely hush hush knowledge

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,680
 that we're about to tell you.

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,060
 The fact is, when you signed up to clubfish,

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,040
 we told you we'd give you a bit of advance warning

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,000
 of live shows.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,080
 Guess what?

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,320
 That's what I'm doing now.

15
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,000
 We are doing some live, no such thing as a fish shows

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,880
 in London, in Swing in London at the Soho Theatre.

17
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,040
 We're gonna be there from the 17th of July

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,620
 to the 21st of August.

19
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,180
 If you can't make either of those two dates,

20
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,800
 there are all sorts of dates in the middle.

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,480
 We're doing 11 shows at the Soho Theatre this summer.

22
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,960
 Sometimes we're doing two in a night.

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,240
 It's gonna be insane.

24
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,120
 There are gonna be special guests every single show.

25
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,500
 It's gonna be off the hook.

26
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,960
 And if you, with your clubfish membership gold card,

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,760
 want to turn up at these shows,

28
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
 all you need to do to get tickets

29
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,160
 in advance of everyone else is go to

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,200
 nosuchthingasafish.com/soho.

31
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,920
 That'll take you to the theatre website.

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,480
 You just need to register with the theatre.

33
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,080
 And if you're asked for a password to get onto the page,

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,880
 the password is yeti, all capitals, Y-E-T-I.

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,320
 The password is yeti.

36
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,160
 Good luck.

37
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,160
 See you there.

38
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,960
 We're counting on you.

39
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,400
 This message will end in a few seconds.

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,240
 Thank you.

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,160
 Let's get started on with the drop as a line.

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,880
 Hi.

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,200
 No, I did it wrong.

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,360
 (laughing)

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,540
 (phone ringing)

46
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,120
 (upbeat music)

47
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,360
 Hi.

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,200
 - Oh, that was much better.

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,040
 - Yeah, that was it.

50
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,880
 - That's the Andy Wing.

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
 - Hi, everybody.

52
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,600
 Welcome to drop as a line.

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,360
 This is the bit of clubfish where we talk about your emails

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
 and the things you've sent in,

55
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,040
 which agree with what we've said

56
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,360
 or maybe disagree with it

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
 or maybe just offer your own perspectives.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,880
 It's a two way street podcasting.

59
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,840
 - No, very much a one way street normally.

60
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,500
 - It's, what it's like, it's like a highway,

61
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,840
 but we have recently opened a small service channel

62
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,920
 running back the other way.

63
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,320
 - We're driving the wrong way down a highway.

64
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,200
 - Yeah, and so let's read the messages

65
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,640
 that are in your cars.

66
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,480
 - It's getting good.

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,200
 - I quite like this torture.

68
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,120
 I think starting every show with a tortured metaphor.

69
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
 - How have I done that before?

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,120
 - No, but I like it.

71
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,160
 - Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, all right.

72
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,200
 Well, let's strap in, do opposite belts and set off.

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,280
 - Strap in and do opposite belts.

74
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,400
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

75
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,240
 - Cool.

76
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
 - Here's a good one.

77
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,640
 Okay, here's a nice procedural question.

78
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
 - Okay.

79
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
 - This is from Pete from Bolton, right?

80
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,960
 - Oh, great.

81
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,120
 - Pete says, just a quick one that's all,

82
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,880
 oh, he says hello specifically to you, James,

83
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
 'cause you're from Bolton as well.

84
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,560
 - Hi, Pete.

85
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,680
 - And then he asks also which bit of Bolton you're from.

86
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,040
 - I was brought up in Black Rod,

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,240
 which is just outside Bolton.

88
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,960
 And then I grew up in Ladybridge.

89
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,360
 And then I moved to Morris Green.

90
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
 And then I moved out of Bolton.

91
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,000
 - Is Black Rod anything to do with the Queens?

92
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,720
 - Yeah, you know what, it is to do with it

93
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,600
 in the fact that it has the same name.

94
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
 - Yeah.

95
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,280
 - Other than that, nothing to do with it.

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,120
 - Do you know what?

97
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,960
 That's why I asked.

98
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
 (laughing)

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,960
 - Anyway, let's get on to the meat of Pete's message.

100
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,800
 - Pete's?

101
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
 (laughing)

102
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,040
 - To Pete's meat.

103
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,400
 Here we go.

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,360
 Just a quick one that's always confused me a little bit.

105
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,960
 And I was reminded of it on the latest podcast

106
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,960
 with Hannah Fry.

107
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
 "You know how you all inform each other

108
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,040
 "of your facts before the show has to be able to prepare.

109
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
 "When you act surprised or impressed by someone's fact,

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,560
 "is it A, you already know the fact,

111
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,760
 "but still act like it's novel

112
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,360
 "to make it sound like a good fact,

113
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,600
 "or B, you kind of know what the fact is about,

114
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,280
 "but you don't know the whole fact.

115
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
 "James is the biggest proprietor of the,

116
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,520
 "ah, is that right?

117
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,800
 "Interesting, or that's amazing."

118
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,960
 And I'm always left feeling like,

119
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
 wait, didn't you already know that?

120
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,800
 (laughing)

121
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,760
 If you only know kind of what the fact is gonna be,

122
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,920
 I'd love to see on what premise

123
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,720
 some of Dan's facts have been rejected.

124
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
 (laughing)

125
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
 - So okay, yeah, over to you.

126
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
 - Well, I don't think missing words

127
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
 would help us choose a fact

128
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,160
 because we do need to know what the subject is.

129
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,120
 So if you're missing the subject from it,

130
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,960
 that wouldn't work.

131
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
 The truth is it's a mixture, isn't it,

132
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,760
 of acting and delivery.

133
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,400
 When someone delivers their fact in a funny way,

134
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
 of course it makes you laugh, or--

135
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,280
 - I think it would be a problem with this podcast

136
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,960
 if every time someone said a fact

137
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,600
 that one of us already knew,

138
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,440
 we replied with, "Yes, I already knew that."

139
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,560
 So I think it's just normal conversation

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
 with your friends, right?

141
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,280
 If your friends sometimes tell you something

142
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
 and you already know some of it,

143
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 you still act slightly surprised

144
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,880
 'cause you want a conversation with them.

145
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,720
 - Definitely.

146
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,560
 - It's just normal.

147
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,400
 - And it's worth saying that

148
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,920
 that's the only thing we do know.

149
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
 When you're listening to the show,

150
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,360
 we don't share any of the other facts.

151
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,040
 There's no plan jokes or anything.

152
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
 It's all new.

153
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,600
 Just the headline is the only thing we go off.

154
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,440
 - That's true.

155
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,680
 All right, thanks to Pete.

156
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,120
 - And your meat.

157
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
 - Okay.

158
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
 (laughing)

159
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
 I quite like the procedural stuff.

160
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,000
 There's another procedural question.

161
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,120
 This is a spicy one.

162
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,040
 - Spicy meat.

163
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,000
 (laughing)

164
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,480
 - It's from Federico.

165
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,560
 - Has this got a name?

166
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,000
 'Cause you've named some of the other sections.

167
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,840
 - That's a good point.

168
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
 - Like get to the meat.

169
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,400
 Do you think we can call it that?

170
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,240
 - Meat cute.

171
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,160
 - I think meat cute, but wow.

172
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,600
 I think spicy meat.

173
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
 Spicy meat is the bit of the pod

174
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,920
 where we open up a pepper army

175
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,760
 and we see what's inside.

176
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,760
 Federico writes, "Hey guys,

177
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,520
 "over the many, many years I've been listening to fish,

178
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,520
 "never, not once has James hosted the show."

179
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
 - No, true.

180
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,200
 - I know this is the best kept secret,

181
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,520
 not only of the podcast,

182
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,120
 but the whole QI HQ Corporation,

183
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
 Inc. and Co. Global Entertainment giant.

184
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,000
 I'm genuinely curious about this.

185
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,760
 These are possible reasons I thought about.

186
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,400
 Here's where we get to the spicy meat.

187
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,800
 One, is it because he already has a senior position at QI?

188
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,280
 Thus he's paid more.

189
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,480
 Thus hosting the podcast would be overkill.

190
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
 (laughing)

191
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,000
 Number two, or is it because he hijacked the episode

192
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,560
 and turned it into a bottomless golf of golf quotes?

193
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,880
 (laughing)

194
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,560
 Three, or is it rather because he really can't be bothered

195
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,720
 and when Dan's not there,

196
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,440
 either Anna or Andy always rushed to volunteer.

197
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,360
 I'm sure I'm touching on something so sensitive

198
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,840
 that you might refuse to answer

199
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,440
 and that's why I'll be waiting for your response

200
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,600
 with trepidation.

201
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,560
 Best Federico.

202
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
 - Lovely question.

203
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,120
 - I don't really know why.

204
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,640
 Well, I always thought of it as, I just wasn't a host

205
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,080
 and Dan was a host

206
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,160
 and then I always think that Anna's the next best host.

207
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,000
 But,

208
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
 (laughing)

209
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
 - What, sorry?

210
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,960
 - And so whenever Dan's not here,

211
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,320
 I'm always like, Anna, why don't you host?

212
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,640
 And Anna's usually like, no, I'm the host, yeah.

213
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,680
 So yeah, I think I'm just far down.

214
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,400
 The pecking order really in hosts.

215
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,040
 I don't feel like I'm a host.

216
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,920
 I don't feel like I have that authority that Dan has.

217
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,400
 - You feel like I'm a third best host?

218
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,560
 - It's only 'cause you keep injecting

219
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,600
 those tortured metaphors right at the time.

220
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
 The editing time is intense.

221
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,520
 - It's the third best in a very, very high field.

222
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,560
 - It's on the podium, isn't it?

223
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,400
 - Yeah.

224
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
 - Yep.

225
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,000
 (laughing)

226
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,920
 - Yeah, no, I just don't really see myself

227
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,680
 as the host of this show, so.

228
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,320
 - I think as well it was sort of, to begin with,

229
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,320
 you were seen as the, I was gonna, I was gonna,

230
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,920
 this is the origins of it.

231
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,440
 - I was gonna host it.

232
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,600
 You were gonna be, as it were, the Alan Davis,

233
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,760
 but you were the clever one.

234
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,280
 So I was the idiot hosting, but you were the clever one.

235
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,560
 And so when, then when it became a four,

236
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,200
 that still was in our head that you were like,

237
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,280
 never the host, you were the guy who was always,

238
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,600
 you were the oracle, you were the--

239
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,040
 - I feel like more like the Richard Osman

240
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,280
 than the Alan Davis maybe.

241
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
 - That's a good point, yeah.

242
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,120
 - Kind of the person who just has the facts

243
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
 and brings them in.

244
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,680
 Then actually, of course, the actual show is

245
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,240
 we all end up having facts and stuff.

246
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,960
 But yeah, that was kind of the thought in my head

247
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,160
 when we first started out the show.

248
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,000
 - 'Cause I was never meant to have a fact.

249
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,480
 What a mistake to change it.

250
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
 What were we thinking?

251
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,120
 - Here's a bit of cross on something you said recently, Dan.

252
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,960
 - Oh yeah.

253
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,320
 - Seth Sibesma, I hope I'm pronouncing it right.

254
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
 I'm sorry if I'm not, Seth, says,

255
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,520
 I don't mean to alarm you, but in episode 127,

256
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
 Dan says that by the time the episode is launched

257
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,160
 into space, do you remember we were gonna do that?

258
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
 There's a sort of digital upload to the moon.

259
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
 And land on the moon in 2024,

260
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,400
 all of the podcast crew will be dead

261
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,640
 due to a horrible explosion in the QI office

262
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,300
 in 2023.

263
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,140
 - Oh.

264
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,980
 That's really interesting.

265
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,760
 - And you said this in about 2016.

266
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,880
 Please all be extra cautious this year

267
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,080
 and perhaps hire an inspector to ensure the integrity

268
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,480
 of gas lines and other potentially explosive elements

269
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
 of your new offices.

270
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,080
 - We have just moved into a new building

271
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
 and we weren't allowed to have a poo in the building

272
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,160
 because there were issues.

273
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,480
 I wonder if some sort of drainage explosion

274
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,000
 is on the carbon. - I think we're safe.

275
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,760
 Like because Anna's not coming into the office

276
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,600
 at the moment.

277
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
 - Yes.

278
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,640
 - So we're safe until Anna comes back.

279
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
 - Okay.

280
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,320
 - Oh, that's a point.

281
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
 So Margaret Daniel wrote on the same subject.

282
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,720
 She said, Dan quips in this episode

283
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,600
 that all the elves will disappear in 2023.

284
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,440
 Ironically, Anna has disappeared.

285
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,280
 - Oh yeah.

286
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,120
 - Then the rest of you disappeared

287
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
 from the original office.

288
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,720
 - Oh yeah, maybe that's what you meant.

289
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,760
 This is a bit of a Nostradamus thing, isn't it?

290
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,600
 - It is.

291
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,080
 - Nostradamus said something slightly vague

292
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,520
 and we're trying to shoehorn the facts into it.

293
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,360
 - Nostradamus, these are my shit predictions.

294
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,200
 - Nostradamus.

295
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,160
 Here's a great fact that we got sent.

296
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,220
 - We didn't go to the moon, by the way,

297
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,060
 just to add that.

298
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,280
 - Oh yeah, didn't that fall apart?

299
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
 - We did, yeah.

300
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,920
 So we did a, in one of our tour shows,

301
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,280
 that was my first half, I sort of mentioned the fact

302
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,680
 that we were meant to go to the moon

303
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,320
 and then our mission got canceled

304
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,160
 because the team that were funding it fell short.

305
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,500
 Just short by a hundred million dollars.

306
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,720
 (laughing)

307
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,200
 - It's like us giving them a tanner.

308
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
 It's so weird.

309
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,860
 - Yeah.

310
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,700
 - It's really weird.

311
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,760
 - So yeah, so we never made it to the moon.

312
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,680
 - No.

313
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,240
 Oh well.

314
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,160
 Here's a fact from Christian Ryder.

315
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,200
 This is a great one.

316
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,440
 Christian was looking at the surname Sizzers,

317
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,780
 which apparently comes from the Latin word for a tailor,

318
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,320
 and there was a small family of Russian Jews

319
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,380
 with that surname that fled the pogrom of Alexander II

320
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,160
 to America in the 1870s or '80s.

321
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,640
 And I got to thinking even more.

322
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,720
 And after a lot of searching and many hours wasted

323
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,800
 on findagrave.com, I found the ultimate.

324
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,240
 At the Jewish cemetery of Mount Sinai Memorial Park

325
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,600
 in the Hollywood Hills, there are three Jewish men

326
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,860
 who all lived at the same time in the area

327
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,520
 and may well have known each other.

328
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,360
 They were--

329
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
 - Oh no, I've got it.

330
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,040
 - Really?

331
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
 - Milton H. Rock.

332
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
 - Beautiful.

333
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,680
 - Harry W. Paper and Samuel Sizzers.

334
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,160
 - No, that's brilliant.

335
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,560
 That's so funny.

336
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,160
 What bit of the show are we in right now, by the way?

337
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,280
 Are we still in Spicy Meat?

338
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,680
 - No, no, we've moved on from the Spicy Meat course

339
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,880
 to an amusing sorbet in between.

340
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,720
 (laughing)

341
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,560
 - Amusing sorbet.

342
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
 - And it was boot, yeah, yeah.

343
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,960
 - And we've moved on to another tortured metaphor.

344
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,680
 - Yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,860
 - Wow, that's a brilliant fact.

346
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,700
 - Isn't that incredible?

347
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,540
 - That's incredible.

348
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,380
 - Yeah, amazing.

349
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,500
 - So good, and apparently he's tried to find out

350
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,340
 a bit more about them.

351
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,700
 On Rock's grave, Milton Rock--

352
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,740
 - Rock killed the Sizzers, Sizzers killed Paper.

353
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,140
 It's a triple homicide.

354
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,660
 - Rock might have been a spy.

355
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,140
 On Rock's grave, it says broke the Japanese code.

356
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,180
 So he might have been part of the team

357
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,700
 working on the Japanese equivalent of the enigma code.

358
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,540
 - Cool.

359
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,380
 - Which is amazing.

360
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,220
 But there's not much information.

361
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,500
 Anyway, Christian, thank you so much.

362
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,580
 What a stunning--

363
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,420
 - Yeah, incredible.

364
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,260
 - What a fact.

365
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,100
 - Incredible.

366
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,280
 - That's good.

367
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,400
 Ben writes about Hannah Fry's cabbie.

368
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,240
 - Oh yeah?

369
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,060
 - Oh yeah.

370
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,360
 - So this was, Hannah came on the show

371
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,160
 and she has a personal cabbie who she uses

372
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,080
 and he can find any place in London

373
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,880
 from just a photograph.

374
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,240
 He knows exactly where you are.

375
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
 - Yeah.

376
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,160
 - Well, Ben writes, Hannah Fry's cabbie.

377
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,200
 You do know that location data is included

378
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,000
 in the background of the most photos taken on a phone.

379
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,200
 He might be clever or he might be devious.

380
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,340
 (laughing)

381
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,160
 - Best wishes, Ben.

382
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,840
 (laughing)

383
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,980
 - That would be devious if that was true.

384
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,760
 (laughing)

385
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,600
 - Is that true?

386
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,940
 You can just, any photo I sent to you,

387
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,400
 you can get the location data from my photo.

388
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,660
 - I'm not sure I would have the skills to do it,

389
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,860
 but I think there would be metadata in there.

390
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,700
 - Yeah.

391
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,780
 - But not if I post on Twitter or something, right?

392
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,340
 - I don't, I think normally if you post it on Twitter,

393
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,180
 you're just posting the image.

394
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,200
 But I'm just looking at an image I took on my phone now

395
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,740
 and trying to get to the metadata.

396
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,160
 - Oh no, I haven't added a location,

397
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,640
 but it's got all the other data about how the photo was taken.

398
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,800
 It's a photo of my car ownership certificate.

399
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,120
 (laughing)

400
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,400
 - Oh, you own a car, doing all right for yourself?

401
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,760
 (laughing)

402
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,880
 - I said I own a certificate, James.

403
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
 Not a car.

404
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
 (laughing)

405
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,400
 I'm saving up for the car.

406
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,240
 - Yeah?

407
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,480
 (laughing)

408
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,280
 - I nearly gave away a personal fact about myself.

409
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,040
 (laughing)

410
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,880
 Okay, here's another one.

411
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,760
 This is a really great one.

412
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,000
 It's kind of based on the music,

413
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,220
 'cause we were talking a lot about Dan's thing of music

414
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,560
 and people--

415
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
 - The suit players.

416
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,460
 - The suit is, this is moving the conversation on a lot,

417
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,820
 so it's a new field.

418
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,000
 It's from Phil Boyd, who says,

419
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,840
 "Leland Sklar, who is probably the most recorded

420
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,280
 "bass player ever due to his work with Phil Collins,

421
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,180
 "Toto, James Taylor, and many, many more.

422
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,420
 "He's played on thousands of albums, apparently.

423
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,100
 "He had a special switch placed on one of his bass guitars

424
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,280
 "that he regularly uses in the studio.

425
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,840
 "The switch isn't connected to anything,

426
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,980
 "and switching it does nothing at all,

427
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,720
 "except trick record producers who ask him

428
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,000
 "if he could change his tone to make it more muddy

429
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,840
 "or bright or whatever."

430
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,180
 - Brilliant, brilliant.

431
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
 - So when a producer asks him,

432
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,560
 he's flicks the producer switch

433
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
 and plays exactly the same as before.

434
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,280
 (laughing)

435
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,760
 And then they say how much better it is than before.

436
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,580
 - That's incredible.

437
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,520
 - Yeah.

438
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,920
 I'm really fascinated by--

439
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
 - When you get tricked by something,

440
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,880
 but you're at a high end of your profession, right?

441
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,720
 Like you--

442
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,760
 - Like a wine expert who gets fooled by a--

443
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,000
 - Exactly.

444
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
 - A really cheap bottle of wine,

445
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,040
 and thinks it's great.

446
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,200
 - Yeah, if you're, we were in the pub the other day

447
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,520
 with my friend, who's, I would say, a very clever person,

448
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,720
 and he had a beer downstairs, went upstairs,

449
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,840
 and he said the beer was flat.

450
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,840
 So they came over with two glasses of the same beer,

451
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,000
 and what he didn't know was one was for me,

452
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,840
 and one was for him.

453
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,200
 He thought they were two different samples

454
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
 from upstairs and downstairs,

455
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,240
 and he said, "Yes, you can clearly taste that

456
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,200
 "the one on the right is different to the one on the left,

457
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
 "even though it was the exact same."

458
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,800
 And I just, I find that fascinating

459
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,400
 that our brains can, weirdly, he's a brain surgeon,

460
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,640
 so you should know what his brain's doing.

461
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,320
 But they play those tricks on us.

462
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,400
 It's fascinating. - Yeah, that's really clever.

463
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
 - Okay, here's another one.

464
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,320
 It's from William Lay.

465
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,320
 Hi, everyone.

466
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,160
 - Hi, William.

467
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,000
 - Hello, William.

468
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,440
 - Do you like bricks?

469
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
 - Love 'em.

470
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,480
 (laughing)

471
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,880
 - I don't really have an opinion on them.

472
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,720
 - Do you like bricks so much you start a website

473
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,000
 dedicated to cataloging them,

474
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,360
 but only if they have a word or name stamped into them?

475
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,120
 - No. - Well, Dave Salary does.

476
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
 It's a genuinely really interesting website

477
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,680
 to have a poke around, stumbled across it

478
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
 in the comments of Reddit thread,

479
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,520
 and immediately thought,

480
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,640
 "This has Andrew Hunter Murray written all over it."

481
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
 (laughing)

482
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,480
 - What, one of the bricks has Andrew Hunter Murray

483
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,280
 written all over it?

484
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,320
 - And, you know, I went to the website, Old Bricks,

485
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,760
 and it's bloody good.

486
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,760
 - Okay, so the one you've just shown us says 007 on it.

487
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,200
 - I know.

488
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,600
 It's nothing to do with James Bond.

489
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
 It's possibly a refractory brick batch number.

490
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,960
 Anyway, it's brocross.com/bricks.

491
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
 - Okay, are we doing a new thing

492
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,480
 where people can send us interesting websites

493
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,080
 about really dull subjects now?

494
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,800
 - And then you just look at it while we stare at you?

495
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,440
 (laughing)

496
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,560
 - I'm sorry for trying to advance the form

497
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,400
 of Drop As A Light.

498
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,080
 I'm sorry for daring to innovate, you know?

499
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,840
 - Which part of the tortured food metaphor is this?

500
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
 'Cause it feels like--

501
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,520
 - It's a lull.

502
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,200
 It's a lull. (laughing)

503
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,960
 The mains have taken quite a long time to come now, actually.

504
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,600
 - Can I, sorry, can we get some more bread

505
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,120
 stuck to there while we're waiting?

506
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,800
 (laughing)

507
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
 - Okay, okay.

508
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,480
 - Oh, just on food, actually.

509
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,320
 I got sent a thing.

510
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,000
 I annoyingly haven't written down the name of the person,

511
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,400
 so I'm really sorry, but you'll know who you are.

512
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,240
 She said, "I was telling my mum about tender stem broccoli

513
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,680
 "and how it was created by a Japanese company.

514
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,360
 "I told her the next time she sees some

515
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,560
 "to look for a little copyright icon,

516
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,840
 "she went to a fridge, pulled out a pack of tender stem

517
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,400
 "broccoli instead, looking for the symbol on the broccoli."

518
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,160
 (laughing)

519
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,000
 - Oh, that's so funny.

520
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,240
 - Yeah, that's so good.

521
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,240
 Here is a very cool thing.

522
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,200
 So you know, this is the thing that's been going

523
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,880
 in droppers of line since February.

524
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,480
 So it's quite an advanced conversation now,

525
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,840
 but it's about the longest day?

526
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,680
 - Yeah, yeah.

527
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,520
 - Okay.

528
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,400
 - Okay, so yeah, we've said, someone sent in saying

529
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
 that when the clocks go back or forward,

530
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
 that's the longest day,

531
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,040
 and various pedants are giving different answers.

532
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,880
 Is that right?

533
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,800
 - That's exactly right.

534
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,520
 So Mark Jacobs writes,

535
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,200
 he's got a new variant of the theory, I love this.

536
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,360
 - Great.

537
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,760
 - I meant to send you this fact a few years ago,

538
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,680
 found it during, he was gonna be on a Radio 4 program

539
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,120
 about leap years.

540
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,480
 The fact didn't make it onto that show,

541
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,920
 and I fully expect it to meet the same fate here.

542
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,680
 (laughing)

543
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,800
 - I'm excited.

544
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,000
 - Can I just say, if you've ever meant to be

545
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,720
 on a radio show, and you had some amazing facts

546
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,280
 for that show, and they weren't good enough

547
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,920
 for that show, do send them on, please.

548
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,760
 - Please do.

549
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,560
 Okay, this is the fact.

550
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
 The fact is that the claim for being historically

551
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,360
 the longest day of the year,

552
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,840
 could be said to be held by the 24th of February,

553
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,440
 which every four years used to be 48 hours long.

554
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,280
 - Okay.

555
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,720
 - Because it was the original leap day

556
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,520
 in the Roman calendar.

557
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,560
 It was the bisect style day.

558
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,080
 So instead of there being a 29th of February,

559
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,920
 you would do, February was still 28 days long,

560
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,040
 but you'd have a really long 24th of February.

561
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,880
 You'd have two 24s.

562
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,860
 - Two 24s, yeah.

563
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,000
 - That's ironic, isn't it?

564
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,720
 Because if the TV show 24 was based on that day,

565
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,160
 they would have to have 48 episodes.

566
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,520
 - That's true.

567
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,560
 - Jack Bauer is, sorry, a Roman senator in this?

568
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,400
 - Yeah, okay.

569
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,840
 - A very exhausted one by the end.

570
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,680
 (laughing)

571
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,200
 - Yeah, and apparently this was used in Britain

572
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,680
 well into the 18th century.

573
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,520
 - That's truly interesting.

574
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,480
 - Probably the second 24th of February,

575
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,880
 and it was officially replaced

576
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,960
 by an act of parliament in 1750.

577
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,800
 - That's great, okay.

578
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,640
 - Yeah.

579
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,480
 - That's the longest day.

580
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
 - Thank you, Mark.

581
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,160
 - Until next week's episode.

582
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,980
 - Longest day, yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
 - Definitely.

584
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,540
 - Who can beat it?

585
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,860
 - Well, Charlie Thompson just points

586
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,940
 a little bit of clarification.

587
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,940
 Based on the trivia question about the longest day,

588
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,860
 I had a light bulb moment that I think was caused

589
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,100
 by listening to the show for too long, not possible.

590
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,980
 Someone born at 1.59 AM on October the 29th of 2023

591
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:10,020
 would be younger than someone born at 1.01 AM on that day.

592
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,860
 - Okay.

593
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,700
 - That's cool.

594
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,520
 - Yeah, that's interesting.

595
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,360
 - Oh, I see.

596
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,180
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,020
 - Quirk there?

598
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,860
 - Yeah.

599
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:16,700
 - Quirk of time?

600
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,480
 - Yeah, that's really that interesting in most cases.

601
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,340
 But let's say it was Royal Twins.

602
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,680
 - Oh!

603
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,040
 - That could be really interesting, couldn't it?

604
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,240
 - Yes, that's really good.

605
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,800
 - You think you've won, and then, yeah.

606
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,160
 - Yeah, well, like when you both turn 18 and then someone

607
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,500
 dies and you become the new king or queen,

608
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,440
 you look at your birth certificate.

609
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,280
 One of them looks younger, but it's not actually,

610
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
 it's basically a new game of thrones, I think.

611
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,600
 - That's brilliant.

612
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,840
 - Just from that one fact we could extrapolate

613
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,140
 an entire universe.

614
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,620
 - That is the best possible plot implication of that fact,

615
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,460
 I think.

616
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,300
 - Yeah.

617
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,420
 - Nice, genuinely, I really strongly mean that.

618
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,300
 Just to briefly circle back to, like, spicy meat.

619
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,700
 - Yeah, let's get back to the spicy meat.

620
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,140
 - Connor Wagstaff writes, "Despite listening for so long,

621
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,020
 "I had never seen the faces behind the voices

622
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,380
 "until browsing your website the other day."

623
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,180
 Those such things as fish.com.

624
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,340
 I was really surprised.

625
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,780
 I hope this doesn't sound rude.

626
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,620
 - I'm sure it will.

627
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,460
 - It will.

628
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,460
 Let's see how Andrew and James look, because, can you guess?

629
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,960
 - He thought we were both women.

630
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,200
 (laughing)

631
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
 - No, this is something we've had before.

632
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,080
 - Yeah, people often mistake my voice for your voice

633
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,440
 or my face for your face.

634
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,800
 - Your face and voice, should we swap?

635
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,640
 - That's it.

636
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,040
 Apparently your face suits my voice better and vice versa.

637
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,320
 - Yeah, Andrew looks as my mental image of James was

638
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,240
 and vice versa.

639
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,760
 I wonder if this is something you've heard before

640
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,340
 or whether I'm just being exceedingly strange

641
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,120
 by thinking about it and then also emailing.

642
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,040
 Not at all.

643
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,480
 That's the main bit of feedback we get

644
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,120
 when people see us after listening.

645
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,240
 - The thing is, I am from the north of England.

646
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:58,460
 Andy, I don't think that you look like a northerner.

647
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,180
 You don't look like someone who's come

648
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,300
 from the backwaters of Bolton.

649
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,920
 So I don't know why people think that.

650
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,560
 I think it might be that you have a deeper voice

651
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,180
 and I'm older.

652
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,320
 - Maybe that's it.

653
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
 Maybe that's it.

654
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,000
 - Could be.

655
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:14,840
 - Yeah.

656
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,440
 You're saying that my pocket square,

657
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,760
 my triple breasted suit.

658
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,880
 - All I'm saying is, do you remember when we talked

659
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,120
 about there was a group of people who did a survey

660
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,800
 of pubs in the north and they couldn't find

661
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,880
 any northerners to do it.

662
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,560
 So they got a load of posh southerners

663
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,360
 to pretend to be northerners.

664
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,120
 I'm saying you couldn't pull that off.

665
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,360
 - I think you're right.

666
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,280
 I think I wouldn't get down my first half

667
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,720
 of Shandy.

668
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,540
 - I often see, there's a thing of, a lot of people say,

669
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,160
 oh, it's really nice having the four different

670
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,620
 distinctive voices we can tell who's talking.

671
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,980
 But I do often see that you and I,

672
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,420
 some people go, I can't tell between Dan and Andy.

673
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,260
 - Really?

674
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,140
 - Yeah, which feels really unfair on you.

675
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,980
 Because that means--

676
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,940
 - It's not unfair, you've got a nice voice.

677
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,900
 - Well no, it's the shit coming out of it.

678
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,900
 - Oh yeah.

679
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,740
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

680
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,300
 You can be labeled with some of these inaccurate facts.

681
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,140
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

682
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,720
 The posh people coming to the north,

683
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,400
 I don't think I've told this story before.

684
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,880
 So Anna came, we did a show in Manchester.

685
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,120
 And Anna stayed with my sister.

686
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,800
 And so we had to drive from Bolton to Manchester.

687
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,000
 And I drove, I can't remember why I was driving,

688
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,560
 but I was driving down.

689
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,200
 And she was in the passenger seat.

690
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,120
 And I was giving her the tour of Bolton.

691
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 So I was like, and on your right, you can see B&Q.

692
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,800
 And on the left, you can see the old

693
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,880
 Bolton Wanderers Stadium and whatever.

694
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,900
 And I drove down, I said, and on the left here,

695
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,740
 it's the tip.

696
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,780
 And Anna's like, oh, the tip.

697
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,620
 That's interesting.

698
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,140
 I didn't know Bolton was famous for that.

699
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,460
 I'm like, what?

700
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,420
 I like the tip, you know, like where you throw away

701
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,140
 your old dishwashers and stuff.

702
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,460
 And she went, oh, I thought it was like another name

703
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,980
 for a castle or something.

704
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,900
 - Is that a name for it?

705
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,780
 - I don't think so, but she thought that the Bolton tip

706
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,020
 might have been some kind of old, you know--

707
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,760
 - Yeah, the tip that's all this point.

708
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,840
 - But it presumably looks like a tip.

709
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,000
 - It was, you couldn't really see the tip itself.

710
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 You could see the gates.

711
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,040
 - That's someone recently thrown away a castle.

712
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,560
 (laughing)

713
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,720
 That would be confusing.

714
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,760
 - Wow, yeah.

715
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,880
 Here's a bit of interesting, really interesting

716
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,920
 bonus info from Louise who writes to say,

717
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,960
 "Howdy, that's not the interesting bit.

718
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,440
 "I thought you'd like to know where the Natural History

719
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,380
 "museum storage warehouse is."

720
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,140
 - Oh, so this is the warehouse that has all the whale bones,

721
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,880
 which is a secret, and Philip Piperi was particularly

722
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,500
 put out by the fact that we wouldn't know where it was.

723
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,420
 - Yeah, so Louise writes, "Unless they have others

724
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,180
 "that aren't listed," which I guess is possible,

725
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,980
 "is this one in Wandsworth."

726
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
 (laughing)

727
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,580
 And she attaches a link, and it's on governmentbuildings.co.uk.

728
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,900
 I used to live just by it, but there's nothing to give away

729
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,300
 the secrets inside.

730
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,280
 - How big are the doors?

731
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,000
 'Cause they had noted big doors, didn't they?

732
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,120
 - It's just a map, sadly.

733
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,640
 It doesn't have the--

734
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,000
 - Could we get on Google Street View

735
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,480
 and see how big the doors are?

736
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,040
 - Oh yeah, we probably could.

737
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,200
 Yeah, let me do that now.

738
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,920
 - More from staring at Andy as he looks at websites.

739
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,520
 - And I've just clicked on the bit

740
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,720
 that's marked on the field, and it's an empty field.

741
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,360
 (laughing)

742
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,040
 It's an invisible warehouse.

743
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,880
 - You know, if you ever go on Google Maps

744
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,480
 and you search for certain areas of America,

745
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,700
 it's all pixelated, and they don't let you see.

746
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,260
 And Google are kind of in on it,

747
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,180
 and they will pixelate things

748
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,100
 that governments don't want you to see.

749
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,780
 Do you think that Google Street View

750
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,700
 has put an image of an empty field here

751
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,140
 because it doesn't want people to know

752
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,980
 where the whale bones are?

753
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,820
 - Almost certainly.

754
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,100
 And actually, looking at the outline of this field now,

755
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,900
 it's in the shape of a whale.

756
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,380
 (laughing)

757
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,300
 - Well, it could be an underground warehouse.

758
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,140
 - It could be.

759
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,860
 - We could have been looking at the ceiling there, basically,

760
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,700
 the rooftop.

761
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,540
 - What a good point.

762
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,360
 - Yeah.

763
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,200
 - Okay, thank you, Louise,

764
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,800
 for that potentially criminally compromising

765
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,760
 bit of information.

766
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,960
 She says, she adds, "If the whale bones get stolen,

767
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,760
 don't blame me."

768
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,300
 Don't see who else will be responsible.

769
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,060
 (laughing)

770
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,400
 (laughing)

771
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,240
 That's almost all.

772
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,080
 That's almost all for this time.

773
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
 We've got one last message from Toby Bird.

774
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,440
 So I guess this is the after dinner mint.

775
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,280
 - Okay.

776
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,400
 - We skipped a few courses.

777
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,240
 (laughing)

778
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,080
 - Which was--

779
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
 - I was still waiting for the make up.

780
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,880
 (laughing)

781
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,720
 - Sorry.

782
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,920
 Sorry.

783
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,520
 Not at the drop of the line restaurant.

784
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,160
 (laughing)

785
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,840
 That's all starters, soulmates, after dinner mints.

786
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,480
 (laughing)

787
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,320
 - Wow, yeah.

788
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,800
 Okay, well, this is from Toby Bird.

789
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,440
 Hello, nice to think of the fish.

790
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,240
 On the most recent podcast,

791
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,040
 Andy mentioned bimetallic strips.

792
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,880
 - Oh, yeah.

793
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
 Really cool.

794
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,560
 Kettles, right?

795
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,320
 - And kettles, which work because the two metals

796
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,400
 expand at different rates

797
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,760
 when the water temperature increases.

798
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
 - Yeah.

799
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,200
 - And that's how kettles turn themselves off.

800
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,360
 - Really, I can't believe anyone listening

801
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,320
 didn't already know that, I have to say.

802
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,160
 - Really?

803
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
 - I do think that bimetallic strips

804
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,840
 are quite a well-known thing.

805
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,160
 - You're a man of science, though.

806
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,000
 - I guess so.

807
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,920
 - And you did physics, didn't you, at uni.

808
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,120
 So you know, I mean, you're--

809
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
 - Okay, maybe.

810
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,680
 - You worked on that kettle shop for years as well.

811
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,640
 (laughing)

812
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,120
 - Just putting two bits of metal together.

813
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
 That was my whole job.

814
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,160
 - Yeah.

815
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,080
 - It's an incredibly unsexy dance, isn't it?

816
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
 The bimetallic strip.

817
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,580
 (laughing)

818
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,460
 (laughing)

819
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,380
 Well, Toby writes, "I thought you would find it interesting,"

820
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,180
 and I don't think he's writing to James here, clearly,

821
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,220
 "that there are some materials that shrink

822
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,300
 when you heat them up."

823
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,140
 - Okay.

824
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,980
 - Oh, that is interesting.

825
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,820
 - Yeah.

826
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,660
 - Yeah.

827
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
 - Thanks to physics.

828
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,340
 - Thanks to physics.

829
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,180
 (laughing)

830
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,420
 - Well, now he's explained that.

831
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
 Let's move on.

832
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,060
 I think that's the end of the show, is it?

833
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,380
 - No, it's a slightly complicated explanation,

834
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,100
 which I would not do justice to,

835
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,460
 but just take it from Toby Bird and from us,

836
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,860
 that you get some materials that shrink

837
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,780
 when you heat them up and enjoy that.

838
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
 - That's physics.

839
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,860
 - That's physics.

840
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,700
 (laughing)

841
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,020
 And there's the slogan of this week's episode

842
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
 of "Drop Us a Line."

843
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,860
 Bye.

844
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,440
 (upbeat music)

845
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,780
 Okay, and that's it.

846
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,860
 On that bombshell about bimetallic strips,

847
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,700
 we're gonna end it.

848
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,380
 Thank you so much for all of your correspondence.

849
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,860
 It genuinely, it makes us laugh.

850
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,940
 It makes us think.

851
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,100
 It sometimes makes us cry.

852
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,340
 So please do send us more of it.

853
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,500
 Podcast at qi.com.

854
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,540
 If you want to send us anything, please do.

855
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,540
 And we'll be back in a month with another one of these.

856
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,060
 And in a couple of weeks with...

857
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,340
 - Something new.

858
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,700
 - Alternate format.

859
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,940
 (laughing)

860
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,660
 Bye.

861
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,240
 (upbeat music)

862
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,820
 (upbeat music)

863
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,400
 (upbeat music)

864
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,980
