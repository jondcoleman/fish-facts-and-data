1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,880
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,400
 This week, coming to you live

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,420
 from the London Podcast Festival.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,280
 (audience cheering)

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,320
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,640
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,080
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,040
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,140
 - My fact this week is that researchers have concluded

15
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,220
 that cats don't like cat people.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,640
 (audience laughing)

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,360
 I'm really sorry.

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,280
 - What a cat. - Scientifically speaking,

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,960
 the more you like cats, the less they like you.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,680
 - But I would say I have a cat,

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,280
 and I wouldn't say I'm a cat person.

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,480
 And my cat definitely doesn't like me.

23
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,680
 So could it be that cats just don't like any people?

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,440
 - Sometimes they're just good judges of character, James.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,760
 But this, it's actually not that.

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,160
 So this is a study that was done

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,880
 at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,120
 with a bunch of universities involved.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,280
 And it got 119 different people to interact

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,080
 with a cat in a room.

31
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,160
 And then it looked at various things

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,920
 about the people, like their personality type,

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,280
 they're kind of neurotic, are they agreeable people?

34
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,360
 You know, you fill in a questionnaire

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,000
 and say all that stuff about yourself.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,440
 And it asked them, have you ever owned a cat?

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,200
 How long have you owned a cat for?

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,560
 Do you like cats?

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,540
 Turns out the best predictor of how much a cat

40
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,480
 is gonna like you is the number of years

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,940
 that you've lived with a cat,

42
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,040
 but they're inversely proportional.

43
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,400
 (audience laughing)

44
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,160
 Yeah, the more, and people would like say,

45
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
 you know, I'm really good with cats.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,200
 It's the people who are self-professed cat knowers.

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,920
 - Well, the thing I was reading is that a lot of it

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,640
 is about cat people, people who like cats,

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,680
 cat people.

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,480
 - So, good clarification, sorry.

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,240
 - Just in case you all thought we were talking

52
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,760
 about half cats, half person.

53
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,800
 (audience laughing)

54
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,040
 - Really annoyingly, that's all my research.

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,560
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,840
 - Well, I think this was the study.

57
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,840
 It found that they touched the cats

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,880
 so-called red areas more when left alone with cats.

59
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,280
 Red areas are things like the, please,

60
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,120
 the-

61
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,680
 - We all went to that HR meeting, Andy, we know.

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,680
 (audience laughing)

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,280
 - The base of the tail, or the belly.

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,440
 Apparently, the hairs on the belly are really sensitive,

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
 and so a big old belly rub will,

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
 I'm sure the cats vary from cat cats, but-

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,840
 - They don't seem to, with the red areas.

68
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,360
 It's just the belly and base of the tail that are red,

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,600
 and they really seem to have crossed the board dislike.

70
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,080
 The rest of the cat is yellow area,

71
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
 like traffic lights.

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,760
 - There's no green area.

73
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,600
 - There's no green.

74
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,120
 - I thought green was under the chin.

75
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,200
 - You're absolutely right.

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,120
 - Yeah, I mean, I read it.

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
 I didn't-

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,320
 (audience laughing)

79
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,000
 Yeah, they love a little tickle under the chin, and-

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,120
 - And the cheeks, and the base of the ears.

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 - Yeah.

82
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,320
 - But yeah, that's basically it.

83
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,640
 The cat people are too tactile with cats,

84
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,480
 and also this study found that their interaction style,

85
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,480
 they want to control the interaction,

86
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,000
 whereas cats really dislike that.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,700
 So they prefer to be the ones who approach you.

88
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,280
 They only want to get touched.

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,680
 If, you know, they've initiated it,

90
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,520
 they've said, "All right, come on,

91
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,640
 you can touch me now."

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
 And this isn't what cat people do.

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,360
 And similarly, older people, cats tend to like them less

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,720
 'cause older people, sorry, but usually cat people.

95
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,440
 (audience laughing)

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,000
 It's the old cliche that, you know,

97
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,160
 it's always the person in the corner of the room

98
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,400
 who's ignoring the cat that it goes to.

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
 It turns out that it's true.

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
 - Yeah.

101
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,240
 There's been a recent study as well

102
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,280
 that says that they recognize their names, cats,

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,680
 but they're just, they don't want you to know

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,920
 that they recognize their names.

105
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,240
 (audience laughing)

106
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,320
 So this was people at Sophia University in Japan.

107
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,160
 And they played a load of noises,

108
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,280
 including the cat's name that was said by the owner.

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
 And then as soon as their name was called,

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,960
 they saw their tail move almost imperceptibly.

111
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,880
 They just very slightly moved.

112
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,200
 Some people think that that's because

113
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,160
 they recognize their name,

114
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,560
 but other people think, well,

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,960
 it's just something they kind of associate with food.

116
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,000
 So you might as well be shaking a box of cat food

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,840
 and do the same.

118
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,040
 - I feel like all of these cat studies

119
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,760
 are dancing around the fact that cats are dicks.

120
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,440
 None of the scientists want to say that cats are dicks

121
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,240
 because they know that if they say cats are dicks

122
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,760
 in the abstract of their paper,

123
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 then they'll get in trouble with cat people.

124
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,280
 So here's another one.

125
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,680
 Again, they didn't say cats are dicks,

126
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,560
 but I think we can all agree the implication.

127
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,920
 When you own a cat,

128
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,640
 it will not side with you against your enemies.

129
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,960
 Okay, that's bad.

130
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,400
 So there's this experiment.

131
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,520
 Basically, you get a cat and the cat observes its owner,

132
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,360
 struggling to open a container of something, right?

133
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
 And then the owner would request help

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,040
 from an actor, a stooge sitting there by,

135
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,120
 and either the actor did help or didn't, right?

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,400
 And then later on, that actor,

137
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,680
 whether unhelpful or not, offered the cats some food.

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
 The cats were completely agnostic

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
 about whether they took the food or not,

140
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,440
 whereas dogs would frequently refuse food

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,640
 from the person who'd been a dick to their owner.

142
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,160
 Cats were not like that.

143
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360
 Cats were totally neutral,

144
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
 but it is possible that they're too stupid

145
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,680
 to understand the play

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
 that they've been put on for their benefit.

147
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,440
 Wow, yeah.

148
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,160
 Speaking of dicks, this study...

149
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,360
 That is definitely a red area.

150
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
 So this study that I mentioned

151
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,520
 was done by a bunch of universities,

152
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
 the two Nottingham universities, in fact,

153
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,840
 and also the Royal Brackets Dick,

154
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,800
 Clothes Brackets School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh,

155
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,840
 and that's its name.

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,280
 The Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh.

157
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,840
 It is named after a person called Dick,

158
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,840
 so it's usually abbreviated to "The Dick Fett."

159
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,200
 So it sounds like it's a real specialty vet.

160
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,080
 And it was established...

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
 It was established in the 19th century

162
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,080
 by a vet called William Dick.

163
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
 And before you say anything, James,

164
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,440
 there's no evidence he ever shortened his name to Willie, OK?

165
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,000
 Willie Dick.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,360
 Never did he go by Willie Dick.

167
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,560
 Good. Very nice.

168
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,760
 Have you guys heard?

169
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,800
 This has blown my mind,

170
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,440
 and I can't believe it's not bigger news,

171
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,560
 but there's an app out now called Meow Talk.

172
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,920
 Have you heard of Meow Talk?

173
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,240
 Everyone listening, everyone here, everyone watching.

174
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,120
 If you have a cat, get Meow Talk.

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,720
 It's an app that translates what your cat is saying to you.

176
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,320
 And I swear to God, this was done with scientists,

177
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
 and if you read the reviews,

178
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
 it sounds like it's actually genuinely

179
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,000
 picking up what the cat is saying.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,760
 So this was a New York Times article

181
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,640
 that was written by Emily Antheys,

182
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,520
 and she was saying she tried it out.

183
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,680
 And there's basically what they break it down to

184
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,240
 is different sounds of the cat get matched to certain terms.

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,480
 So they can tell by the tone, the pitch, the length,

186
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,640
 and so on of the meow in order to say,

187
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,160
 roughly, they are saying this.

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
 So she first used it, and the cat meowed

189
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
 after, I think, eating something,

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,040
 and it translated as, "I'm happy."

191
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,680
 She was away from home, and she came home,

192
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,320
 and the cat purred as she got in.

193
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,200
 And her app said, the cat says, "Nice to see you."

194
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
 Like, oh, come on. Absolutely.

195
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
 This had so many reviews.

196
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,440
 I swear to God, this is a real thing

197
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
 where they think that that is happening.

198
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
 But then it's also got, like, weird little terms

199
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,280
 that it uses as well.

200
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,160
 So there was one time that she went to the cat,

201
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
 and the cat went, "Meow."

202
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,120
 Which translated as, "Just chilling."

203
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
 (audience laughing)

204
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,400
 This is not true.

205
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,920
 Okay, stick with me, guys.

206
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,120
 It's, so they've got, the other terms they've got is,

207
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,760
 there was another time that she came in,

208
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,600
 and the cat went, "Meow."

209
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,880
 Which went, "My love, I'm here."

210
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
 Which is the word that it used.

211
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,640
 - Is there another one where you kind of get at,

212
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,000
 and it goes, "You should upgrade your membership

213
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,160
 "to a premium account."

214
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 - If you read all the reviews of the app,

215
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,200
 that's unfortunately, they get a lot of one-stars,

216
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,600
 because the first meow leads to,

217
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
 "You need premium membership

218
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,800
 "to understand what your cat is saying."

219
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,280
 But the best one is, she lifted her cat off the ground once,

220
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,320
 and she was moving it somewhere,

221
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,720
 and the cat went, "Meow."

222
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
 And that translated on her phone as,

223
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,400
 "Hey, baby, let's go somewhere private."

224
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
 (audience laughing)

225
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,700
 But this is real.

226
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:12,080
 We can now talk to cats through meow talk.

227
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,200
 - I've never been more convinced

228
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
 you've been completely duped.

229
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,640
 And now it's saying something.

230
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,680
 Have you guys heard of Caden Griffin?

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
 - No, no. - So,

232
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,560
 he's relevant to this field of study.

233
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,960
 He is an American teenager, sixth grader.

234
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,280
 He, last year, he was in the sixth grade,

235
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,000
 which I think is about 12, 13 years old.

236
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
 And it's from Tennessee.

237
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,680
 And last year, he became curious

238
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,760
 about how often the objects in our home

239
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,920
 are touched by cats' bottoms, okay?

240
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,320
 If you own a cat, you might think,

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
 "Oh, is the cat rubbing itself on everything I own?"

242
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
 So, he, being a scientifically-minded child,

243
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,200
 ran an experiment by putting lipstick

244
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,240
 on his cat's bottom (audience laughing)

245
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
 then studying the home for where lipstick was popping up.

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,640
 What an amazing-- - And where did it end?

247
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,480
 Not his toothbrush. - It's not on his lips.

248
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
 (audience laughing)

249
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
 Just his toothbrush day after day.

250
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,600
 (audience laughing)

251
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,840
 It's really good news for owners of long-haired cats.

252
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,440
 There's basically no lipstick anywhere

253
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,720
 at the end of the trial period.

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 Short-haired cats, there's a little bit on soft furnishings,

255
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,640
 but, you know, in general, it's okay.

256
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,880
 - Okay, yeah.

257
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,120
 - Do you know that outdoor cats are banned in Housavi

258
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,200
 in Iceland, which is the town

259
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,560
 where they did the Eurovision movie?

260
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,640
 - Oh, cool. - I don't know if you remember that.

261
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
 - Beautiful. - And there's actually

262
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,680
 a few places, also a place called Acuriri,

263
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,960
 where they're just about to ban them,

264
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,560
 and they'll be banned in 2025.

265
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,040
 But to try and stop that, there was a guy

266
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,520
 called Snorri Admondson, and he started the cats party,

267
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,240
 and in the recent local elections,

268
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
 they got 4.1% of the votes.

269
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,760
 - That's not bad. - This is just

270
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
 cat people in Iceland.

271
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,440
 They beat the pirate party,

272
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,360
 who actually, a pirate party, quite big in Iceland.

273
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
 - Yeah, they were. - Yeah, they were.

274
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,120
 - Like a few years ago, they were, anyway.

275
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,680
 And a lot of the candidates for the cat party

276
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,120
 said that they were expressly running on behalf

277
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,560
 of their cats, because the cats were ineligible

278
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,360
 to vote or run for office.

279
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,480
 - Oh, hey.

280
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,320
 - I dread to think the kind of genuine bastards

281
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,040
 we'd have in charge if, actually,

282
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
 we voted on behalf of our cats.

283
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,240
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

284
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,280
 I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.

285
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,080
 I've got a quick story about someone who doesn't like cats,

286
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,160
 and that is Andrew Lloyd Webber, hang on.

287
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,280
 Who apparently was so annoyed and so angry

288
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,280
 with the recent movie Cats, that after seeing the movie,

289
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,800
 he went out and bought a dog.

290
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,600
 He was just, he was so angry, right?

291
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,080
 But then he fell in love with this dog,

292
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,560
 and it became a really great thing,

293
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,120
 and that he was traveling a lot overseas.

294
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
 So anytime he got on a plane,

295
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,200
 he tried to bring the dog with him,

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
 and the only way you can really do that

297
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,080
 is claim to be an emotional animal,

298
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,040
 like an emotional support animal, right?

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,880
 So that's what he did.

300
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,600
 So he said, "I rode off and said I needed him with me

301
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,800
 "at all times because I'm emotionally damaged,

302
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
 "and I must have this therapy dog."

303
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,960
 He said, "The airline rode back and said,

304
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
 "can you prove that you really need him?"

305
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,440
 He said, "Yes, just see what Hollywood did

306
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,680
 "to my musical cats."

307
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,480
 And a note came back saying, "No doctor's report required."

308
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 (audience laughing)

309
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,060
 (upbeat music)

310
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

311
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,320
 My fact this week is that if you take 50 generations

312
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,720
 of Confucius descendants and read out their names

313
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 from oldest to youngest, in it it will reveal a secret poem.

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,200
 - Ooh.

315
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,280
 - So this I find really interesting.

316
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,760
 This is the story of Confucius.

317
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,700
 Confucius basically has the Guinness World Record

318
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,680
 for the longest unbroken lineage.

319
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,480
 And I happened to make friends quite recently

320
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,880
 with the 79th generation descendant of Confucius.

321
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,360
 He's a guy who lives in London called James Kong.

322
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,200
 And the Guinness World Record has recognized

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,800
 that basically for thousands of years,

324
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,480
 the Confucius family have been charting their family tree

325
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,680
 so consistently, so tightly, that we know

326
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,520
 who everyone is inside the Confucius family.

327
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 And there's two million of them.

328
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,780
 So every 60 or 70 years or so,

329
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,800
 they update the big database of all the descendants.

330
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,480
 And in 2009, one book, which was broken up into 80 volumes,

331
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,720
 weighing over half a ton was published,

332
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,800
 having every single name of all of the descendants,

333
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
 both living and dead in there.

334
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,260
 And James Kong is almost the closest that we get

335
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,320
 to a direct descendant that's alive.

336
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,520
 Now the reason that their names would reveal a poem

337
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,560
 is there's a beautiful thing that they do in China.

338
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,400
 Certain families do this, which is a generational name.

339
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
 And a generational name means that all the families

340
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,440
 can know which generation a child is from

341
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,480
 by inserting a key word into their name.

342
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,160
 So what they do is they write a poem

343
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,640
 and the next generation just takes the next word

344
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,800
 in that poem.

345
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
 So you can look at that poem and you can go,

346
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,480
 "This is the 79, 78, 77, 76."

347
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,760
 So if you're out and about and you meet someone from China

348
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,560
 and you also name and you hear a key word,

349
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,560
 you can go, "Oh my God, it's a descendant of Confucius."

350
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,440
 - That's really cool. - Yeah, which is really awesome.

351
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,040
 - And do we-- - You know this poem?

352
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,880
 - Yeah.

353
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,640
 - Does the next generation have to make up the next line,

354
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,400
 like improv game or something?

355
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
 - No, yeah. - Like consequences.

356
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,960
 Confucian consequences. - Yeah, exactly.

357
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,000
 - So it's a word at a time.

358
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,720
 As far as I know, it loops back onto itself once

359
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,080
 because you're not gonna have 50 generations alive at once.

360
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
 So you're not gonna get confused.

361
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,640
 - You're not gonna get confused.

362
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,840
 - Yeah.

363
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,640
 - Yeah, isn't it?

364
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,280
 - It's a really good joke.

365
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,160
 (audience laughing)

366
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,560
 What's really nice is that back in the day,

367
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,400
 Confucius was a very prominent person in China

368
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,840
 and his descendants, therefore,

369
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,560
 were almost like a class of their own.

370
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,600
 So if you knew that someone was a descendant of Confucius,

371
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,140
 there would be things like tax breaks

372
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,040
 when they were buying houses or something like that.

373
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,840
 Yeah, and then it all went tits up

374
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,320
 when the Cultural Revolution happened

375
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,120
 because Confucius then became a sign

376
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,040
 of something that Mao Zedong and so on didn't want.

377
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
 So basically, they lost everything.

378
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,600
 The main bloodline of Confucius had to flee to Taiwan

379
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,040
 and it became hard times for all of them.

380
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,000
 But now it's better again and this one family

381
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,800
 handed the reins over to James's family.

382
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,640
 But when James goes back, he lives here.

383
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,320
 He's a very normal guy.

384
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,640
 In China, he goes back.

385
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,220
 It's like in coming to America

386
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,540
 when Eddie Murphy goes back to Zemuda.

387
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,220
 It's like everyone's bowing and kissing his feet.

388
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,540
 And yeah, he's a big deal back in China.

389
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,620
 But the thing is, if anyone has a grasp

390
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,140
 of how numbers work, there are shitloads more

391
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,020
 than three million descendants of Confucius out there, right?

392
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,580
 I mean, I think everyone in China

393
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,460
 is probably directly descended from Confucius.

394
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,100
 But if you go back, even,

395
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,420
 I think we'll descend it from Genghis Khan.

396
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,380
 So this is just people who have managed

397
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,220
 to get the paper trail to prove it.

398
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,680
 - Yeah, basically, yeah.

399
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,480
 Wait, am I descending from Genghis Khan?

400
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,920
 - I think you might.

401
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,600
 I mean, there's a little bit of gray areas

402
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,840
 'cause how much immigration happened.

403
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,200
 We don't really know, but yeah.

404
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,800
 - Your family never left Wimbledon

405
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,940
 for five million generations, did they?

406
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,080
 No.

407
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,840
 And Genghis Khan didn't make it to Wimbledon.

408
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
 - Imagine that.

409
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,140
 - We'd have been furious if he'd made it.

410
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,880
 The lawn, the lawn, darling.

411
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,140
 They've damaged the lawn.

412
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,640
 I'm gonna go and say something.

413
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,680
 I'm gonna go and say something.

414
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,520
 (laughing)

415
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,660
 - That's what thwarted him in the end.

416
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,060
 He couldn't handle the British passive-aggressive attitude.

417
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
 (laughing)

418
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,740
 - Can you imagine, though,

419
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,440
 Genghis Khan, if we have a crack time travel

420
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,280
 and the descendant to go back to meet him is Andy.

421
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,780
 (laughing)

422
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,620
 Hello, James.

423
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,220
 - I think he'll be quietly impressed.

424
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,060
 - Would he?

425
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,900
 - Yeah.

426
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,740
 - It's a warlord.

427
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,580
 - Yeah.

428
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,420
 - Yeah, I think he'll say,

429
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,360
 "I see, he's got soft skills, and that's important."

430
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,140
 (laughing)

431
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,740
 - Famously soft skills is something

432
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,060
 that Genghis Khan made.

433
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,380
 (laughing)

434
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,220
 - That's just not Confucius.

435
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,060
 - Yeah.

436
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,900
 - Confucius was,

437
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,460
 I didn't realize how unsuccessful he was in life.

438
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,300
 He was incredible.

439
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,140
 - Ouch.

440
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,360
 - He basically, he became important about 100 years later.

441
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,500
 During his life, he was not listened to at all.

442
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,860
 Nobody took up his ideas for a century at least.

443
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,400
 And he, I'm kind of not surprised.

444
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,220
 This main book is, I think it's called The Analect, is it?

445
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,600
 Yeah, and it's not by him, it's anecdotes about him.

446
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,080
 So it's like fun stories about Confucius.

447
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,300
 - And the Confucius says it's a kind of term

448
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,140
 that came out of it.

449
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,980
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

450
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,900
 But he didn't charge any of his pupils,

451
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,940
 or his students, and he was teaching philosophy.

452
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,420
 All he requested from them was a symbolic bundle

453
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,940
 of dried meat.

454
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,780
 - Oh.

455
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,620
 - But I can see why he's priced himself out of the market

456
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,180
 at the wrong end, basically.

457
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,540
 So I think you're not going to be respected

458
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,300
 if you say, "I want one pepper army,"

459
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,180
 and I will then tell you the secrets of the universe.

460
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,300
 - Exactly, you would probably go

461
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,100
 for the second cheapest option, wouldn't you?

462
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

463
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,880
 He had 3,000 students, and only 72 managed

464
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
 to pass master all of his teaching.

465
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,780
 So that's quite a high bar, isn't it?

466
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,620
 - Yeah, that's impressive.

467
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,880
 - But the Analects, there are two versions of the Analects.

468
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,660
 One's called the Lou version, and one's called the Chi version.

469
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,500
 And really exciting.

470
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,340
 - Is the Lou version, that's the easy reading,

471
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,500
 big, funny jokes in it?

472
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,180
 (laughing)

473
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,280
 - You've got five minutes, get the Lou version, yeah.

474
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,200
 - Well, the Chi version was long lost,

475
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,440
 but really excitingly in 2015, we found the copy

476
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,780
 in the tomb of Emperor Liu He, and he was one,

477
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,700
 he was like a really, not a great emperor.

478
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,180
 He was dethroned after 27 days,

479
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,060
 which is the shortest reign of any of the Han emperors.

480
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,100
 And the reason he was kicked out

481
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,500
 is because he was like debauchery, a terrible lifestyle.

482
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,620
 There was like a period of mourning,

483
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,580
 and during that time, he bought a special kind of chicken

484
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,340
 and had lots of sex.

485
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
 - With?

486
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,920
 - No, no, no, with concubines, with concubines.

487
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,300
 - It is better, it is better than chicken.

488
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,640
 - It's better than chicken, isn't it?

489
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,460
 - I do think so.

490
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,300
 - It is better than chicken.

491
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,220
 - And he's still thinking.

492
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,480
 (laughing)

493
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,680
 - Well, anyway, he was punished by being given

494
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,680
 a small fife of 2,000 families who would pay tribute to him.

495
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,400
 - Wait, he was punished by being given tribute?

496
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,960
 - Well, he was, and his subordinates were all executed.

497
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,160
 - Oh, bloody hell, yeah.

498
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,960
 - Why was that, sorry, 'cause that does sound nice to me.

499
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,340
 - He's going from being an emperor

500
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,140
 to just being in charge of a couple of thousand families.

501
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
 It's like, we're gonna take off

502
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,580
 the main responsibility for you.

503
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,420
 - I guess.

504
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
 - And then, it's like how if I was in charge of something

505
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,140
 and then you guys demoted me,

506
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,740
 so I was only in charge of holding Sharpies

507
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,660
 for after show signings.

508
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,460
 That would be, for example, just an example, just an example.

509
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,000
 - Do you remember that show a couple of shows go

510
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,380
 when we didn't have any Sharpies?

511
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,780
 - Got the Sharpies?

512
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,620
 Yeah, that was awful, I'm still sorry about that.

513
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,420
 - He's, just when I read his story,

514
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,100
 I thought that we're kind of parallels

515
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,000
 to Tutankhamun, because in the same way

516
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,160
 that Tutankhamun's grave was found, virtually intact,

517
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,160
 I know there was a grave robbing,

518
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,000
 but it was because he was kind of wiped

519
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,160
 from the records, wasn't he?

520
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,680
 He's sort of, no one knew to loot his.

521
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,840
 Kind of like this guy as well.

522
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,080
 His tomb, where they found this Confucius reference,

523
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,720
 was kind of untouched, because he was sort of

524
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,140
 wiped out from history as well, yeah.

525
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,980
 I think so, yeah.

526
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,040
 - So go to all the irrelevant people's tombs.

527
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,080
 Let's go to Tim Farron's tomb and see what's there.

528
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,680
 - He's still alive, I don't know, he was just.

529
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,860
 - But he might as well be dead.

530
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,520
 I think that's what you're saying.

531
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,680
 I don't even know who he is, who are we talking about?

532
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,100
 (audience laughing)

533
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,440
 Who is he?

534
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,280
 - Speaking of politics, as we were, Dan.

535
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,640
 - He's a politician, he's a politician.

536
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,480
 - You're gonna say you don't know

537
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,760
 who Joe Swinson is next?

538
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,680
 (audience laughing)

539
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,520
 - It's a politician.

540
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,560
 - They're all alive though, I feel bad.

541
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,400
 - Sorry, Joe, sorry.

542
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,460
 - All right, so speaking of politics, Confucius,

543
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,840
 like Andy said, not that successful when alive,

544
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,600
 but he was the minister for crime.

545
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,740
 He was basically the pretty patella of his day.

546
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,080
 (audience laughing)

547
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,260
 - She's a politician.

548
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,560
 (audience laughing)

549
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,760
 - And so he was working for a juke.

550
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,960
 It was like a jukedom, and he was in charge

551
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,680
 of sort of punishment and crime and stuff like that.

552
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,120
 And he fell out with the juke, apparently,

553
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,080
 and wandered for 12 years after he fell out with the juke.

554
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,960
 And apparently the reason that he fell out with him

555
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,700
 is he was at a sacrifice, and the sacrificial meat

556
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,540
 was being offered around, but he wasn't offered any.

557
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,620
 And so without taking off his sacrificial bonnet,

558
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,260
 he left the country.

559
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,080
 - He loved meat.

560
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,140
 (audience laughing)

561
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,940
 That's the main thing, I'm getting time and again.

562
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,620
 - I've got a data point to add to this.

563
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,860
 When he was, so he wandered for 12, 13 years

564
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,620
 trying to get people to listen to him, no one did.

565
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,140
 So he went back, became a politician again,

566
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,340
 and he was quite successful as a politician, to be honest,

567
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,740
 just not spreading his ideas.

568
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,320
 But he transformed the town that he was a counselor of.

569
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,360
 And the way he transformed it, I read, mainly,

570
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,560
 is by ending the adulteration of meat.

571
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,200
 - Gosh.

572
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,040
 - Wow. - He's just

573
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,940
 the sausage king, and he just happens to have,

574
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,480
 this is amazing. - Incredible.

575
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,640
 - He once said that the main goal of life

576
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,080
 is to become a man of virtue, which is,

577
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,400
 there's a word for that, junzi.

578
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing it wrong, but it is about education,

579
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,240
 it's about compassion, it's about observing ritual.

580
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,960
 But if you don't succeed, that is also a chance

581
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,420
 to gain virtue.

582
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,740
 And he said, "Is not a junzi one who stays unruffled,

583
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,220
 "though men ignore him?"

584
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,540
 (audience laughs)

585
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,480
 - Anyway, I've got another fact over here.

586
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,300
 (audience laughs)

587
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,360
 - It's a blessed moment.

588
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,740
 - If you compare him to what other people in, let's say,

589
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,340
 Europe were doing at this time and saying,

590
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,860
 basically philosophers were, they were quite pro-war,

591
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,500
 they're pro-pride, they're pro-patriotism or your city,

592
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,600
 there wasn't much chat about compassion and kindness

593
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,840
 and generosity, and he was much more about all of that,

594
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,800
 which was about 2,000 years ahead of where anyone else was.

595
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,560
 He was quite crap on women, which is a slightly annoying

596
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,920
 thing about him. - Yes.

597
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,840
 - He did think that they were like a different species,

598
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,880
 really, or not, like a different social class.

599
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,680
 There was one moment where he met a leader who said,

600
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,720
 "I've got 10 very good ministers working for me,"

601
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,120
 and Confucius looked at them and went,

602
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,760
 "Well, one of them is a woman, so you've only got nine."

603
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,320
 But look, I know.

604
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,640
 - Confucius canceled 2,500 years later.

605
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,500
 (audience laughs)

606
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,840
 - We all made mistakes.

607
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,820
 - I've just got some stuff on family trees,

608
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
 if you wanna hear me. - Yeah, yeah.

609
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,900
 - So a couple of very long family trees,

610
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,580
 possibly almost records compared to Confucius,

611
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,220
 the Lurie family, some people think that's the longest

612
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,620
 in the world, according to Dr. Neil Rosenstein,

613
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,140
 who wrote a book about it, they can trace their lineage

614
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,920
 all the way back to the Biblical king David.

615
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,560
 - Ooh. - Okay.

616
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,760
 But in the Bible, it says that David was begat by Jesse,

617
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,600
 who was begat by Obed, and their booze,

618
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,080
 and their salmon, and their nascent,

619
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,000
 so I don't know why they stopped there,

620
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
 'cause we know who came before them.

621
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
 - Oh, I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,120
 - And then the only other family that could be around

623
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,840
 the same is the House of Solomon,

624
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,560
 and they claim to go back to the Queen of Sheba.

625
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,400
 That's the Imperial family of Ethiopia,

626
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,920
 and we know who the latest on that line is.

627
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,460
 It's someone called Zira Yakob,

628
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,260
 who was the second African to ever go to Eaton College,

629
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,740
 who ever go to Eaton College,

630
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,060
 and in the '90s, at the last time I could find him,

631
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,060
 he was living in the Rastafarian community in Manchester,

632
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,580
 and according to the legend,

633
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,340
 his family looks after the Ark of the Covenant,

634
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:26,780
 so Indiana Jones could have just gone to Russia.

635
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,040
 (laughing)

636
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,140
 - What a downer that movie would have been in.

637
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,260
 (laughing)

638
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,620
 - All right, you're coming over there,

639
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,620
 looking for your Ark of the Covenant.

640
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,420
 (laughing)

641
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
 I love you, mate.

642
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,000
 (upbeat music)

643
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,280
 - All right, look, I need to move us on to our next fact.

644
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,720
 It is time for fact number three,

645
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,960
 and that is Andy.

646
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,160
 - My fact is that there is a two-headed tortoise

647
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,640
 in Switzerland whose two heads prefer different foods.

648
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,260
 (laughing)

649
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,220
 - And here he is.

650
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,460
 - So people at home, their pictures just come up

651
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,300
 on the screen.

652
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,020
 - Yeah, Andy didn't have them in his pocket.

653
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,940
 (laughing)

654
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,700
 - Yeah, Janus is his name,

655
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,020
 named after the old god with two faces,

656
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,060
 that's facing different ways,

657
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,700
 and he's 25 years old.

658
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,640
 He's just turned 25.

659
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,540
 He was born in, and still lives in Geneva,

660
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,580
 'cause he's quite slow-moving

661
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,780
 and he hasn't managed to leave yet.

662
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,620
 - Hopefully in about 50 years he'll be in Zurich.

663
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,380
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

664
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,520
 This is all from a great piece,

665
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
 just about a million other times, by the way.

666
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,840
 And he lives in the Natural History Museum,

667
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,160
 and he sounds like a great guy.

668
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,600
 I mean, he really, he has a wonderful life.

669
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,440
 He has--

670
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,520
 - Can I just ask?

671
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,440
 With it being two heads, should you not say "they"

672
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,000
 rather than "he"?

673
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
 - I agree, they need two names,

674
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,600
 like Janus one and Janus two maybe.

675
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,720
 - Yeah.

676
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 - Okay, well, just rip up these notes then.

677
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,440
 (laughing)

678
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,120
 Well, they, no, you're right,

679
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,080
 'cause they have different personalities,

680
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,700
 and you're right, yeah, yeah, all right.

681
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,420
 Well, anyway, between them,

682
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,800
 these two little guys, who share a shell,

683
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,340
 they have a skateboard, which I love.

684
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,020
 - Today! - Yeah.

685
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,860
 Isn't that cool?

686
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
 - That is really cool.

687
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,220
 - Did they, someone gave them that, right?

688
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,300
 They didn't go out to make their way to the shop,

689
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,140
 didn't they?

690
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:20,980
 - They didn't made it themselves?

691
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,900
 - Yeah, he or they get a valium rubbed

692
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,380
 on their heads every day.

693
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,220
 - What?

694
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,980
 That's nice. - Vaseline.

695
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,820
 - Oh, yeah.

696
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,380
 (laughing)

697
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,220
 Yeah.

698
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,220
 - Oh my God, you do not want to get those two mixed up.

699
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,840
 - So, I've got valium here,

700
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,080
 but I think I just wrote that

701
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,820
 as a kind of wishful film and thing.

702
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,800
 (laughing)

703
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,740
 - They have Vaseline because their heads

704
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,080
 bump into each other too much.

705
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,860
 - And why would valium prevent chafing,

706
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,120
 as I've also put in the notes?

707
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,680
 This is why you're always in so much pain, I've been telling you.

708
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,900
 (laughing)

709
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,680
 I'm depressed, but I'm incredibly smooth.

710
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,940
 (laughing)

711
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,000
 - Yeah, and also, he does have a lot of,

712
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,920
 or they both have a lot of issues

713
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,520
 in terms of general lifestyle.

714
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
 So, they're 25 years old.

715
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,720
 These tortoises can live for quite a long time.

716
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,100
 If they were in the wild, they'd probably be dead by now.

717
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,160
 One of the ways that tortoises, as we know,

718
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,560
 survive in the wild is if a predator comes in,

719
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,840
 they can back up into their shell.

720
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,920
 But there's only space for one of the heads to go back in.

721
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 Which would just leave the other one hanging out, yeah.

722
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,520
 - Unfortunately, he's got a skateboard,

723
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,920
 so he can make good his exit.

724
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,240
 - I was just thinking, maybe if they cover him in Vaseline,

725
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,800
 he might be able to slip in there.

726
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,280
 (laughing)

727
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,360
 - They chuck valium at the predator, they might be able to.

728
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,480
 - Well, he's, this is a mutation, right?

729
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,320
 Where you have two heads instead of one.

730
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,040
 If it's a mutation, then that means,

731
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,880
 'cause he's 25 years old now, it means we have all missed

732
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,900
 the time when there was a genuine teenage mutant hero

733
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,120
 tortoise owning a skateboard.

734
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:54,960
 - Oh my God, yes.

735
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,880
 - No, anyway, he was 25, so he's now a mid-20s.

736
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,720
 (laughing)

737
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,360
 - He's a bit old for a skateboard, really, 25, isn't he?

738
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,920
 - Yes, definitely, yeah, yeah.

739
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,600
 - On the skateboard, it's not putting one foot down

740
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
 to propel itself, right?

741
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,600
 It's just someone's pushing it.

742
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,640
 - I think his helpers are pushing him around, yeah.

743
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,720
 - Yeah, 'cause I visited the embalmed body

744
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
 of Jeremy Bentham, and they said,

745
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,720
 oh, he's got a skateboard, and I saw the skateboard.

746
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,520
 It's not a skateboard, so.

747
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
 - Hang on, I mean, he's definitely not riding

748
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,760
 that skateboard, why has he even got that?

749
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,240
 - Oh, 'cause when he rides out of his box

750
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,600
 to get vacuumed each year,

751
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,320
 they need to get him across.

752
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,280
 - But actually, doesn't he have two heads?

753
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,120
 Jeremy Bentham.

754
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,960
 - He does have two heads?

755
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,800
 - He does have two heads?

756
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,240
 - He has, like, his real head is hidden away,

758
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,640
 and he's got, like, a fake head.

759
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,920
 - The white sort of a wax head, 'cause, wow.

760
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,600
 - Oh my God, we've blown this right open.

761
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,440
 - Yeah.

762
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,280
 - Two-headed tortoise.

763
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,640
 - Jeremy Bentham is a tortoise?

764
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,480
 (laughing)

765
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,040
 - And so what, they just skate him out to Hoover him?

766
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,600
 - Yeah, when transporting him,

767
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,000
 they put him on what they call a skateboard.

768
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,840
 I imagine it's the same with--

769
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,400
 - To be honest, I didn't know that they Hoovered

770
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,800
 Jeremy Bentham once a year, as in, that's--

771
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,520
 - We've mentioned that in the show, I think, yeah, yeah.

772
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,440
 They have a little vacuum and they Hoover him, yeah, yeah.

773
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,880
 Anyway, tortoises.

774
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,520
 (laughing)

775
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,240
 So, yeah, so Janice is a tortoise,

776
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,920
 and it is quite rare, but if you go online,

777
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,320
 you can see lots of tortoises that have two heads.

778
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
 - Probably the second most common animal to have two heads.

779
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,600
 I think snakes are slightly more common,

780
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,960
 but yeah, if you're gonna get any animal with two heads,

781
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,760
 if it's not a snake, it's probably a tortoise.

782
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,960
 - Snake's all over the place,

783
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,000
 by Kefley, as it's called, one in 100,000 snakes.

784
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,480
 That's loads. - Yeah.

785
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,680
 - And, again, they never really lived that long

786
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,120
 unless they're in captivity,

787
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,640
 because, partly because of this whole,

788
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,920
 the heads argue with each other thing.

789
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,720
 So, in snakes, it's a serious problem.

790
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,520
 If they, like, one head will fight with the other for food,

791
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,160
 and they'll end up, kind of, no one gets it,

792
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,920
 and they'll exhaust so much energy fighting

793
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,040
 with each other that they starve to death.

794
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,960
 - And what's crazy is, it goes into the one stomach.

795
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,800
 - Well, it depends.

796
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,520
 Some of them have two, some of them have one, but yeah.

797
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,840
 But the ones that have one, yeah,

798
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,760
 exactly the two heads will be fighting, not knowing,

799
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
 never having studied anatomy and realising.

800
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,720
 - So sad, 'cause it feels like they could,

801
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,840
 lady in the tramp, all their meals.

802
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,040
 - Yeah.

803
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,880
 - And that would be very charming.

804
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,000
 - But I know, 'cause I think that is incest, isn't it?

805
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,840
 Definitely.

806
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,720
 - I think something else has to happen for incest.

807
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,560
 - Really?

808
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,400
 - It's not.

809
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,960
 - Yeah, that is hard.

810
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,720
 - Yeah, but the thing about that is--

811
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
 - Wait, just kissing is not incest?

812
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,640
 - Dad's interested suddenly.

813
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,920
 (audience laughing)

814
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,120
 - We've found a very interesting philosophical question,

815
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,160
 which is, if a two-headed snake has a wank, is it incest?

816
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,000
 (audience laughing)

817
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 - What is it using to have a wank?

818
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,480
 (audience laughing)

819
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
 - That's plenty of tail there, I think.

820
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,320
 Could do the job.

821
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
 - Oh, puts the tail, oh god.

822
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,600
 - Yeah.

823
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,440
 (audience laughing)

824
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,280
 - The other thing we have these snakes--

825
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,120
 - Do they have dicks?

826
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,400
 We need to take it to the dick vet to find out, I guess.

827
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,320
 (audience laughing)

828
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,880
 - So, snakes, tots, there's Tasmanians

829
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480
 with the other people with two heads.

830
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,960
 (audience laughing)

831
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,280
 Commonly.

832
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,320
 Apparently, there's a thing.

833
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,040
 In the olden days, there's a thing in Australia

834
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,880
 that all Tasmanians had two heads.

835
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
 - Really?

836
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,120
 - And the reason being that they had a problem

837
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
 with a deficiency of iodine.

838
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,920
 And so it would often have goiters.

839
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,840
 So people in Tasmania would often have goiters.

840
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
 - What is a goiters?

841
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,320
 - So a goiter is like a, it's a growth on your neck.

842
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,440
 And it can get really big,

843
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,240
 and it can almost look like a second head.

844
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,640
 But actually, what would happen is,

845
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,400
 they would have some surgery,

846
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,920
 and so they would have like a scar on their neck.

847
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,200
 And then during the war,

848
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,600
 a lot of Tasmanians would go to the front line

849
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,560
 and they'd meet Australians and they'd say,

850
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,520
 "Well, where's your other head?"

851
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,960
 'Cause they saw a scar, thought that a head had grown there.

852
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,800
 - I used to-

853
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,320
 - I believe these days, it's not so common

854
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
 to be iodine deficient in Tasmania.

855
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
 - Cool.

856
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,240
 - And it probably wasn't a hundred percent.

857
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,560
 But I do think the ones that did it,

858
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,240
 'cause they are Aussie, so they've got a sense of humor.

859
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,440
 I assume they drew a face on their goiters.

860
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
 (audience laughing)

861
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,600
 - Good point, yeah.

862
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,720
 - Went around freaking everyone out.

863
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,600
 - Good eye, mate.

864
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,760
 (laughing)

865
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,600
 - That's true.

866
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,760
 - There's a, I found this through a QI, actually.

867
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,840
 In 2019, a two-headed rattlesnake called Double Dave

868
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,660
 was born.

869
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,940
 Do you know why he's called Double Dave?

870
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,280
 - 'Cause it's got two heads.

871
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,720
 (audience laughing)

872
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,240
 - No, he was found by two scientists called Dave.

873
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,240
 (audience laughing)

874
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,120
 - That's amazing.

875
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,400
 - You know, Nicholas Cage?

876
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,240
 - No.

877
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,080
 - Who's that?

878
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,400
 - He was Min Campbell's predecessor

879
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,520
 as leader of the Lib Dems.

880
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,840
 No, he was, Nick Cage, he once spent $80,000

881
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,960
 on a two-headed snake, because he'd had a dream.

882
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,000
 He dreamed of a two-headed eagle, which you can't get.

883
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,840
 And so...

884
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,920
 (audience laughing)

885
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,080
 - So he went on eBay, it's a two-headed eagle.

886
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,920
 - Exactly, yeah.

887
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,760
 - And this is why it came up.

888
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,240
 - Yeah, weirdly, you can't get a two-headed eagle,

889
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,680
 as in no one's ever seen a two-headed eagle,

890
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
 even though it's the symbol of loads of countries,

891
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,440
 and it's a big thing, and that just doesn't happen

892
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
 as far as we know.

893
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,880
 Anyway, and he got so freaked out

894
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,360
 that he gave it away to a museum,

895
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,080
 'cause they fought, and he said,

896
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,720
 "I had to put a spatula between the two heads

897
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,560
 "to feed them."

898
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,480
 (audience laughing)

899
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,160
 - Is that where he got the idea for face-off?

900
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,400
 (audience gasping)

901
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,440
 - It's quite a different plot, but they're...

902
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,480
 (audience laughing)

903
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,920
 - But you know, once these Hollywood types

904
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,640
 rework a script, they re-write it.

905
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,980
 - Yeah, it's very different.

906
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,440
 - I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.

907
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,280
 - What?

908
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,400
 - So you can get Janus Katz, Katz with two faces,

909
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,720
 which I think is the correct use of the term Janus,

910
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 'cause Janus had two faces, not two heads.

911
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 So I actually think that their tortoise here,

912
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
 they fucked up.

913
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,400
 - Miss Noma.

914
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,240
 (audience laughing)

915
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,440
 - Well, it does have two faces as well, in fairness.

916
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,280
 - Yeah.

917
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,120
 - Okay, it does have two faces.

918
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,640
 You're right, but it's not how you'd describe it, is it?

919
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
 If you were saying that tortoise has got two...

920
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,160
 - He can't look forward into one year

921
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
 and look back into another year.

922
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,280
 - Exactly.

923
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,240
 That would be so shit if you had a two-faced tortoise

924
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,480
 and one of the faces just looked backwards

925
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,640
 into your shell the whole time.

926
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,120
 (audience laughing)

927
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,280
 - Janus and Anus, I guess.

928
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
 (audience laughing)

929
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,600
 - Hey, how 'bout us?

930
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,760
 - Well, that's just Anus.

931
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,240
 (audience laughing)

932
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,880
 Lovely lipstick, Anus.

933
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,460
 (upbeat music)

934
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,880
 - It is time for a final fact of the show,

935
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,800
 and that is Janus.

936
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,240
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Jagermeister

937
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,600
 was originally drunk to stop people from feeling sick.

938
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
 (audience laughing)

939
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,280
 - How many do you have to have?

940
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,400
 - It's about 12.

941
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,240
 - Okay.

942
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,320
 - So no, it was originally a digestif.

943
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,040
 And in fact, some Germans still call it liver glue.

944
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,360
 And the idea is that you would take it after a large meal

945
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,640
 and it would settle your stomach.

946
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,440
 And it was always taken at room temperature,

947
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,280
 and that was the only reason you would have it.

948
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,360
 And it was invented by a guy called Karl Maast.

949
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,920
 And it was his nephew, Gunter,

950
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,880
 who came up with the idea that you could take it cold

951
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,240
 and have it as a social drink and get hammered with it.

952
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,120
 - I hadn't thought of it as something you had cold.

953
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,280
 Just whenever you have Jagermeister,

954
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,480
 you are so unaware of the temperature of the drink.

955
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,800
 (audience laughing)

956
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,920
 - Excuse me, can I set back this Jagermeister, please?

957
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
 It's a few degrees off.

958
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,920
 (audience laughing)

959
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,760
 - I think it's corked.

960
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,920
 (audience laughing)

961
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,000
 But yeah, Jagermeister, invented in Germany

962
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,160
 by this guy called Kurt Maast.

963
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,760
 He was a son of a vinegar maker,

964
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,720
 and he decided he would go into liquor.

965
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,680
 So he invented loads of types of drinks.

966
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,240
 Burning Love was his biggest one

967
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,240
 until he came up with this 56 herb recipe for the Jagermeister.

968
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,320
 - Do we believe the 56 herbs in?

969
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,760
 'Cause they sort of are open about 10 of the herbs.

970
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
 But then they claim that it's definitely 56,

971
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,080
 but the rest are all secret.

972
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,400
 - And it's secret, isn't it?

973
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,280
 - They've got a chief bartender.

974
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,880
 He's called the Brandmeister at the moment.

975
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,800
 His name is Willie Shine, and he says that he,

976
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,920
 come on, grow up, guys.

977
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,640
 (audience laughing)

978
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,640
 He says, Willie Shine says he is legally only allowed

979
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,360
 to discuss 11 of the 56 ingredients.

980
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,400
 - Wow, I know.

981
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,280
 - So does that mean if you ever talked to him

982
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,320
 about licorice or something, he's like,

983
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,240
 you can't say anything?

984
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,920
 - Yeah, he's like a one-man guess who,

985
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,160
 but instead of guessing a person,

986
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,160
 you're guessing ingredients again.

987
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,000
 - Isn't it amazing, though?

988
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,480
 'Cause I know, I guess back in the day,

989
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,560
 Coca-Cola has the secret ingredient.

990
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,120
 KFC, you know, the secret ingredient.

991
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,000
 Like, these days, are you allowed to get away

992
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,920
 just saying there's a magical something in there?

993
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,760
 No, I don't think you're allowed to.

994
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,480
 - No, I'm gonna not allergy a secret ingredient?

995
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,720
 Get the fuck out!

996
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,080
 (audience laughing)

997
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,160
 - But it's still allowed, right?

998
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,000
 - Yeah, it's still allowed.

999
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,920
 I guess, maybe alcoholic drinks seem to be a loophole.

1000
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,400
 I've never looked the back of a bottle of--

1001
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,240
 - No one has ever read the back of a bottle of Jägermeister.

1002
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
 (audience laughing)

1003
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,600
 - Yeah, it was quite sort of a stiff,

1004
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,520
 like a drink for kind of stiff types, wasn't it?

1005
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,640
 Before it was loosened up.

1006
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,360
 It was basically well-to-do German people who drunk it.

1007
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,760
 And then, I think it was in the 1970s,

1008
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,960
 there was a businessman called Sidney Frank,

1009
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,520
 who realized in America that the only people

1010
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,880
 drinking this thing were these well-to-do German

1011
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,720
 kind of immigrants.

1012
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,560
 And for some reason thought,

1013
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,040
 "I reckon I can make this huge."

1014
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,360
 And he completely transformed its reputation.

1015
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,520
 He hired a lot of Jägerets.

1016
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,600
 And Jäger dudes, I think, came later.

1017
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,960
 Jägerets are scantily clad women

1018
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,680
 who tend to be just rolled out

1019
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,000
 whenever you need to sell anything in life.

1020
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,840
 But he sent sort of a scantily clad Jägerets

1021
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,040
 around the bars of the U.S.

1022
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
 And it went huge.

1023
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,400
 - Yeah, and one of the things that he did

1024
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,120
 was kind of spread rumors about Jägermeister.

1025
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,400
 So there had actually been a guy who had been up,

1026
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,240
 I think for attempted murder or something,

1027
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
 and he said that he'd had something

1028
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,320
 called liquid valium, actually.

1029
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,280
 - Stop it, he actually had solid vaseline.

1030
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,600
 - It was solid vaseline.

1031
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,080
 But then later on, a bar in New Orleans

1032
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,200
 started selling this Jägermeister

1033
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,000
 as if it was called liquid valium as a publicity thing.

1034
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,800
 So it was like maybe it had caused this murder

1035
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,200
 or this attempted murder.

1036
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,280
 - Sorry, just on the Jägerets thing very quickly

1037
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,160
 before we move on from there.

1038
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,200
 I was once in a bar in Budapest

1039
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,680
 and someone came around,

1040
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,680
 sort of young woman came around who was,

1041
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,760
 she was like a kind of Jägeret,

1042
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,880
 but she wasn't selling shots of alcohol.

1043
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,360
 She was selling carrots.

1044
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,280
 - And really?

1045
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,520
 - And I've got one.

1046
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,560
 - And it was like, it was like a quid for a carrot,

1047
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,000
 which in the supermarket,

1048
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,720
 I know which in the supermarket is crazy,

1049
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,920
 but next to a glass of wine,

1050
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,360
 you think that's a good, that's an investment,

1051
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,200
 isn't that reasonable?

1052
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,040
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1053
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,040
 - And I swear to God, that was the best carrot

1054
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,880
 I had ever eaten.

1055
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
 It was like, it was about a foot long.

1056
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,720
 It was clean, it was crunchy.

1057
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,560
 - Was it shaved?

1058
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,040
 - It had been, it was shaved or peeled, as we call it.

1059
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,320
 (audience laughing)

1060
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,760
 - Oh yeah, that's the weird one.

1061
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,520
 - You better quid for a carrot.

1062
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,720
 - I don't regret it for a second.

1063
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,120
 And I looked around the back,

1064
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,560
 every other man in the room had also just standing there

1065
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
 with a carrot.

1066
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,080
 - Wow.

1067
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,880
 Genuine, I've never seen this in any other bowl

1068
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,080
 or any other country or anything like that.

1069
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,200
 - That's because it was one-off.

1070
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,680
 I have no question in my mind

1071
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,520
 that you were part of a scientific study

1072
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,560
 setting out to prove that men are so stupid,

1073
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,640
 they will literally buy anything at any price

1074
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,880
 if an attractive woman sells it to them.

1075
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,880
 (audience cheering)

1076
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,040
 - Unbelievable.

1077
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,880
 - So what?

1078
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,000
 So what?

1079
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 Apparently I'm also a mug

1080
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,560
 when the Sprout Girl came around a couple of minutes later.

1081
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,880
 (audience laughing)

1082
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,200
 That was a fucking lovely Sprout.

1083
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,280
 It only cost a fiver.

1084
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,280
 (audience laughing)

1085
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,160
 Jägermeister, the word itself is, it means master hunter.

1086
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,800
 And it's really interesting, the story.

1087
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,520
 So if you look at a Jägermeister bottle,

1088
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,800
 you'll see there's a stag on it.

1089
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
 And in between, there's a Christian cross

1090
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,840
 going across it, the crucifix is there.

1091
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,520
 And sometimes it's depicted when you see pictures

1092
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,920
 of where he took this idea from

1093
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,560
 with Jesus on the cross itself.

1094
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,960
 And what it was was it was a guy

1095
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,440
 who eventually became a saint, Saint Hubertus.

1096
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,360
 He was out and he was hunting

1097
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,240
 and he suddenly saw a stag come around the corner.

1098
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,800
 He was meant to be in church, but he wasn't.

1099
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
 And he saw a stag come around the corner

1100
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,280
 and the stag had a sort of crucifix, just a cross,

1101
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,960
 in between, glowing through its horns.

1102
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,160
 And he had this sudden conversation with this stag,

1103
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,720
 where the stag was like, dude, what are you doing?

1104
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,320
 I was thinking of the Jäger dudes there.

1105
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,040
 I assume that's how they talk.

1106
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,240
 Where he basically said,

1107
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,280
 you need to be more ethical in your hunting.

1108
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,240
 You need to make sure that if you're gonna kill a stag,

1109
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,120
 it's one that's older or maybe sickly.

1110
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,080
 I would do it, you know.

1111
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,560
 And he sort of introduced ethicalness into it.

1112
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,240
 So he became a saint, Saint Hubertus.

1113
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,720
 He's the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians,

1114
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,360
 opticians, chicken roasters.

1115
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,640
 I couldn't, could you find any evidence of the chicken roasters?

1116
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,040
 'Cause I just couldn't find any evidence of where that came from.

1117
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,360
 It's a bit left field, isn't it?

1118
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,640
 It's sort of just, it was left over and they weren't like us.

1119
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,360
 What is a chicken roaster? It's not even a thing.

1120
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,840
 But rotisserie, you see,

1121
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,400
 something that's used as a counter at the supermarket,

1122
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,480
 which has a rotisserie.

1123
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,320
 You just always thought, if you're a saint in the chicken roasters,

1124
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,680
 you'll be a saint of just all the meat roasters.

1125
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,320
 No, Andy once paid 20 euros for a rotisserie chicken.

1126
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,960
 That was an error, yeah.

1127
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,880
 Another thing that he did was cured rabies.

1128
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,160
 Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah.

1129
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,560
 What just sort of, what, people are animals,

1130
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,000
 'cause both can get it.

1131
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,040
 Both can be cured by Saint Hubertus.

1132
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,120
 Oh, great.

1133
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,440
 Saint Hubertus' key,

1134
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,160
 which is a key that I think priests would keep them, wouldn't they?

1135
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,720
 And sometimes normal shops would have us in Hubertus' key.

1136
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,800
 And you would, it was like an iron bar and you heat it up.

1137
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,200
 It's like a defibrillator in a, you know...

1138
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,400
 It's exactly like that, yeah.

1139
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,920
 The effect of what you were doing was

1140
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,840
 you were heating up the key and you were branding the person with the key.

1141
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,760
 So if they were bitten by a dog that might have rabies,

1142
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,440
 you would immediately heat up the key, put it on.

1143
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,760
 And the idea is that the burning would sterilise your...

1144
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,840
 Well, I think the idea was that it was a magic key.

1145
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,440
 Yeah, the idea was that it turns out that actually it might have worked

1146
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
 because of the sterilisation of the heat, it's possible.

1147
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,000
 And you would have cauterised the wounds,

1148
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,440
 so no bacteria could have got in, so it might have worked slightly.

1149
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,280
 They got lucky.

1150
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,560
 It's always one in 1,000 of these bullshit magical cures happen to also work.

1151
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,520
 Yeah.

1152
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,720
 Um, Jägermeister, back to that.

1153
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,040
 Yeah.

1154
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,400
 Jägermeister do not like Jägerbombs.

1155
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,280
 Yeah.

1156
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,080
 Who does?

1157
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,760
 Just for the streamers, there was a gasp in the room.

1158
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,080
 They can't believe it.

1159
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,120
 So Jägerbombs is a Jägermeister from Red Bull

1160
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,640
 and you drop one in the other and it's great.

1161
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,840
 And so they didn't invent it.

1162
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,000
 And I think they have slightly distanced themselves from it.

1163
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,080
 The Jägermeister firm, they say they have to promote responsible drinking

1164
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,440
 and the marketing director, who's a woman called Nicole Goodwin,

1165
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,560
 she said, "You will never see us actively support or promote Jägerbombs.

1166
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,560
 That's very much driven by our customers."

1167
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,440
 And they recommend you have it with ginger beer.

1168
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,560
 And a carrot.

1169
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,520
 And a nice...

1170
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,440
 They've signed up to the apartment group, haven't they?

1171
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,640
 The apartment group is a thing that encourages responsible drinking

1172
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,960
 that a lot of, sort of, alcohol companies sign up for.

1173
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,480
 But they have admitted that it's helped.

1174
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,120
 So they don't like it, but, you know, they're not going to stop you from doing it, I think.

1175
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,720
 Yeah, right.

1176
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:56,080
 So I mentioned Gunther Elio, who was a nephew of Karl Maast.

1177
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,600
 And he, in the '70s, came up with an advertising campaign, which was one for all.

1178
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,520
 So like Hannah said, it was quite an upper-class kind of German drink.

1179
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,480
 But he wanted to get normal Germans drinking it.

1180
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,480
 So the idea was it would be a poster and you would have a normal German

1181
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,600
 and they would just look like it could be a man, a woman, a young girl, or anything.

1182
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,200
 But it'd be completely unknown.

1183
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,520
 And they would say, "I drink Jägermeister because."

1184
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,680
 And then it would give an excuse.

1185
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,520
 So...

1186
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,320
 A reason?

1187
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,080
 Reason, yeah.

1188
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,920
 An excuse is a bit different, Lee.

1189
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,960
 An excuse is what you have to say the next morning.

1190
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,880
 I drank all that Jägermeister because, yeah.

1191
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,400
 Well, for instance, I drink Jägermeister because, as a teacher,

1192
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,640
 I have to go to school my whole life.

1193
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,920
 Oh, that was one of them.

1194
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,960
 That's so good.

1195
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,760
 Yeah.

1196
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,040
 One of them was, "I drink Jägermeister because my husband always calls me Erika,

1197
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,600
 even though my name is Heidi."

1198
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,320
 (LAUGHTER)

1199
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,800
 These were genuinely adverts for Jägermeister.

1200
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,120
 That's incredible.

1201
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,760
 There's just one more thing.

1202
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,800
 The factory that makes Jägermeister is in...

1203
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:05,600
 It's on Jägermeister Straus, weird coincidence, in Wulfenbüttel in Germany.

1204
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,320
 And an independent journalist went to see what goes on there

1205
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,520
 and stayed in the Jägermeister guest house,

1206
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,400
 where you have Jägermeister in the mini bar, obviously.

1207
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,200
 And he went to visit Jägermeister HQ

1208
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,520
 and you're told that you're not allowed to take a phone in

1209
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,640
 because the alcohol fumes in there are so thick

1210
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,400
 that they might spark an explosion, apparently.

1211
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,120
 Well, a literal Jägerbomber.

1212
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,600
 (LAUGHTER)

1213
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,720
 OK, that is it.

1214
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,000
 That is all of our facts.

1215
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,720

00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,560
 It's got all... Thank you, yeah.

1229
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,920
 It's a very exciting place.

1230
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,560
 We've got lots of bonus content going up

1231
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,040
 where we dick about behind the scenes

1232
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,960
 and just think of new fun things to try out.

1233
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,400
 Also, it's ad-free, so if you want that, get that.

1234
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,280
 Otherwise, just stay here if you're listening at home

1235
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,720
 at this very same place that you get us,

1236
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,720
 because we'll be back again next week.

1237
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,600
 London Podcast Festival, thank you so much for having us.

1238
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:28,760
