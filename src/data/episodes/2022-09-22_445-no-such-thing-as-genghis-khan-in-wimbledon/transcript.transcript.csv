00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast."
00:00:19,00:00:21,"This week, coming to you live"
00:00:21,00:00:23,from the London Podcast Festival.
00:00:23,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:25,00:00:27,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:29,00:00:31,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:31,00:00:34,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones"
00:00:34,00:00:36,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:36,00:00:40,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:40,00:00:44,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:44,00:00:47,- My fact this week is that researchers have concluded
00:00:47,00:00:50,that cats don't like cat people.
00:00:50,00:00:52,(audience laughing)
00:00:52,00:00:54,I'm really sorry.
00:00:54,00:00:56,"- What a cat. - Scientifically speaking,"
00:00:56,00:00:58,"the more you like cats, the less they like you."
00:00:58,00:01:00,"- But I would say I have a cat,"
00:01:00,00:01:02,and I wouldn't say I'm a cat person.
00:01:02,00:01:04,And my cat definitely doesn't like me.
00:01:04,00:01:07,So could it be that cats just don't like any people?
00:01:07,00:01:10,"- Sometimes they're just good judges of character, James."
00:01:10,00:01:13,"But this, it's actually not that."
00:01:13,00:01:15,So this is a study that was done
00:01:15,00:01:16,at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home
00:01:16,00:01:19,with a bunch of universities involved.
00:01:19,00:01:23,And it got 119 different people to interact
00:01:23,00:01:25,with a cat in a room.
00:01:25,00:01:27,And then it looked at various things
00:01:27,00:01:28,"about the people, like their personality type,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"they're kind of neurotic, are they agreeable people?"
00:01:31,00:01:32,"You know, you fill in a questionnaire"
00:01:32,00:01:34,and say all that stuff about yourself.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And it asked them, have you ever owned a cat?"
00:01:36,00:01:38,How long have you owned a cat for?
00:01:38,00:01:39,Do you like cats?
00:01:39,00:01:42,Turns out the best predictor of how much a cat
00:01:42,00:01:44,is gonna like you is the number of years
00:01:44,00:01:45,"that you've lived with a cat,"
00:01:45,00:01:48,but they're inversely proportional.
00:01:48,00:01:50,(audience laughing)
00:01:50,00:01:53,"Yeah, the more, and people would like say,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,"you know, I'm really good with cats."
00:01:55,00:01:58,It's the people who are self-professed cat knowers.
00:01:58,00:01:59,"- Well, the thing I was reading is that a lot of it"
00:01:59,00:02:03,"is about cat people, people who like cats,"
00:02:03,00:02:05,cat people.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"- So, good clarification, sorry."
00:02:07,00:02:09,- Just in case you all thought we were talking
00:02:09,00:02:10,"about half cats, half person."
00:02:10,00:02:11,(audience laughing)
00:02:11,00:02:14,"- Really annoyingly, that's all my research."
00:02:14,00:02:16,(audience laughing)
00:02:16,00:02:18,"- Well, I think this was the study."
00:02:18,00:02:20,It found that they touched the cats
00:02:20,00:02:23,so-called red areas more when left alone with cats.
00:02:23,00:02:27,"Red areas are things like the, please,"
00:02:27,00:02:28,the-
00:02:28,00:02:31,"- We all went to that HR meeting, Andy, we know."
00:02:31,00:02:33,(audience laughing)
00:02:33,00:02:37,"- The base of the tail, or the belly."
00:02:37,00:02:39,"Apparently, the hairs on the belly are really sensitive,"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"and so a big old belly rub will,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,"I'm sure the cats vary from cat cats, but-"
00:02:43,00:02:45,"- They don't seem to, with the red areas."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"It's just the belly and base of the tail that are red,"
00:02:48,00:02:50,and they really seem to have crossed the board dislike.
00:02:50,00:02:53,"The rest of the cat is yellow area,"
00:02:53,00:02:53,like traffic lights.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- There's no green area.
00:02:54,00:02:55,- There's no green.
00:02:55,00:02:57,- I thought green was under the chin.
00:02:57,00:02:58,- You're absolutely right.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- Yeah, I mean, I read it."
00:02:59,00:02:59,I didn't-
00:02:59,00:03:02,(audience laughing)
00:03:02,00:03:05,"Yeah, they love a little tickle under the chin, and-"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"- And the cheeks, and the base of the ears."
00:03:07,00:03:08,- Yeah.
00:03:08,00:03:09,"- But yeah, that's basically it."
00:03:09,00:03:12,"The cat people are too tactile with cats,"
00:03:12,00:03:15,"and also this study found that their interaction style,"
00:03:15,00:03:17,"they want to control the interaction,"
00:03:17,00:03:20,whereas cats really dislike that.
00:03:20,00:03:22,So they prefer to be the ones who approach you.
00:03:22,00:03:24,They only want to get touched.
00:03:24,00:03:25,"If, you know, they've initiated it,"
00:03:25,00:03:26,"they've said, ""All right, come on,"
00:03:26,00:03:27,"you can touch me now."""
00:03:27,00:03:29,And this isn't what cat people do.
00:03:29,00:03:33,"And similarly, older people, cats tend to like them less"
00:03:33,00:03:37,"'cause older people, sorry, but usually cat people."
00:03:37,00:03:39,(audience laughing)
00:03:39,00:03:41,"It's the old cliche that, you know,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,it's always the person in the corner of the room
00:03:43,00:03:44,who's ignoring the cat that it goes to.
00:03:44,00:03:45,It turns out that it's true.
00:03:45,00:03:46,- Yeah.
00:03:46,00:03:48,There's been a recent study as well
00:03:48,00:03:51,"that says that they recognize their names, cats,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,"but they're just, they don't want you to know"
00:03:53,00:03:54,that they recognize their names.
00:03:54,00:03:56,(audience laughing)
00:03:56,00:04:00,So this was people at Sophia University in Japan.
00:04:00,00:04:02,"And they played a load of noises,"
00:04:02,00:04:05,including the cat's name that was said by the owner.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"And then as soon as their name was called,"
00:04:07,00:04:10,they saw their tail move almost imperceptibly.
00:04:10,00:04:12,They just very slightly moved.
00:04:12,00:04:14,Some people think that that's because
00:04:14,00:04:15,"they recognize their name,"
00:04:15,00:04:16,"but other people think, well,"
00:04:16,00:04:18,it's just something they kind of associate with food.
00:04:18,00:04:22,So you might as well be shaking a box of cat food
00:04:22,00:04:22,and do the same.
00:04:22,00:04:24,- I feel like all of these cat studies
00:04:24,00:04:25,are dancing around the fact that cats are dicks.
00:04:25,00:04:28,None of the scientists want to say that cats are dicks
00:04:28,00:04:31,because they know that if they say cats are dicks
00:04:31,00:04:32,"in the abstract of their paper,"
00:04:32,00:04:34,then they'll get in trouble with cat people.
00:04:34,00:04:36,So here's another one.
00:04:36,00:04:37,"Again, they didn't say cats are dicks,"
00:04:37,00:04:39,but I think we can all agree the implication.
00:04:39,00:04:40,"When you own a cat,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,it will not side with you against your enemies.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"Okay, that's bad."
00:04:45,00:04:47,So there's this experiment.
00:04:47,00:04:50,"Basically, you get a cat and the cat observes its owner,"
00:04:50,00:04:53,"struggling to open a container of something, right?"
00:04:53,00:04:55,And then the owner would request help
00:04:55,00:04:58,"from an actor, a stooge sitting there by,"
00:04:58,00:05:01,"and either the actor did help or didn't, right?"
00:05:01,00:05:03,"And then later on, that actor,"
00:05:03,00:05:05,"whether unhelpful or not, offered the cats some food."
00:05:05,00:05:07,The cats were completely agnostic
00:05:07,00:05:09,"about whether they took the food or not,"
00:05:09,00:05:13,whereas dogs would frequently refuse food
00:05:13,00:05:15,from the person who'd been a dick to their owner.
00:05:15,00:05:17,Cats were not like that.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"Cats were totally neutral,"
00:05:19,00:05:21,but it is possible that they're too stupid
00:05:21,00:05:23,to understand the play
00:05:23,00:05:26,that they've been put on for their benefit.
00:05:26,00:05:27,"Wow, yeah."
00:05:27,00:05:31,"Speaking of dicks, this study..."
00:05:31,00:05:34,That is definitely a red area.
00:05:34,00:05:36,So this study that I mentioned
00:05:36,00:05:39,"was done by a bunch of universities,"
00:05:39,00:05:41,"the two Nottingham universities, in fact,"
00:05:41,00:05:44,"and also the Royal Brackets Dick,"
00:05:44,00:05:47,"Clothes Brackets School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,and that's its name.
00:05:49,00:05:52,The Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh.
00:05:52,00:05:53,"It is named after a person called Dick,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,"so it's usually abbreviated to ""The Dick Fett."""
00:05:56,00:06:01,So it sounds like it's a real specialty vet.
00:06:01,00:06:04,And it was established...
00:06:04,00:06:05,It was established in the 19th century
00:06:05,00:06:08,by a vet called William Dick.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"And before you say anything, James,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"there's no evidence he ever shortened his name to Willie, OK?"
00:06:12,00:06:14,Willie Dick.
00:06:14,00:06:16,Never did he go by Willie Dick.
00:06:16,00:06:17,Good. Very nice.
00:06:17,00:06:18,Have you guys heard?
00:06:18,00:06:20,"This has blown my mind,"
00:06:20,00:06:22,"and I can't believe it's not bigger news,"
00:06:22,00:06:25,but there's an app out now called Meow Talk.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Have you heard of Meow Talk?
00:06:26,00:06:29,"Everyone listening, everyone here, everyone watching."
00:06:29,00:06:31,"If you have a cat, get Meow Talk."
00:06:31,00:06:34,It's an app that translates what your cat is saying to you.
00:06:34,00:06:37,"And I swear to God, this was done with scientists,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"and if you read the reviews,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,it sounds like it's actually genuinely
00:06:41,00:06:43,picking up what the cat is saying.
00:06:43,00:06:44,So this was a New York Times article
00:06:44,00:06:46,"that was written by Emily Antheys,"
00:06:46,00:06:48,and she was saying she tried it out.
00:06:48,00:06:50,And there's basically what they break it down to
00:06:50,00:06:54,is different sounds of the cat get matched to certain terms.
00:06:54,00:06:56,"So they can tell by the tone, the pitch, the length,"
00:06:56,00:06:58,"and so on of the meow in order to say,"
00:06:58,00:07:00,"roughly, they are saying this."
00:07:00,00:07:03,"So she first used it, and the cat meowed"
00:07:03,00:07:04,"after, I think, eating something,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,"and it translated as, ""I'm happy."""
00:07:07,00:07:09,"She was away from home, and she came home,"
00:07:09,00:07:11,and the cat purred as she got in.
00:07:11,00:07:14,"And her app said, the cat says, ""Nice to see you."""
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Like, oh, come on. Absolutely."
00:07:15,00:07:17,This had so many reviews.
00:07:17,00:07:18,"I swear to God, this is a real thing"
00:07:18,00:07:20,where they think that that is happening.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"But then it's also got, like, weird little terms"
00:07:22,00:07:23,that it uses as well.
00:07:23,00:07:26,"So there was one time that she went to the cat,"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"and the cat went, ""Meow."""
00:07:27,00:07:29,"Which translated as, ""Just chilling."""
00:07:29,00:07:30,(audience laughing)
00:07:30,00:07:31,This is not true.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"Okay, stick with me, guys."
00:07:32,00:07:36,"It's, so they've got, the other terms they've got is,"
00:07:36,00:07:37,"there was another time that she came in,"
00:07:37,00:07:38,"and the cat went, ""Meow."""
00:07:38,00:07:39,"Which went, ""My love, I'm here."""
00:07:39,00:07:41,Which is the word that it used.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"- Is there another one where you kind of get at,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,"and it goes, ""You should upgrade your membership"
00:07:46,00:07:47,"""to a premium account."""
00:07:47,00:07:49,"- If you read all the reviews of the app,"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"that's unfortunately, they get a lot of one-stars,"
00:07:51,00:07:52,"because the first meow leads to,"
00:07:52,00:07:54,"""You need premium membership"
00:07:54,00:07:55,"""to understand what your cat is saying."""
00:07:55,00:07:58,"But the best one is, she lifted her cat off the ground once,"
00:07:58,00:07:59,"and she was moving it somewhere,"
00:07:59,00:08:00,"and the cat went, ""Meow."""
00:08:00,00:08:02,"And that translated on her phone as,"
00:08:02,00:08:04,"""Hey, baby, let's go somewhere private."""
00:08:04,00:08:06,(audience laughing)
00:08:06,00:08:07,But this is real.
00:08:07,00:08:12,We can now talk to cats through meow talk.
00:08:12,00:08:13,- I've never been more convinced
00:08:13,00:08:15,you've been completely duped.
00:08:15,00:08:17,And now it's saying something.
00:08:17,00:08:19,Have you guys heard of Caden Griffin?
00:08:19,00:08:21,"- No, no. - So,"
00:08:21,00:08:23,he's relevant to this field of study.
00:08:23,00:08:27,"He is an American teenager, sixth grader."
00:08:27,00:08:29,"He, last year, he was in the sixth grade,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"which I think is about 12, 13 years old."
00:08:31,00:08:32,And it's from Tennessee.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"And last year, he became curious"
00:08:34,00:08:37,about how often the objects in our home
00:08:37,00:08:40,"are touched by cats' bottoms, okay?"
00:08:40,00:08:42,"If you own a cat, you might think,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"""Oh, is the cat rubbing itself on everything I own?"""
00:08:44,00:08:48,"So, he, being a scientifically-minded child,"
00:08:48,00:08:52,ran an experiment by putting lipstick
00:08:52,00:08:54,on his cat's bottom (audience laughing)
00:08:54,00:08:58,then studying the home for where lipstick was popping up.
00:08:58,00:09:00,What an amazing-- - And where did it end?
00:09:00,00:09:02,Not his toothbrush. - It's not on his lips.
00:09:02,00:09:04,(audience laughing)
00:09:04,00:09:06,Just his toothbrush day after day.
00:09:06,00:09:07,(audience laughing)
00:09:07,00:09:09,It's really good news for owners of long-haired cats.
00:09:09,00:09:11,There's basically no lipstick anywhere
00:09:11,00:09:12,at the end of the trial period.
00:09:12,00:09:17,"Short-haired cats, there's a little bit on soft furnishings,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,"but, you know, in general, it's okay."
00:09:21,00:09:22,"- Okay, yeah."
00:09:22,00:09:26,- Do you know that outdoor cats are banned in Housavi
00:09:26,00:09:29,"in Iceland, which is the town"
00:09:29,00:09:31,where they did the Eurovision movie?
00:09:31,00:09:32,"- Oh, cool. - I don't know if you remember that."
00:09:32,00:09:34,- Beautiful. - And there's actually
00:09:34,00:09:36,"a few places, also a place called Acuriri,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"where they're just about to ban them,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,and they'll be banned in 2025.
00:09:41,00:09:43,"But to try and stop that, there was a guy"
00:09:43,00:09:46,"called Snorri Admondson, and he started the cats party,"
00:09:46,00:09:48,"and in the recent local elections,"
00:09:48,00:09:50,they got 4.1% of the votes.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- That's not bad. - This is just
00:09:51,00:09:53,cat people in Iceland.
00:09:53,00:09:55,"They beat the pirate party,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"who actually, a pirate party, quite big in Iceland."
00:09:58,00:09:59,"- Yeah, they were. - Yeah, they were."
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- Like a few years ago, they were, anyway."
00:10:01,00:10:03,And a lot of the candidates for the cat party
00:10:03,00:10:06,said that they were expressly running on behalf
00:10:06,00:10:09,"of their cats, because the cats were ineligible"
00:10:09,00:10:11,to vote or run for office.
00:10:11,00:10:12,"- Oh, hey."
00:10:12,00:10:15,- I dread to think the kind of genuine bastards
00:10:15,00:10:17,"we'd have in charge if, actually,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,we voted on behalf of our cats.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"- Yeah, yeah, exactly."
00:10:21,00:10:23,I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.
00:10:23,00:10:27,"I've got a quick story about someone who doesn't like cats,"
00:10:27,00:10:31,"and that is Andrew Lloyd Webber, hang on."
00:10:31,00:10:34,Who apparently was so annoyed and so angry
00:10:34,00:10:38,"with the recent movie Cats, that after seeing the movie,"
00:10:38,00:10:39,he went out and bought a dog.
00:10:39,00:10:43,"He was just, he was so angry, right?"
00:10:43,00:10:45,"But then he fell in love with this dog,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,"and it became a really great thing,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,and that he was traveling a lot overseas.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"So anytime he got on a plane,"
00:10:49,00:10:51,"he tried to bring the dog with him,"
00:10:51,00:10:52,and the only way you can really do that
00:10:52,00:10:55,"is claim to be an emotional animal,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"like an emotional support animal, right?"
00:10:57,00:10:57,So that's what he did.
00:10:57,00:11:00,"So he said, ""I rode off and said I needed him with me"
00:11:00,00:11:02,"""at all times because I'm emotionally damaged,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"""and I must have this therapy dog."""
00:11:04,00:11:05,"He said, ""The airline rode back and said,"
00:11:05,00:11:07,"""can you prove that you really need him?"""
00:11:07,00:11:10,"He said, ""Yes, just see what Hollywood did"
00:11:10,00:11:12,"""to my musical cats."""
00:11:12,00:11:16,"And a note came back saying, ""No doctor's report required."""
00:11:16,00:11:19,(audience laughing)
00:11:19,00:11:22,(upbeat music)
00:11:22,00:11:28,"It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:11:28,00:11:32,My fact this week is that if you take 50 generations
00:11:32,00:11:35,of Confucius descendants and read out their names
00:11:35,00:11:40,"from oldest to youngest, in it it will reveal a secret poem."
00:11:40,00:11:42,- Ooh.
00:11:42,00:11:45,- So this I find really interesting.
00:11:45,00:11:46,This is the story of Confucius.
00:11:46,00:11:49,Confucius basically has the Guinness World Record
00:11:49,00:11:52,for the longest unbroken lineage.
00:11:52,00:11:55,And I happened to make friends quite recently
00:11:55,00:11:59,with the 79th generation descendant of Confucius.
00:11:59,00:12:02,He's a guy who lives in London called James Kong.
00:12:02,00:12:05,And the Guinness World Record has recognized
00:12:05,00:12:07,"that basically for thousands of years,"
00:12:07,00:12:11,the Confucius family have been charting their family tree
00:12:11,00:12:14,"so consistently, so tightly, that we know"
00:12:14,00:12:18,who everyone is inside the Confucius family.
00:12:18,00:12:20,And there's two million of them.
00:12:20,00:12:23,"So every 60 or 70 years or so,"
00:12:23,00:12:26,they update the big database of all the descendants.
00:12:26,00:12:31,"And in 2009, one book, which was broken up into 80 volumes,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,"weighing over half a ton was published,"
00:12:33,00:12:36,"having every single name of all of the descendants,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,both living and dead in there.
00:12:38,00:12:42,And James Kong is almost the closest that we get
00:12:42,00:12:45,to a direct descendant that's alive.
00:12:45,00:12:47,Now the reason that their names would reveal a poem
00:12:47,00:12:49,is there's a beautiful thing that they do in China.
00:12:49,00:12:52,"Certain families do this, which is a generational name."
00:12:52,00:12:55,And a generational name means that all the families
00:12:55,00:12:57,can know which generation a child is from
00:12:57,00:13:00,by inserting a key word into their name.
00:13:00,00:13:02,So what they do is they write a poem
00:13:02,00:13:04,and the next generation just takes the next word
00:13:04,00:13:05,in that poem.
00:13:05,00:13:07,"So you can look at that poem and you can go,"
00:13:07,00:13:10,"""This is the 79, 78, 77, 76."""
00:13:10,00:13:12,So if you're out and about and you meet someone from China
00:13:12,00:13:14,"and you also name and you hear a key word,"
00:13:14,00:13:17,"you can go, ""Oh my God, it's a descendant of Confucius."""
00:13:17,00:13:19,"- That's really cool. - Yeah, which is really awesome."
00:13:19,00:13:21,- And do we-- - You know this poem?
00:13:21,00:13:21,- Yeah.
00:13:21,00:13:24,"- Does the next generation have to make up the next line,"
00:13:24,00:13:26,like improv game or something?
00:13:26,00:13:28,"- No, yeah. - Like consequences."
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Confucian consequences. - Yeah, exactly."
00:13:29,00:13:31,- So it's a word at a time.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"As far as I know, it loops back onto itself once"
00:13:33,00:13:36,because you're not gonna have 50 generations alive at once.
00:13:36,00:13:38,So you're not gonna get confused.
00:13:38,00:13:39,- You're not gonna get confused.
00:13:39,00:13:41,- Yeah.
00:13:41,00:13:43,"- Yeah, isn't it?"
00:13:43,00:13:45,- It's a really good joke.
00:13:45,00:13:47,(audience laughing)
00:13:47,00:13:49,"What's really nice is that back in the day,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,Confucius was a very prominent person in China
00:13:52,00:13:53,"and his descendants, therefore,"
00:13:53,00:13:55,were almost like a class of their own.
00:13:55,00:13:58,"So if you knew that someone was a descendant of Confucius,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,there would be things like tax breaks
00:14:00,00:14:02,when they were buying houses or something like that.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"Yeah, and then it all went tits up"
00:14:04,00:14:06,when the Cultural Revolution happened
00:14:06,00:14:08,because Confucius then became a sign
00:14:08,00:14:11,of something that Mao Zedong and so on didn't want.
00:14:11,00:14:13,"So basically, they lost everything."
00:14:13,00:14:16,The main bloodline of Confucius had to flee to Taiwan
00:14:16,00:14:19,and it became hard times for all of them.
00:14:19,00:14:22,But now it's better again and this one family
00:14:22,00:14:24,handed the reins over to James's family.
00:14:24,00:14:26,"But when James goes back, he lives here."
00:14:26,00:14:28,He's a very normal guy.
00:14:28,00:14:29,"In China, he goes back."
00:14:29,00:14:31,It's like in coming to America
00:14:31,00:14:33,when Eddie Murphy goes back to Zemuda.
00:14:33,00:14:36,It's like everyone's bowing and kissing his feet.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"And yeah, he's a big deal back in China."
00:14:38,00:14:41,"But the thing is, if anyone has a grasp"
00:14:41,00:14:45,"of how numbers work, there are shitloads more"
00:14:45,00:14:48,"than three million descendants of Confucius out there, right?"
00:14:48,00:14:49,"I mean, I think everyone in China"
00:14:49,00:14:51,is probably directly descended from Confucius.
00:14:51,00:14:53,"But if you go back, even,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,I think we'll descend it from Genghis Khan.
00:14:55,00:14:57,So this is just people who have managed
00:14:57,00:14:59,to get the paper trail to prove it.
00:14:59,00:15:00,"- Yeah, basically, yeah."
00:15:00,00:15:03,"Wait, am I descending from Genghis Khan?"
00:15:03,00:15:04,- I think you might.
00:15:04,00:15:06,"I mean, there's a little bit of gray areas"
00:15:06,00:15:07,'cause how much immigration happened.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"We don't really know, but yeah."
00:15:09,00:15:10,- Your family never left Wimbledon
00:15:10,00:15:12,"for five million generations, did they?"
00:15:12,00:15:15,No.
00:15:15,00:15:17,And Genghis Khan didn't make it to Wimbledon.
00:15:17,00:15:18,- Imagine that.
00:15:18,00:15:20,- We'd have been furious if he'd made it.
00:15:20,00:15:21,"The lawn, the lawn, darling."
00:15:21,00:15:23,They've damaged the lawn.
00:15:23,00:15:25,I'm gonna go and say something.
00:15:25,00:15:26,I'm gonna go and say something.
00:15:26,00:15:28,(laughing)
00:15:28,00:15:29,- That's what thwarted him in the end.
00:15:29,00:15:33,He couldn't handle the British passive-aggressive attitude.
00:15:33,00:15:33,(laughing)
00:15:33,00:15:34,"- Can you imagine, though,"
00:15:34,00:15:36,"Genghis Khan, if we have a crack time travel"
00:15:36,00:15:39,and the descendant to go back to meet him is Andy.
00:15:39,00:15:41,(laughing)
00:15:41,00:15:42,"Hello, James."
00:15:42,00:15:44,- I think he'll be quietly impressed.
00:15:44,00:15:45,- Would he?
00:15:45,00:15:45,- Yeah.
00:15:45,00:15:46,- It's a warlord.
00:15:46,00:15:47,- Yeah.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"- Yeah, I think he'll say,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,"""I see, he's got soft skills, and that's important."""
00:15:50,00:15:52,(laughing)
00:15:52,00:15:53,- Famously soft skills is something
00:15:53,00:15:55,that Genghis Khan made.
00:15:55,00:15:57,(laughing)
00:15:57,00:15:58,- That's just not Confucius.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Yeah.
00:15:59,00:15:59,"- Confucius was,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,I didn't realize how unsuccessful he was in life.
00:16:03,00:16:04,He was incredible.
00:16:04,00:16:05,- Ouch.
00:16:05,00:16:07,"- He basically, he became important about 100 years later."
00:16:07,00:16:09,"During his life, he was not listened to at all."
00:16:09,00:16:12,Nobody took up his ideas for a century at least.
00:16:12,00:16:15,"And he, I'm kind of not surprised."
00:16:15,00:16:19,"This main book is, I think it's called The Analect, is it?"
00:16:19,00:16:22,"Yeah, and it's not by him, it's anecdotes about him."
00:16:22,00:16:26,So it's like fun stories about Confucius.
00:16:26,00:16:28,- And the Confucius says it's a kind of term
00:16:28,00:16:29,that came out of it.
00:16:29,00:16:29,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:16:29,00:16:33,"But he didn't charge any of his pupils,"
00:16:33,00:16:36,"or his students, and he was teaching philosophy."
00:16:36,00:16:39,All he requested from them was a symbolic bundle
00:16:39,00:16:40,of dried meat.
00:16:40,00:16:41,- Oh.
00:16:41,00:16:44,- But I can see why he's priced himself out of the market
00:16:44,00:16:46,"at the wrong end, basically."
00:16:46,00:16:47,So I think you're not going to be respected
00:16:47,00:16:49,"if you say, ""I want one pepper army,"""
00:16:49,00:16:52,and I will then tell you the secrets of the universe.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- Exactly, you would probably go"
00:16:53,00:16:55,"for the second cheapest option, wouldn't you?"
00:16:55,00:16:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:56,00:16:58,"He had 3,000 students, and only 72 managed"
00:16:58,00:17:01,to pass master all of his teaching.
00:17:01,00:17:02,"So that's quite a high bar, isn't it?"
00:17:02,00:17:03,"- Yeah, that's impressive."
00:17:03,00:17:05,"- But the Analects, there are two versions of the Analects."
00:17:05,00:17:08,"One's called the Lou version, and one's called the Chi version."
00:17:08,00:17:09,And really exciting.
00:17:09,00:17:11,"- Is the Lou version, that's the easy reading,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,"big, funny jokes in it?"
00:17:14,00:17:16,(laughing)
00:17:16,00:17:19,"- You've got five minutes, get the Lou version, yeah."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"- Well, the Chi version was long lost,"
00:17:21,00:17:24,"but really excitingly in 2015, we found the copy"
00:17:24,00:17:28,"in the tomb of Emperor Liu He, and he was one,"
00:17:28,00:17:30,"he was like a really, not a great emperor."
00:17:30,00:17:33,"He was dethroned after 27 days,"
00:17:33,00:17:37,which is the shortest reign of any of the Han emperors.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And the reason he was kicked out
00:17:39,00:17:43,"is because he was like debauchery, a terrible lifestyle."
00:17:43,00:17:45,"There was like a period of mourning,"
00:17:45,00:17:49,"and during that time, he bought a special kind of chicken"
00:17:49,00:17:51,and had lots of sex.
00:17:51,00:17:52,- With?
00:17:52,00:17:56,"- No, no, no, with concubines, with concubines."
00:17:56,00:17:59,"- It is better, it is better than chicken."
00:17:59,00:18:00,"- It's better than chicken, isn't it?"
00:18:00,00:18:01,- I do think so.
00:18:01,00:18:02,- It is better than chicken.
00:18:02,00:18:03,- And he's still thinking.
00:18:03,00:18:04,(laughing)
00:18:04,00:18:06,"- Well, anyway, he was punished by being given"
00:18:06,00:18:10,"a small fife of 2,000 families who would pay tribute to him."
00:18:10,00:18:12,"- Wait, he was punished by being given tribute?"
00:18:12,00:18:15,"- Well, he was, and his subordinates were all executed."
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- Oh, bloody hell, yeah."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"- Why was that, sorry, 'cause that does sound nice to me."
00:18:20,00:18:23,- He's going from being an emperor
00:18:23,00:18:25,to just being in charge of a couple of thousand families.
00:18:25,00:18:25,"It's like, we're gonna take off"
00:18:25,00:18:27,the main responsibility for you.
00:18:27,00:18:28,- I guess.
00:18:28,00:18:29,"- And then, it's like how if I was in charge of something"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"and then you guys demoted me,"
00:18:31,00:18:32,so I was only in charge of holding Sharpies
00:18:32,00:18:34,for after show signings.
00:18:34,00:18:38,"That would be, for example, just an example, just an example."
00:18:38,00:18:40,- Do you remember that show a couple of shows go
00:18:40,00:18:41,when we didn't have any Sharpies?
00:18:41,00:18:42,- Got the Sharpies?
00:18:42,00:18:45,"Yeah, that was awful, I'm still sorry about that."
00:18:45,00:18:48,"- He's, just when I read his story,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,I thought that we're kind of parallels
00:18:50,00:18:53,"to Tutankhamun, because in the same way"
00:18:53,00:18:56,"that Tutankhamun's grave was found, virtually intact,"
00:18:56,00:18:57,"I know there was a grave robbing,"
00:18:57,00:18:59,but it was because he was kind of wiped
00:18:59,00:19:00,"from the records, wasn't he?"
00:19:00,00:19:02,"He's sort of, no one knew to loot his."
00:19:02,00:19:03,Kind of like this guy as well.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"His tomb, where they found this Confucius reference,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,"was kind of untouched, because he was sort of"
00:19:09,00:19:12,"wiped out from history as well, yeah."
00:19:12,00:19:12,"I think so, yeah."
00:19:12,00:19:15,- So go to all the irrelevant people's tombs.
00:19:15,00:19:18,Let's go to Tim Farron's tomb and see what's there.
00:19:18,00:19:21,"- He's still alive, I don't know, he was just."
00:19:21,00:19:22,- But he might as well be dead.
00:19:22,00:19:24,I think that's what you're saying.
00:19:24,00:19:26,"I don't even know who he is, who are we talking about?"
00:19:26,00:19:28,(audience laughing)
00:19:28,00:19:29,Who is he?
00:19:29,00:19:31,"- Speaking of politics, as we were, Dan."
00:19:31,00:19:33,"- He's a politician, he's a politician."
00:19:33,00:19:34,- You're gonna say you don't know
00:19:34,00:19:35,who Joe Swinson is next?
00:19:35,00:19:39,(audience laughing)
00:19:39,00:19:40,- It's a politician.
00:19:40,00:19:42,"- They're all alive though, I feel bad."
00:19:42,00:19:43,"- Sorry, Joe, sorry."
00:19:43,00:19:46,"- All right, so speaking of politics, Confucius,"
00:19:46,00:19:48,"like Andy said, not that successful when alive,"
00:19:48,00:19:51,but he was the minister for crime.
00:19:51,00:19:53,He was basically the pretty patella of his day.
00:19:53,00:19:55,(audience laughing)
00:19:55,00:19:56,- She's a politician.
00:19:56,00:19:58,(audience laughing)
00:19:58,00:20:00,- And so he was working for a juke.
00:20:00,00:20:02,"It was like a jukedom, and he was in charge"
00:20:02,00:20:05,of sort of punishment and crime and stuff like that.
00:20:05,00:20:08,"And he fell out with the juke, apparently,"
00:20:08,00:20:12,and wandered for 12 years after he fell out with the juke.
00:20:12,00:20:13,And apparently the reason that he fell out with him
00:20:13,00:20:16,"is he was at a sacrifice, and the sacrificial meat"
00:20:16,00:20:19,"was being offered around, but he wasn't offered any."
00:20:19,00:20:22,"And so without taking off his sacrificial bonnet,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,he left the country.
00:20:24,00:20:27,- He loved meat.
00:20:27,00:20:28,(audience laughing)
00:20:28,00:20:30,"That's the main thing, I'm getting time and again."
00:20:30,00:20:32,- I've got a data point to add to this.
00:20:32,00:20:35,"When he was, so he wandered for 12, 13 years"
00:20:35,00:20:37,"trying to get people to listen to him, no one did."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"So he went back, became a politician again,"
00:20:40,00:20:42,"and he was quite successful as a politician, to be honest,"
00:20:42,00:20:43,just not spreading his ideas.
00:20:43,00:20:47,But he transformed the town that he was a counselor of.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"And the way he transformed it, I read, mainly,"
00:20:49,00:20:51,is by ending the adulteration of meat.
00:20:51,00:20:53,- Gosh.
00:20:53,00:20:54,- Wow. - He's just
00:20:54,00:20:56,"the sausage king, and he just happens to have,"
00:20:56,00:20:58,this is amazing. - Incredible.
00:20:58,00:21:00,- He once said that the main goal of life
00:21:00,00:21:03,"is to become a man of virtue, which is,"
00:21:03,00:21:04,"there's a word for that, junzi."
00:21:04,00:21:06,"I'm sure I'm pronouncing it wrong, but it is about education,"
00:21:06,00:21:09,"it's about compassion, it's about observing ritual."
00:21:09,00:21:11,"But if you don't succeed, that is also a chance"
00:21:11,00:21:13,to gain virtue.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"And he said, ""Is not a junzi one who stays unruffled,"
00:21:16,00:21:18,"""though men ignore him?"""
00:21:18,00:21:21,(audience laughs)
00:21:21,00:21:23,"- Anyway, I've got another fact over here."
00:21:23,00:21:26,(audience laughs)
00:21:26,00:21:31,- It's a blessed moment.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- If you compare him to what other people in, let's say,"
00:21:33,00:21:36,"Europe were doing at this time and saying,"
00:21:36,00:21:38,"basically philosophers were, they were quite pro-war,"
00:21:38,00:21:41,"they're pro-pride, they're pro-patriotism or your city,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,there wasn't much chat about compassion and kindness
00:21:44,00:21:47,"and generosity, and he was much more about all of that,"
00:21:47,00:21:50,"which was about 2,000 years ahead of where anyone else was."
00:21:50,00:21:53,"He was quite crap on women, which is a slightly annoying"
00:21:53,00:21:54,thing about him. - Yes.
00:21:54,00:21:59,"- He did think that they were like a different species,"
00:21:59,00:22:02,"really, or not, like a different social class."
00:22:02,00:22:05,"There was one moment where he met a leader who said,"
00:22:05,00:22:08,"""I've got 10 very good ministers working for me,"""
00:22:08,00:22:10,"and Confucius looked at them and went,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,"""Well, one of them is a woman, so you've only got nine."""
00:22:12,00:22:15,"But look, I know."
00:22:15,00:22:17,"- Confucius canceled 2,500 years later."
00:22:17,00:22:19,(audience laughs)
00:22:19,00:22:20,- We all made mistakes.
00:22:20,00:22:23,"- I've just got some stuff on family trees,"
00:22:23,00:22:24,"if you wanna hear me. - Yeah, yeah."
00:22:24,00:22:26,"- So a couple of very long family trees,"
00:22:26,00:22:30,"possibly almost records compared to Confucius,"
00:22:30,00:22:33,"the Lurie family, some people think that's the longest"
00:22:33,00:22:35,"in the world, according to Dr. Neil Rosenstein,"
00:22:35,00:22:38,"who wrote a book about it, they can trace their lineage"
00:22:38,00:22:40,all the way back to the Biblical king David.
00:22:40,00:22:42,- Ooh. - Okay.
00:22:42,00:22:45,"But in the Bible, it says that David was begat by Jesse,"
00:22:45,00:22:47,"who was begat by Obed, and their booze,"
00:22:47,00:22:49,"and their salmon, and their nascent,"
00:22:49,00:22:51,"so I don't know why they stopped there,"
00:22:51,00:22:52,'cause we know who came before them.
00:22:52,00:22:54,"- Oh, I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:54,00:22:56,- And then the only other family that could be around
00:22:56,00:22:57,"the same is the House of Solomon,"
00:22:57,00:23:00,and they claim to go back to the Queen of Sheba.
00:23:00,00:23:03,"That's the Imperial family of Ethiopia,"
00:23:03,00:23:05,and we know who the latest on that line is.
00:23:05,00:23:07,"It's someone called Zira Yakob,"
00:23:07,00:23:10,"who was the second African to ever go to Eaton College,"
00:23:10,00:23:11,"who ever go to Eaton College,"
00:23:11,00:23:14,"and in the '90s, at the last time I could find him,"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"he was living in the Rastafarian community in Manchester,"
00:23:17,00:23:19,"and according to the legend,"
00:23:19,00:23:22,"his family looks after the Ark of the Covenant,"
00:23:22,00:23:26,so Indiana Jones could have just gone to Russia.
00:23:26,00:23:29,(laughing)
00:23:29,00:23:33,- What a downer that movie would have been in.
00:23:33,00:23:34,(laughing)
00:23:34,00:23:35,"- All right, you're coming over there,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,looking for your Ark of the Covenant.
00:23:37,00:23:39,(laughing)
00:23:39,00:23:40,"I love you, mate."
00:23:40,00:23:44,(upbeat music)
00:23:44,00:23:49,"- All right, look, I need to move us on to our next fact."
00:23:49,00:23:51,"It is time for fact number three,"
00:23:51,00:23:53,and that is Andy.
00:23:53,00:23:56,- My fact is that there is a two-headed tortoise
00:23:56,00:23:59,in Switzerland whose two heads prefer different foods.
00:23:59,00:24:01,(laughing)
00:24:01,00:24:03,- And here he is.
00:24:04,00:24:06,"- So people at home, their pictures just come up"
00:24:06,00:24:07,on the screen.
00:24:07,00:24:09,"- Yeah, Andy didn't have them in his pocket."
00:24:09,00:24:11,(laughing)
00:24:11,00:24:13,"- Yeah, Janus is his name,"
00:24:13,00:24:17,"named after the old god with two faces,"
00:24:17,00:24:18,"that's facing different ways,"
00:24:18,00:24:20,and he's 25 years old.
00:24:20,00:24:22,He's just turned 25.
00:24:22,00:24:26,"He was born in, and still lives in Geneva,"
00:24:26,00:24:27,'cause he's quite slow-moving
00:24:27,00:24:29,and he hasn't managed to leave yet.
00:24:29,00:24:31,- Hopefully in about 50 years he'll be in Zurich.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:24:33,00:24:34,"This is all from a great piece,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,"just about a million other times, by the way."
00:24:35,00:24:38,"And he lives in the Natural History Museum,"
00:24:38,00:24:41,and he sounds like a great guy.
00:24:41,00:24:44,"I mean, he really, he has a wonderful life."
00:24:44,00:24:45,He has--
00:24:45,00:24:46,- Can I just ask?
00:24:46,00:24:48,"With it being two heads, should you not say ""they"""
00:24:48,00:24:50,"rather than ""he""?"
00:24:50,00:24:51,"- I agree, they need two names,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,like Janus one and Janus two maybe.
00:24:53,00:24:54,- Yeah.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"- Okay, well, just rip up these notes then."
00:24:57,00:24:59,(laughing)
00:24:59,00:25:01,"Well, they, no, you're right,"
00:25:01,00:25:03,"'cause they have different personalities,"
00:25:03,00:25:04,"and you're right, yeah, yeah, all right."
00:25:04,00:25:06,"Well, anyway, between them,"
00:25:06,00:25:08,"these two little guys, who share a shell,"
00:25:08,00:25:12,"they have a skateboard, which I love."
00:25:12,00:25:14,- Today! - Yeah.
00:25:14,00:25:14,Isn't that cool?
00:25:14,00:25:15,- That is really cool.
00:25:15,00:25:17,"- Did they, someone gave them that, right?"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"They didn't go out to make their way to the shop,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,didn't they?
00:25:20,00:25:20,- They didn't made it themselves?
00:25:20,00:25:22,"- Yeah, he or they get a valium rubbed"
00:25:22,00:25:24,on their heads every day.
00:25:24,00:25:25,- What?
00:25:25,00:25:26,That's nice. - Vaseline.
00:25:26,00:25:27,"- Oh, yeah."
00:25:27,00:25:30,(laughing)
00:25:30,00:25:31,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"- Oh my God, you do not want to get those two mixed up."
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- So, I've got valium here,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,but I think I just wrote that
00:25:40,00:25:41,as a kind of wishful film and thing.
00:25:41,00:25:43,(laughing)
00:25:43,00:25:45,- They have Vaseline because their heads
00:25:45,00:25:47,bump into each other too much.
00:25:47,00:25:49,"- And why would valium prevent chafing,"
00:25:49,00:25:52,as I've also put in the notes?
00:25:52,00:25:54,"This is why you're always in so much pain, I've been telling you."
00:25:54,00:25:57,(laughing)
00:25:57,00:25:59,"I'm depressed, but I'm incredibly smooth."
00:25:59,00:26:02,(laughing)
00:26:02,00:26:05,"- Yeah, and also, he does have a lot of,"
00:26:05,00:26:06,or they both have a lot of issues
00:26:06,00:26:08,in terms of general lifestyle.
00:26:08,00:26:09,"So, they're 25 years old."
00:26:09,00:26:11,These tortoises can live for quite a long time.
00:26:11,00:26:14,"If they were in the wild, they'd probably be dead by now."
00:26:14,00:26:16,"One of the ways that tortoises, as we know,"
00:26:16,00:26:18,"survive in the wild is if a predator comes in,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,they can back up into their shell.
00:26:20,00:26:23,But there's only space for one of the heads to go back in.
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Which would just leave the other one hanging out, yeah."
00:26:25,00:26:27,"- Unfortunately, he's got a skateboard,"
00:26:27,00:26:29,so he can make good his exit.
00:26:29,00:26:32,"- I was just thinking, maybe if they cover him in Vaseline,"
00:26:32,00:26:33,he might be able to slip in there.
00:26:33,00:26:35,(laughing)
00:26:35,00:26:39,"- They chuck valium at the predator, they might be able to."
00:26:39,00:26:41,"- Well, he's, this is a mutation, right?"
00:26:41,00:26:43,Where you have two heads instead of one.
00:26:43,00:26:45,"If it's a mutation, then that means,"
00:26:45,00:26:46,"'cause he's 25 years old now, it means we have all missed"
00:26:46,00:26:50,the time when there was a genuine teenage mutant hero
00:26:50,00:26:54,tortoise owning a skateboard.
00:26:54,00:26:54,"- Oh my God, yes."
00:26:54,00:26:57,"- No, anyway, he was 25, so he's now a mid-20s."
00:26:57,00:26:58,(laughing)
00:26:58,00:27:00,"- He's a bit old for a skateboard, really, 25, isn't he?"
00:27:00,00:27:01,"- Yes, definitely, yeah, yeah."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"- On the skateboard, it's not putting one foot down"
00:27:04,00:27:05,"to propel itself, right?"
00:27:05,00:27:06,It's just someone's pushing it.
00:27:06,00:27:08,"- I think his helpers are pushing him around, yeah."
00:27:08,00:27:11,"- Yeah, 'cause I visited the embalmed body"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"of Jeremy Bentham, and they said,"
00:27:13,00:27:15,"oh, he's got a skateboard, and I saw the skateboard."
00:27:15,00:27:17,"It's not a skateboard, so."
00:27:17,00:27:19,"- Hang on, I mean, he's definitely not riding"
00:27:19,00:27:21,"that skateboard, why has he even got that?"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"- Oh, 'cause when he rides out of his box"
00:27:23,00:27:24,"to get vacuumed each year,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,they need to get him across.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- But actually, doesn't he have two heads?"
00:27:28,00:27:29,Jeremy Bentham.
00:27:29,00:27:29,- He does have two heads?
00:27:29,00:27:30,- He does have two heads?
00:27:30,00:27:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:31,00:27:33,"- He has, like, his real head is hidden away,"
00:27:33,00:27:34,"and he's got, like, a fake head."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"- The white sort of a wax head, 'cause, wow."
00:27:36,00:27:38,"- Oh my God, we've blown this right open."
00:27:38,00:27:39,- Yeah.
00:27:39,00:27:40,- Two-headed tortoise.
00:27:40,00:27:41,- Jeremy Bentham is a tortoise?
00:27:41,00:27:43,(laughing)
00:27:43,00:27:47,"- And so what, they just skate him out to Hoover him?"
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- Yeah, when transporting him,"
00:27:48,00:27:50,they put him on what they call a skateboard.
00:27:50,00:27:51,I imagine it's the same with--
00:27:51,00:27:53,"- To be honest, I didn't know that they Hoovered"
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Jeremy Bentham once a year, as in, that's--"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"- We've mentioned that in the show, I think, yeah, yeah."
00:27:57,00:28:00,"They have a little vacuum and they Hoover him, yeah, yeah."
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Anyway, tortoises."
00:28:01,00:28:03,(laughing)
00:28:03,00:28:06,"So, yeah, so Janice is a tortoise,"
00:28:06,00:28:07,"and it is quite rare, but if you go online,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,you can see lots of tortoises that have two heads.
00:28:10,00:28:13,- Probably the second most common animal to have two heads.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"I think snakes are slightly more common,"
00:28:15,00:28:17,"but yeah, if you're gonna get any animal with two heads,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,"if it's not a snake, it's probably a tortoise."
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- Snake's all over the place,"
00:28:20,00:28:24,"by Kefley, as it's called, one in 100,000 snakes."
00:28:24,00:28:25,That's loads. - Yeah.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"- And, again, they never really lived that long"
00:28:28,00:28:30,"unless they're in captivity,"
00:28:30,00:28:31,"because, partly because of this whole,"
00:28:31,00:28:32,the heads argue with each other thing.
00:28:32,00:28:35,"So, in snakes, it's a serious problem."
00:28:35,00:28:38,"If they, like, one head will fight with the other for food,"
00:28:38,00:28:40,"and they'll end up, kind of, no one gets it,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,and they'll exhaust so much energy fighting
00:28:41,00:28:44,with each other that they starve to death.
00:28:44,00:28:46,"- And what's crazy is, it goes into the one stomach."
00:28:46,00:28:47,"- Well, it depends."
00:28:47,00:28:49,"Some of them have two, some of them have one, but yeah."
00:28:49,00:28:50,"But the ones that have one, yeah,"
00:28:50,00:28:53,"exactly the two heads will be fighting, not knowing,"
00:28:53,00:28:56,never having studied anatomy and realising.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"- So sad, 'cause it feels like they could,"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"lady in the tramp, all their meals."
00:29:00,00:29:02,- Yeah.
00:29:02,00:29:02,- And that would be very charming.
00:29:02,00:29:05,"- But I know, 'cause I think that is incest, isn't it?"
00:29:05,00:29:05,Definitely.
00:29:05,00:29:10,- I think something else has to happen for incest.
00:29:10,00:29:11,- Really?
00:29:11,00:29:12,- It's not.
00:29:12,00:29:13,"- Yeah, that is hard."
00:29:13,00:29:15,"- Yeah, but the thing about that is--"
00:29:15,00:29:17,"- Wait, just kissing is not incest?"
00:29:17,00:29:20,- Dad's interested suddenly.
00:29:20,00:29:21,(audience laughing)
00:29:21,00:29:25,"- We've found a very interesting philosophical question,"
00:29:25,00:29:28,"which is, if a two-headed snake has a wank, is it incest?"
00:29:28,00:29:30,(audience laughing)
00:29:30,00:29:32,- What is it using to have a wank?
00:29:32,00:29:34,(audience laughing)
00:29:34,00:29:36,"- That's plenty of tail there, I think."
00:29:36,00:29:37,Could do the job.
00:29:37,00:29:38,"- Oh, puts the tail, oh god."
00:29:38,00:29:39,- Yeah.
00:29:39,00:29:40,(audience laughing)
00:29:40,00:29:41,- The other thing we have these snakes--
00:29:41,00:29:42,- Do they have dicks?
00:29:42,00:29:43,"We need to take it to the dick vet to find out, I guess."
00:29:43,00:29:45,(audience laughing)
00:29:45,00:29:48,"- So, snakes, tots, there's Tasmanians"
00:29:48,00:29:50,with the other people with two heads.
00:29:50,00:29:51,(audience laughing)
00:29:51,00:29:53,Commonly.
00:29:53,00:29:55,"Apparently, there's a thing."
00:29:55,00:29:57,"In the olden days, there's a thing in Australia"
00:29:57,00:29:58,that all Tasmanians had two heads.
00:29:58,00:29:59,- Really?
00:29:59,00:30:03,- And the reason being that they had a problem
00:30:03,00:30:05,with a deficiency of iodine.
00:30:05,00:30:06,And so it would often have goiters.
00:30:06,00:30:08,So people in Tasmania would often have goiters.
00:30:08,00:30:09,- What is a goiters?
00:30:09,00:30:12,"- So a goiter is like a, it's a growth on your neck."
00:30:12,00:30:13,"And it can get really big,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,and it can almost look like a second head.
00:30:15,00:30:16,"But actually, what would happen is,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"they would have some surgery,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,and so they would have like a scar on their neck.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"And then during the war,"
00:30:22,00:30:24,a lot of Tasmanians would go to the front line
00:30:24,00:30:26,"and they'd meet Australians and they'd say,"
00:30:26,00:30:27,"""Well, where's your other head?"""
00:30:27,00:30:29,"'Cause they saw a scar, thought that a head had grown there."
00:30:29,00:30:30,- I used to-
00:30:30,00:30:32,"- I believe these days, it's not so common"
00:30:32,00:30:34,to be iodine deficient in Tasmania.
00:30:34,00:30:35,- Cool.
00:30:35,00:30:36,- And it probably wasn't a hundred percent.
00:30:36,00:30:37,"But I do think the ones that did it,"
00:30:37,00:30:39,"'cause they are Aussie, so they've got a sense of humor."
00:30:39,00:30:41,I assume they drew a face on their goiters.
00:30:41,00:30:42,(audience laughing)
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- Good point, yeah."
00:30:43,00:30:44,- Went around freaking everyone out.
00:30:44,00:30:45,"- Good eye, mate."
00:30:45,00:30:46,(laughing)
00:30:46,00:30:47,- That's true.
00:30:47,00:30:50,"- There's a, I found this through a QI, actually."
00:30:50,00:30:54,"In 2019, a two-headed rattlesnake called Double Dave"
00:30:54,00:30:55,was born.
00:30:55,00:30:59,Do you know why he's called Double Dave?
00:30:59,00:31:01,- 'Cause it's got two heads.
00:31:01,00:31:02,(audience laughing)
00:31:02,00:31:05,"- No, he was found by two scientists called Dave."
00:31:05,00:31:08,(audience laughing)
00:31:08,00:31:12,- That's amazing.
00:31:12,00:31:13,"- You know, Nicholas Cage?"
00:31:13,00:31:14,- No.
00:31:14,00:31:15,- Who's that?
00:31:16,00:31:18,- He was Min Campbell's predecessor
00:31:18,00:31:19,as leader of the Lib Dems.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"No, he was, Nick Cage, he once spent $80,000"
00:31:22,00:31:25,"on a two-headed snake, because he'd had a dream."
00:31:25,00:31:29,"He dreamed of a two-headed eagle, which you can't get."
00:31:29,00:31:29,And so...
00:31:29,00:31:31,(audience laughing)
00:31:31,00:31:34,"- So he went on eBay, it's a two-headed eagle."
00:31:34,00:31:34,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:31:34,00:31:35,- And this is why it came up.
00:31:35,00:31:37,"- Yeah, weirdly, you can't get a two-headed eagle,"
00:31:37,00:31:38,"as in no one's ever seen a two-headed eagle,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"even though it's the symbol of loads of countries,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,"and it's a big thing, and that just doesn't happen"
00:31:42,00:31:43,as far as we know.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Anyway, and he got so freaked out"
00:31:45,00:31:47,"that he gave it away to a museum,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,"'cause they fought, and he said,"
00:31:49,00:31:50,"""I had to put a spatula between the two heads"
00:31:50,00:31:51,"""to feed them."""
00:31:51,00:31:53,(audience laughing)
00:31:53,00:31:56,- Is that where he got the idea for face-off?
00:31:56,00:31:58,(audience gasping)
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- It's quite a different plot, but they're..."
00:32:00,00:32:02,(audience laughing)
00:32:02,00:32:03,"- But you know, once these Hollywood types"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"rework a script, they re-write it."
00:32:05,00:32:07,"- Yeah, it's very different."
00:32:07,00:32:09,- I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.
00:32:09,00:32:10,- What?
00:32:10,00:32:13,"- So you can get Janus Katz, Katz with two faces,"
00:32:13,00:32:16,"which I think is the correct use of the term Janus,"
00:32:16,00:32:19,"'cause Janus had two faces, not two heads."
00:32:19,00:32:21,"So I actually think that their tortoise here,"
00:32:21,00:32:22,they fucked up.
00:32:22,00:32:23,- Miss Noma.
00:32:23,00:32:24,(audience laughing)
00:32:24,00:32:26,"- Well, it does have two faces as well, in fairness."
00:32:26,00:32:27,- Yeah.
00:32:27,00:32:28,"- Okay, it does have two faces."
00:32:28,00:32:30,"You're right, but it's not how you'd describe it, is it?"
00:32:30,00:32:32,If you were saying that tortoise has got two...
00:32:32,00:32:34,- He can't look forward into one year
00:32:34,00:32:35,and look back into another year.
00:32:35,00:32:36,- Exactly.
00:32:36,00:32:38,That would be so shit if you had a two-faced tortoise
00:32:38,00:32:39,and one of the faces just looked backwards
00:32:39,00:32:40,into your shell the whole time.
00:32:40,00:32:42,(audience laughing)
00:32:42,00:32:44,"- Janus and Anus, I guess."
00:32:44,00:32:47,(audience laughing)
00:32:47,00:32:50,"- Hey, how 'bout us?"
00:32:50,00:32:51,"- Well, that's just Anus."
00:32:51,00:32:54,(audience laughing)
00:32:54,00:32:55,"Lovely lipstick, Anus."
00:32:55,00:32:58,(upbeat music)
00:32:58,00:33:03,"- It is time for a final fact of the show,"
00:33:03,00:33:05,and that is Janus.
00:33:05,00:33:08,"- Okay, my fact this week is that Jagermeister"
00:33:08,00:33:11,was originally drunk to stop people from feeling sick.
00:33:11,00:33:14,(audience laughing)
00:33:14,00:33:18,- How many do you have to have?
00:33:18,00:33:19,- It's about 12.
00:33:19,00:33:20,- Okay.
00:33:20,00:33:24,"- So no, it was originally a digestif."
00:33:24,00:33:28,"And in fact, some Germans still call it liver glue."
00:33:28,00:33:30,And the idea is that you would take it after a large meal
00:33:30,00:33:32,and it would settle your stomach.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"And it was always taken at room temperature,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,and that was the only reason you would have it.
00:33:37,00:33:40,And it was invented by a guy called Karl Maast.
00:33:40,00:33:41,"And it was his nephew, Gunter,"
00:33:41,00:33:43,who came up with the idea that you could take it cold
00:33:43,00:33:47,and have it as a social drink and get hammered with it.
00:33:47,00:33:49,- I hadn't thought of it as something you had cold.
00:33:49,00:33:50,"Just whenever you have Jagermeister,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,you are so unaware of the temperature of the drink.
00:33:53,00:33:55,(audience laughing)
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- Excuse me, can I set back this Jagermeister, please?"
00:33:57,00:33:59,It's a few degrees off.
00:33:59,00:34:00,(audience laughing)
00:34:00,00:34:01,- I think it's corked.
00:34:01,00:34:04,(audience laughing)
00:34:04,00:34:08,"But yeah, Jagermeister, invented in Germany"
00:34:08,00:34:10,by this guy called Kurt Maast.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"He was a son of a vinegar maker,"
00:34:12,00:34:14,and he decided he would go into liquor.
00:34:14,00:34:17,So he invented loads of types of drinks.
00:34:17,00:34:20,Burning Love was his biggest one
00:34:20,00:34:25,until he came up with this 56 herb recipe for the Jagermeister.
00:34:25,00:34:27,- Do we believe the 56 herbs in?
00:34:27,00:34:30,'Cause they sort of are open about 10 of the herbs.
00:34:30,00:34:32,"But then they claim that it's definitely 56,"
00:34:32,00:34:34,but the rest are all secret.
00:34:34,00:34:35,"- And it's secret, isn't it?"
00:34:35,00:34:37,- They've got a chief bartender.
00:34:37,00:34:39,He's called the Brandmeister at the moment.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"His name is Willie Shine, and he says that he,"
00:34:42,00:34:44,"come on, grow up, guys."
00:34:44,00:34:46,(audience laughing)
00:34:46,00:34:49,"He says, Willie Shine says he is legally only allowed"
00:34:49,00:34:52,to discuss 11 of the 56 ingredients.
00:34:52,00:34:53,"- Wow, I know."
00:34:53,00:34:55,- So does that mean if you ever talked to him
00:34:55,00:34:57,"about licorice or something, he's like,"
00:34:57,00:34:59,you can't say anything?
00:34:59,00:35:00,"- Yeah, he's like a one-man guess who,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,"but instead of guessing a person,"
00:35:02,00:35:03,you're guessing ingredients again.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"- Isn't it amazing, though?"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"'Cause I know, I guess back in the day,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,Coca-Cola has the secret ingredient.
00:35:08,00:35:11,"KFC, you know, the secret ingredient."
00:35:11,00:35:14,"Like, these days, are you allowed to get away"
00:35:14,00:35:16,just saying there's a magical something in there?
00:35:16,00:35:17,"No, I don't think you're allowed to."
00:35:17,00:35:20,"- No, I'm gonna not allergy a secret ingredient?"
00:35:20,00:35:21,Get the fuck out!
00:35:21,00:35:23,(audience laughing)
00:35:23,00:35:24,"- But it's still allowed, right?"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"- Yeah, it's still allowed."
00:35:25,00:35:27,"I guess, maybe alcoholic drinks seem to be a loophole."
00:35:27,00:35:29,I've never looked the back of a bottle of--
00:35:29,00:35:32,- No one has ever read the back of a bottle of Jägermeister.
00:35:32,00:35:33,(audience laughing)
00:35:33,00:35:35,"- Yeah, it was quite sort of a stiff,"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"like a drink for kind of stiff types, wasn't it?"
00:35:38,00:35:40,Before it was loosened up.
00:35:40,00:35:44,It was basically well-to-do German people who drunk it.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"And then, I think it was in the 1970s,"
00:35:46,00:35:48,"there was a businessman called Sidney Frank,"
00:35:48,00:35:51,who realized in America that the only people
00:35:51,00:35:53,drinking this thing were these well-to-do German
00:35:53,00:35:54,kind of immigrants.
00:35:54,00:35:55,"And for some reason thought,"
00:35:55,00:35:57,"""I reckon I can make this huge."""
00:35:57,00:35:59,And he completely transformed its reputation.
00:35:59,00:36:01,He hired a lot of Jägerets.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"And Jäger dudes, I think, came later."
00:36:03,00:36:05,Jägerets are scantily clad women
00:36:05,00:36:07,who tend to be just rolled out
00:36:07,00:36:11,whenever you need to sell anything in life.
00:36:11,00:36:14,But he sent sort of a scantily clad Jägerets
00:36:14,00:36:17,around the bars of the U.S.
00:36:17,00:36:18,And it went huge.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"- Yeah, and one of the things that he did"
00:36:19,00:36:23,was kind of spread rumors about Jägermeister.
00:36:23,00:36:27,"So there had actually been a guy who had been up,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"I think for attempted murder or something,"
00:36:29,00:36:31,and he said that he'd had something
00:36:31,00:36:33,"called liquid valium, actually."
00:36:33,00:36:36,"- Stop it, he actually had solid vaseline."
00:36:36,00:36:38,- It was solid vaseline.
00:36:38,00:36:41,"But then later on, a bar in New Orleans"
00:36:41,00:36:43,started selling this Jägermeister
00:36:43,00:36:47,as if it was called liquid valium as a publicity thing.
00:36:47,00:36:49,So it was like maybe it had caused this murder
00:36:49,00:36:51,or this attempted murder.
00:36:51,00:36:53,"- Sorry, just on the Jägerets thing very quickly"
00:36:53,00:36:54,before we move on from there.
00:36:54,00:36:56,I was once in a bar in Budapest
00:36:56,00:36:57,"and someone came around,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,"sort of young woman came around who was,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"she was like a kind of Jägeret,"
00:37:02,00:37:03,but she wasn't selling shots of alcohol.
00:37:03,00:37:05,She was selling carrots.
00:37:05,00:37:07,- And really?
00:37:07,00:37:08,- And I've got one.
00:37:08,00:37:10,"- And it was like, it was like a quid for a carrot,"
00:37:10,00:37:12,"which in the supermarket,"
00:37:12,00:37:13,"I know which in the supermarket is crazy,"
00:37:13,00:37:14,"but next to a glass of wine,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"you think that's a good, that's an investment,"
00:37:16,00:37:17,isn't that reasonable?
00:37:17,00:37:18,"- Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:37:18,00:37:20,"- And I swear to God, that was the best carrot"
00:37:20,00:37:20,I had ever eaten.
00:37:20,00:37:22,"It was like, it was about a foot long."
00:37:22,00:37:25,"It was clean, it was crunchy."
00:37:25,00:37:26,- Was it shaved?
00:37:26,00:37:29,"- It had been, it was shaved or peeled, as we call it."
00:37:29,00:37:32,(audience laughing)
00:37:32,00:37:33,"- Oh yeah, that's the weird one."
00:37:33,00:37:35,- You better quid for a carrot.
00:37:35,00:37:36,- I don't regret it for a second.
00:37:36,00:37:38,"And I looked around the back,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,every other man in the room had also just standing there
00:37:40,00:37:41,with a carrot.
00:37:41,00:37:44,- Wow.
00:37:44,00:37:45,"Genuine, I've never seen this in any other bowl"
00:37:45,00:37:47,or any other country or anything like that.
00:37:47,00:37:48,- That's because it was one-off.
00:37:48,00:37:49,I have no question in my mind
00:37:49,00:37:51,that you were part of a scientific study
00:37:51,00:37:54,"setting out to prove that men are so stupid,"
00:37:54,00:37:56,they will literally buy anything at any price
00:37:56,00:37:58,if an attractive woman sells it to them.
00:37:58,00:38:01,(audience cheering)
00:38:02,00:38:04,- Unbelievable.
00:38:04,00:38:04,- So what?
00:38:04,00:38:07,So what?
00:38:07,00:38:08,Apparently I'm also a mug
00:38:08,00:38:10,when the Sprout Girl came around a couple of minutes later.
00:38:10,00:38:11,(audience laughing)
00:38:11,00:38:13,That was a fucking lovely Sprout.
00:38:13,00:38:14,It only cost a fiver.
00:38:14,00:38:17,(audience laughing)
00:38:17,00:38:23,"Jägermeister, the word itself is, it means master hunter."
00:38:23,00:38:25,"And it's really interesting, the story."
00:38:25,00:38:27,"So if you look at a Jägermeister bottle,"
00:38:27,00:38:28,you'll see there's a stag on it.
00:38:28,00:38:32,"And in between, there's a Christian cross"
00:38:32,00:38:33,"going across it, the crucifix is there."
00:38:33,00:38:36,And sometimes it's depicted when you see pictures
00:38:36,00:38:38,of where he took this idea from
00:38:38,00:38:40,with Jesus on the cross itself.
00:38:40,00:38:41,And what it was was it was a guy
00:38:41,00:38:44,"who eventually became a saint, Saint Hubertus."
00:38:44,00:38:46,He was out and he was hunting
00:38:46,00:38:48,and he suddenly saw a stag come around the corner.
00:38:48,00:38:49,"He was meant to be in church, but he wasn't."
00:38:49,00:38:51,And he saw a stag come around the corner
00:38:51,00:38:54,"and the stag had a sort of crucifix, just a cross,"
00:38:54,00:38:57,"in between, glowing through its horns."
00:38:57,00:39:02,"And he had this sudden conversation with this stag,"
00:39:02,00:39:04,"where the stag was like, dude, what are you doing?"
00:39:04,00:39:08,I was thinking of the Jäger dudes there.
00:39:08,00:39:10,I assume that's how they talk.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"Where he basically said,"
00:39:12,00:39:14,you need to be more ethical in your hunting.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"You need to make sure that if you're gonna kill a stag,"
00:39:16,00:39:18,it's one that's older or maybe sickly.
00:39:18,00:39:19,"I would do it, you know."
00:39:19,00:39:21,And he sort of introduced ethicalness into it.
00:39:21,00:39:24,"So he became a saint, Saint Hubertus."
00:39:24,00:39:27,"He's the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians,"
00:39:27,00:39:30,"opticians, chicken roasters."
00:39:30,00:39:33,"I couldn't, could you find any evidence of the chicken roasters?"
00:39:33,00:39:36,'Cause I just couldn't find any evidence of where that came from.
00:39:36,00:39:37,"It's a bit left field, isn't it?"
00:39:37,00:39:39,"It's sort of just, it was left over and they weren't like us."
00:39:39,00:39:41,What is a chicken roaster? It's not even a thing.
00:39:41,00:39:42,"But rotisserie, you see,"
00:39:42,00:39:44,"something that's used as a counter at the supermarket,"
00:39:44,00:39:45,which has a rotisserie.
00:39:45,00:39:47,"You just always thought, if you're a saint in the chicken roasters,"
00:39:47,00:39:49,you'll be a saint of just all the meat roasters.
00:39:49,00:39:53,"No, Andy once paid 20 euros for a rotisserie chicken."
00:39:53,00:39:55,"That was an error, yeah."
00:39:55,00:39:57,Another thing that he did was cured rabies.
00:39:57,00:40:00,"Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah."
00:40:00,00:40:03,"What just sort of, what, people are animals,"
00:40:03,00:40:05,'cause both can get it.
00:40:05,00:40:07,Both can be cured by Saint Hubertus.
00:40:07,00:40:08,"Oh, great."
00:40:08,00:40:10,"Saint Hubertus' key,"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"which is a key that I think priests would keep them, wouldn't they?"
00:40:13,00:40:15,And sometimes normal shops would have us in Hubertus' key.
00:40:15,00:40:18,"And you would, it was like an iron bar and you heat it up."
00:40:18,00:40:21,"It's like a defibrillator in a, you know..."
00:40:21,00:40:23,"It's exactly like that, yeah."
00:40:23,00:40:24,The effect of what you were doing was
00:40:24,00:40:28,you were heating up the key and you were branding the person with the key.
00:40:28,00:40:31,"So if they were bitten by a dog that might have rabies,"
00:40:31,00:40:33,"you would immediately heat up the key, put it on."
00:40:33,00:40:37,And the idea is that the burning would sterilise your...
00:40:37,00:40:39,"Well, I think the idea was that it was a magic key."
00:40:39,00:40:43,"Yeah, the idea was that it turns out that actually it might have worked"
00:40:43,00:40:46,"because of the sterilisation of the heat, it's possible."
00:40:46,00:40:48,"And you would have cauterised the wounds,"
00:40:48,00:40:51,"so no bacteria could have got in, so it might have worked slightly."
00:40:51,00:40:52,They got lucky.
00:40:52,00:40:56,"It's always one in 1,000 of these bullshit magical cures happen to also work."
00:40:56,00:40:57,Yeah.
00:40:57,00:40:59,"Um, Jägermeister, back to that."
00:40:59,00:41:00,Yeah.
00:41:00,00:41:03,Jägermeister do not like Jägerbombs.
00:41:03,00:41:04,Yeah.
00:41:04,00:41:05,Who does?
00:41:05,00:41:07,"Just for the streamers, there was a gasp in the room."
00:41:07,00:41:09,They can't believe it.
00:41:09,00:41:11,So Jägerbombs is a Jägermeister from Red Bull
00:41:11,00:41:13,and you drop one in the other and it's great.
00:41:13,00:41:16,And so they didn't invent it.
00:41:16,00:41:19,And I think they have slightly distanced themselves from it.
00:41:19,00:41:22,"The Jägermeister firm, they say they have to promote responsible drinking"
00:41:22,00:41:24,"and the marketing director, who's a woman called Nicole Goodwin,"
00:41:24,00:41:28,"she said, ""You will never see us actively support or promote Jägerbombs."
00:41:28,00:41:30,"That's very much driven by our customers."""
00:41:30,00:41:32,And they recommend you have it with ginger beer.
00:41:32,00:41:33,And a carrot.
00:41:33,00:41:35,And a nice...
00:41:35,00:41:37,"They've signed up to the apartment group, haven't they?"
00:41:37,00:41:40,The apartment group is a thing that encourages responsible drinking
00:41:40,00:41:44,"that a lot of, sort of, alcohol companies sign up for."
00:41:44,00:41:47,But they have admitted that it's helped.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"So they don't like it, but, you know, they're not going to stop you from doing it, I think."
00:41:51,00:41:51,"Yeah, right."
00:41:51,00:41:56,"So I mentioned Gunther Elio, who was a nephew of Karl Maast."
00:41:56,00:42:00,"And he, in the '70s, came up with an advertising campaign, which was one for all."
00:42:00,00:42:04,"So like Hannah said, it was quite an upper-class kind of German drink."
00:42:04,00:42:07,But he wanted to get normal Germans drinking it.
00:42:07,00:42:11,So the idea was it would be a poster and you would have a normal German
00:42:11,00:42:15,"and they would just look like it could be a man, a woman, a young girl, or anything."
00:42:15,00:42:17,But it'd be completely unknown.
00:42:17,00:42:20,"And they would say, ""I drink Jägermeister because."""
00:42:20,00:42:22,And then it would give an excuse.
00:42:22,00:42:23,So...
00:42:23,00:42:25,A reason?
00:42:25,00:42:26,"Reason, yeah."
00:42:26,00:42:27,"An excuse is a bit different, Lee."
00:42:27,00:42:30,An excuse is what you have to say the next morning.
00:42:30,00:42:32,"I drank all that Jägermeister because, yeah."
00:42:32,00:42:36,"Well, for instance, I drink Jägermeister because, as a teacher,"
00:42:36,00:42:38,I have to go to school my whole life.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"Oh, that was one of them."
00:42:40,00:42:41,That's so good.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Yeah.
00:42:42,00:42:47,"One of them was, ""I drink Jägermeister because my husband always calls me Erika,"
00:42:47,00:42:48,"even though my name is Heidi."""
00:42:48,00:42:50,(LAUGHTER)
00:42:50,00:42:52,These were genuinely adverts for Jägermeister.
00:42:52,00:42:54,That's incredible.
00:42:54,00:42:56,There's just one more thing.
00:42:56,00:42:59,The factory that makes Jägermeister is in...
00:42:59,00:43:05,"It's on Jägermeister Straus, weird coincidence, in Wulfenbüttel in Germany."
00:43:05,00:43:09,And an independent journalist went to see what goes on there
00:43:09,00:43:11,"and stayed in the Jägermeister guest house,"
00:43:11,00:43:15,"where you have Jägermeister in the mini bar, obviously."
00:43:15,00:43:18,And he went to visit Jägermeister HQ
00:43:18,00:43:20,and you're told that you're not allowed to take a phone in
00:43:20,00:43:22,because the alcohol fumes in there are so thick
00:43:22,00:43:26,"that they might spark an explosion, apparently."
00:43:26,00:43:28,"Well, a literal Jägerbomber."
00:43:28,00:43:32,(LAUGHTER)
00:43:32,00:43:34,"OK, that is it."
00:43:34,00:43:36,That is all of our facts.
