00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.560
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.880
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.400
 This week, coming to you live

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.420
 from the London Podcast Festival.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.280
 (audience cheering)

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.320
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.640
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.080
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.880
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.000
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.040
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.140
 - My fact this week is that researchers have concluded

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.220
 that cats don't like cat people.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.640
 (audience laughing)

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.360
 I'm really sorry.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.280
 - What a cat. - Scientifically speaking,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.960
 the more you like cats, the less they like you.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 - But I would say I have a cat,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.280
 and I wouldn't say I'm a cat person.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.480
 And my cat definitely doesn't like me.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.680
 So could it be that cats just don't like any people?

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.440
 - Sometimes they're just good judges of character, James.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.760
 But this, it's actually not that.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 So this is a study that was done

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.880
 at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.120
 with a bunch of universities involved.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.280
 And it got 119 different people to interact

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.080
 with a cat in a room.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.160
 And then it looked at various things

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.920
 about the people, like their personality type,

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.280
 they're kind of neurotic, are they agreeable people?

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.360
 You know, you fill in a questionnaire

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.000
 and say all that stuff about yourself.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.440
 And it asked them, have you ever owned a cat?

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.200
 How long have you owned a cat for?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.560
 Do you like cats?

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.540
 Turns out the best predictor of how much a cat

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.480
 is gonna like you is the number of years

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.940
 that you've lived with a cat,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.040
 but they're inversely proportional.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.400
 (audience laughing)

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.160
 Yeah, the more, and people would like say,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.280
 you know, I'm really good with cats.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.200
 It's the people who are self-professed cat knowers.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.920
 - Well, the thing I was reading is that a lot of it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.640
 is about cat people, people who like cats,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 cat people.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.480
 - So, good clarification, sorry.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.240
 - Just in case you all thought we were talking

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.760
 about half cats, half person.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.800
 (audience laughing)

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.040
 - Really annoyingly, that's all my research.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.560
 (audience laughing)

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 - Well, I think this was the study.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.840
 It found that they touched the cats

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.880
 so-called red areas more when left alone with cats.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.280
 Red areas are things like the, please,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 the-

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680
 - We all went to that HR meeting, Andy, we know.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680
 (audience laughing)

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
 - The base of the tail, or the belly.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.440
 Apparently, the hairs on the belly are really sensitive,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 and so a big old belly rub will,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.840
 I'm sure the cats vary from cat cats, but-

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.840
 - They don't seem to, with the red areas.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.360
 It's just the belly and base of the tail that are red,

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.600
 and they really seem to have crossed the board dislike.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.080
 The rest of the cat is yellow area,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.920
 like traffic lights.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.760
 - There's no green area.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.600
 - There's no green.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.120
 - I thought green was under the chin.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.200
 - You're absolutely right.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.120
 - Yeah, I mean, I read it.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960
 I didn't-

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.320
 (audience laughing)

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.000
 Yeah, they love a little tickle under the chin, and-

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.120
 - And the cheeks, and the base of the ears.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
 - Yeah.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.320
 - But yeah, that's basically it.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.640
 The cat people are too tactile with cats,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.480
 and also this study found that their interaction style,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 they want to control the interaction,

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.000
 whereas cats really dislike that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.700
 So they prefer to be the ones who approach you.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.280
 They only want to get touched.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.680
 If, you know, they've initiated it,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.520
 they've said, "All right, come on,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.640
 you can touch me now."

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.840
 And this isn't what cat people do.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.360
 And similarly, older people, cats tend to like them less

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.720
 'cause older people, sorry, but usually cat people.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.440
 (audience laughing)

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.000
 It's the old cliche that, you know,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.160
 it's always the person in the corner of the room

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.400
 who's ignoring the cat that it goes to.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.680
 It turns out that it's true.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.720
 - Yeah.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.240
 There's been a recent study as well

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.280
 that says that they recognize their names, cats,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.680
 but they're just, they don't want you to know

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.920
 that they recognize their names.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.240
 (audience laughing)

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.320
 So this was people at Sophia University in Japan.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.160
 And they played a load of noises,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.280
 including the cat's name that was said by the owner.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.560
 And then as soon as their name was called,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.960
 they saw their tail move almost imperceptibly.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.880
 They just very slightly moved.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.200
 Some people think that that's because

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.160
 they recognize their name,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.560
 but other people think, well,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960
 it's just something they kind of associate with food.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.000
 So you might as well be shaking a box of cat food

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.840
 and do the same.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.040
 - I feel like all of these cat studies

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.760
 are dancing around the fact that cats are dicks.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.440
 None of the scientists want to say that cats are dicks

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.240
 because they know that if they say cats are dicks

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.760
 in the abstract of their paper,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760
 then they'll get in trouble with cat people.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.280
 So here's another one.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.680
 Again, they didn't say cats are dicks,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.560
 but I think we can all agree the implication.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.920
 When you own a cat,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.640
 it will not side with you against your enemies.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.960
 Okay, that's bad.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.400
 So there's this experiment.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.520
 Basically, you get a cat and the cat observes its owner,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.360
 struggling to open a container of something, right?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.120
 And then the owner would request help

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.040
 from an actor, a stooge sitting there by,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.120
 and either the actor did help or didn't, right?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.400
 And then later on, that actor,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.680
 whether unhelpful or not, offered the cats some food.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680
 The cats were completely agnostic

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.400
 about whether they took the food or not,

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.440
 whereas dogs would frequently refuse food

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.640
 from the person who'd been a dick to their owner.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.160
 Cats were not like that.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.360
 Cats were totally neutral,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.040
 but it is possible that they're too stupid

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.680
 to understand the play

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.120
 that they've been put on for their benefit.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.440
 Wow, yeah.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.160
 Speaking of dicks, this study...

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.360
 That is definitely a red area.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.360
 So this study that I mentioned

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.520
 was done by a bunch of universities,

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.440
 the two Nottingham universities, in fact,

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.840
 and also the Royal Brackets Dick,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.800
 Clothes Brackets School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.840
 and that's its name.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.280
 The Royal Dick School of Veterinary Studies in Edinburgh.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.840
 It is named after a person called Dick,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.840
 so it's usually abbreviated to "The Dick Fett."

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.200
 So it sounds like it's a real specialty vet.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.080
 And it was established...

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.600
 It was established in the 19th century

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.080
 by a vet called William Dick.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.640
 And before you say anything, James,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.440
 there's no evidence he ever shortened his name to Willie, OK?

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.000
 Willie Dick.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.360
 Never did he go by Willie Dick.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.560
 Good. Very nice.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.760
 Have you guys heard?

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.800
 This has blown my mind,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.440
 and I can't believe it's not bigger news,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.560
 but there's an app out now called Meow Talk.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.920
 Have you heard of Meow Talk?

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.240
 Everyone listening, everyone here, everyone watching.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.120
 If you have a cat, get Meow Talk.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.720
 It's an app that translates what your cat is saying to you.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.320
 And I swear to God, this was done with scientists,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.520
 and if you read the reviews,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.520
 it sounds like it's actually genuinely

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.000
 picking up what the cat is saying.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.760
 So this was a New York Times article

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.640
 that was written by Emily Antheys,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.520
 and she was saying she tried it out.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.680
 And there's basically what they break it down to

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.240
 is different sounds of the cat get matched to certain terms.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.480
 So they can tell by the tone, the pitch, the length,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.640
 and so on of the meow in order to say,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.160
 roughly, they are saying this.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.440
 So she first used it, and the cat meowed

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.720
 after, I think, eating something,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.040
 and it translated as, "I'm happy."

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.680
 She was away from home, and she came home,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.320
 and the cat purred as she got in.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.200
 And her app said, the cat says, "Nice to see you."

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.800
 Like, oh, come on. Absolutely.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.160
 This had so many reviews.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.440
 I swear to God, this is a real thing

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.200
 where they think that that is happening.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.400
 But then it's also got, like, weird little terms

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.280
 that it uses as well.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.160
 So there was one time that she went to the cat,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.200
 and the cat went, "Meow."

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.120
 Which translated as, "Just chilling."

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.080
 (audience laughing)

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.400
 This is not true.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.920
 Okay, stick with me, guys.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.120
 It's, so they've got, the other terms they've got is,

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.760
 there was another time that she came in,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.600
 and the cat went, "Meow."

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.880
 Which went, "My love, I'm here."

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.400
 Which is the word that it used.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.640
 - Is there another one where you kind of get at,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.000
 and it goes, "You should upgrade your membership

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.160
 "to a premium account."

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 - If you read all the reviews of the app,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.200
 that's unfortunately, they get a lot of one-stars,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.600
 because the first meow leads to,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.000
 "You need premium membership

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.800
 "to understand what your cat is saying."

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.280
 But the best one is, she lifted her cat off the ground once,

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.320
 and she was moving it somewhere,

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.720
 and the cat went, "Meow."

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.240
 And that translated on her phone as,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.400
 "Hey, baby, let's go somewhere private."

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.520
 (audience laughing)

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.700
 But this is real.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.080
 We can now talk to cats through meow talk.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.200
 - I've never been more convinced

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.200
 you've been completely duped.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.640
 And now it's saying something.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.680
 Have you guys heard of Caden Griffin?

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.200
 - No, no. - So,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.560
 he's relevant to this field of study.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.960
 He is an American teenager, sixth grader.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.280
 He, last year, he was in the sixth grade,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.000
 which I think is about 12, 13 years old.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.800
 And it's from Tennessee.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.680
 And last year, he became curious

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.760
 about how often the objects in our home

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.920
 are touched by cats' bottoms, okay?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.320
 If you own a cat, you might think,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.880
 "Oh, is the cat rubbing itself on everything I own?"

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.720
 So, he, being a scientifically-minded child,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.200
 ran an experiment by putting lipstick

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.240
 on his cat's bottom (audience laughing)

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.000
 then studying the home for where lipstick was popping up.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.640
 What an amazing-- - And where did it end?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.480
 Not his toothbrush. - It's not on his lips.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.040
 (audience laughing)

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040
 Just his toothbrush day after day.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.600
 (audience laughing)

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.840
 It's really good news for owners of long-haired cats.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.440
 There's basically no lipstick anywhere

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.720
 at the end of the trial period.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.720
 Short-haired cats, there's a little bit on soft furnishings,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.640
 but, you know, in general, it's okay.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.880
 - Okay, yeah.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.120
 - Do you know that outdoor cats are banned in Housavi

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.200
 in Iceland, which is the town

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.560
 where they did the Eurovision movie?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.640
 - Oh, cool. - I don't know if you remember that.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.000
 - Beautiful. - And there's actually

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.680
 a few places, also a place called Acuriri,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.960
 where they're just about to ban them,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.560
 and they'll be banned in 2025.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.040
 But to try and stop that, there was a guy

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.520
 called Snorri Admondson, and he started the cats party,

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.240
 and in the recent local elections,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.240
 they got 4.1% of the votes.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.760
 - That's not bad. - This is just

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.760
 cat people in Iceland.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.440
 They beat the pirate party,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.360
 who actually, a pirate party, quite big in Iceland.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.200
 - Yeah, they were. - Yeah, they were.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.120
 - Like a few years ago, they were, anyway.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.680
 And a lot of the candidates for the cat party

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.120
 said that they were expressly running on behalf

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.560
 of their cats, because the cats were ineligible

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.360
 to vote or run for office.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.480
 - Oh, hey.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.320
 - I dread to think the kind of genuine bastards

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.040
 we'd have in charge if, actually,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.040
 we voted on behalf of our cats.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.240
 - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.280
 I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.080
 I've got a quick story about someone who doesn't like cats,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.160
 and that is Andrew Lloyd Webber, hang on.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.280
 Who apparently was so annoyed and so angry

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.280
 with the recent movie Cats, that after seeing the movie,

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.800
 he went out and bought a dog.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.600
 He was just, he was so angry, right?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.080
 But then he fell in love with this dog,

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.560
 and it became a really great thing,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.120
 and that he was traveling a lot overseas.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.520
 So anytime he got on a plane,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.200
 he tried to bring the dog with him,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.720
 and the only way you can really do that

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.080
 is claim to be an emotional animal,

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.040
 like an emotional support animal, right?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.880
 So that's what he did.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.600
 So he said, "I rode off and said I needed him with me

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.800
 "at all times because I'm emotionally damaged,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.720
 "and I must have this therapy dog."

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.960
 He said, "The airline rode back and said,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.960
 "can you prove that you really need him?"

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.440
 He said, "Yes, just see what Hollywood did

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.680
 "to my musical cats."

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.480
 And a note came back saying, "No doctor's report required."

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 (audience laughing)

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.060
 (upbeat music)

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.000
 It is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.320
 My fact this week is that if you take 50 generations

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.720
 of Confucius descendants and read out their names

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.720
 from oldest to youngest, in it it will reveal a secret poem.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.200
 - Ooh.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.280
 - So this I find really interesting.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.760
 This is the story of Confucius.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.700
 Confucius basically has the Guinness World Record

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.680
 for the longest unbroken lineage.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.480
 And I happened to make friends quite recently

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.880
 with the 79th generation descendant of Confucius.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.360
 He's a guy who lives in London called James Kong.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.200
 And the Guinness World Record has recognized

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.800
 that basically for thousands of years,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.480
 the Confucius family have been charting their family tree

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:14.680
 so consistently, so tightly, that we know

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.520
 who everyone is inside the Confucius family.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520
 And there's two million of them.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.780
 So every 60 or 70 years or so,

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.800
 they update the big database of all the descendants.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.480
 And in 2009, one book, which was broken up into 80 volumes,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.720
 weighing over half a ton was published,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.800
 having every single name of all of the descendants,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800
 both living and dead in there.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.260
 And James Kong is almost the closest that we get

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.320
 to a direct descendant that's alive.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.520
 Now the reason that their names would reveal a poem

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.560
 is there's a beautiful thing that they do in China.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.400
 Certain families do this, which is a generational name.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.000
 And a generational name means that all the families

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.440
 can know which generation a child is from

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.480
 by inserting a key word into their name.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.160
 So what they do is they write a poem

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.640
 and the next generation just takes the next word

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.800
 in that poem.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
 So you can look at that poem and you can go,

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.480
 "This is the 79, 78, 77, 76."

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.760
 So if you're out and about and you meet someone from China

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.560
 and you also name and you hear a key word,

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.560
 you can go, "Oh my God, it's a descendant of Confucius."

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.440
 - That's really cool. - Yeah, which is really awesome.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.040
 - And do we-- - You know this poem?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.880
 - Yeah.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.640
 - Does the next generation have to make up the next line,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.400
 like improv game or something?

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.640
 - No, yeah. - Like consequences.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.960
 Confucian consequences. - Yeah, exactly.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.000
 - So it's a word at a time.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.720
 As far as I know, it loops back onto itself once

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.080
 because you're not gonna have 50 generations alive at once.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.080
 So you're not gonna get confused.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.640
 - You're not gonna get confused.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.840
 - Yeah.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.640
 - Yeah, isn't it?

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:45.280
 - It's a really good joke.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.160
 (audience laughing)

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.560
 What's really nice is that back in the day,

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.400
 Confucius was a very prominent person in China

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.840
 and his descendants, therefore,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.560
 were almost like a class of their own.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.600
 So if you knew that someone was a descendant of Confucius,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.140
 there would be things like tax breaks

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.040
 when they were buying houses or something like that.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.840
 Yeah, and then it all went tits up

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.320
 when the Cultural Revolution happened

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.120
 because Confucius then became a sign

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.040
 of something that Mao Zedong and so on didn't want.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.040
 So basically, they lost everything.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.600
 The main bloodline of Confucius had to flee to Taiwan

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.040
 and it became hard times for all of them.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.000
 But now it's better again and this one family

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.800
 handed the reins over to James's family.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.640
 But when James goes back, he lives here.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.320
 He's a very normal guy.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.640
 In China, he goes back.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.220
 It's like in coming to America

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.540
 when Eddie Murphy goes back to Zemuda.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.220
 It's like everyone's bowing and kissing his feet.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.540
 And yeah, he's a big deal back in China.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.620
 But the thing is, if anyone has a grasp

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:45.140
 of how numbers work, there are shitloads more

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.020
 than three million descendants of Confucius out there, right?

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:49.580
 I mean, I think everyone in China

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:51.460
 is probably directly descended from Confucius.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.100
 But if you go back, even,

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.420
 I think we'll descend it from Genghis Khan.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.380
 So this is just people who have managed

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.220
 to get the paper trail to prove it.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.680
 - Yeah, basically, yeah.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.480
 Wait, am I descending from Genghis Khan?

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.920
 - I think you might.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.600
 I mean, there's a little bit of gray areas

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.840
 'cause how much immigration happened.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.200
 We don't really know, but yeah.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.800
 - Your family never left Wimbledon

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.940
 for five million generations, did they?

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.080
 No.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.840
 And Genghis Khan didn't make it to Wimbledon.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.680
 - Imagine that.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.140
 - We'd have been furious if he'd made it.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.880
 The lawn, the lawn, darling.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.140
 They've damaged the lawn.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.640
 I'm gonna go and say something.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.680
 I'm gonna go and say something.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.520
 (laughing)

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.660
 - That's what thwarted him in the end.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.060
 He couldn't handle the British passive-aggressive attitude.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.900
 (laughing)

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:34.740
 - Can you imagine, though,

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.440
 Genghis Khan, if we have a crack time travel

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.280
 and the descendant to go back to meet him is Andy.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.780
 (laughing)

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:42.620
 Hello, James.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.220
 - I think he'll be quietly impressed.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:45.060
 - Would he?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:45.900
 - Yeah.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.740
 - It's a warlord.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.580
 - Yeah.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.420
 - Yeah, I think he'll say,

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:50.360
 "I see, he's got soft skills, and that's important."

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.140
 (laughing)

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.740
 - Famously soft skills is something

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.060
 that Genghis Khan made.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.380
 (laughing)

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.220
 - That's just not Confucius.

00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.060
 - Yeah.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:15:59.900
 - Confucius was,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.460
 I didn't realize how unsuccessful he was in life.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.300
 He was incredible.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.140
 - Ouch.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.360
 - He basically, he became important about 100 years later.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.500
 During his life, he was not listened to at all.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.860
 Nobody took up his ideas for a century at least.

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.400
 And he, I'm kind of not surprised.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.220
 This main book is, I think it's called The Analect, is it?

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.600
 Yeah, and it's not by him, it's anecdotes about him.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.080
 So it's like fun stories about Confucius.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.300
 - And the Confucius says it's a kind of term

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.140
 that came out of it.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:29.980
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.900
 But he didn't charge any of his pupils,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.940
 or his students, and he was teaching philosophy.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.420
 All he requested from them was a symbolic bundle

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:40.940
 of dried meat.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.780
 - Oh.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.620
 - But I can see why he's priced himself out of the market

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.180
 at the wrong end, basically.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.540
 So I think you're not going to be respected

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.300
 if you say, "I want one pepper army,"

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.180
 and I will then tell you the secrets of the universe.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.300
 - Exactly, you would probably go

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.100
 for the second cheapest option, wouldn't you?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.880
 He had 3,000 students, and only 72 managed

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.440
 to pass master all of his teaching.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.780
 So that's quite a high bar, isn't it?

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:03.620
 - Yeah, that's impressive.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.880
 - But the Analects, there are two versions of the Analects.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.660
 One's called the Lou version, and one's called the Chi version.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.500
 And really exciting.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.340
 - Is the Lou version, that's the easy reading,

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.500
 big, funny jokes in it?

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.180
 (laughing)

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.280
 - You've got five minutes, get the Lou version, yeah.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.200
 - Well, the Chi version was long lost,

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.440
 but really excitingly in 2015, we found the copy

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.780
 in the tomb of Emperor Liu He, and he was one,

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:30.700
 he was like a really, not a great emperor.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.180
 He was dethroned after 27 days,

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.060
 which is the shortest reign of any of the Han emperors.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.100
 And the reason he was kicked out

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.500
 is because he was like debauchery, a terrible lifestyle.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.620
 There was like a period of mourning,

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.580
 and during that time, he bought a special kind of chicken

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.340
 and had lots of sex.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.340
 - With?

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.920
 - No, no, no, with concubines, with concubines.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.300
 - It is better, it is better than chicken.

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:00.640
 - It's better than chicken, isn't it?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.460
 - I do think so.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.300
 - It is better than chicken.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.220
 - And he's still thinking.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.480
 (laughing)

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.680
 - Well, anyway, he was punished by being given

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.680
 a small fife of 2,000 families who would pay tribute to him.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.400
 - Wait, he was punished by being given tribute?

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.960
 - Well, he was, and his subordinates were all executed.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.160
 - Oh, bloody hell, yeah.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.960
 - Why was that, sorry, 'cause that does sound nice to me.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.340
 - He's going from being an emperor

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.140
 to just being in charge of a couple of thousand families.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.980
 It's like, we're gonna take off

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.580
 the main responsibility for you.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.420
 - I guess.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.980
 - And then, it's like how if I was in charge of something

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.140
 and then you guys demoted me,

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.740
 so I was only in charge of holding Sharpies

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.660
 for after show signings.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.460
 That would be, for example, just an example, just an example.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.000
 - Do you remember that show a couple of shows go

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.380
 when we didn't have any Sharpies?

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.780
 - Got the Sharpies?

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.620
 Yeah, that was awful, I'm still sorry about that.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.420
 - He's, just when I read his story,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.100
 I thought that we're kind of parallels

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:53.000
 to Tutankhamun, because in the same way

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.160
 that Tutankhamun's grave was found, virtually intact,

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.160
 I know there was a grave robbing,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.000
 but it was because he was kind of wiped

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.160
 from the records, wasn't he?

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.680
 He's sort of, no one knew to loot his.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.840
 Kind of like this guy as well.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.080
 His tomb, where they found this Confucius reference,

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.720
 was kind of untouched, because he was sort of

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.140
 wiped out from history as well, yeah.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:12.980
 I think so, yeah.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.040
 - So go to all the irrelevant people's tombs.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.080
 Let's go to Tim Farron's tomb and see what's there.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:21.680
 - He's still alive, I don't know, he was just.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.860
 - But he might as well be dead.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.520
 I think that's what you're saying.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.680
 I don't even know who he is, who are we talking about?

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.100
 (audience laughing)

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.440
 Who is he?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.280
 - Speaking of politics, as we were, Dan.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.640
 - He's a politician, he's a politician.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.480
 - You're gonna say you don't know

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.760
 who Joe Swinson is next?

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.680
 (audience laughing)

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.520
 - It's a politician.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.560
 - They're all alive though, I feel bad.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.400
 - Sorry, Joe, sorry.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.460
 - All right, so speaking of politics, Confucius,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.840
 like Andy said, not that successful when alive,

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.600
 but he was the minister for crime.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.740
 He was basically the pretty patella of his day.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.080
 (audience laughing)

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.260
 - She's a politician.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.560
 (audience laughing)

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.760
 - And so he was working for a juke.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.960
 It was like a jukedom, and he was in charge

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.680
 of sort of punishment and crime and stuff like that.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.120
 And he fell out with the juke, apparently,

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.080
 and wandered for 12 years after he fell out with the juke.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.960
 And apparently the reason that he fell out with him

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.700
 is he was at a sacrifice, and the sacrificial meat

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.540
 was being offered around, but he wasn't offered any.

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.620
 And so without taking off his sacrificial bonnet,

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.260
 he left the country.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.080
 - He loved meat.

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.140
 (audience laughing)

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.940
 That's the main thing, I'm getting time and again.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.620
 - I've got a data point to add to this.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.860
 When he was, so he wandered for 12, 13 years

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.620
 trying to get people to listen to him, no one did.

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.140
 So he went back, became a politician again,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.340
 and he was quite successful as a politician, to be honest,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.740
 just not spreading his ideas.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.320
 But he transformed the town that he was a counselor of.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.360
 And the way he transformed it, I read, mainly,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.560
 is by ending the adulteration of meat.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.200
 - Gosh.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.040
 - Wow. - He's just

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.940
 the sausage king, and he just happens to have,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.480
 this is amazing. - Incredible.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.640
 - He once said that the main goal of life

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.080
 is to become a man of virtue, which is,

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.400
 there's a word for that, junzi.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.640
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing it wrong, but it is about education,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.240
 it's about compassion, it's about observing ritual.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.960
 But if you don't succeed, that is also a chance

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.420
 to gain virtue.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.740
 And he said, "Is not a junzi one who stays unruffled,

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.220
 "though men ignore him?"

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.540
 (audience laughs)

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.480
 - Anyway, I've got another fact over here.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.300
 (audience laughs)

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:31.360
 - It's a blessed moment.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.740
 - If you compare him to what other people in, let's say,

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.340
 Europe were doing at this time and saying,

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.860
 basically philosophers were, they were quite pro-war,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.500
 they're pro-pride, they're pro-patriotism or your city,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.600
 there wasn't much chat about compassion and kindness

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.840
 and generosity, and he was much more about all of that,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.800
 which was about 2,000 years ahead of where anyone else was.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.560
 He was quite crap on women, which is a slightly annoying

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.920
 thing about him. - Yes.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.840
 - He did think that they were like a different species,

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.880
 really, or not, like a different social class.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.680
 There was one moment where he met a leader who said,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:08.720
 "I've got 10 very good ministers working for me,"

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.120
 and Confucius looked at them and went,

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.760
 "Well, one of them is a woman, so you've only got nine."

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.320
 But look, I know.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.640
 - Confucius canceled 2,500 years later.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.500
 (audience laughs)

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.840
 - We all made mistakes.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.820
 - I've just got some stuff on family trees,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.820
 if you wanna hear me. - Yeah, yeah.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.900
 - So a couple of very long family trees,

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.580
 possibly almost records compared to Confucius,

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.220
 the Lurie family, some people think that's the longest

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.620
 in the world, according to Dr. Neil Rosenstein,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:38.140
 who wrote a book about it, they can trace their lineage

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.920
 all the way back to the Biblical king David.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.560
 - Ooh. - Okay.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.760
 But in the Bible, it says that David was begat by Jesse,

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.600
 who was begat by Obed, and their booze,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.080
 and their salmon, and their nascent,

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.000
 so I don't know why they stopped there,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.400
 'cause we know who came before them.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.160
 - Oh, I see, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.120
 - And then the only other family that could be around

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.840
 the same is the House of Solomon,

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.560
 and they claim to go back to the Queen of Sheba.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.400
 That's the Imperial family of Ethiopia,

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.920
 and we know who the latest on that line is.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.460
 It's someone called Zira Yakob,

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.260
 who was the second African to ever go to Eaton College,

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.740
 who ever go to Eaton College,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.060
 and in the '90s, at the last time I could find him,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.060
 he was living in the Rastafarian community in Manchester,

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:19.580
 and according to the legend,

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.340
 his family looks after the Ark of the Covenant,

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.780
 so Indiana Jones could have just gone to Russia.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:29.040
 (laughing)

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.140
 - What a downer that movie would have been in.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.260
 (laughing)

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.620
 - All right, you're coming over there,

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.620
 looking for your Ark of the Covenant.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.420
 (laughing)

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.420
 I love you, mate.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.000
 (upbeat music)

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.280
 - All right, look, I need to move us on to our next fact.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.720
 It is time for fact number three,

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.960
 and that is Andy.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.160
 - My fact is that there is a two-headed tortoise

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.640
 in Switzerland whose two heads prefer different foods.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.260
 (laughing)

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.220
 - And here he is.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.460
 - So people at home, their pictures just come up

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.300
 on the screen.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.020
 - Yeah, Andy didn't have them in his pocket.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.940
 (laughing)

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.700
 - Yeah, Janus is his name,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.020
 named after the old god with two faces,

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:18.060
 that's facing different ways,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.700
 and he's 25 years old.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.640
 He's just turned 25.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:26.540
 He was born in, and still lives in Geneva,

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.580
 'cause he's quite slow-moving

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:29.780
 and he hasn't managed to leave yet.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.620
 - Hopefully in about 50 years he'll be in Zurich.

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.380
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.520
 This is all from a great piece,

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.880
 just about a million other times, by the way.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.840
 And he lives in the Natural History Museum,

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.160
 and he sounds like a great guy.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:44.600
 I mean, he really, he has a wonderful life.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.440
 He has--

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.520
 - Can I just ask?

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.440
 With it being two heads, should you not say "they"

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.000
 rather than "he"?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.600
 - I agree, they need two names,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.600
 like Janus one and Janus two maybe.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.720
 - Yeah.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.720
 - Okay, well, just rip up these notes then.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.440
 (laughing)

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.120
 Well, they, no, you're right,

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.080
 'cause they have different personalities,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.700
 and you're right, yeah, yeah, all right.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.420
 Well, anyway, between them,

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:08.800
 these two little guys, who share a shell,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.340
 they have a skateboard, which I love.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.020
 - Today! - Yeah.

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.860
 Isn't that cool?

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.700
 - That is really cool.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.220
 - Did they, someone gave them that, right?

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.300
 They didn't go out to make their way to the shop,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.140
 didn't they?

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:20.980
 - They didn't made it themselves?

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.900
 - Yeah, he or they get a valium rubbed

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.380
 on their heads every day.

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.220
 - What?

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:26.980
 That's nice. - Vaseline.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:27.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.380
 (laughing)

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:31.220
 Yeah.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.220
 - Oh my God, you do not want to get those two mixed up.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:37.840
 - So, I've got valium here,

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.080
 but I think I just wrote that

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.820
 as a kind of wishful film and thing.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:43.800
 (laughing)

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.740
 - They have Vaseline because their heads

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.080
 bump into each other too much.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.860
 - And why would valium prevent chafing,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.120
 as I've also put in the notes?

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.680
 This is why you're always in so much pain, I've been telling you.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.900
 (laughing)

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.680
 I'm depressed, but I'm incredibly smooth.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.940
 (laughing)

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.000
 - Yeah, and also, he does have a lot of,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.920
 or they both have a lot of issues

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.520
 in terms of general lifestyle.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.880
 So, they're 25 years old.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.720
 These tortoises can live for quite a long time.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.100
 If they were in the wild, they'd probably be dead by now.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.160
 One of the ways that tortoises, as we know,

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.560
 survive in the wild is if a predator comes in,

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.840
 they can back up into their shell.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.920
 But there's only space for one of the heads to go back in.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.920
 Which would just leave the other one hanging out, yeah.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.520
 - Unfortunately, he's got a skateboard,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.920
 so he can make good his exit.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.240
 - I was just thinking, maybe if they cover him in Vaseline,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.800
 he might be able to slip in there.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.280
 (laughing)

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.360
 - They chuck valium at the predator, they might be able to.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.480
 - Well, he's, this is a mutation, right?

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.320
 Where you have two heads instead of one.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.040
 If it's a mutation, then that means,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.880
 'cause he's 25 years old now, it means we have all missed

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.900
 the time when there was a genuine teenage mutant hero

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.120
 tortoise owning a skateboard.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.960
 - Oh my God, yes.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.880
 - No, anyway, he was 25, so he's now a mid-20s.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:58.720
 (laughing)

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.360
 - He's a bit old for a skateboard, really, 25, isn't he?

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.920
 - Yes, definitely, yeah, yeah.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.600
 - On the skateboard, it's not putting one foot down

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.600
 to propel itself, right?

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600
 It's just someone's pushing it.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.640
 - I think his helpers are pushing him around, yeah.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.720
 - Yeah, 'cause I visited the embalmed body

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.200
 of Jeremy Bentham, and they said,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.720
 oh, he's got a skateboard, and I saw the skateboard.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.520
 It's not a skateboard, so.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.000
 - Hang on, I mean, he's definitely not riding

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.760
 that skateboard, why has he even got that?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.240
 - Oh, 'cause when he rides out of his box

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.600
 to get vacuumed each year,

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.320
 they need to get him across.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.280
 - But actually, doesn't he have two heads?

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.120
 Jeremy Bentham.

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.960
 - He does have two heads?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.800
 - He does have two heads?

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:31.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.240
 - He has, like, his real head is hidden away,

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.640
 and he's got, like, a fake head.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.920
 - The white sort of a wax head, 'cause, wow.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.600
 - Oh my God, we've blown this right open.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.440
 - Yeah.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.280
 - Two-headed tortoise.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.640
 - Jeremy Bentham is a tortoise?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.480
 (laughing)

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.040
 - And so what, they just skate him out to Hoover him?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.600
 - Yeah, when transporting him,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.000
 they put him on what they call a skateboard.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.840
 I imagine it's the same with--

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.400
 - To be honest, I didn't know that they Hoovered

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.800
 Jeremy Bentham once a year, as in, that's--

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:57.520
 - We've mentioned that in the show, I think, yeah, yeah.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.440
 They have a little vacuum and they Hoover him, yeah, yeah.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.880
 Anyway, tortoises.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.520
 (laughing)

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.240
 So, yeah, so Janice is a tortoise,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.920
 and it is quite rare, but if you go online,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.320
 you can see lots of tortoises that have two heads.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.120
 - Probably the second most common animal to have two heads.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.600
 I think snakes are slightly more common,

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.960
 but yeah, if you're gonna get any animal with two heads,

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.760
 if it's not a snake, it's probably a tortoise.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.960
 - Snake's all over the place,

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.000
 by Kefley, as it's called, one in 100,000 snakes.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.480
 That's loads. - Yeah.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.680
 - And, again, they never really lived that long

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.120
 unless they're in captivity,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.640
 because, partly because of this whole,

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.920
 the heads argue with each other thing.

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.720
 So, in snakes, it's a serious problem.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.520
 If they, like, one head will fight with the other for food,

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.160
 and they'll end up, kind of, no one gets it,

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.920
 and they'll exhaust so much energy fighting

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.040
 with each other that they starve to death.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.960
 - And what's crazy is, it goes into the one stomach.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.800
 - Well, it depends.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.520
 Some of them have two, some of them have one, but yeah.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.840
 But the ones that have one, yeah,

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.760
 exactly the two heads will be fighting, not knowing,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.880
 never having studied anatomy and realising.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.720
 - So sad, 'cause it feels like they could,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.840
 lady in the tramp, all their meals.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.040
 - Yeah.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:02.880
 - And that would be very charming.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.000
 - But I know, 'cause I think that is incest, isn't it?

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.840
 Definitely.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.720
 - I think something else has to happen for incest.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.560
 - Really?

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.400
 - It's not.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.960
 - Yeah, that is hard.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.720
 - Yeah, but the thing about that is--

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.720
 - Wait, just kissing is not incest?

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.640
 - Dad's interested suddenly.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.920
 (audience laughing)

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.120
 - We've found a very interesting philosophical question,

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:28.160
 which is, if a two-headed snake has a wank, is it incest?

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.000
 (audience laughing)

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
 - What is it using to have a wank?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.480
 (audience laughing)

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.480
 - That's plenty of tail there, I think.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.320
 Could do the job.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.760
 - Oh, puts the tail, oh god.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.600
 - Yeah.

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.440
 (audience laughing)

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.280
 - The other thing we have these snakes--

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.120
 - Do they have dicks?

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.400
 We need to take it to the dick vet to find out, I guess.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.320
 (audience laughing)

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.880
 - So, snakes, tots, there's Tasmanians

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.480
 with the other people with two heads.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.960
 (audience laughing)

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.280
 Commonly.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.320
 Apparently, there's a thing.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.040
 In the olden days, there's a thing in Australia

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.880
 that all Tasmanians had two heads.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.720
 - Really?

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.120
 - And the reason being that they had a problem

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.120
 with a deficiency of iodine.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.920
 And so it would often have goiters.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.840
 So people in Tasmania would often have goiters.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.680
 - What is a goiters?

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.320
 - So a goiter is like a, it's a growth on your neck.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.440
 And it can get really big,

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.240
 and it can almost look like a second head.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.640
 But actually, what would happen is,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.400
 they would have some surgery,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.920
 and so they would have like a scar on their neck.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.200
 And then during the war,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.600
 a lot of Tasmanians would go to the front line

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.560
 and they'd meet Australians and they'd say,

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.520
 "Well, where's your other head?"

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.960
 'Cause they saw a scar, thought that a head had grown there.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.800
 - I used to-

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.320
 - I believe these days, it's not so common

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.240
 to be iodine deficient in Tasmania.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.080
 - Cool.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.240
 - And it probably wasn't a hundred percent.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.560
 But I do think the ones that did it,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.240
 'cause they are Aussie, so they've got a sense of humor.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.440
 I assume they drew a face on their goiters.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.760
 (audience laughing)

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.600
 - Good point, yeah.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.720
 - Went around freaking everyone out.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.600
 - Good eye, mate.

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.760
 (laughing)

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.600
 - That's true.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.760
 - There's a, I found this through a QI, actually.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.840
 In 2019, a two-headed rattlesnake called Double Dave

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.660
 was born.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.940
 Do you know why he's called Double Dave?

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.280
 - 'Cause it's got two heads.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.720
 (audience laughing)

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.240
 - No, he was found by two scientists called Dave.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.240
 (audience laughing)

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.120
 - That's amazing.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.400
 - You know, Nicholas Cage?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.240
 - No.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.080
 - Who's that?

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.400
 - He was Min Campbell's predecessor

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.520
 as leader of the Lib Dems.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.840
 No, he was, Nick Cage, he once spent $80,000

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.960
 on a two-headed snake, because he'd had a dream.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.000
 He dreamed of a two-headed eagle, which you can't get.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:29.840
 And so...

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.920
 (audience laughing)

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.080
 - So he went on eBay, it's a two-headed eagle.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:34.920
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.760
 - And this is why it came up.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.240
 - Yeah, weirdly, you can't get a two-headed eagle,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.680
 as in no one's ever seen a two-headed eagle,

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.680
 even though it's the symbol of loads of countries,

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.440
 and it's a big thing, and that just doesn't happen

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.480
 as far as we know.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.880
 Anyway, and he got so freaked out

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.360
 that he gave it away to a museum,

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.080
 'cause they fought, and he said,

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.720
 "I had to put a spatula between the two heads

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.560
 "to feed them."

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.480
 (audience laughing)

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.160
 - Is that where he got the idea for face-off?

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.400
 (audience gasping)

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.440
 - It's quite a different plot, but they're...

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.480
 (audience laughing)

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.920
 - But you know, once these Hollywood types

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.640
 rework a script, they re-write it.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.980
 - Yeah, it's very different.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.440
 - I'm gonna have to move us on very soon.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.280
 - What?

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.400
 - So you can get Janus Katz, Katz with two faces,

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.720
 which I think is the correct use of the term Janus,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.720
 'cause Janus had two faces, not two heads.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.720
 So I actually think that their tortoise here,

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.560
 they fucked up.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:23.400
 - Miss Noma.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.240
 (audience laughing)

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:26.440
 - Well, it does have two faces as well, in fairness.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.280
 - Yeah.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.120
 - Okay, it does have two faces.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.640
 You're right, but it's not how you'd describe it, is it?

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.480
 If you were saying that tortoise has got two...

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.160
 - He can't look forward into one year

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.440
 and look back into another year.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.280
 - Exactly.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.240
 That would be so shit if you had a two-faced tortoise

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:39.480
 and one of the faces just looked backwards

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.640
 into your shell the whole time.

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.120
 (audience laughing)

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.280
 - Janus and Anus, I guess.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.280
 (audience laughing)

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.600
 - Hey, how 'bout us?

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.760
 - Well, that's just Anus.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.240
 (audience laughing)

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.880
 Lovely lipstick, Anus.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.460
 (upbeat music)

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:03.880
 - It is time for a final fact of the show,

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.800
 and that is Janus.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:08.240
 - Okay, my fact this week is that Jagermeister

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.600
 was originally drunk to stop people from feeling sick.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.600
 (audience laughing)

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.280
 - How many do you have to have?

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.400
 - It's about 12.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.240
 - Okay.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.320
 - So no, it was originally a digestif.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.040
 And in fact, some Germans still call it liver glue.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.360
 And the idea is that you would take it after a large meal

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.640
 and it would settle your stomach.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.440
 And it was always taken at room temperature,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.280
 and that was the only reason you would have it.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.360
 And it was invented by a guy called Karl Maast.

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.920
 And it was his nephew, Gunter,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.880
 who came up with the idea that you could take it cold

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.240
 and have it as a social drink and get hammered with it.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.120
 - I hadn't thought of it as something you had cold.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.280
 Just whenever you have Jagermeister,

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.480
 you are so unaware of the temperature of the drink.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.800
 (audience laughing)

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.920
 - Excuse me, can I set back this Jagermeister, please?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.920
 It's a few degrees off.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.920
 (audience laughing)

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.760
 - I think it's corked.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.920
 (audience laughing)

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.000
 But yeah, Jagermeister, invented in Germany

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.160
 by this guy called Kurt Maast.

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.760
 He was a son of a vinegar maker,

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.720
 and he decided he would go into liquor.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.680
 So he invented loads of types of drinks.

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.240
 Burning Love was his biggest one

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.240
 until he came up with this 56 herb recipe for the Jagermeister.

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.320
 - Do we believe the 56 herbs in?

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.760
 'Cause they sort of are open about 10 of the herbs.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.760
 But then they claim that it's definitely 56,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.080
 but the rest are all secret.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.400
 - And it's secret, isn't it?

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.280
 - They've got a chief bartender.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.880
 He's called the Brandmeister at the moment.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.800
 His name is Willie Shine, and he says that he,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.920
 come on, grow up, guys.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.640
 (audience laughing)

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.640
 He says, Willie Shine says he is legally only allowed

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.360
 to discuss 11 of the 56 ingredients.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.400
 - Wow, I know.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.280
 - So does that mean if you ever talked to him

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.320
 about licorice or something, he's like,

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.240
 you can't say anything?

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.920
 - Yeah, he's like a one-man guess who,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.160
 but instead of guessing a person,

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160
 you're guessing ingredients again.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.000
 - Isn't it amazing, though?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.480
 'Cause I know, I guess back in the day,

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.560
 Coca-Cola has the secret ingredient.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.120
 KFC, you know, the secret ingredient.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.000
 Like, these days, are you allowed to get away

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.920
 just saying there's a magical something in there?

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.760
 No, I don't think you're allowed to.

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.480
 - No, I'm gonna not allergy a secret ingredient?

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.720
 Get the fuck out!

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.080
 (audience laughing)

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.160
 - But it's still allowed, right?

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.000
 - Yeah, it's still allowed.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.920
 I guess, maybe alcoholic drinks seem to be a loophole.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.400
 I've never looked the back of a bottle of--

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.240
 - No one has ever read the back of a bottle of Jägermeister.

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.280
 (audience laughing)

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.600
 - Yeah, it was quite sort of a stiff,

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.520
 like a drink for kind of stiff types, wasn't it?

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.640
 Before it was loosened up.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.360
 It was basically well-to-do German people who drunk it.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.760
 And then, I think it was in the 1970s,

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.960
 there was a businessman called Sidney Frank,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.520
 who realized in America that the only people

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.880
 drinking this thing were these well-to-do German

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:54.720
 kind of immigrants.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.560
 And for some reason thought,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.040
 "I reckon I can make this huge."

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.360
 And he completely transformed its reputation.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.520
 He hired a lot of Jägerets.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.600
 And Jäger dudes, I think, came later.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.960
 Jägerets are scantily clad women

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.680
 who tend to be just rolled out

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:11.000
 whenever you need to sell anything in life.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.840
 But he sent sort of a scantily clad Jägerets

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.040
 around the bars of the U.S.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040
 And it went huge.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.400
 - Yeah, and one of the things that he did

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:23.120
 was kind of spread rumors about Jägermeister.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.400
 So there had actually been a guy who had been up,

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.240
 I think for attempted murder or something,

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.000
 and he said that he'd had something

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.320
 called liquid valium, actually.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.280
 - Stop it, he actually had solid vaseline.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.600
 - It was solid vaseline.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.080
 But then later on, a bar in New Orleans

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.200
 started selling this Jägermeister

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.000
 as if it was called liquid valium as a publicity thing.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.800
 So it was like maybe it had caused this murder

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.200
 or this attempted murder.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.280
 - Sorry, just on the Jägerets thing very quickly

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.160
 before we move on from there.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.200
 I was once in a bar in Budapest

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.680
 and someone came around,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.680
 sort of young woman came around who was,

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.760
 she was like a kind of Jägeret,

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.880
 but she wasn't selling shots of alcohol.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.360
 She was selling carrots.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.280
 - And really?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.520
 - And I've got one.

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.560
 - And it was like, it was like a quid for a carrot,

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.000
 which in the supermarket,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.720
 I know which in the supermarket is crazy,

00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.920
 but next to a glass of wine,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.360
 you think that's a good, that's an investment,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.200
 isn't that reasonable?

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.040
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.040
 - And I swear to God, that was the best carrot

00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:20.880
 I had ever eaten.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:22.880
 It was like, it was about a foot long.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.720
 It was clean, it was crunchy.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.560
 - Was it shaved?

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.040
 - It had been, it was shaved or peeled, as we call it.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.320
 (audience laughing)

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.760
 - Oh yeah, that's the weird one.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.520
 - You better quid for a carrot.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.720
 - I don't regret it for a second.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.120
 And I looked around the back,

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.560
 every other man in the room had also just standing there

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.400
 with a carrot.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.080
 - Wow.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.880
 Genuine, I've never seen this in any other bowl

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.080
 or any other country or anything like that.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.200
 - That's because it was one-off.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.680
 I have no question in my mind

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.520
 that you were part of a scientific study

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.560
 setting out to prove that men are so stupid,

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.640
 they will literally buy anything at any price

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.880
 if an attractive woman sells it to them.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.880
 (audience cheering)

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.040
 - Unbelievable.

00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:04.880
 - So what?

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.000
 So what?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
 Apparently I'm also a mug

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.560
 when the Sprout Girl came around a couple of minutes later.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.880
 (audience laughing)

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.200
 That was a fucking lovely Sprout.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.280
 It only cost a fiver.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.280
 (audience laughing)

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:23.160
 Jägermeister, the word itself is, it means master hunter.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.800
 And it's really interesting, the story.

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:27.520
 So if you look at a Jägermeister bottle,

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.800
 you'll see there's a stag on it.

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.000
 And in between, there's a Christian cross

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.840
 going across it, the crucifix is there.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.520
 And sometimes it's depicted when you see pictures

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.920
 of where he took this idea from

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.560
 with Jesus on the cross itself.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.960
 And what it was was it was a guy

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.440
 who eventually became a saint, Saint Hubertus.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.360
 He was out and he was hunting

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.240
 and he suddenly saw a stag come around the corner.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.800
 He was meant to be in church, but he wasn't.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.200
 And he saw a stag come around the corner

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.280
 and the stag had a sort of crucifix, just a cross,

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.960
 in between, glowing through its horns.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.160
 And he had this sudden conversation with this stag,

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.720
 where the stag was like, dude, what are you doing?

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.320
 I was thinking of the Jäger dudes there.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.040
 I assume that's how they talk.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.240
 Where he basically said,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.280
 you need to be more ethical in your hunting.

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.240
 You need to make sure that if you're gonna kill a stag,

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.120
 it's one that's older or maybe sickly.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.080
 I would do it, you know.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.560
 And he sort of introduced ethicalness into it.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.240
 So he became a saint, Saint Hubertus.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.720
 He's the patron saint of hunters, mathematicians,

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:30.360
 opticians, chicken roasters.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.640
 I couldn't, could you find any evidence of the chicken roasters?

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.040
 'Cause I just couldn't find any evidence of where that came from.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.360
 It's a bit left field, isn't it?

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.640
 It's sort of just, it was left over and they weren't like us.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.360
 What is a chicken roaster? It's not even a thing.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.840
 But rotisserie, you see,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.400
 something that's used as a counter at the supermarket,

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.480
 which has a rotisserie.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.320
 You just always thought, if you're a saint in the chicken roasters,

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.680
 you'll be a saint of just all the meat roasters.

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:53.320
 No, Andy once paid 20 euros for a rotisserie chicken.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.960
 That was an error, yeah.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.880
 Another thing that he did was cured rabies.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.160
 Oh, yeah. Oh, wow. Yeah.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.560
 What just sort of, what, people are animals,

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.000
 'cause both can get it.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.040
 Both can be cured by Saint Hubertus.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.120
 Oh, great.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.440
 Saint Hubertus' key,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.160
 which is a key that I think priests would keep them, wouldn't they?

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.720
 And sometimes normal shops would have us in Hubertus' key.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.800
 And you would, it was like an iron bar and you heat it up.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.200
 It's like a defibrillator in a, you know...

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.400
 It's exactly like that, yeah.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.920
 The effect of what you were doing was

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.840
 you were heating up the key and you were branding the person with the key.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.760
 So if they were bitten by a dog that might have rabies,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.440
 you would immediately heat up the key, put it on.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.760
 And the idea is that the burning would sterilise your...

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.840
 Well, I think the idea was that it was a magic key.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.440
 Yeah, the idea was that it turns out that actually it might have worked

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.560
 because of the sterilisation of the heat, it's possible.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.000
 And you would have cauterised the wounds,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.440
 so no bacteria could have got in, so it might have worked slightly.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.280
 They got lucky.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.560
 It's always one in 1,000 of these bullshit magical cures happen to also work.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.520
 Yeah.

00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.720
 Um, Jägermeister, back to that.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.040
 Yeah.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.400
 Jägermeister do not like Jägerbombs.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.280
 Yeah.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.080
 Who does?

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.760
 Just for the streamers, there was a gasp in the room.

00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.080
 They can't believe it.

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.120
 So Jägerbombs is a Jägermeister from Red Bull

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.640
 and you drop one in the other and it's great.

00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.840
 And so they didn't invent it.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.000
 And I think they have slightly distanced themselves from it.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.080
 The Jägermeister firm, they say they have to promote responsible drinking

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.440
 and the marketing director, who's a woman called Nicole Goodwin,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.560
 she said, "You will never see us actively support or promote Jägerbombs.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.560
 That's very much driven by our customers."

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.440
 And they recommend you have it with ginger beer.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.560
 And a carrot.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.520
 And a nice...

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.440
 They've signed up to the apartment group, haven't they?

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.640
 The apartment group is a thing that encourages responsible drinking

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.960
 that a lot of, sort of, alcohol companies sign up for.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.480
 But they have admitted that it's helped.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.120
 So they don't like it, but, you know, they're not going to stop you from doing it, I think.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:51.720
 Yeah, right.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:56.080
 So I mentioned Gunther Elio, who was a nephew of Karl Maast.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:00.600
 And he, in the '70s, came up with an advertising campaign, which was one for all.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.520
 So like Hannah said, it was quite an upper-class kind of German drink.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:07.480
 But he wanted to get normal Germans drinking it.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.480
 So the idea was it would be a poster and you would have a normal German

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:15.600
 and they would just look like it could be a man, a woman, a young girl, or anything.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.200
 But it'd be completely unknown.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.520
 And they would say, "I drink Jägermeister because."

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.680
 And then it would give an excuse.

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.520
 So...

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.320
 A reason?

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.080
 Reason, yeah.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.920
 An excuse is a bit different, Lee.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:30.960
 An excuse is what you have to say the next morning.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.880
 I drank all that Jägermeister because, yeah.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.400
 Well, for instance, I drink Jägermeister because, as a teacher,

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.640
 I have to go to school my whole life.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.920
 Oh, that was one of them.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.960
 That's so good.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.760
 Yeah.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.040
 One of them was, "I drink Jägermeister because my husband always calls me Erika,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.600
 even though my name is Heidi."

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.320
 (LAUGHTER)

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.800
 These were genuinely adverts for Jägermeister.

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.120
 That's incredible.

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.760
 There's just one more thing.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.800
 The factory that makes Jägermeister is in...

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:05.600
 It's on Jägermeister Straus, weird coincidence, in Wulfenbüttel in Germany.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.320
 And an independent journalist went to see what goes on there

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.520
 and stayed in the Jägermeister guest house,

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.400
 where you have Jägermeister in the mini bar, obviously.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.200
 And he went to visit Jägermeister HQ

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:20.520
 and you're told that you're not allowed to take a phone in

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.640
 because the alcohol fumes in there are so thick

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:26.400
 that they might spark an explosion, apparently.
