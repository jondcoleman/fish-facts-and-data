00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,660
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,720
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,760
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,200
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,440
 and in no particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is My Fact.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
 My Fact this week is that a lot of the Daniel Day Lewis movie,

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,720
 My Left Foot, was filmed using his right foot.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 - What are you saying using?

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,920
 Is that, we're operating the camera with his right foot?

17
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,760
 - Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,600
 - While he filmed his left foot.

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,120
 Yes, and when I say a lot, I also mean some.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
 So let's just put this into context.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,660
 This is a movie about an Irish writer

22
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,320
 and painter called Christy Brown.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,560
 He was born with cerebral palsy,

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,120
 and by the time he was an older kid, he didn't walk,

25
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,680
 he couldn't do much, and he only really could operate

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,440
 by moving his left foot,

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,520
 particularly the big toe on his left foot.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,320
 As he grew older, he got really excited

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,960
 by the idea of becoming an artist.

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
 He started to learn to paint,

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,120
 and then he started to write a book

32
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,180
 by using that left toe on a typewriter.

33
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,720
 It was a massive success,

34
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 and this is what eventually became a biopic,

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,280
 which starred Daniel Day-Lewis.

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,720
 Now, for anyone who knows Daniel Day-Lewis,

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,920
 he's a method actor.

38
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 He loves to really immerse himself,

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,720
 and in this case, he operated most of the movie

40
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,760
 from a wheelchair using his left foot.

41
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,000
 - Yeah, and when you say method actor,

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,160
 he basically lived as this character

43
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,200
 throughout the whole time, right?

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
 He stayed in the wheelchair the whole time, pretty much.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
 Like he had to be carried places.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,240
 - Yeah, made the cast and crew feed him.

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,840
 - Well, he just was trying to stay in character,

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
 but here's the thing.

49
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,800
 The movie involves some quite intense stunts footwork-wise.

50
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,200
 Okay, the movie is not,

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
 I'm sorry, I watched the film yesterday.

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,720
 It's a terrific film.

53
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,880
 Stunts is not a good way to play it.

54
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,480
 And when you say this movie contains footwork,

56
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,920
 it's not like Ginger Rogers.

57
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
 (laughing)

58
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
 - So there's a couple of scenes where he,

59
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 as an actor, was unable to do it

60
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,040
 by manipulating his left foot into the right positions.

61
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,680
 - But so the scenes are basically

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,960
 he's holding a paintbrush or a pencil.

63
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,800
 - Or writing.

64
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,720
 And the first shot of the whole film,

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
 it's just a shot of a foot.

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
 And it's taking a vinyl record out of the sleeve.

67
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,000
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,840
 - And popping it off the turn.

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
 - So what you're saying, Dan,

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,400
 is that he did that with his right foot

71
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
 instead of his left foot.

72
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
 - Exactly.

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,120
 - Now my question is,

74
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,640
 how did we not tell the difference in the movie?

75
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,600
 - He has them switched around.

76
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,360
 It's really the opposite way around.

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
 - That's the method.

78
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,000
 He had to speak seven and then reversed.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
 (laughing)

80
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,200
 - That's exactly it, Andy's got it right.

81
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,440
 It was mirror filmed.

82
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,240
 So the detail is a bit actually quite hard

83
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,720
 to work out if they flipped the film itself

84
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,840
 as in they did a mirror image

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,040
 or if they filmed through a mirror.

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,880
 - Right, okay.

87
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,400
 - Has anyone else seen it?

88
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,560
 - Yeah, many years ago.

89
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,880
 Good film.

90
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,240
 Weirdly, I read the book about 20 years ago.

91
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,200
 It was also a great book.

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,040
 - Did you, right?

93
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,240
 - Yes, apparently he's a brilliant writer

94
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,480
 when the book came out,

95
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,120
 which bizarrely was when this guy Christy was,

96
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,240
 Christy Brown was only 22.

97
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,480
 He was so young to be writing about your experiences

98
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
 so far, but I think it was in the 50s.

99
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,240
 And when it came out,

100
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,560
 someone said, I think the Irish standard or something,

101
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,240
 said that it was the most important book

102
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,520
 since Ulysses in Ireland.

103
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,360
 - I think that might have been the subsequent book.

104
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,800
 - Sorry, you're absolutely right.

105
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
 That was his magnum opus.

106
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
 Yes, what's it called?

107
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,600
 Down on All Days?

108
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,440
 - Down on All Days.

109
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,120
 But I mean, they were both absolutely massive.

110
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,600
 And he was from a family of 22 children,

111
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,440
 not all of whom made it to adulthood.

112
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,800
 - I think 11 did.

113
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 - 11 did, yeah, imagine that.

114
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
 Good grief.

115
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,480
 - That's from the birthdays.

116
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,320
 - That's the candles.

117
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,660
 - That's true.

118
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,000
 That's the candles.

119
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,200
 - Oh yeah, I was gonna say you could reuse them,

120
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,040
 but no, you can't reuse them.

121
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
 - No, well, you can.

122
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,240
 - Oh, it depends how quickly you light and blow, right?

123
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,080
 - But most birthday candles are so thin.

124
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,120
 Maybe they had a very strict lighting and blowing policy.

125
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
 Maybe in the--

126
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
 - You'd have to.

127
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,640
 You'd have to.

128
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
 Anyway, it's a very--

129
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,320
 - Is that in the book?

130
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,040
 - It's like, it's been 20 years, I can't remember.

131
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
 It's definitely not an overwritten book though,

132
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
 because he's typing it with one toe.

133
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,120
 So he doesn't go for the incredibly long sentence,

134
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
 quite a lot of the time.

135
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
 - It's kind of the reverse Ulysses, isn't it, in a way?

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,840
 - Yes, it is, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,680
 - That was good.

138
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,640
 - And it was a big book, right?

139
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,840
 So when it came out, it made Splash internationally.

140
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,240
 He actually got no correspondence

141
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,120
 with this American woman called Beth Moore,

142
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,080
 and he eventually went over to hang out with her,

143
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,600
 and she was married, but they had an affair.

144
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
 And this is where he wrote his magnum opus, this novel.

145
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,280
 And she basically is the reason he got it done,

146
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,120
 because at this point,

147
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,640
 he did have a bit of an alcohol problem,

148
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,400
 and it was preventing him from getting on with stuff.

149
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,080
 She basically said, "You're not allowed to drink

150
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,000
 "until the end of the day,

151
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,480
 "after you've done a full day's of writing,

152
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,520
 "and then you can have that."

153
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,920
 And that's how he got the novel done.

154
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,600
 He dedicates it to her.

155
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
 He goes back to Ireland,

156
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
 and then they have more correspondence saying--

157
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,360
 - Is he married as well at the time?

158
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
 'Cause he did marry a couple of times.

159
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
 - No, he wasn't married at the time.

160
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,880
 - No, 'cause he's not married.

161
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,720
 - He's not married.

162
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,120
 - Yeah, so, but she tells her husband,

163
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
 "I'm gonna marry Christy."

164
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,680
 And just as that's about to happen,

165
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,600
 Christy meets his wife and gets married,

166
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,440
 and then Beth is stuck.

167
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,360
 - So, bit of an asshole, actually.

168
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,960
 You know, people don't really focus on this bit, do they?

169
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,800
 Abandoned poor Beth for his new woman,

170
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 who's the person I think in the film,

171
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,760
 which I haven't seen, but he goes off with a woman

172
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,280
 at the very end of the film, I think.

173
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,000
 It looks like it's going to be happy.

174
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,520
 But actually, that's the person he went off with.

175
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
 And it seems like, based on his life,

176
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,080
 Beth, who helped him write his great novel,

177
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,120
 was a lovely woman, and he ended up with this other lady,

178
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,600
 who I think a lot of his family didn't like,

179
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,160
 who turned him into a bit of a recluse.

180
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,000
 She was an alcoholic herself, I believe.

181
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
 - There were allegations of abuse,

182
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,920
 so he passed away, quite sadly, at 49.

183
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,760
 - Really young, yeah, yeah.

184
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,600
 - He was choked while eating, but, yeah, on his body,

185
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,120
 there were sort of unexplained bruises all over,

186
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
 with the abuse. - Yeah, wow.

187
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
 What about Daniel De Lewis, eh?

188
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
 - Oof. - Well, not that guy.

189
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
 - He's a character.

190
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
 (laughing)

191
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
 - Well, more often than he is himself, yeah.

192
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,880
 - So, before this podcast recording time,

193
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,320
 I had never seen any of the films with Daniel De Lewis in.

194
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
 - Is that right?

195
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
 - Not one. - That was so cool.

196
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
 Not one.

197
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,680
 - Wow.

198
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,520
 - I thought he was in "Backman Forever",

199
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,360
 but it turns out that was someone else.

200
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,200
 (laughing)

201
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,040
 - Don't spell kill them.

202
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,880
 - No, spell kill them.

203
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,640
 You're thinking of Jim Carrey.

204
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,240
 (laughing)

205
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,160
 - So, I've never seen any of the interests.

206
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
 - Have you just watched them all?

207
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,280
 Have you seen, how many have you seen now?

208
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,480
 - I've now seen one and a half way through two others.

209
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,440
 - Which two?

210
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,760
 - Gangs of New York, have you watched that?

211
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,600
 - No, I haven't.

212
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
 - Oh, that's a brilliant movie.

213
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,280
 - It sounds great.

214
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,720
 I've started, not on "American Werewolf" in London,

215
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,920
 but "The Last Mohican", sorry.

216
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,760
 - Yep. - Oh, yeah.

217
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,160
 - I started "The Last Mohican", terrific.

218
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,720
 Was watching that in the small house this morning.

219
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,200
 And I'm also watching "Stars and Bars",

220
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
 which is a goofy comedy he made immediately

221
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,120
 after "My Left Foot", which appears to have been

222
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
 the only film for which he's never done any method work,

223
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,960
 whatsoever.

224
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,800
 - What was his character in that?

225
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,640
 - The premise is just like,

226
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,000
 what if a goofy British guy went to the deep South of America

227
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,040
 and it is so bad?

228
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
 (laughing)

229
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,320
 - I've managed to watch the only time they know this film,

230
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,520
 which is not like five-star.

231
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,800
 This will change your life movie.

232
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,080
 - Well, in "The Last Mohicans",

233
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,000
 he caught and killed all of his food.

234
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
 - Brilliant.

235
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,880
 - Apparently, I had to get into that character.

236
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
 - Yeah, he lived for a whole month in the wilderness,

237
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,640
 didn't he, in order to fully immerse himself.

238
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,080
 - He was in "The Crucible"

239
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,320
 and he didn't bathe for the entirety of "The Crucible".

240
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,760
 Now, I'm not sure, is that about the witch trial?

241
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,160
 Sorry, is that about Snooker?

242
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,120
 (laughing)

243
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
 - It's the happy marriage of the two.

244
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,360
 - He bathed, but he kept one foot on the floor at all time.

245
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,320
 (laughing)

246
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,400
 I think my favorite one,

247
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,800
 'cause I don't ever heard of him as like this,

248
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,440
 incredible that he lives the role.

249
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,440
 My favorite is the unbearable likeness of being,

250
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,920
 I'm sure you guys all found this,

251
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,200
 which is based on a Czech novel by Milan Kundera,

252
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,560
 and he learned Czech,

253
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,840
 learned to speak Czech almost fluently for the film,

254
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,800
 despite the fact the film is in English,

255
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,560
 all of his lines are in English,

256
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
 and he said, "Yeah, but I can't just do an accent."

257
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,400
 I need to know where that accent comes from, great.

258
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,200
 So he put all of his lines through the Czechy New

259
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,880
 and then back into English to do the accent, I mean, insane.

260
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,160
 - And do you know what people who speak Czech,

261
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,920
 and particularly British people who now live

262
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,960
 in the Czech Republic,

263
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,160
 say that it's a really bad Czech accent?

264
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,360
 - Oh no, he says nothing like a Czech English.

265
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
 - If you learn how to speak a language,

266
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,680
 that doesn't mean you learn how to speak English

267
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,040
 in that accent, but that's the one problem

268
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,400
 when you learn a language is you can never nail the accent.

269
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,120
 - Yeah, I also really want to find out how fluent he is,

270
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,760
 'cause there's so much allegation about this,

271
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,160
 and apparently, according to the Foreign Services Institute,

272
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,240
 which ranks languages by difficulty,

273
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,520
 Czech is in the fourth out of five hardest languages.

274
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,280
 So I mean, it takes years and years and years to nail.

275
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,360
 So how, I mean, was it,

276
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
 do you think it was like primary school, French level?

277
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
 - I always wonder that,

278
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,080
 whenever you see like a top footballer or a basketball player

279
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,240
 going, I speak nine languages to you.

280
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,240
 Did you Kobe Bryant, did you really?

281
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,760
 - Well, did you just learn how to say,

282
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,000
 oh, I got that three points today?

283
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,280
 - Exactly, 'cause as that fact we did ages ago

284
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,520
 about umpires and tennis,

285
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,200
 do you need to learn all the swear words

286
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,760
 in multiple languages or something on the same?

287
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,720
 Maybe it's just that.

288
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,760
 I mean, obviously some of it is myth-making,

289
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,600
 but I love it, I just love it.

290
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,760
 Like he played Lincoln, President Lincoln.

291
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,200
 So he actually-

292
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
 - He got assassinated for that one.

293
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,360
 - He got assassinated, he had himself made President first.

294
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,360
 And then, so on the set of Lincoln,

295
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,960
 it was just totally a period appropriate.

296
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,720
 So supposedly, nobody was allowed to tell that

297
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
 wearing a T-shirt with a logo on.

298
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,880
 Like, I presume all the like thousands of electricians

299
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
 of people who work on the film had to be in front coats

300
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,200
 and things like, it's addressed to like union soldiers.

301
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,580
 No shorts, no paper coffee cups.

302
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,320
 Lincoln wouldn't have had a paper coffee cup.

303
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
 I imagine it's more for Daniel Day-Lewis

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,720
 than it is for everyone else.

305
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,440
 - But you've got to slightly create the scene around him,

306
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
 haven't you?

307
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,520
 I mean, like in there's a famous thing in Gangs of New York

308
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
 when he was filming,

309
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,220
 where first of all, Stephen Graham,

310
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,560
 who is very famous and brilliant British actor,

311
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,040
 said that he was such a great guy to work with

312
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,860
 and they became friends before they started filming

313
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,520
 and they did the training together,

314
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,640
 some martial arts training together.

315
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,720
 And then the first day on set,

316
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,040
 Daniel Day-Lewis walks on the set

317
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,000
 and just touches him on the shoulder and says,

318
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,120
 "From now on, I call you Shang and you call me Bill."

319
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,960
 And then moves on.

320
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
 So cool.

321
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,040
 - Bill the butcher.

322
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,880
 - And then indeed-

323
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,920
 - Is that his character?

324
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
 - Yes.

325
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,880
 - I read that he worked as a butcher for some time.

326
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,120
 I know I read butchers were flown over to the set.

327
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,360
 - It was one butcher.

328
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
 But I've got a theory about this butcher.

329
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,160
 I don't think he's a butcher.

330
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,000
 - Okay.

331
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,200
 - I think this butcher is the ultimate method actor.

332
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,080
 He's a guy called John Dell.

333
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
 Look him up.

334
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,560
 He's a butcher who runs W, head and co-butchers in Peckham.

335
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,600
 - Sounds like he is a butcher.

336
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,920
 - Well, no evidence of that online at all.

337
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,760
 - Oh.

338
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,480
 - There's like one little company record

339
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,880
 of it once existing.

340
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,720
 John Dell.

341
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,040
 - How many butchers have websites, though?

342
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,440
 Especially at the time that Gangs of New York

343
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,480
 was the 2002 film, it's early into there.

344
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,800
 It wasn't required that a butcher

345
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,120
 had to have a buzzing online presence in 2002.

346
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,240
 - Everyone's Google reviewed something.

347
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,080
 - Oh, come on.

348
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,200
 - I couldn't find nothing.

349
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
 He was an amazing character, though.

350
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,160
 When he was interviewed, first of all,

351
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,400
 he was asked by the producer who lived in Peckham

352
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,240
 and he knew him.

353
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,040
 And he was like, this guy's a legit butcher.

354
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,320
 He knows how to slaughter a pig.

355
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
 So-

356
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
 - He's an avatar worker.

357
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,640
 You could clearly, yeah.

358
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,880
 If your butcher's killing the pig,

359
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,480
 that's a problem with the sourcing.

360
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,120
 Butchers don't normally kill the animal.

361
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,960
 - No, sorry.

362
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
 - No butchers.

363
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,240
 I mean, butcher the animal.

364
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
 But he was very good at butchering pigs.

365
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,160
 So he trained Daniel Day-Lewis in how to butcher a pig.

366
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,480
 And they got along really well.

367
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,280
 He said Daniel Day-Lewis could butcher a pig like no one else.

368
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,480
 He'd never seen anyone else with the knife skills.

369
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,400
 He'd never seen anyone else

370
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,880
 with the natural feel for cutting meat.

371
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,720
 - And this is a man who presumably

372
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
 has known a lot of other butchers.

373
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,080
 - I reckon 'cause they hang out together, don't they?

374
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,920
 - Yeah.

375
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,760
 - Yeah.

376
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,600
 - I love the sound of Daniel Day-Lewis.

377
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,560
 He sounds like a really nice bloke.

378
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
 And when he's interviewed about it,

379
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,680
 he sounds quite normal.

380
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,520
 - Yeah.

381
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,360
 - Because I'm just trying to get into the head

382
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
 of the character so that when I put it on film, it's real.

383
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
 - I think he's a big old liar.

384
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
 - No.

385
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
 - You think he's just not doing it?

386
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,520
 - I genuinely do.

387
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,240
 I think some of it's true, but I think there's some.

388
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,800
 And actually, I think a lot of the lies

389
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,720
 are made up by people around him.

390
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,640
 But there was the famous thing where he walked off stage

391
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,960
 'cause he thought he saw his dad in the wings

392
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,920
 when he was doing Hamlet.

393
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
 - That's right.

394
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,280
 - And then later on, he did an interview saying

395
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
 that's what happened.

396
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,680
 And then later on, he went, "No, it didn't really happen."

397
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,120
 - He said he was just tired.

398
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
 He said he was just exhausted

399
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,800
 and you're doing a play for every day for 18 months,

400
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,040
 whatever, that's really exhausting.

401
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,680
 - But you can imagine if Daniel Del Luis says,

402
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,520
 "I saw my dad father in the wings,"

403
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
 you're gonna believe that, aren't you?

404
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,360
 - Absolutely, yeah.

405
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,960
 - And it was, he's never done theater since.

406
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,800
 - But he explains, actually,

407
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,600
 he prefers the medium of film and so on and so forth.

408
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,560
 - I kind of agree.

409
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,040
 It's sort of like if he was less sort of thespian-like

410
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
 and had so much integrity, he's Brian Blessed.

411
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,360
 Like all these stories are just tall tales.

412
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,440
 Apparently on my left foot, he broke two ribs

413
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,000
 because he was hunching over so much

414
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,280
 while he was in the wheelchair,

415
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,440
 but they just snapped under the weight of his hunchback.

416
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,840
 - I just don't think that breaks your ribs.

417
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,280
 - I hunch over my laptop all day, every day,

418
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,680
 and never have I broken a rib.

419
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,760
 - You're not committing to the work

420
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
 like Del Luis commits to his work.

421
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,400
 No offence, Anna, I'm sorry.

422
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,120
 - But he is a very, very successful actor,

423
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,240
 Daniel Del Luis.

424
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,840
 His Wikipedia, he doesn't have a separate Wikipedia page

425
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,240
 listing his movies, 'cause he's done so few movies.

426
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,520
 I think he's done less than 20 or around 20.

427
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,360
 - Wow.

428
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,160
 - But he does have a separate page listing all

429
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,360
 of his awards.

430
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,040
 - Just 'cause he's won so many.

431
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,480
 - Yeah, he's done around 20 feature length films

432
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,240
 and he's had 212 major nominations and 139 wins.

433
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,080
 - Wow.

434
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,040
 - And not one of them will have been for "Stars and Bugs".

435
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,640
 I guarantee it.

436
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,440
 - What I worked out is if each episode of our podcast

437
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,000
 was as successful as each of his films,

438
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,600
 then we'd have more than 4,000 awards.

439
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,240
 And if they all weighed the same as an Oscar statuette,

440
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,040
 the total weight would be about the same as two elephants.

441
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,880
 - Oh my God.

442
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,400
 - So that puts it into perspective.

443
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,000
 - Yeah, it really does. - That's brilliant.

444
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
 - Tells you a lot about Daniel Del Luis, that.

445
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,760
 - Yeah.

446
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:41,960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

447
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,160
 My fact is that some French unions have special barbecues

448
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,520
 that can be used to cook sausages while on a protest march.

449
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,360
 - Brilliant.

450
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
 They do like a strike in France.

451
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,040
 - They love a strike and they love a saucy song.

452
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,640
 And they found a way of combining the two.

453
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,160
 And this does the rounds every now and again.

454
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
 But Snopes, the brilliant people at Snopes,

455
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
 looked into this picture.

456
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,520
 You can find it online.

457
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,960
 There's French people, they're very clearly French union workers.

458
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,600
 They're in their hives and they're pushing along

459
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,680
 this mobile barbecue, which is in tram tracks.

460
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,520
 - Yeah. - Oh.

461
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,200
 - So they're going the tram route, I presume.

462
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,000
 Oh, they're French train workers who were on strike.

463
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,360
 - It was in Nice.

464
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
 - It was in Nice.

465
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,680
 - Very annoying if it's French teachers on strike

466
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,520
 and they're confined to the tram route for the whole process.

467
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,360
 - It's 'cause they were doing some reform of the SNCF.

468
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,680
 - There was some probably mild change

469
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,480
 suggested to working hours and I was like,

470
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,480
 "Everybody out now, we leave Nice to Rock for a year."

471
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,280
 - So it's really cool though, isn't it?

472
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,680
 There's actually video footage.

473
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,600
 It's like one second of video footage

474
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,480
 from what I saw where they're just pushing it down.

475
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,120
 It's a massive grill going over the two tram tracks.

476
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,960
 - It's very cool. - And they're pushing it along

477
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,840
 and they're, you know.

478
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,320
 - So why do they put it on tram tracks

479
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,600
 rather than just putting a barbecue on wheels?

480
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,840
 - Good call.

481
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,680
 Good point.

482
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,280
 I suppose they were marching the route of the tracks.

483
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,240
 I mean, I suppose they were only walking the tram route

484
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,440
 to make a point about whatever beef they were having.

485
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,840
 With their bosses.

486
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,480
 - Maybe it makes the point more emphatically

487
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,200
 if they're like, "We've even made a barbecue

488
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360
 "to make our point."

489
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
 - I mean, we're talking about them now.

490
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,920
 This was several years ago.

491
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,560
 - It's worked. - So, you know, it's worked.

492
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,120
 - Their wagers will probably shoot up

493
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,040
 now that we've discussed it.

494
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,080
 - You're welcome.

495
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,920
 - Yeah.

496
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,160
 I didn't actually know the knees had trams.

497
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,960
 I've been to knees, but clearly I wasn't paying attention.

498
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,800
 So, you know.

499
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,160
 Is that an all new low in terms of my anecdotes?

500
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,000
 It's 'cause I cycled into knees, that's it.

501
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,280
 Now we've hit the rock bottom.

502
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,000
 There we go, there we go.

503
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 - You know, the barbecue I have is a Weber or Weber barbecue.

504
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,840
 - Okay.

505
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,520
 - And that is a, it's like a circular one.

506
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,840
 It's almost like a ball and some legs.

507
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,920
 - I think of that as a classic.

508
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,960
 - It's a classic garden barbecue.

509
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,640
 - It's like War of the Worlds, the tripods.

510
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
 - It is. - Like this is all with a tripod.

511
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,520
 - The terrifying aliens leap out of it

512
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,560
 if you want to cook the meat.

513
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,400
 - Sort of.

514
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,240
 Will they climb into your body

515
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,720
 and then they leap out several hours later?

516
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,960
 - Yes.

517
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,960
 - Well, they were invented in 1952

518
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,680
 from two halves of a steel boy.

519
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,520
 - A boy?

520
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,360
 - You know, a boy.

521
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,200
 - A boy?

522
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
 - A boy. - Ocean boy.

523
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,920
 - You know, those things that float to the ocean.

524
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,840
 - Yeah.

525
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,360
 - Well, yeah, they decided they wanted

526
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,920
 to make a new kind of barbecue

527
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,160
 and they thought, wouldn't it be nice if it was circular?

528
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,400
 And what do we have that's circular in our iron works?

529
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,560
 Well, we have some boys.

530
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,800
 - Boys. - Cool.

531
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,640
 - That's brilliant.

532
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,080
 - And the guy used it in his garden

533
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,960
 and basically all his neighbors called it a spaceship

534
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,680
 and laughed at him.

535
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,520
 But it turned around.

536
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,360
 - And it took off?

537
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,200
 - It did.

538
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,200
 - So was the previous barbecue not around like a bro?

539
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,480
 - No, because in America where the barbecuing started,

540
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,120
 that's not really what barbecuing is.

541
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
 It's more like roasting meat for 24 hours

542
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,760
 until it's really, really, really soft.

543
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,100
 Isn't it? - Right.

544
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
 - That's low cut.

545
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,120
 - 'Cause in the, I should say to any Americans listening,

546
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,960
 in the UK, a barbecue is you sit in the garden

547
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,280
 when it's raining and you put burgers on a grill.

548
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,560
 - You go into the house and put them in the oven

549
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
 if it's really raining yet.

550
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,600
 - As far as I'm concerned, a barbecue is a metal tray

551
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,200
 that you buy from Tesco Metro on a sunny day

552
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,360
 and then take to the park.

553
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,200
 - You cramp.

554
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,360
 - You three bottles of white light in.

555
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
 - Yeah, delicious as well.

556
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,360
 - I discovered that I spell barbecue differently to you three.

557
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,200
 - No, you spell it wrong,

558
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,800
 which is what I noticed is a document

559
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,640
 where we put a tag or a search.

560
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
 - Are you spelling it with a Q, Dan?

561
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,560
 - I'm spelling it with a Q,

562
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,200
 which is the Australian way of spelling it.

563
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
 That's the actual way of spelling it in Australia.

564
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,880
 Yes, it is, and New Zealand as well.

565
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,160
 And also, ah.

566
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,840
 - But you pronounce that barbec.

567
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,680
 - Barbeque.

568
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,240
 - They pronounce it Barbie, as we know.

569
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
 - Oh, we have a Barbie, but yeah, barbecue.

570
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,960
 And in Sydney, there's a thing.

571
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,800
 - If it was, sorry, if it was meant,

572
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,640
 if you were spelling it like it was pronounced,

573
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,800
 but you wanted to include the Q,

574
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,040
 you'd have to end it Q-U-E-U-E.

575
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,200
 That's how you do Q.

576
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,440
 - Join the barbecue.

577
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,280
 - Yeah.

578
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,120
 Well, no, I'll bring that up.

579
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,200
 And the next time I'm at the Australian Embassy

580
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,320
 and they're asking me for my international opinions.

581
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,880
 - They've constantly got a barbecue

582
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,920
 on the go at the Aussie Embassy.

583
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,760
 - They do, exactly.

584
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,400
 - But this relates to a really interesting

585
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,840
 etymology of barbecue,

586
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,280
 because there's a kind of mythic folk belief

587
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,000
 that it comes from a French phrase

588
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,360
 from barbecue, which means from beer to tail.

589
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,680
 You're eating the whole pig.

590
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,800
 Jokes on you, that pig is Daniel Day-Louis in disguise.

591
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,640
 He was method acting.

592
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,480
 You're in big trouble now.

593
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,640
 You've cooked and eaten him.

594
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,480
 - Was he in Babe?

595
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,320
 - What was the movie?

596
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
 (all laughing)

597
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,000
 - 'Cause the word Q in English as in to stand in a line

598
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,040
 comes from the French for tail as well.

599
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,200
 - Right, right.

600
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
 - But you're saying this isn't correct.

601
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,160
 - It's not from that.

602
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,840
 In fact, we very briefly mentioned years and years ago

603
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,440
 that it's from a guy called William Dampier

604
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,880
 who was a privateer, sailor, pirate, roaster.

605
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,720
 - The original Robinson Crusoe, I want to say.

606
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,520
 - He was a buccaneer and a buccaneer is a pirate

607
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,480
 who cooks meat.

608
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,640
 It's basically the etymology of buccaneer

609
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,720
 comes from that as well.

610
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,560
 - Yes.

611
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,960
 - It's all Caribbean languages basically.

612
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,520
 So there's a barbacao,

613
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,920
 which is from the various Caribbean peoples who got it.

614
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,320
 So it's from the Americas, the word in the first place, yeah.

615
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,440
 - There's a fun phrase in Argentina

616
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,880
 where barbecuing is huge and it's called asado

617
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,240
 in place like Argentina, Brazil,

618
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
 other parts of South America.

619
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,960
 And then you get asado al disco, do you know what that is?

620
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
 - A circular.

621
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,800
 - Revolving, yeah, rotating.

622
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,720
 - Oh, the disco gets so hot that you feel like you're cooking.

623
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,440
 So they're a ball full of meat.

624
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
 - Thank you.

625
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,680
 I was looking for some disco stuff

626
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,640
 and then I could say no,

627
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,320
 it's about the first things that you guys said,

628
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,640
 but a disco is the disc from a plow.

629
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,680
 So a plow has like very sharp discs

630
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,560
 that it cuts the crops with.

631
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,120
 And once they've worn out, then in Argentina,

632
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,600
 you take that off the plow and you cook on it.

633
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,360
 And it's basically like a wok, a giant wok.

634
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,760
 And that's Apollo al disco

635
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,800
 is using the disc from a plow to barbecue.

636
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,480
 - Yeah, a barbecuing is very common around the world.

637
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,600
 And one thing that's quite interesting

638
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
 is it's very common for men to do the barbecuing

639
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,360
 almost everywhere that you go.

640
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,600
 So like we think of it in the UK at least

641
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,680
 and probably in America as like,

642
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,400
 the dads go and do the barbecuing

643
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,000
 while everyone else does something else.

644
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,840
 - That's right.

645
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,240
 And the men obsess over it and they talk,

646
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,080
 Lou, what charcoal are you cooking with these days?

647
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,280
 You know that kind of stuff.

648
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,960
 - But yeah, Levi Strauss, the anthropologist,

649
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,400
 he says that yeah, basically if you look all over the world

650
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,520
 from Amazonian tribes, people in Africa,

651
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,760
 it's often the men's work for the barbecuing.

652
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,640
 There was a book called the complete barbecue book

653
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,480
 by John and Marie Robertson who put it,

654
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
 they said that the man who does the barbecuing

655
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,320
 takes on a somewhat god-like stature.

656
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,040
 As for the ladies, well, they're virtually your slaves.

657
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,840
 I feel like John wrote that bit, not Marie, probably.

658
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,680
 - Who is it?

659
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,080
 - Anthropologist of food rides called Calvin Trillin

660
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
 records that if you want to be a good barbecueist,

661
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,840
 you have to be basically a mishandthrope

662
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,160
 because you're going in the garden on your own.

663
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,000
 You're not really talking to anyone else.

664
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Your friend is the meat, as opposed to the--

665
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,320
 - Oh God, it's such a lovely chance

666
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
 not to have to fulfill your social obligations

667
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,080
 and just stand there feeling used to it.

668
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,280
 - I would say in Australia,

669
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,040
 I don't know what it's like here properly,

670
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,120
 but it's the water cooler.

671
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,240
 It's everywhere when it hangs around the barbecue.

672
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,760
 - What are you driving these days?

673
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,600
 Yeah, that kind of thing.

674
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,000
 - Exactly that kind of thing, yeah.

675
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,160
 - But then this guy says that actually it's quite good

676
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,040
 as a hobby because golf and sailing and fishing,

677
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,320
 these are also things where men sort of like to go

678
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,560
 just a couple of men on their own

679
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,520
 and not see anyone else misanthropically,

680
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
 but at least in this case,

681
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,040
 everyone gets some food out of it at the end.

682
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,920
 - That's true, I'm not guaranteed with fishing.

683
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,840
 I'm very rare with golf unless you really hit something.

684
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,880
 - Yeah, I think misanthropically,

685
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,200
 for activities like fishing,

686
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,480
 which is so dominated by men,

687
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,240
 we need to replace the word misanthrope,

688
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,280
 which has a kind of coolness to it with unhelpful,

689
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,400
 because that's all it is.

690
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,640
 That's just men pissing off and not helping out, isn't it?

691
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
 - So when my wife says to me,

692
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,320
 "Why have you not taken the bins out?"

693
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,680
 I could just say, "Oh, it's been misanthropic."

694
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,160
 - Yeah, exactly.

695
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,400
 The male thing is interesting though,

696
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,920
 and going back to French barbecues,

697
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,960
 a green politician in France got in trouble in 2022

698
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,240
 'cause they were saying obviously meat,

699
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
 very bad for the environment,

700
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,600
 20% of our greenhouse gases still come from the meat industry.

701
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,320
 And she was saying,

702
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,600
 "We have to change our mentality

703
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 "so that eating a barbecued Andracot

704
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,080
 "is no longer a symbol of virility."

705
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,480
 And basically people said,

706
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,520
 "You're blaming men for killing the planet."

707
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,320
 - I don't think I've ever heard someone say the word

708
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,440
 "Andracot" and think that is a virile person.

709
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,400
 - France is a very different place to Bolton James.

710
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
 The interesting male thing about barbecuing a meat

711
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,040
 is that men just do eat more meat,

712
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,360
 and actually we don't know why,

713
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,200
 but around the world, in almost every country--

714
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,480
 - It must be cultural, it can't be biological.

715
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,320
 - Well, a lot of people think it's biological,

716
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,080
 so there are arguments that female hormones suppress

717
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,560
 the desire to eat meat around your period,

718
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,800
 or when you're pregnant, which sounds very implausible to me.

719
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,920
 There's another argument that says

720
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
 men behave in more risky ways.

721
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,320
 So evolutionarily, they need to eat more protein

722
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,080
 to make their bones stronger, more meat.

723
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
 - But also cooking a sausage for three minutes a day,

724
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I was probably fine, that is a risky behavior.

725
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,280
 (laughing)

726
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,360
 - But it's really interesting,

727
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,080
 and also there was a study looking at 23 countries,

728
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,320
 and the wealthier and more gender equality we have,

729
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,160
 what would you think, as you get more gender equality,

730
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,680
 which tends to happen in more developed countries,

731
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,640
 does the gap between men and women's meat

732
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,120
 seem to get bigger or smaller?

733
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,440
 - Well, you think it would get smaller.

734
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
 - You think it would get smaller and it gets bigger?

735
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,080
 - It doesn't, 'cause men are trying to cling

736
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,240
 to something to show their blokes, is that it?

737
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,640
 - We don't know, but I like that's a nice interpretation.

738
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,400
 - Have you heard of transglutaminase?

739
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,360
 I'd be really surprised if you had, no.

740
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,520
 - Some kind of molecule.

741
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,000
 - It's a molecule, all right, it's an enzyme,

742
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,800
 and it's a thing that gets called meat glue.

743
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,640
 - Oh, that's not the answer.

744
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
 - And if you buy a big piece of steak, you may notice,

745
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
 it might be skewered, and if it's skewered,

746
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,000
 there's a good chance.

747
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,920
 This is in America, this stuff is not legal in the EU,

748
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,840
 that it's been had meat glue sort of painted on it,

749
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,160
 and if you paint meat glue on it and squish it all together,

750
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,920
 you can make a big, expensive looking steak

751
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,440
 out of several pieces of small scrap meat.

752
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,280
 - Oh, cool.

753
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,040
 - And that's how it's not cool, it's really horrible.

754
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,840
 - No, but it's cool that you could bring

755
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,280
 a dino burger basically, right?

756
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
 - Yeah, it's like the Power Rangers,

757
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
 they combine their forces.

758
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
 - Yeah, yeah.

759
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,200
 - If you're listening to this after the Trump tariffs

760
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,960
 have forced us to do a trade deal with America,

761
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,920
 then you two could be eating one right now.

762
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,120
 - We'll eat these days.

763
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,520
 - Yeah, I was looking at sort of out-of-place barbecues,

764
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,920
 like the one on the tram line,

765
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,440
 and there was a really cool thing I found,

766
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,760
 which is there used to be a tour

767
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,920
 called the Vans Warp Tour.

768
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,920
 It's basically a festival that you would have like 20 bands,

769
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,720
 and they would go from city to city together.

770
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,160
 So not like class and regis or what.

771
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,400
 Yeah, and they came to Australia in 1998,

772
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,920
 and I remember it being a big deal.

773
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,600
 So they had big bands,

774
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,360
 you'd get people like Blink 182 and No Effects and stuff,

775
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,200
 but then they would also give opportunities

776
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
 to younger newer bands.

777
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,000
 And one of the conditions of being on the Warp Tour

778
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,840
 was you could be the barbecue band.

779
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,200
 You get a slot on stage, but when it's done,

780
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,000
 you go backstage and you're in charge of the barbecue,

781
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,400
 and you cook for everyone.

782
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
 And so that's the condition,

783
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,000
 the trade-off of you being on the tour.

784
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,400
 - Don't we know any bands that went on to be massive,

785
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,800
 having begun as barbecues?

786
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,360
 - Yeah, the Dropkick Murphy's, Art of Shock,

787
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,120
 Gorilla's, Gorilla's, Gorilla's.

788
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,840
 - Yes. - Yeah, yeah.

789
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,000
 - Yeah.

790
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,860
 - Was he in it?

791
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,720
 (laughing)

792
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
 - I was in it.

793
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,000
 - I think Gorilla's is what belongs, isn't it?

794
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,320
 - Oh, you mean, I think. - Damon Aldon, you mean.

795
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,160
 - Yeah, Damon Aldon.

796
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,000
 - Yeah, well, it's a good one.

797
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,720
 - Damon Aldon, I mean, he belongs on a farm anyway.

798
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,000
 (laughing)

799
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,320
 So you know, there are these rubs.

800
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,160
 - Yeah, meat rub. - It's a big thing.

801
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,120
 - Meat rub. - Meat rub.

802
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,440
 - Yeah.

803
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,120
 - So it's basically a load of spices

804
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,080
 that you rub over your meat to marinate it.

805
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,560
 - Exactly, exactly.

806
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,400
 And there's a shop named Me,

807
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,880
 which stocks something by what's called

808
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,160
 the Gentleman's Rub Club.

809
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,680
 And I have tried to,

810
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,440
 and I've tried to find any evidence that it existed online

811
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,920
 'cause I remembered it running up to this podcast

812
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,760
 and they're nowhere.

813
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,200
 - The thing is, it's a bit like Butchers in the 1980s.

814
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,400
 You don't necessarily have to have a massive online presence

815
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,040
 if you're a rub club.

816
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,560
 - But the fairly the first rule of Gentleman's Rub Club.

817
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,440
 (laughing)

818
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,320
 But this just got me off onto like,

819
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,760
 so it got me off onto, got me onto grilling awards,

820
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,320
 barbecue awards.

821
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,240
 So I was looking at the NBBQA,

822
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,560
 National Barbecue and Grilling Association,

823
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,920
 'cause they have an awards of excellence every year.

824
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,120
 I think it's an American thing.

825
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
 So they've got beef rub, pork rub, poultry rub,

826
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
 seafood rub, spicy rub.

827
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
 And I just, I wanted to read a few of the prizes

828
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,000
 from the latest awards.

829
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,960
 They're terrific.

830
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,560
 Barbecue apparel category.

831
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,560
 First prize, a t-shirt reading, wanna see my rack.

832
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,160
 - First prize. - First prize.

833
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,000
 - Third prize.

834
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,240
 - Well, they try and encourage women to get into it, aren't they?

835
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,320
 - Second prize, wanna see my sausage.

836
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,720
 (laughing)

837
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,560
 - Third prize, t-shirt reading, I got sourced.

838
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,680
 Fourth hat reading, my dad's barbecue.

839
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,040
 But there's a barbecue book of the year.

840
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,880
 - Oh yeah.

841
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,480
 - A barbecue, badass backyard cooking.

842
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,320
 - Oh, dear.

843
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,640
 - Oh, cool.

844
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,280
 - There's even an award for best barbecue audio series.

845
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,960
 There's barbecue podcasts.

846
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,720
 Could we put this section up for it?

847
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,560
 - I think so.

848
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,040
 If we wanna dethrone the smoking hot confessions

849
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,800
 of the BBQ podcast.

850
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,880
 - Well, I definitely wanna check out my rack t-shirt

851
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,160
 or whatever it is, so let's do it.

852
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,760
 (laughing)

853
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,880
 They're massive, the barbecue contest in America.

854
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,360
 They're all run by the Kansas City Barbecue Society

855
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:04,120
 and it's trained over 15,000 judges to judge barbecues

856
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,480
 and the rules are very tight.

857
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,040
 So, judges are not allowed to eat with utensils,

858
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,840
 but you're also not allowed to lick your fingers.

859
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,680
 Why?

860
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
 No one knows.

861
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,120
 You just have fingers covered in like,

862
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,760
 - I do? - Barbecue meat the whole time.

863
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,560
 - How can you eat some ribs

864
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,520
 without licking your fingers?

865
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
 That's unnatural.

866
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,200
 - Well, I think it's not a challenge.

867
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
 - Maybe you have wipes.

868
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
 - Gloves?

869
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,880
 - Yes.

870
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,720
 - I don't even like gloves.

871
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,760
 - They've got the glove culture they want.

872
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,120
 (laughing)

873
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,440
 - Like a snooker referee.

874
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,320
 - I need another 20,000 pounds of linen gloves please, yeah.

875
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,200
 - The scores are on a scale of one to nine,

876
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,920
 but there's no three and four, weirdly.

877
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,760
 (laughing)

878
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,600
 - Come on.

879
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,440
 - Five.

880
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,480
 - What, one, two, five, six, seven and nine.

881
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,320
 - That's so funny.

882
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,600
 - Yeah, five is poor and then two is inedible.

883
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,560
 Nothing in between.

884
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,480
 - That's very funny.

885
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
 - There are various rules.

886
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,480
 To judge a brisket as in a big chest of a cow,

887
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,240
 you have to be able to manipulate it like an accordion.

888
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,160
 - Wow.

889
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
 - Oh.

890
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,840
 - Yeah.

891
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
 - Wow, what a sentence, horrible.

892
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,000
 - I think it's all, I think it's useful.

893
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,920
 - I'm surprised, yeah.

894
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,760
 - Are you?

895
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
 - Because, well, I could play the accordion, right?

896
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,640
 And so you have to move it quite a lot, right?

897
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,200
 And to move a rib cage,

898
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,160
 I don't feel like that would be possible.

899
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,000
 - Yeah.

900
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,320
 - Maybe the rib cage.

901
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,520
 - That's a terrible cheer.

902
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,440
 But if a couple of the rooms have already been broken,

903
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
 let's hope because Daniel Day Lewis

904
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,080
 has been living as the cow.

905
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,560
 (laughing)

906
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
 - Tank, I'll ask you a question.

907
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,400
 - Yeah.

908
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,220
 - Australia.

909
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,060
 - Yeah.

910
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,880
 - You're from there.

911
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,720
 - Yes.

912
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,560
 - Have you ever seen a coin operated barbecue in the past?

913
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,120
 - I was gonna mention this before I was cut off

914
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,560
 for my terrible spelling, which was not terrible.

915
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,000
 In Sydney, we actually have not even coin operated.

916
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,400
 You have free barbecues on most of the beaches

917
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,280
 that you go to.

918
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,640
 So we would go down to Clairville on the weekend.

919
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,360
 You would just press a button and it gets going.

920
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
 And your only thing is to just clean it up.

921
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,400
 - Wait, is it like gas,

922
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
 or do you have to bring your own charcoal?

923
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,840
 - Oh, no, no, yeah, just goes up.

924
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,200
 - Isn't it unhygienic?

925
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,040
 - No, you clean.

926
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,400
 So there's a raw sausages on there.

927
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
 - I kind of think the thing with barbecue

928
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,840
 is it doesn't matter if you drop it in the mud,

929
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,440
 'cause you're cooking it on such a massive, massive heat.

930
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,040
 - It's a thousand degrees.

931
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,360
 What's surviving on that?

932
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,200
 - There's a real pride thing, by the way,

933
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,440
 of you leave it ready for the next person.

934
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,480
 Yeah, it's a thing that is sort of just part of the way.

935
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
 - I see, I see, that's national culture.

936
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,240
 Well, supposedly even some zoos have free barbecues,

937
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,760
 which I feel is open to misuse.

938
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,800
 - What, do you think that's a bit scary

939
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,320
 for the animals just sitting around?

940
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,360
 - Have you seen the wombat?

941
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
 Where's the wombat?

942
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,160
 (laughing)

943
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,740
 (upbeat music)

944
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:29,680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

945
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,480
 and that is Anna.

946
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,760
 - My fact this week is that epileptic fits

947
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,480
 can be triggered by thinking about toothpaste.

948
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,320
 - That's wild.

949
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,160
 - Yeah, not widespread, don't worry.

950
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,000
 - Do you have to have a specific condition

951
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,760
 already for this to happen?

952
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,000
 Epilepsy, I'm assuming.

953
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,800
 (laughing)

954
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,760
 - It is more common epileptics, yes.

955
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,000
 But you ask all the right questions, Andy.

956
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
 That's why we love to have you in the class.

957
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,160
 This, I just came across this paper from 2006,

958
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,360
 which reported on a patient with epilepsy.

959
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,360
 Came across a paper from 2006,

960
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,440
 which reported on a patient with epilepsy

961
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,080
 in which seizures were induced

962
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,560
 both by tooth brushing and by seeing

963
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,320
 or thinking about toothbrush and toothpaste.

964
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,160
 - That's amazing.

965
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,000
 - It's extraordinary.

966
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,680
 - Is that someone who is stressed

967
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
 about the idea of brushing their teeth

968
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,160
 and then the stress brings on it?

969
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,200
 Like, what is bringing it on?

970
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
 - I don't, well, it's very mysterious,

971
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,000
 and I don't think it's quite that.

972
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
 It's a type of reflex epilepsy,

973
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,600
 which is epilepsy that's triggered by something,

974
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,320
 and this type is called thinking epilepsy,

975
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,360
 and it's where thinking about something,

976
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,640
 and I don't think it's necessarily something

977
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
 that causes you stress,

978
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,760
 but thinking about a certain thing triggers it,

979
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,920
 so there was other cases reported on

980
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,960
 where someone, when they thought about food,

981
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,920
 whenever they thought about food,

982
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,280
 which is quite debilitating.

983
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,960
 - I read about one who, every time they tried to do Sudoku,

984
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,400
 they got an epileptic fit.

985
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,360
 - This seems to be a thing, puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku.

986
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,040
 - Oh yeah, I hate a Sudoku.

987
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,680
 - Yeah, but it's not about hating it.

988
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,880
 I don't know, do you have the lying epilepsy?

989
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,200
 - I'm starting to feel like I might.

990
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,240
 - But is it because there's a particular location

991
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,280
 in your brain where the neurons for toothpaste

992
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,400
 or Sudoku or whatever, or food are kept,

993
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,880
 and there's a crossed wire in there?

994
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,960
 That seems logical, doesn't it?

995
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,400
 But I don't think anyone really knows.

996
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,920
 - No, no, and it is rare, but it is amazing,

997
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,400
 and some people can think themselves into an epileptic fit.

998
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,360
 It just sounds like the most awful thing,

999
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,640
 'cause what is the only thing you can do

1000
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
 when you're told not to think about something,

1001
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,760
 obviously is think about something.

1002
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,520
 If you know that you can't think about this,

1003
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,960
 there was a guy who was taken to hospital,

1004
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,280
 and he had a brain lesion, I think,

1005
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,840
 and he had an epileptic fit,

1006
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,920
 and the only way you could characterize it was,

1007
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,200
 if he started to feel enthusiastic,

1008
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,160
 he would then have a fit.

1009
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,000
 - Oh, interesting.

1010
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,840
 - Can I wonder if you have that?

1011
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,400
 I know we probably never know.

1012
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,240
 - Me.

1013
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,400
 (all laughing)

1014
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,800
 That's why, actually, I play it safe.

1015
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,280
 - So it could be anything, you just got to identify it.

1016
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,920
 - So he's not allowed a hobby?

1017
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,080
 - He's not allowed a hobby that he likes, no.

1018
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,400
 He can do Sudoku to his ask and death, actually,

1019
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,840
 but they actually made him induce one,

1020
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,720
 which does feel quite mean.

1021
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,920
 They were like, "Could you try and replicate the feeling

1022
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,520
 "when you have one so we can have a look?"

1023
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,400
 So he was like, "Okay, I'll make myself feel enthusiastic.

1024
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,600
 "You ready?" - Wow.

1025
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,520
 - Toothpaste?

1026
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,360
 - Yes, please.

1027
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,360
 How do the stripes get in?

1028
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
 (all laughing)

1029
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,960
 - Oh my God, the ultimate question.

1030
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,800
 - Why don't I know?

1031
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,760
 - I believe there's a couple of different ways of doing it.

1032
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
 - Yeah, they got a couple of them.

1033
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,920
 - But my understanding is that the main one,

1034
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,320
 there's a little thing near the nozzle or something.

1035
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,160
 - Oh, it's a paintbrush.

1036
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,600
 - It's disappointingly technical, the explanation,

1037
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,840
 but knowing that it's not like--

1038
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,040
 - Is it not through the back door?

1039
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,480
 - What do you mean through the back door?

1040
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,720
 There's one rope of toothpaste that goes into the tube.

1041
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,920
 - You've got the nozzle at the top,

1042
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,840
 and then you've got the bottom.

1043
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,040
 Maybe that's not closed up when the stuff's put in,

1044
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,880
 and then you seal it up.

1045
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,400
 - What you're saying is that one long string

1046
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,440
 of toothpaste is put in,

1047
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,720
 and it comes out in the same order

1048
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,720
 that it went in the other end.

1049
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,640
 - No, I'm picturing it a bit like Mr. Whippy.

1050
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,320
 - What if you get it wrong and squeeze it the wrong way?

1051
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,400
 - How does it work the opposite way round, though?

1052
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
 'Cause it would mush inside.

1053
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,480
 - It's white on the inside, up to near the nozzle end,

1054
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,240
 and then the color, or colors,

1055
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,640
 this is one way of doing it, the colors are up at that end,

1056
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,560
 and it's a very thin pipe.

1057
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,600
 So as you squeeze from the back end,

1058
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,280
 the white goes up through the nozzle,

1059
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,960
 but the color bit is also pressed out

1060
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
 through the holes in the sides,

1061
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,000
 and joins the main white bit.

1062
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,840
 - Cool.

1063
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,760
 - And the main bit is white,

1064
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,560
 and the other colors then are the garnish.

1065
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,400
 - That's fantastic.

1066
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
 - I love it.

1067
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,180
 I never knew that.

1068
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,480
 - So if you don't like the colors,

1069
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,240
 if you get a bit perturbed when you spit it out,

1070
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,320
 and it looks like your mouth is bleeding,

1071
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,080
 you can cut your toothpaste tube in half,

1072
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,480
 and then just use the bottom of it, and it's just white.

1073
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,820
 - That's what I do.

1074
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,400
 Think of someone who could have had a tube of toothpaste,

1075
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,800
 right, a famous person in history.

1076
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,120
 - Margaret Thatcher.

1077
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,120
 - She could, yes, even more impressively,

1078
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,320
 even further back on that.

1079
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,520
 - Jim Callaghan.

1080
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,920
 - Julius Caesar.

1081
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,320
 - Yes, Jim Callaghan, no, do this.

1082
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
 (laughing)

1083
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
 - Wilson.

1084
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,560
 - Harold Wilson, yep.

1085
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,760
 You're just doing PMs.

1086
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
 - Yeah, just going backwards.

1087
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
 - I think even before Balfour,

1088
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,840
 she could have had it, yeah.

1089
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,480
 - I don't know if designing quiz formats is for you.

1090
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,920
 - Lord Salisbury.

1091
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,760
 - Oh, God.

1092
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,600
 - No.

1093
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:11,560
 - Was it between Disraeli's first term

1094
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,120
 and Disraeli's second term?

1095
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,280
 - No, it's after all of Disraelian Gladstone.

1096
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,600
 Campbell Bannerman probably could have had, who?

1097
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,440
 - Wow.

1098
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,800
 - He was a turn of the 20th century Prime Minister.

1099
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,640
 - Atlee.

1100
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,160
 - Yeah, we must say that atlee could have done, James.

1101
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,120
 You're not catching up.

1102
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,040
 You're not playing the game at all well,

1103
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,640
 which is surprising to me, 'cause it's such a good game.

1104
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,160
 (laughing)

1105
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,520
 - What's your point toothpaste

1106
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,880
 that was invented 100 years ago?

1107
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,560
 - How young, Joan Rivers?

1108
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,960
 - Let's trust him, yeah, all of these people.

1109
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,040
 So what I'm trying to say is that the squeezy toothpaste tube,

1110
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,000
 the collapsible toothpaste tube,

1111
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,760
 was invented in roughly the 1880s, '90s.

1112
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
 So Queen Victoria could have had a tube of toothpaste,

1113
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,880
 which just makes you think, doesn't it?

1114
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,520
 - What does it make me think?

1115
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,800
 - Well, it's just the tube of toothpaste

1116
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
 is older than we might think it is, you know?

1117
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,080
 James thought Clement Atlee was the earliest

1118
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
 Prime Minister who could have had one.

1119
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,200
 But actually, 1880, a dentist from Connecticut,

1120
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,040
 confusingly he was called Sheffield, launched it.

1121
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,520
 And then it was launched in York,

1122
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,800
 confusingly the place in 1896.

1123
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,160
 So other people who could have enjoyed it

1124
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,240
 include Adolf Sachs, Friedrich Engels,

1125
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,040
 William Morris and Rutherford B. Hayes.

1126
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,400
 - Goni women there who cleaned the teeth in there.

1127
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
 - Queen Victoria, I think was the opener.

1128
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,840
 - I stopped him.

1129
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,840
 - Queen Victoria, Queen Victoria, great.

1130
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,600
 Here's a worrying thing for toothpaste, possibly.

1131
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,840
 Do you know that sails have dropped by a lot?

1132
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,760
 Some say almost half since the late '90s.

1133
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,600
 - What?

1134
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,480
 - Yeah, now riddle me this.

1135
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,640
 - Is it that people used to have much bigger toothbrushes?

1136
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,600
 - You got in one, electric toothbrushes.

1137
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,440
 - Oh, wow!

1138
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,760
 - Electric toothbrushes have such a small little surface area

1139
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,500
 if you put it on that you're not squeezing as much.

1140
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,040
 And also the rise of the two for one

1141
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,680
 or three for two promotion

1142
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,280
 has absolutely knocked out sails for them as well.

1143
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,840
 But it's literally that we're using it

1144
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,720
 almost half the amount that we usually would.

1145
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,480
 - I'm so surprised, 'cause I don't think a high proportion

1146
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,120
 of people use electric toothbrushes.

1147
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,360
 I'm surprised that it's half.

1148
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,200
 Do you guys?

1149
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,860
 - Well, so the promotions as well, the promotions.

1150
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,680
 - I don't, but I tend to just cover my whole flannel

1151
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,760
 with toothpaste and rub that round my mouth.

1152
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,600
 - Well, do you know--

1153
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,680
 - So I'm probably keeping the industry going.

1154
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,040
 - That would work.

1155
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,600
 And this is his, you don't need to put it

1156
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
 on a brush or anything.

1157
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,960
 And this is something that will really send

1158
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,140
 toothpaste sales plummeting.

1159
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,900
 If they were worried before about this drop,

1160
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,720
 it's totally pointless.

1161
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,440
 - What's happened to your teeth, Adam?

1162
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,280
 - Toothbrush.

1163
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,320
 - Toothpaste.

1164
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,160
 - What?

1165
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,820
 - So, study after study.

1166
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,880
 If you're looking at removing plaque,

1167
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,040
 study after study, like dozens and dozens of studies,

1168
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,820
 very, very reliable, broad studies,

1169
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,460
 look at the difference between toothbrushing

1170
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,000
 without any toothpaste and toothbrushing with toothpaste,

1171
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,300
 and there is absolutely no difference.

1172
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,380
 - Your teeth are gonna be stronger if you use fluoride.

1173
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,640
 - So the only thing is, the fluoride in toothpaste

1174
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,560
 is in the long term, good for your teeth,

1175
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,880
 only if you do the thing that I've always known

1176
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,560
 you should do, but can't bring myself to do,

1177
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,920
 which is not rinse at the end.

1178
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,360
 Do you guys all not rinse?

1179
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,600
 - I do now, having learned this,

1180
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,120
 'cause we talked about this from QI coming up.

1181
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,460
 - Oh, did we?

1182
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,920
 But yeah, it is quite interesting,

1183
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,560
 'cause I think, and there are so many ingredients,

1184
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,900
 but it is literally the only thing

1185
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,040
 is fluoride that does anything,

1186
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,620
 unless except like breath-smelling of mint.

1187
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,200
 'Cause you get a fluoride-free toothpaste,

1188
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,180
 which I do have friends who use,

1189
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,480
 and I'm not judging them, 'cause they're my friends.

1190
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,540
 - Yeah, but you can't invite them to the barbecue

1191
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,300
 'cause they can't get through the meat.

1192
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,820
 - How is RFK?

1193
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,980
 Is he all right?

1194
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,060
 It's so interesting how we got fluoride in toothpaste,

1195
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,220
 and in fact in water.

1196
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,660
 In 1901, there was a young dentist called Frederick Mackay,

1197
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,860
 and he moved to Colorado Springs in America,

1198
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,380
 and he found that people there had a thing called,

1199
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,840
 have you heard of Colorado brown stain?

1200
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,940
 - Well, I wouldn't buy that toothpaste, Brad.

1201
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,240
 - Isn't that one of the spots, team,

1202
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,980
 the Colorado brown stains?

1203
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,820
 - Yes, that's right.

1204
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,540
 - Go brown stains, yeah, yeah.

1205
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,080
 This is insane, 90% of children had it.

1206
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,480
 Almost no one in the rest of America

1207
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,360
 had Colorado brown stain, or any kind of brown stain.

1208
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,880
 The water was tested.

1209
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,520
 Turns out the water was very high on fluoride, right?

1210
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,180
 Particular towns of particular water sources

1211
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,040
 had awful brown stain, but the good thing was,

1212
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,760
 they did some experiments, Mackay and Et El,

1213
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,100
 and they found that basically this water-borne fluoride

1214
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,580
 changed the color of your tooth enamel,

1215
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,180
 but it also made this mottled tooth enamel

1216
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,740
 that people have was very resistant to decay.

1217
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
 And so they started thinking, okay, we pop a little bit,

1218
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,660
 these kids have rock hard teeth, basically.

1219
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,540
 And they thought, if we put the right amount

1220
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:38,380
 of fluoride in the water, you won't get discolored teeth,

1221
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,100
 but you will get strong teeth.

1222
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,780
 And the year after the first place,

1223
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,580
 Grand Rapids in Michigan got fluoride,

1224
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,940
 the number of cavities dropped 60%.

1225
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,260
 It's one of the most effective

1226
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
 health interventions ever made.

1227
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,480
 It's like that thing in Switzerland,

1228
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,960
 where everyone had goiters on their neck,

1229
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,200
 and then they started putting iodine in the salt,

1230
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,860
 just overnight changed it.

1231
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,280
 - Well, and bizarrely, we don't do it everywhere in Britain,

1232
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,780
 which I actually didn't realize until recently.

1233
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,620
 - Not everywhere, no.

1234
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,880
 - And lots, in fact, in most places, we don't do it.

1235
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,800
 But does that mean we should actually,

1236
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,120
 or good teeth, mottled brown teeth?

1237
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,480
 Like really, if we want super strong teeth,

1238
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,820
 why not triple the fluoride?

1239
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,180
 - I think you can have too much fluoride.

1240
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,240
 - You definitely can, there are advisory levels.

1241
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,840
 And people go a bit nuts about it, obviously.

1242
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,080
 There's lots of stuff online about it.

1243
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,280
 When it was installed in Grand Rapids in 1945,

1244
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,040
 lots of people said, "This fluoride,

1245
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,280
 it's giving me sore teeth and sore enamel,

1246
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,620
 and it's really bad."

1247
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,460
 And they were told,

1248
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,440
 "Yes, we haven't actually put the fluoride in the water yet."

1249
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,420
 That's happening in a few weeks, yeah.

1250
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,880
 - So we know now that there's no toothpaste

1251
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,900
 before Campbell Benjamin.

1252
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,160
 - Well, there's no tubes, right?

1253
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,000
 - It's usable tubes.

1254
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,840
 - Yeah, okay.

1255
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,700
 But what did the Romans do to keep their mouth nice

1256
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,000
 and healthy, what they use as mouthwash?

1257
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,480
 - Oh, like urine.

1258
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,720
 - So there is this sort of factoid

1259
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,260
 that Romans used urine from Portugal as mouthwash.

1260
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,880
 (laughing)

1261
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,800
 And it is put across by lots of popular historians,

1262
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,880
 but it's really probably not true.

1263
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,240
 Like if you look for any classical evidence,

1264
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,160
 there is a mention by Catalyst, and it's a poem,

1265
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,880
 but he's mocking someone and he's saying,

1266
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,120
 "Oh yeah, you're in Spain, you've been to Spain,

1267
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,280
 so you probably wash your mouth with urine."

1268
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,120
 - Oh, okay, right.

1269
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,720
 - And it might be that maybe some people in Spain did that,

1270
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,840
 but this is a satirical sort of taking the piss.

1271
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,040
 Really, they didn't do this.

1272
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,160
 - You mean not only not Portuguese urine,

1273
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,360
 they probably didn't use urine in general.

1274
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,680
 - Probably not, nah.

1275
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,280
 Otherwise, why would you take the piss out of someone

1276
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,400
 for doing it, having just been to Nigeria?

1277
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,840
 - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

1278
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,880
 I thought you were saying like,

1279
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,680
 it's a myth that they imported large quantities

1280
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,040
 of Portuguese urine, and actually,

1281
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,760
 they just used good old fashioned Roman urine.

1282
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,600
 (laughing)

1283
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,200
 But you're saying no urine was probably involved.

1284
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
 - No, I don't think there's any urine involved.

1285
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,600
 - There's only often they introduce the urine tariffs,

1286
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,360
 of course, starting getting good at making their own.

1287
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:47,400
 - There's a lot of old methods to clean your teeth

1288
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,120
 and alleviate toothache before it was a paste.

1289
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,920
 It was powder, so we were all using powder toothpaste.

1290
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,920
 One of my favorite ones, if not my favorite,

1291
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,920
 is you would use the ground up ashes of a wolf's head.

1292
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,840
 But what you say is when you find that dead wolf

1293
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,680
 and you get its head in order to mash it up and use that,

1294
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,160
 it is a well-known fact too,

1295
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,600
 that there are bones generally found

1296
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,080
 in the excrement of that animal.

1297
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,160
 These bones attached to an amulet

1298
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,880
 are protective as well.

1299
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,040
 There's a lot going on.

1300
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,160
 - It's an undertaking, isn't it?

1301
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,120
 (laughing)

1302
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,880
 - It's laborious every night, I guess.

1303
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,440
 Yeah, you gotta add a toothpaste.

1304
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,880
 - Honestly, compared to,

1305
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,720
 'cause I've literally been to the dentist two days ago,

1306
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,680
 and compared to that, I'll take the wolf crap.

1307
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,480
 - You'll follow a wolf run until it does a shit,

1308
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,880
 immediately kill it, turn the shit into a necklace.

1309
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,560
 - Rather than an hour and a half of drilling,

1310
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,400
 yeah, I'll go for it.

1311
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,880
 - Fair enough.

1312
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,000
 - My dentist said, "Mr. Harkin, you have a very strong tongue."

1313
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,040
 (laughing)

1314
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,200
 - Wow, wow, would you like to join my gentleman's rub club?

1315
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,440
 (laughing)

1316
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,020
 (upbeat music)

1317
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:56,040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1318
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,520
 and that is James.

1319
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,440
 - Okay, my fact this week is that things

1320
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,520
 that French newspapers were censored

1321
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,280
 from mentioning during World War I included,

1322
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,480
 any use of the word peace without the word victorious,

1323
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,080
 any mention of the cold weather,

1324
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,880
 in case it reminded people about the shortage of coal,

1325
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,520
 and any reference of a meeting

1326
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,520
 between the president's wife and a wild ape.

1327
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,760
 - I mean, what twist?

1328
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
 - And did that reference a specific occasion,

1329
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,120
 or was it just in case anyone--

1330
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,840
 - It did, it did, yeah, there was an incident

1331
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,600
 involving Henriette Poincaré,

1332
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,800
 who was the wife of the president.

1333
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,440
 And on the Wikipedia for the Alise Palace,

1334
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,000
 it says in 1917, a chimpanzee escaped

1335
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
 from a nearby menagerie, entered the palace,

1336
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,120
 and was said to have tried to hold the wife

1337
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,000
 of president Raymond Poincaré into a tree,

1338
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,120
 only to be foiled by the guards.

1339
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,160
 And-- - How strong was it

1340
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,440
 that he could have held her into a tree?

1341
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,560
 - Oh, what chimpanzees? - I know chimpanzees are strong,

1342
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,600
 but that's bulky.

1343
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,480
 - A teenage girl chimpanzee would beat you in an arm wrestle.

1344
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,360
 - I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it.

1345
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,880
 - I know you've been bulking up.

1346
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,200
 - Thank you, I think a teenage human girl

1347
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,040
 would probably beat Andy in an arm wrestle.

1348
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,440
 Oh wow, it's going there, are we?

1349
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,920
 - Can I celebrate strong women, Dan?

1350
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,040
 I'm sorry you don't.

1351
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,400
 (all laughing)

1352
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,120
 - Wow, in the metaphorical arm wrestle,

1353
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,920
 but in this discussion, you just got slammed.

1354
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,760
 - I got beat shitless, yeah.

1355
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,040
 - So I read this on Wikipedia,

1356
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
 and I looked for some contemporary reports,

1357
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,280
 and I found this mention,

1358
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,400
 actually this was from the 1930s they mentioned it,

1359
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,240
 it was in the London Diary,

1360
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,920
 and it was things that you were not allowed to mention

1361
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,120
 in 1916 in France in World War I.

1362
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,440
 So that seemed to be that it might have happened,

1363
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,160
 but then I went further back

1364
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,480
 and found some reports in 1916 in the American press,

1365
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,520
 and this definitely did happen.

1366
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,560
 And the Baron Henri de Rothschild

1367
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,800
 had a place near the Elisae Palace,

1368
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,440
 and he'd been to the Far East,

1369
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,920
 which means that maybe this might have been

1370
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,880
 an orangutan, we think.

1371
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,400
 He brought it to his home near the Elisae Palace,

1372
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,680
 and it had escaped.

1373
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,520
 - Oh my God.

1374
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,880
 - And I read one account in the Oldie magazine,

1375
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,040
 a bit more recently, that said,

1376
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,040
 "The ape wrapped her in his embrace,

1377
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,440
 took her by the waist,

1378
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,200
 and attempted to carry her up a tree."

1379
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,280
 - That was like King Kong.

1380
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,720
 - It is King Kong, that's it.

1381
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,040
 - And then apparently, Poincaré, the president,

1382
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,720
 he apparently put the orangutan up

1383
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,000
 against the firing squad.

1384
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,400
 - No, according to one article.

1385
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,800
 - Which is still King Kong.

1386
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,040
 That's the exact quote.

1387
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,280
 - So I mean, whether that's all true or not,

1388
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,720
 like it definitely was reported in 1916 when it happened.

1389
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,560
 - 'Cause it's really hard, isn't it?

1390
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,000
 'Cause it was censored from the French press.

1391
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,280
 - Yes, you've picked a really hard factor, especially.

1392
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,480
 - But it was mentioned in the world press around the time.

1393
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,160
 And apparently, President Deschanel, who came after him,

1394
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,520
 he was so impressed by the ape

1395
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,680
 that he took to jumping in trees during state receptions.

1396
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,760
 - Oh, wow.

1397
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,480
 - But he was the one who went a bit crazy.

1398
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,560
 - He was very mad, wasn't he?

1399
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,480
 - Deschanel was the manic pixie dream president, wasn't he?

1400
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,720
 He was, he was the one who woke up on a train,

1401
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,320
 opened the window, fell out of it,

1402
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,200
 as it was going 35 miles an hour.

1403
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,040
 They didn't know until the next morning that he was gone.

1404
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,640
 And he was found by a local rail guy who,

1405
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,120
 he was saying, "I'm the president of France."

1406
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,080
 He goes, "Sure, mate, sure, okay."

1407
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,760
 Brings him to his home and they just keep him there

1408
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,680
 until he convinces them that he is, yeah.

1409
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,080
 - And then later on, he left the palace

1410
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,760
 to go into the gardens and started chatting

1411
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,600
 to a park worker, but he had no trousers on.

1412
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,120
 And then he stepped into an ornamental fountain

1413
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,600
 thinking it was a bath.

1414
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,920
 And then he resigned.

1415
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:30,680
 - Yeah, he was in the stress of the job.

1416
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,520
 - No, in fairness, like we think now

1417
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,520
 that he had some sort of really awful

1418
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,520
 sort of sleep deprivation illness.

1419
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,560
 - Help in a syndrome, I think it was called sleep.

1420
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,960
 Sleep drunkenness is a, yeah.

1421
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,840
 - But yeah, it was basically he would never,

1422
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,520
 he couldn't go into REM sleep or anything.

1423
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,680
 So even when he slept,

1424
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,680
 he just wasn't getting his brain refreshed.

1425
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
 - Oh boy, what a pain.

1426
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,440
 - It's so weird 'cause he lasted a long time being fine.

1427
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,480
 And then as soon as he became president.

1428
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,080
 - Maybe the stress did do something for it.

1429
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,160
 - Yeah, his wife was called Jermaine.

1430
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,080
 And I just think I've blown something open

1431
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,280
 but I don't quite know what because she's,

1432
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,600
 so Jermaine Deschanel was there.

1433
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,080
 She was a society lady.

1434
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,600
 She looks like she would have been so good at entertaining

1435
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,120
 'cause your whole role as first lady then

1436
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:15,360
 was throwing big parties and she was brilliant at that.

1437
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,160
 So such a shame he only lasted about a minute as president.

1438
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,240
 But she's called Jermaine.

1439
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,760
 They were married in St. Jermaine church

1440
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,040
 and he first went mad in St. Jermaine forest.

1441
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,960
 - All right, so what's your theory?

1442
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:31,960
 - Well, I was throwing something open

1443
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,800
 but I don't know what it is.

1444
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:33,640
 - Is this like the Peckham Butcher?

1445
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,640
 Do you think she doesn't exist?

1446
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,720
 - Well, she is the devil or something

1447
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,120
 who she drove him mad by embodying a forest

1448
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,120
 and then a church.

1449
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,520
 - I think it's a very Jermaine theory.

1450
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,760
 - Oh yeah.

1451
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,400
 - And there's the missing piece.

1452
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,720
 - Yes.

1453
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,560
 - The pun.

1454
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,040
 (all laughing)

1455
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,240
 - You need for any conspiracy theory to be the pun.

1456
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,520
 - So this original president's wife,

1457
00:46:58,520 --> 00:46:59,880
 the one who bumped into the orangutan

1458
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,480
 was Madame Poincaré, right?

1459
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,880
 She was, so Mr. Poincaré,

1460
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,680
 her, him indoors, was Raymond who was president,

1461
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,040
 very presently, president for the whole

1462
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,120
 First World War and some years on either side,

1463
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,560
 PM three times as well over a longer period,

1464
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,880
 like really, very imminent.

1465
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,040
 - And then came back to be president again,

1466
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,160
 I think, afterwards.

1467
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,000
 - Wow.

1468
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,040
 Yeah, I mean, so like amazing political career.

1469
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,040
 So he would have had tube toothpaste.

1470
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,180
 - Right?

1471
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,400
 - He would have had tube toothpaste.

1472
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,720
 - Yeah.

1473
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,640
 - So his cousin was Henri Poincaré,

1474
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,200
 mathematician, who James, you might?

1475
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,320
 - Oh, of conjecture fame.

1476
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,400
 - Of conjecture fame, and I'm putting big quotes on that.

1477
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,600
 - Poincaré, conjecture.

1478
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,120
 - So he's, yeah, he's really famous, right?

1479
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,960
 - Oh yeah.

1480
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:39,800
 - In maths world.

1481
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,640
 - In maths world, yeah.

1482
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,480
 - So I just love this, this is a slight sidebar,

1483
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,720
 but he was in a picture, Henri Poincaré,

1484
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,800
 which is known as the most intelligent photo ever taken.

1485
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,640
 - So there are lots of smart people in it.

1486
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,480
 - Exactly.

1487
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,840
 - More than that one from the Oscars

1488
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,600
 with Ellen the generous in it.

1489
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,960
 - Amazingly, no, that one,

1490
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,760
 that was not the most intelligent photo I've taken,

1491
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,160
 but this was in 1927.

1492
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,760
 So it was the previous record holder.

1493
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,000
 Can we guess who's in the photo?

1494
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,840
 Would we know?

1495
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,680
 - Let's say Einstein.

1496
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,880
 - Let's say Einstein.

1497
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,160
 I'll give you a clue.

1498
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,400
 - Neil's bar.

1499
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,720
 - Can I give you the clue?

1500
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,560
 - Wait.

1501
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,400
 - Proust.

1502
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,240
 - Please wait.

1503
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,080
 - Marie Curie.

1504
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:14,920
 - Hugo.

1505
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,240
 - I mean, you kind of hit all of them.

1506
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,480
 - The 1927 Solvay conference on quantum mechanics,

1507
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,760
 which was held in Brussels, attracted,

1508
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,840
 there were 29 people in this photo,

1509
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,640
 17 of whom got Nobel prizes.

1510
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,480
 - Oh my God.

1511
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,320
 - The photo was stunning.

1512
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,200
 So you said Einstein.

1513
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,560
 You said Marie Curie.

1514
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,680
 You said Dirac.

1515
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,040
 Someone said Paul Dirac.

1516
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,320
 Neil's ball, Max Planck, Heisenberg,

1517
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,440
 Erwin Trödinger, August Picard.

1518
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,600
 Like everybody, 17 of them got no bells.

1519
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,440
 And just Picard.

1520
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,280
 - Wow.

1521
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,120
 - I know.

1522
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,120
 Yeah, Picard, yeah, yeah.

1523
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,000
 But there's just one photo of the,

1524
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
 maybe the most intelligent conference

1525
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,840
 that's ever happened.

1526
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,160
 - It wasn't in the.

1527
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,000
 - And Poincaré was in it.

1528
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,840
 - Oh, he took it.

1529
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,660
 He was in it.

1530
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,500
 - He was one of the.

1531
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,320
 - Wow.

1532
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,160
 - There were people in it.

1533
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,000
 - And that's lots of nuclear physicists

1534
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
 of that period as well, right?

1535
00:48:59,000 --> 00:48:59,840
 - Right.

1536
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,680
 - 'Cause I wonder if the phrase,

1537
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,760
 "If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now,"

1538
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,600
 would have been used.

1539
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,760
 - I'm afraid the atomic bomb hadn't been invented.

1540
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,600
 - No, no, no.

1541
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,440
 Okay.

1542
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,260
 Well, a bomb.

1543
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,100
 - Is there a phrase that says,

1544
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,440
 "If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now"?

1545
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,720
 - No, I was just adding that to the bomb.

1546
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,640
 If a bomb hit this.

1547
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,960
 - If a bomb, right.

1548
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1549
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,680
 - If a bomb hit this recording studio we're in right now,

1550
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,140
 no effect on global history.

1551
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,120
 (all laughing)

1552
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,960
 - Do yourself that.

1553
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,020
 - Although next year's top barbecue podcast

1554
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,340
 might be short one candidate.

1555
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,460
 (all laughing)

1556
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,860
 Can I just ask quickly the censorship over that story,

1557
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:35,620
 is it because it wasn't so much that it was embarrassing?

1558
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,460
 It's just that no matter what interview they gave,

1559
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,580
 the journalist was just desperate to say.

1560
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,420
 - You know what Dan?

1561
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,660
 Like I really, I did a lot of very, very in-depth research

1562
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,900
 on this and it's very difficult to research,

1563
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,900
 but I think it was because they were trying to keep morale

1564
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,260
 up in the country.

1565
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,600
 I can't think of anything that would improve morale more

1566
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,980
 than if I found out what's the name Starmer

1567
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,780
 that was attacked by a cheetah

1568
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,060
 in the background down on the street.

1569
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,180
 (all laughing)

1570
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,600
 - Well, I think also like it could denigrate his authority.

1571
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,940
 - Yeah, right.

1572
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,180
 Like they're quite good about,

1573
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,000
 well rather they're quite strict about private lives

1574
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:12,840
 in France in particular.

1575
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,680
 - Yeah, that's true.

1576
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,500
 - But you're right.

1577
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,340
 And it's sort of a leading industrialist as well.

1578
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,480
 It's like if Alan Sugar's pet Komodo dragon

1579
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,120
 had temporarily abducted Mrs. Starmer.

1580
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,180
 - And Starmer's had it shot by a firing squad.

1581
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,260
 - Yes. - Lovely.

1582
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,120
 - She, Madame Poincaré, she was quite controversial.

1583
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,440
 In fact, the Queen of England was very snobbish

1584
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,900
 about her, Queen Mary.

1585
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,000
 They did an official visit in 1914

1586
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,940
 and she refused to be seen with her at first.

1587
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,380
 - Sorry, that's just grinning away

1588
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,380
 at the thought of Queen Mary

1589
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,000
 using some collapsible toothpaste tubes.

1590
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,260
 - I was about to say, how did you know?

1591
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,620
 - 'Cause I had the same thought then.

1592
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,280
 (all laughing)

1593
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,740
 - I don't know the state of her dental hygiene.

1594
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,940
 All I know is I'm trying to make the serious point

1595
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:57,100
 that the English, the Brits were very snobbish

1596
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,300
 because Madame Poincaré, she was very old when she married.

1597
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,380
 This wasn't why they disapproved.

1598
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,620
 This is sort of why I disapproved when I read about the story.

1599
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,460
 She was in her, she was 46

1600
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,740
 and the primus was a bit younger.

1601
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,140
 So Queen Mary refused to share a carriage with her

1602
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,860
 because she was divorced and her first husband

1603
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,060
 was a cab driver who was still alive.

1604
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:16,380
 - Oh, okay. - Unbelievable.

1605
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,500
 - It's showing because they could have run

1606
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,760
 with the headline Cougar attacked by chimpanzee.

1607
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,840
 (all laughing)

1608
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,680
 - Very good.

1609
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,720
 - I mean, that mirrors current prime minister,

1610
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,600
 sorry, Brigitte Macron.

1611
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,440
 - The French are into it, yeah.

1612
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,160
 - And they're also into presidents

1613
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,920
 having lots of mistresses all the way.

1614
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,520
 François Hollande, he had four children

1615
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:37,600
 with his long-term partner,

1616
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000
 but then when he became president,

1617
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,200
 moved in with his mistress, Valérie Truvile.

1618
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,400
 But then he cheated on her with an actor

1619
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,100
 with an actress and it was really funny

1620
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,860
 'cause he went off to see this actress

1621
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,700
 with a motorcycle helmet on his head

1622
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,420
 thinking that no one would be able to tell it was him.

1623
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,960
 But he wore the same pair of socks

1624
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,220
 that he'd been wearing at a recent international visit.

1625
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,100
 So the photographers took a photo of him

1626
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,780
 and went, "I recognize those socks."

1627
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,180
 - Whoa. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1628
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,380
 - That was bad luck.

1629
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:09,460
 - What does the sock say, president of France?

1630
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,820
 Like what was-- (all laughing)

1631
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,260
 - It must have been quite distinctive.

1632
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,100
 - I think it must have been

1633
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,740
 'cause most socks are just quite plain.

1634
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,560
 - Most male professionals wear plain black socks.

1635
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,640
 - That's why I always wear plain black socks

1636
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:22,840
 is so I can get away with being a cat.

1637
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,560
 - What socks I'm wearing?

1638
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,460
 - Just a shagger on your socks, James.

1639
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,180
 (all laughing)

1640
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,040
 - I'm wearing part of a girl's socks,

1641
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,840
 which I reckon if, oh, look at Dan's.

1642
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,040
 He's got bright yellow ones.

1643
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,160
 - James, you must be the only man

1644
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,120
 in London wearing those socks today.

1645
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,760
 - I know, if I have an affair.

1646
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,840
 - Yeah, you're screwed.

1647
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,160
 - Dan, what's that?

1648
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,680
 - It's blast skateboards.

1649
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,000
 It's their logo.

1650
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,880
 I am the only man wearing this in London today,

1651
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,060
 but because of them, I will not be having an affair.

1652
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,420
 - I think the same applies to James.

1653
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,780
 - Show you mine, plain black.

1654
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:52,940
 - Lovely, lovely.

1655
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,820
 - If you see a man having an affair

1656
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:57,100
 and playing back socks, you know it's not me or Dan.

1657
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,000
 - No, and if they've got a little garter

1658
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,060
 and they're tighter than me, you'll know it's me.

1659
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:02,740
 (all laughing)

1660
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,940
 He is not, I don't mean to be rude about him,

1661
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,260
 but he's not David Gandhi.

1662
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,100
 - Oland, who's saying?

1663
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,940
 - Oland, yeah.

1664
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,140
 He's an example of power being a great aphrodisiac.

1665
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,420
 You know, he's sort of just a very average-looking dude

1666
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,020
 who happened to be the president of France.

1667
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,120
 - He's not David Gandhi, is that the best?

1668
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,960
 - Yeah, I don't know.

1669
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,560
 Is that Mahatma Gandhi's brother?

1670
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:20,320
 - He's Mahatma Gandhi's, yeah, yeah.

1671
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,120
 Mahatma Gandhi had taken his well-man pills.

1672
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,600
 He would have looked like David.

1673
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,160
 - David's one of my top-end model, male model.

1674
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,100
 - He's an underpan model.

1675
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,600
 - Right. - Oh, yeah.

1676
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
 - Okay, yeah.

1677
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:33,040
 - Is this the first ever modern popular culture reference

1678
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,320
 that Andy's ever said on the podcast?

1679
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,320
 - I think it might be, yeah.

1680
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,960
 - Maybe that none of us have, well, I've got it,

1681
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,320
 but like that you two haven't heard it.

1682
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,640
 - I can't believe you haven't, Hannah.

1683
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,640
 - He's sort of a famous guy.

1684
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,040
 - You think I know a lot of male underpan models?

1685
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,780
 - He might get a magazine or something, I don't know.

1686
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,020
 - Right, yeah.

1687
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,860
 - But Jack Chirac, President of France?

1688
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:49,700
 - Yeah.

1689
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,940
 - He muddled the pants.

1690
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,300
 - Well, he might as well have done.

1691
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
 I mean, he certainly showed his pants off a lot.

1692
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,140
 - Did he?

1693
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:57,180
 - He, when he was mayor of Paris in the 1980s,

1694
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,140
 he ordered the city council to buy him a coat

1695
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,340
 fitted with a bedroom so he could meet lovers

1696
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,500
 on official engagement.

1697
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,340
 - Oh, wow.

1698
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,540
 - Sorry, a coat fitted with a bedroom.

1699
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,380
 - Coat.

1700
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:06,580
 - Coat, right?

1701
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,700
 - Coat like a bus.

1702
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,340
 - Like a national express.

1703
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,580
 (laughing)

1704
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,680
 - Like a mega bus.

1705
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,520
 - Like a mega bus.

1706
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,240
 - A really mega bus.

1707
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,720
 - Was that so he could have lots of affairs

1708
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,520
 not just so he could sleep between?

1709
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,880
 - No, it was specifically so he could meet lovers.

1710
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,280
 - Did he say that?

1711
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,040
 - Well, he had his private jet when he was president,

1712
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,160
 had a room that was for trists.

1713
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,000
 - Lovely.

1714
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,120
 He has the weirdest thing, which made me sort of warm to him.

1715
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,920
 So Jack and Bernadette, his wife,

1716
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,560
 brought a Vietnamese refugee to live with them

1717
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,360
 and sort of adopted a Vietnamese refugee.

1718
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,540
 And it was on a whim.

1719
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,620
 So this woman was called Anne Dow Traxel.

1720
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,660
 She was actually about 20.

1721
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,260
 But she'd escaped from a refugee camp in 1979

1722
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,220
 when the Vietnamese were having a not very good time.

1723
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:53,820
 And she was crying in the corner of an airport in France.

1724
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,060
 And Jack Shorak saw her, approached her,

1725
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,180
 and said, "Don't cry, my dear,

1726
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,780
 from now on you'll live with us."

1727
00:54:58,780 --> 00:54:59,980
 - Hmm, okay.

1728
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,420
 I've got a special bedroom on the jumper.

1729
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:02,260
 - Yeah.

1730
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:03,100
 (laughing)

1731
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,500
 - Can I tell you one French heroine I found out,

1732
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,980
 she wasn't First Lady of France or anything,

1733
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:08,540
 but just in the course of researching her,

1734
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,240
 so I found out about her, 'cause she was amazing.

1735
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,600
 Her name was Valerie André.

1736
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,560
 She died this year in February.

1737
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,400
 She was the wife of President Peter André,

1738
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,240
 wasn't she?

1739
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,080
 - She was.

1740
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:20,720
 And she was a mysterious girl.

1741
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:21,560
 She died this year.

1742
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,760
 She was 102 years old, right?

1743
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,460
 So she lived 1923 to 2025.

1744
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,200
 She was, in this order, a brain surgeon, a parachutist,

1745
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,120
 and the first woman to fly helicopter missions

1746
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,480
 in combat zones, and the first French woman

1747
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,320
 to become a general in their army.

1748
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,160
 - Wow.

1749
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,660
 - She would do parachute jumps into combat zones

1750
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,540
 if someone had been wounded, right?

1751
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,780
 You know, she would either do parachute jumps in

1752
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,560
 or she would fly a helicopter in herself,

1753
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,700
 pick up a wounded soldier in the helicopter,

1754
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:49,440
 fly them to hospital, and then she'd say,

1755
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,260
 "Hello, I'm gonna be your surgeon today,"

1756
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,420
 and do the operation on them.

1757
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,260
 - That's amazing.

1758
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,660
 - I just think I was like, imagine that.

1759
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:58,060
 Imagine you're pilot then becoming a surgeon

1760
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,360
 halfway through and patching you up.

1761
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,200
 Just crazy.

1762
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,600
 - I think I would feel less confident in her in both roles.

1763
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,700
 (laughing)

1764
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,300
 - I think you're not putting your full life

1765
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,860
 into being a helicopter pilot or a surgeon, are you?

1766
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,780
 - Would you say that before she made the first incision,

1767
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,980
 or would you maybe wait until?

1768
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,660
 - I'd be like, do we not have someone

1769
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,460
 who studied their whole life as a surgeon

1770
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:20,180
 who could do my surgery, please?

1771
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:22,260
 - Looking at gift horse in the mouth, or what?

1772
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,560
 (laughing)

1773
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,660
 - That's so funny.

1774
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,980
 (laughing)

1775
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,340
 - I'm not gonna sign this consent form.

1776
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,180
 (laughing)

1777
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,760
 (upbeat music)

1778
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,240
 - Okay, that's it.

1779
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:36,220
 That is all of our facts.

1780
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,620
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,480

 All of our previous episodes are up there.

1797
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:08,520
 There's also links to an upcoming live show

1798
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,400
 that we're doing later this year in Sheffield.

1799
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,920
 It is part of the Crossed Wires Festival.

1800
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,720
 That's happening on the 6th of July.

1801
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,960
 Tickets are available.

1802
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,200
 We also have a lot of merch that's up there.

1803
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,320
 We have the entrance to our secret club,

1804
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,000
 which has bonus episodes behind the scenes stuff.

1805
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,480
 It has extra compilations of all the outtakes.

1806
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,200
 From our show, it's called Club Fish.

1807
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,680
 - Is it still $2.99 then?

1808
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,280
 - At the moment, but I am on the brink of changing

1809
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,660
 that, James.

1810
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,020
 So get in quick, get in while that lasts,

1811
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,660
 and yeah, otherwise just come back

1812
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:40,060

1813
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,980

1816
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,720
