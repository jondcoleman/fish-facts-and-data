00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:15.240
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.660
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720
 from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.760
 I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.200
 and Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.200
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.440
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.360
 Starting with fact number one, and that is My Fact.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.960
 My Fact this week is that a lot of the Daniel Day Lewis movie,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.720
 My Left Foot, was filmed using his right foot.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.720
 - What are you saying using?

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.920
 Is that, we're operating the camera with his right foot?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.760
 - Yeah, that's what it sounds like.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.600
 - While he filmed his left foot.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.120
 Yes, and when I say a lot, I also mean some.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 So let's just put this into context.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.660
 This is a movie about an Irish writer

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.320
 and painter called Christy Brown.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.560
 He was born with cerebral palsy,

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.120
 and by the time he was an older kid, he didn't walk,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.680
 he couldn't do much, and he only really could operate

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.440
 by moving his left foot,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520
 particularly the big toe on his left foot.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.320
 As he grew older, he got really excited

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.960
 by the idea of becoming an artist.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.200
 He started to learn to paint,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.120
 and then he started to write a book

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.180
 by using that left toe on a typewriter.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.720
 It was a massive success,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.560
 and this is what eventually became a biopic,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.280
 which starred Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.720
 Now, for anyone who knows Daniel Day-Lewis,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.920
 he's a method actor.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960
 He loves to really immerse himself,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.720
 and in this case, he operated most of the movie

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.760
 from a wheelchair using his left foot.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000
 - Yeah, and when you say method actor,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
 he basically lived as this character

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.200
 throughout the whole time, right?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
 He stayed in the wheelchair the whole time, pretty much.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 Like he had to be carried places.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.240
 - Yeah, made the cast and crew feed him.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.840
 - Well, he just was trying to stay in character,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.800
 but here's the thing.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.800
 The movie involves some quite intense stunts footwork-wise.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 Okay, the movie is not,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.560
 I'm sorry, I watched the film yesterday.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.720
 It's a terrific film.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.880
 Stunts is not a good way to play it.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.720
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.480
 And when you say this movie contains footwork,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.920
 it's not like Ginger Rogers.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.600
 (laughing)

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 - So there's a couple of scenes where he,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 as an actor, was unable to do it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.040
 by manipulating his left foot into the right positions.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.680
 - But so the scenes are basically

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.960
 he's holding a paintbrush or a pencil.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.800
 - Or writing.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.720
 And the first shot of the whole film,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.560
 it's just a shot of a foot.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.160
 And it's taking a vinyl record out of the sleeve.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.000
 - Yeah.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.840
 - And popping it off the turn.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.680
 - So what you're saying, Dan,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 is that he did that with his right foot

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.440
 instead of his left foot.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.280
 - Exactly.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.120
 - Now my question is,

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.640
 how did we not tell the difference in the movie?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 - He has them switched around.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.360
 It's really the opposite way around.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.200
 - That's the method.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.000
 He had to speak seven and then reversed.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.240
 (laughing)

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.200
 - That's exactly it, Andy's got it right.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.440
 It was mirror filmed.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.240
 So the detail is a bit actually quite hard

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.720
 to work out if they flipped the film itself

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 as in they did a mirror image

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.040
 or if they filmed through a mirror.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.880
 - Right, okay.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.400
 - Has anyone else seen it?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.560
 - Yeah, many years ago.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.880
 Good film.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.240
 Weirdly, I read the book about 20 years ago.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.200
 It was also a great book.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.040
 - Did you, right?

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.240
 - Yes, apparently he's a brilliant writer

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.480
 when the book came out,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.120
 which bizarrely was when this guy Christy was,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.240
 Christy Brown was only 22.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.480
 He was so young to be writing about your experiences

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.240
 so far, but I think it was in the 50s.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240
 And when it came out,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.560
 someone said, I think the Irish standard or something,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240
 said that it was the most important book

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.520
 since Ulysses in Ireland.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.360
 - I think that might have been the subsequent book.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.800
 - Sorry, you're absolutely right.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.920
 That was his magnum opus.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 Yes, what's it called?

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.600
 Down on All Days?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.440
 - Down on All Days.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.120
 But I mean, they were both absolutely massive.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.600
 And he was from a family of 22 children,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.440
 not all of whom made it to adulthood.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.800
 - I think 11 did.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.800
 - 11 did, yeah, imagine that.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.640
 Good grief.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.480
 - That's from the birthdays.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.320
 - That's the candles.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.660
 - That's true.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.000
 That's the candles.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.200
 - Oh yeah, I was gonna say you could reuse them,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.040
 but no, you can't reuse them.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.880
 - No, well, you can.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.240
 - Oh, it depends how quickly you light and blow, right?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.080
 - But most birthday candles are so thin.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.120
 Maybe they had a very strict lighting and blowing policy.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.960
 Maybe in the--

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.800
 - You'd have to.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.640
 You'd have to.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.040
 Anyway, it's a very--

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.320
 - Is that in the book?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.040
 - It's like, it's been 20 years, I can't remember.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.880
 It's definitely not an overwritten book though,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.680
 because he's typing it with one toe.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.120
 So he doesn't go for the incredibly long sentence,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.960
 quite a lot of the time.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.600
 - It's kind of the reverse Ulysses, isn't it, in a way?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.840
 - Yes, it is, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.680
 - That was good.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.640
 - And it was a big book, right?

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.840
 So when it came out, it made Splash internationally.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.240
 He actually got no correspondence

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.120
 with this American woman called Beth Moore,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.080
 and he eventually went over to hang out with her,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.600
 and she was married, but they had an affair.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.200
 And this is where he wrote his magnum opus, this novel.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.280
 And she basically is the reason he got it done,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.120
 because at this point,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.640
 he did have a bit of an alcohol problem,

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.400
 and it was preventing him from getting on with stuff.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.080
 She basically said, "You're not allowed to drink

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.000
 "until the end of the day,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.480
 "after you've done a full day's of writing,

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.520
 "and then you can have that."

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.920
 And that's how he got the novel done.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.600
 He dedicates it to her.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.160
 He goes back to Ireland,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.160
 and then they have more correspondence saying--

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.360
 - Is he married as well at the time?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.200
 'Cause he did marry a couple of times.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.040
 - No, he wasn't married at the time.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.880
 - No, 'cause he's not married.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.720
 - He's not married.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.120
 - Yeah, so, but she tells her husband,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.880
 "I'm gonna marry Christy."

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.680
 And just as that's about to happen,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.600
 Christy meets his wife and gets married,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.440
 and then Beth is stuck.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.360
 - So, bit of an asshole, actually.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.960
 You know, people don't really focus on this bit, do they?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.800
 Abandoned poor Beth for his new woman,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.400
 who's the person I think in the film,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.760
 which I haven't seen, but he goes off with a woman

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.280
 at the very end of the film, I think.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.000
 It looks like it's going to be happy.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.520
 But actually, that's the person he went off with.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.440
 And it seems like, based on his life,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.080
 Beth, who helped him write his great novel,

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.120
 was a lovely woman, and he ended up with this other lady,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.600
 who I think a lot of his family didn't like,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.160
 who turned him into a bit of a recluse.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.000
 She was an alcoholic herself, I believe.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.360
 - There were allegations of abuse,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.920
 so he passed away, quite sadly, at 49.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.760
 - Really young, yeah, yeah.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.600
 - He was choked while eating, but, yeah, on his body,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.120
 there were sort of unexplained bruises all over,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.320
 with the abuse. - Yeah, wow.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.720
 What about Daniel De Lewis, eh?

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.960
 - Oof. - Well, not that guy.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.000
 - He's a character.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.840
 (laughing)

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.840
 - Well, more often than he is himself, yeah.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.880
 - So, before this podcast recording time,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.320
 I had never seen any of the films with Daniel De Lewis in.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.160
 - Is that right?

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.000
 - Not one. - That was so cool.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.840
 Not one.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.680
 - Wow.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.520
 - I thought he was in "Backman Forever",

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.360
 but it turns out that was someone else.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.200
 (laughing)

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.040
 - Don't spell kill them.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.880
 - No, spell kill them.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.640
 You're thinking of Jim Carrey.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.240
 (laughing)

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.160
 - So, I've never seen any of the interests.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.000
 - Have you just watched them all?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.280
 Have you seen, how many have you seen now?

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.480
 - I've now seen one and a half way through two others.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.440
 - Which two?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.760
 - Gangs of New York, have you watched that?

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.600
 - No, I haven't.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.440
 - Oh, that's a brilliant movie.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.280
 - It sounds great.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.720
 I've started, not on "American Werewolf" in London,

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.920
 but "The Last Mohican", sorry.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:33.760
 - Yep. - Oh, yeah.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.160
 - I started "The Last Mohican", terrific.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.720
 Was watching that in the small house this morning.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.200
 And I'm also watching "Stars and Bars",

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.400
 which is a goofy comedy he made immediately

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.120
 after "My Left Foot", which appears to have been

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.120
 the only film for which he's never done any method work,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.960
 whatsoever.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.800
 - What was his character in that?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.640
 - The premise is just like,

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.000
 what if a goofy British guy went to the deep South of America

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.040
 and it is so bad?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.440
 (laughing)

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.320
 - I've managed to watch the only time they know this film,

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.520
 which is not like five-star.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.800
 This will change your life movie.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.080
 - Well, in "The Last Mohicans",

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.000
 he caught and killed all of his food.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.840
 - Brilliant.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.880
 - Apparently, I had to get into that character.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.880
 - Yeah, he lived for a whole month in the wilderness,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.640
 didn't he, in order to fully immerse himself.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.080
 - He was in "The Crucible"

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.320
 and he didn't bathe for the entirety of "The Crucible".

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.760
 Now, I'm not sure, is that about the witch trial?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.160
 Sorry, is that about Snooker?

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.120
 (laughing)

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.480
 - It's the happy marriage of the two.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.360
 - He bathed, but he kept one foot on the floor at all time.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.320
 (laughing)

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.400
 I think my favorite one,

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.800
 'cause I don't ever heard of him as like this,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.440
 incredible that he lives the role.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.440
 My favorite is the unbearable likeness of being,

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.920
 I'm sure you guys all found this,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.200
 which is based on a Czech novel by Milan Kundera,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.560
 and he learned Czech,

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.840
 learned to speak Czech almost fluently for the film,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.800
 despite the fact the film is in English,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.560
 all of his lines are in English,

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.560
 and he said, "Yeah, but I can't just do an accent."

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.400
 I need to know where that accent comes from, great.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.200
 So he put all of his lines through the Czechy New

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.880
 and then back into English to do the accent, I mean, insane.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.160
 - And do you know what people who speak Czech,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.920
 and particularly British people who now live

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.960
 in the Czech Republic,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.160
 say that it's a really bad Czech accent?

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.360
 - Oh no, he says nothing like a Czech English.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.200
 - If you learn how to speak a language,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.680
 that doesn't mean you learn how to speak English

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.040
 in that accent, but that's the one problem

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.400
 when you learn a language is you can never nail the accent.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.120
 - Yeah, I also really want to find out how fluent he is,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.760
 'cause there's so much allegation about this,

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.160
 and apparently, according to the Foreign Services Institute,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.240
 which ranks languages by difficulty,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.520
 Czech is in the fourth out of five hardest languages.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.280
 So I mean, it takes years and years and years to nail.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.360
 So how, I mean, was it,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.280
 do you think it was like primary school, French level?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.520
 - I always wonder that,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.080
 whenever you see like a top footballer or a basketball player

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.240
 going, I speak nine languages to you.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
 Did you Kobe Bryant, did you really?

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.760
 - Well, did you just learn how to say,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.000
 oh, I got that three points today?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.280
 - Exactly, 'cause as that fact we did ages ago

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.520
 about umpires and tennis,

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.200
 do you need to learn all the swear words

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.760
 in multiple languages or something on the same?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:51.720
 Maybe it's just that.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.760
 I mean, obviously some of it is myth-making,

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.600
 but I love it, I just love it.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.760
 Like he played Lincoln, President Lincoln.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.200
 So he actually-

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.400
 - He got assassinated for that one.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.360
 - He got assassinated, he had himself made President first.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.360
 And then, so on the set of Lincoln,

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.960
 it was just totally a period appropriate.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.720
 So supposedly, nobody was allowed to tell that

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720
 wearing a T-shirt with a logo on.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.880
 Like, I presume all the like thousands of electricians

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.760
 of people who work on the film had to be in front coats

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.200
 and things like, it's addressed to like union soldiers.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.580
 No shorts, no paper coffee cups.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.320
 Lincoln wouldn't have had a paper coffee cup.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.000
 I imagine it's more for Daniel Day-Lewis

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.720
 than it is for everyone else.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.440
 - But you've got to slightly create the scene around him,

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.280
 haven't you?

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.520
 I mean, like in there's a famous thing in Gangs of New York

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.520
 when he was filming,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.220
 where first of all, Stephen Graham,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.560
 who is very famous and brilliant British actor,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.040
 said that he was such a great guy to work with

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.860
 and they became friends before they started filming

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.520
 and they did the training together,

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.640
 some martial arts training together.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.720
 And then the first day on set,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.040
 Daniel Day-Lewis walks on the set

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.000
 and just touches him on the shoulder and says,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.120
 "From now on, I call you Shang and you call me Bill."

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.960
 And then moves on.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.800
 So cool.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.040
 - Bill the butcher.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.880
 - And then indeed-

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.920
 - Is that his character?

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.760
 - Yes.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.880
 - I read that he worked as a butcher for some time.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.120
 I know I read butchers were flown over to the set.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.360
 - It was one butcher.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.200
 But I've got a theory about this butcher.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.160
 I don't think he's a butcher.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.000
 - Okay.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.200
 - I think this butcher is the ultimate method actor.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.080
 He's a guy called John Dell.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.920
 Look him up.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.560
 He's a butcher who runs W, head and co-butchers in Peckham.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.600
 - Sounds like he is a butcher.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.920
 - Well, no evidence of that online at all.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.760
 - Oh.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.480
 - There's like one little company record

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.880
 of it once existing.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.720
 John Dell.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.040
 - How many butchers have websites, though?

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.440
 Especially at the time that Gangs of New York

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.480
 was the 2002 film, it's early into there.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.800
 It wasn't required that a butcher

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.120
 had to have a buzzing online presence in 2002.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.240
 - Everyone's Google reviewed something.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.080
 - Oh, come on.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.200
 - I couldn't find nothing.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.440
 He was an amazing character, though.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.160
 When he was interviewed, first of all,

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.400
 he was asked by the producer who lived in Peckham

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.240
 and he knew him.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.040
 And he was like, this guy's a legit butcher.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.320
 He knows how to slaughter a pig.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.160
 So-

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.160
 - He's an avatar worker.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.640
 You could clearly, yeah.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.880
 If your butcher's killing the pig,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.480
 that's a problem with the sourcing.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.120
 Butchers don't normally kill the animal.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.960
 - No, sorry.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.800
 - No butchers.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.240
 I mean, butcher the animal.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.040
 But he was very good at butchering pigs.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.160
 So he trained Daniel Day-Lewis in how to butcher a pig.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.480
 And they got along really well.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.280
 He said Daniel Day-Lewis could butcher a pig like no one else.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.480
 He'd never seen anyone else with the knife skills.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.400
 He'd never seen anyone else

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.880
 with the natural feel for cutting meat.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.720
 - And this is a man who presumably

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.240
 has known a lot of other butchers.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.080
 - I reckon 'cause they hang out together, don't they?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:24.920
 - Yeah.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.760
 - Yeah.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.600
 - I love the sound of Daniel Day-Lewis.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.560
 He sounds like a really nice bloke.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.400
 And when he's interviewed about it,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.680
 he sounds quite normal.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.360
 - Because I'm just trying to get into the head

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.640
 of the character so that when I put it on film, it's real.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.000
 - I think he's a big old liar.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.840
 - No.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.680
 - You think he's just not doing it?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.520
 - I genuinely do.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.240
 I think some of it's true, but I think there's some.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.800
 And actually, I think a lot of the lies

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.720
 are made up by people around him.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.640
 But there was the famous thing where he walked off stage

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.960
 'cause he thought he saw his dad in the wings

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.920
 when he was doing Hamlet.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.760
 - That's right.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.280
 - And then later on, he did an interview saying

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.120
 that's what happened.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.680
 And then later on, he went, "No, it didn't really happen."

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.120
 - He said he was just tired.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120
 He said he was just exhausted

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.800
 and you're doing a play for every day for 18 months,

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.040
 whatever, that's really exhausting.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.680
 - But you can imagine if Daniel Del Luis says,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.520
 "I saw my dad father in the wings,"

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520
 you're gonna believe that, aren't you?

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.360
 - Absolutely, yeah.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.960
 - And it was, he's never done theater since.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.800
 - But he explains, actually,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.600
 he prefers the medium of film and so on and so forth.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:16.560
 - I kind of agree.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.040
 It's sort of like if he was less sort of thespian-like

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.440
 and had so much integrity, he's Brian Blessed.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.360
 Like all these stories are just tall tales.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.440
 Apparently on my left foot, he broke two ribs

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.000
 because he was hunching over so much

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.280
 while he was in the wheelchair,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.440
 but they just snapped under the weight of his hunchback.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.840
 - I just don't think that breaks your ribs.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.280
 - I hunch over my laptop all day, every day,

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.680
 and never have I broken a rib.

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.760
 - You're not committing to the work

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.440
 like Del Luis commits to his work.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.400
 No offence, Anna, I'm sorry.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.120
 - But he is a very, very successful actor,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.240
 Daniel Del Luis.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.840
 His Wikipedia, he doesn't have a separate Wikipedia page

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.240
 listing his movies, 'cause he's done so few movies.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.520
 I think he's done less than 20 or around 20.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.360
 - Wow.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.160
 - But he does have a separate page listing all

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.360
 of his awards.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.040
 - Just 'cause he's won so many.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.480
 - Yeah, he's done around 20 feature length films

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.240
 and he's had 212 major nominations and 139 wins.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.080
 - Wow.

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.040
 - And not one of them will have been for "Stars and Bugs".

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.640
 I guarantee it.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.440
 - What I worked out is if each episode of our podcast

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.000
 was as successful as each of his films,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.600
 then we'd have more than 4,000 awards.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.240
 And if they all weighed the same as an Oscar statuette,

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.040
 the total weight would be about the same as two elephants.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.880
 - Oh my God.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.400
 - So that puts it into perspective.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.000
 - Yeah, it really does. - That's brilliant.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.920
 - Tells you a lot about Daniel Del Luis, that.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.760
 - Yeah.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:41.960
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.160
 My fact is that some French unions have special barbecues

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.520
 that can be used to cook sausages while on a protest march.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.360
 - Brilliant.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.720
 They do like a strike in France.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.040
 - They love a strike and they love a saucy song.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.640
 And they found a way of combining the two.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.160
 And this does the rounds every now and again.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.560
 But Snopes, the brilliant people at Snopes,

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.680
 looked into this picture.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.520
 You can find it online.

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.960
 There's French people, they're very clearly French union workers.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.600
 They're in their hives and they're pushing along

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.680
 this mobile barbecue, which is in tram tracks.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.520
 - Yeah. - Oh.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.200
 - So they're going the tram route, I presume.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:19.000
 Oh, they're French train workers who were on strike.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.360
 - It was in Nice.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.200
 - It was in Nice.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.680
 - Very annoying if it's French teachers on strike

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.520
 and they're confined to the tram route for the whole process.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.360
 - It's 'cause they were doing some reform of the SNCF.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.680
 - There was some probably mild change

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.480
 suggested to working hours and I was like,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.480
 "Everybody out now, we leave Nice to Rock for a year."

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.280
 - So it's really cool though, isn't it?

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.680
 There's actually video footage.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.600
 It's like one second of video footage

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.480
 from what I saw where they're just pushing it down.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.120
 It's a massive grill going over the two tram tracks.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:47.960
 - It's very cool. - And they're pushing it along

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.840
 and they're, you know.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.320
 - So why do they put it on tram tracks

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.600
 rather than just putting a barbecue on wheels?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.840
 - Good call.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:55.680
 Good point.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.280
 I suppose they were marching the route of the tracks.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.240
 I mean, I suppose they were only walking the tram route

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.440
 to make a point about whatever beef they were having.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.840
 With their bosses.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.480
 - Maybe it makes the point more emphatically

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.200
 if they're like, "We've even made a barbecue

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.360
 "to make our point."

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.560
 - I mean, we're talking about them now.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.920
 This was several years ago.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.560
 - It's worked. - So, you know, it's worked.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.120
 - Their wagers will probably shoot up

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.040
 now that we've discussed it.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.080
 - You're welcome.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.920
 - Yeah.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.160
 I didn't actually know the knees had trams.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.960
 I've been to knees, but clearly I wasn't paying attention.

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.800
 So, you know.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.160
 Is that an all new low in terms of my anecdotes?

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:35.000
 It's 'cause I cycled into knees, that's it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.280
 Now we've hit the rock bottom.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.000
 There we go, there we go.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
 - You know, the barbecue I have is a Weber or Weber barbecue.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.840
 - Okay.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.520
 - And that is a, it's like a circular one.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.840
 It's almost like a ball and some legs.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.920
 - I think of that as a classic.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.960
 - It's a classic garden barbecue.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.640
 - It's like War of the Worlds, the tripods.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.640
 - It is. - Like this is all with a tripod.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.520
 - The terrifying aliens leap out of it

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.560
 if you want to cook the meat.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.400
 - Sort of.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.240
 Will they climb into your body

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.720
 and then they leap out several hours later?

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.960
 - Yes.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.960
 - Well, they were invented in 1952

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.680
 from two halves of a steel boy.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.520
 - A boy?

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.360
 - You know, a boy.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.200
 - A boy?

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.040
 - A boy. - Ocean boy.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.920
 - You know, those things that float to the ocean.

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:15.840
 - Yeah.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.360
 - Well, yeah, they decided they wanted

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.920
 to make a new kind of barbecue

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.160
 and they thought, wouldn't it be nice if it was circular?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.400
 And what do we have that's circular in our iron works?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.560
 Well, we have some boys.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.800
 - Boys. - Cool.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.640
 - That's brilliant.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.080
 - And the guy used it in his garden

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.960
 and basically all his neighbors called it a spaceship

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.680
 and laughed at him.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.520
 But it turned around.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.360
 - And it took off?

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.200
 - It did.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.200
 - So was the previous barbecue not around like a bro?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.480
 - No, because in America where the barbecuing started,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.120
 that's not really what barbecuing is.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.800
 It's more like roasting meat for 24 hours

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.760
 until it's really, really, really soft.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.100
 Isn't it? - Right.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:52.940
 - That's low cut.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.120
 - 'Cause in the, I should say to any Americans listening,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:57.960
 in the UK, a barbecue is you sit in the garden

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.280
 when it's raining and you put burgers on a grill.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.560
 - You go into the house and put them in the oven

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.560
 if it's really raining yet.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.600
 - As far as I'm concerned, a barbecue is a metal tray

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.200
 that you buy from Tesco Metro on a sunny day

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.360
 and then take to the park.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.200
 - You cramp.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.360
 - You three bottles of white light in.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360
 - Yeah, delicious as well.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.360
 - I discovered that I spell barbecue differently to you three.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.200
 - No, you spell it wrong,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.800
 which is what I noticed is a document

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.640
 where we put a tag or a search.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.720
 - Are you spelling it with a Q, Dan?

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.560
 - I'm spelling it with a Q,

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.200
 which is the Australian way of spelling it.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.280
 That's the actual way of spelling it in Australia.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.880
 Yes, it is, and New Zealand as well.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.160
 And also, ah.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.840
 - But you pronounce that barbec.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.680
 - Barbeque.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.240
 - They pronounce it Barbie, as we know.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.000
 - Oh, we have a Barbie, but yeah, barbecue.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.960
 And in Sydney, there's a thing.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.800
 - If it was, sorry, if it was meant,

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.640
 if you were spelling it like it was pronounced,

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.800
 but you wanted to include the Q,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.040
 you'd have to end it Q-U-E-U-E.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.200
 That's how you do Q.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.440
 - Join the barbecue.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.280
 - Yeah.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.120
 Well, no, I'll bring that up.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.200
 And the next time I'm at the Australian Embassy

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.320
 and they're asking me for my international opinions.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.880
 - They've constantly got a barbecue

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.920
 on the go at the Aussie Embassy.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.760
 - They do, exactly.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.400
 - But this relates to a really interesting

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:00.840
 etymology of barbecue,

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.280
 because there's a kind of mythic folk belief

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.000
 that it comes from a French phrase

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.360
 from barbecue, which means from beer to tail.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.680
 You're eating the whole pig.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.800
 Jokes on you, that pig is Daniel Day-Louis in disguise.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.640
 He was method acting.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.480
 You're in big trouble now.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.640
 You've cooked and eaten him.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.480
 - Was he in Babe?

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.320
 - What was the movie?

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.320
 (all laughing)

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.000
 - 'Cause the word Q in English as in to stand in a line

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.040
 comes from the French for tail as well.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.200
 - Right, right.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.320
 - But you're saying this isn't correct.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.160
 - It's not from that.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.840
 In fact, we very briefly mentioned years and years ago

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.440
 that it's from a guy called William Dampier

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.880
 who was a privateer, sailor, pirate, roaster.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.720
 - The original Robinson Crusoe, I want to say.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.520
 - He was a buccaneer and a buccaneer is a pirate

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.480
 who cooks meat.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.640
 It's basically the etymology of buccaneer

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.720
 comes from that as well.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.560
 - Yes.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.960
 - It's all Caribbean languages basically.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.520
 So there's a barbacao,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.920
 which is from the various Caribbean peoples who got it.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.320
 So it's from the Americas, the word in the first place, yeah.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.440
 - There's a fun phrase in Argentina

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.880
 where barbecuing is huge and it's called asado

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.240
 in place like Argentina, Brazil,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.520
 other parts of South America.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.960
 And then you get asado al disco, do you know what that is?

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960
 - A circular.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.800
 - Revolving, yeah, rotating.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.720
 - Oh, the disco gets so hot that you feel like you're cooking.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.440
 So they're a ball full of meat.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:16.280
 - Thank you.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.680
 I was looking for some disco stuff

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.640
 and then I could say no,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.320
 it's about the first things that you guys said,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.640
 but a disco is the disc from a plow.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.680
 So a plow has like very sharp discs

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.560
 that it cuts the crops with.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.120
 And once they've worn out, then in Argentina,

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.600
 you take that off the plow and you cook on it.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.360
 And it's basically like a wok, a giant wok.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.760
 And that's Apollo al disco

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.800
 is using the disc from a plow to barbecue.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.480
 - Yeah, a barbecuing is very common around the world.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.600
 And one thing that's quite interesting

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.400
 is it's very common for men to do the barbecuing

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.360
 almost everywhere that you go.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.600
 So like we think of it in the UK at least

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.680
 and probably in America as like,

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.400
 the dads go and do the barbecuing

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.000
 while everyone else does something else.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.840
 - That's right.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.240
 And the men obsess over it and they talk,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.080
 Lou, what charcoal are you cooking with these days?

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.280
 You know that kind of stuff.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.960
 - But yeah, Levi Strauss, the anthropologist,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.400
 he says that yeah, basically if you look all over the world

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.520
 from Amazonian tribes, people in Africa,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.760
 it's often the men's work for the barbecuing.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.640
 There was a book called the complete barbecue book

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.480
 by John and Marie Robertson who put it,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.720
 they said that the man who does the barbecuing

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.320
 takes on a somewhat god-like stature.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.040
 As for the ladies, well, they're virtually your slaves.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.840
 I feel like John wrote that bit, not Marie, probably.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.680
 - Who is it?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.080
 - Anthropologist of food rides called Calvin Trillin

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.240
 records that if you want to be a good barbecueist,

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.840
 you have to be basically a mishandthrope

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.160
 because you're going in the garden on your own.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.000
 You're not really talking to anyone else.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Your friend is the meat, as opposed to the--

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.320
 - Oh God, it's such a lovely chance

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.240
 not to have to fulfill your social obligations

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.080
 and just stand there feeling used to it.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.280
 - I would say in Australia,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.040
 I don't know what it's like here properly,

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.120
 but it's the water cooler.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.240
 It's everywhere when it hangs around the barbecue.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.760
 - What are you driving these days?

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.600
 Yeah, that kind of thing.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.000
 - Exactly that kind of thing, yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.160
 - But then this guy says that actually it's quite good

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.040
 as a hobby because golf and sailing and fishing,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.320
 these are also things where men sort of like to go

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.560
 just a couple of men on their own

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.520
 and not see anyone else misanthropically,

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520
 but at least in this case,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.040
 everyone gets some food out of it at the end.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.920
 - That's true, I'm not guaranteed with fishing.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.840
 I'm very rare with golf unless you really hit something.

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.880
 - Yeah, I think misanthropically,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.200
 for activities like fishing,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.480
 which is so dominated by men,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.240
 we need to replace the word misanthrope,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.280
 which has a kind of coolness to it with unhelpful,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.400
 because that's all it is.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.640
 That's just men pissing off and not helping out, isn't it?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.880
 - So when my wife says to me,

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.320
 "Why have you not taken the bins out?"

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.680
 I could just say, "Oh, it's been misanthropic."

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.160
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.400
 The male thing is interesting though,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.920
 and going back to French barbecues,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.960
 a green politician in France got in trouble in 2022

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.240
 'cause they were saying obviously meat,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.200
 very bad for the environment,

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:53.600
 20% of our greenhouse gases still come from the meat industry.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.320
 And she was saying,

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.600
 "We have to change our mentality

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 "so that eating a barbecued Andracot

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.080
 "is no longer a symbol of virility."

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.480
 And basically people said,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.520
 "You're blaming men for killing the planet."

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.320
 - I don't think I've ever heard someone say the word

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.440
 "Andracot" and think that is a virile person.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.400
 - France is a very different place to Bolton James.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.200
 The interesting male thing about barbecuing a meat

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.040
 is that men just do eat more meat,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.360
 and actually we don't know why,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.200
 but around the world, in almost every country--

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.480
 - It must be cultural, it can't be biological.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.320
 - Well, a lot of people think it's biological,

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.080
 so there are arguments that female hormones suppress

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.560
 the desire to eat meat around your period,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.800
 or when you're pregnant, which sounds very implausible to me.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.920
 There's another argument that says

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.920
 men behave in more risky ways.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.320
 So evolutionarily, they need to eat more protein

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.080
 to make their bones stronger, more meat.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.000
 - But also cooking a sausage for three minutes a day,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
 I was probably fine, that is a risky behavior.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.280
 (laughing)

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.360
 - But it's really interesting,

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.080
 and also there was a study looking at 23 countries,

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.320
 and the wealthier and more gender equality we have,

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:54.160
 what would you think, as you get more gender equality,

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.680
 which tends to happen in more developed countries,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.640
 does the gap between men and women's meat

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.120
 seem to get bigger or smaller?

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.440
 - Well, you think it would get smaller.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.760
 - You think it would get smaller and it gets bigger?

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.080
 - It doesn't, 'cause men are trying to cling

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.240
 to something to show their blokes, is that it?

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.640
 - We don't know, but I like that's a nice interpretation.

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.400
 - Have you heard of transglutaminase?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.360
 I'd be really surprised if you had, no.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.520
 - Some kind of molecule.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.000
 - It's a molecule, all right, it's an enzyme,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.800
 and it's a thing that gets called meat glue.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.640
 - Oh, that's not the answer.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.280
 - And if you buy a big piece of steak, you may notice,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.160
 it might be skewered, and if it's skewered,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.000
 there's a good chance.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.920
 This is in America, this stuff is not legal in the EU,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:36.840
 that it's been had meat glue sort of painted on it,

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.160
 and if you paint meat glue on it and squish it all together,

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.920
 you can make a big, expensive looking steak

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.440
 out of several pieces of small scrap meat.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.280
 - Oh, cool.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.040
 - And that's how it's not cool, it's really horrible.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.840
 - No, but it's cool that you could bring

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.280
 a dino burger basically, right?

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.440
 - Yeah, it's like the Power Rangers,

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.280
 they combine their forces.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.600
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.200
 - If you're listening to this after the Trump tariffs

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.960
 have forced us to do a trade deal with America,

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.920
 then you two could be eating one right now.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.120
 - We'll eat these days.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.520
 - Yeah, I was looking at sort of out-of-place barbecues,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.920
 like the one on the tram line,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.440
 and there was a really cool thing I found,

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.760
 which is there used to be a tour

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.920
 called the Vans Warp Tour.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.920
 It's basically a festival that you would have like 20 bands,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.720
 and they would go from city to city together.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.160
 So not like class and regis or what.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:20.400
 Yeah, and they came to Australia in 1998,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.920
 and I remember it being a big deal.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.600
 So they had big bands,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.360
 you'd get people like Blink 182 and No Effects and stuff,

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.200
 but then they would also give opportunities

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.280
 to younger newer bands.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.000
 And one of the conditions of being on the Warp Tour

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.840
 was you could be the barbecue band.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.200
 You get a slot on stage, but when it's done,

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.000
 you go backstage and you're in charge of the barbecue,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.400
 and you cook for everyone.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.400
 And so that's the condition,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.000
 the trade-off of you being on the tour.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.400
 - Don't we know any bands that went on to be massive,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.800
 having begun as barbecues?

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.360
 - Yeah, the Dropkick Murphy's, Art of Shock,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.120
 Gorilla's, Gorilla's, Gorilla's.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.840
 - Yes. - Yeah, yeah.

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.000
 - Yeah.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:57.860
 - Was he in it?

00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.720
 (laughing)

00:24:58.720 --> 00:24:59.560
 - I was in it.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.000
 - I think Gorilla's is what belongs, isn't it?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.320
 - Oh, you mean, I think. - Damon Aldon, you mean.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.160
 - Yeah, Damon Aldon.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.000
 - Yeah, well, it's a good one.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.720
 - Damon Aldon, I mean, he belongs on a farm anyway.

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.000
 (laughing)

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.320
 So you know, there are these rubs.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.160
 - Yeah, meat rub. - It's a big thing.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.120
 - Meat rub. - Meat rub.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.440
 - Yeah.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.120
 - So it's basically a load of spices

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.080
 that you rub over your meat to marinate it.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.560
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.400
 And there's a shop named Me,

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.880
 which stocks something by what's called

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.160
 the Gentleman's Rub Club.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.680
 And I have tried to,

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:29.440
 and I've tried to find any evidence that it existed online

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.920
 'cause I remembered it running up to this podcast

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.760
 and they're nowhere.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.200
 - The thing is, it's a bit like Butchers in the 1980s.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.400
 You don't necessarily have to have a massive online presence

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.040
 if you're a rub club.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.560
 - But the fairly the first rule of Gentleman's Rub Club.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.440
 (laughing)

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.320
 But this just got me off onto like,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.760
 so it got me off onto, got me onto grilling awards,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.320
 barbecue awards.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:54.240
 So I was looking at the NBBQA,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.560
 National Barbecue and Grilling Association,

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.920
 'cause they have an awards of excellence every year.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.120
 I think it's an American thing.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.120
 So they've got beef rub, pork rub, poultry rub,

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.720
 seafood rub, spicy rub.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.200
 And I just, I wanted to read a few of the prizes

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.000
 from the latest awards.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:09.960
 They're terrific.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.560
 Barbecue apparel category.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.560
 First prize, a t-shirt reading, wanna see my rack.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.160
 - First prize. - First prize.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.000
 - Third prize.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.240
 - Well, they try and encourage women to get into it, aren't they?

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.320
 - Second prize, wanna see my sausage.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.720
 (laughing)

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.560
 - Third prize, t-shirt reading, I got sourced.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.680
 Fourth hat reading, my dad's barbecue.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.040
 But there's a barbecue book of the year.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.880
 - Oh yeah.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.480
 - A barbecue, badass backyard cooking.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.320
 - Oh, dear.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.640
 - Oh, cool.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:42.280
 - There's even an award for best barbecue audio series.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.960
 There's barbecue podcasts.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.720
 Could we put this section up for it?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.560
 - I think so.

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.040
 If we wanna dethrone the smoking hot confessions

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.800
 of the BBQ podcast.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.880
 - Well, I definitely wanna check out my rack t-shirt

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.160
 or whatever it is, so let's do it.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.760
 (laughing)

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.880
 They're massive, the barbecue contest in America.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.360
 They're all run by the Kansas City Barbecue Society

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.120
 and it's trained over 15,000 judges to judge barbecues

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.480
 and the rules are very tight.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.040
 So, judges are not allowed to eat with utensils,

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.840
 but you're also not allowed to lick your fingers.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.680
 Why?

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.520
 No one knows.

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.120
 You just have fingers covered in like,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.760
 - I do? - Barbecue meat the whole time.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.560
 - How can you eat some ribs

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.520
 without licking your fingers?

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.360
 That's unnatural.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.200
 - Well, I think it's not a challenge.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.200
 - Maybe you have wipes.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.040
 - Gloves?

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.880
 - Yes.

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.720
 - I don't even like gloves.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.760
 - They've got the glove culture they want.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.120
 (laughing)

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.440
 - Like a snooker referee.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.320
 - I need another 20,000 pounds of linen gloves please, yeah.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.200
 - The scores are on a scale of one to nine,

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.920
 but there's no three and four, weirdly.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.760
 (laughing)

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.600
 - Come on.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.440
 - Five.

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.480
 - What, one, two, five, six, seven and nine.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.320
 - That's so funny.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.600
 - Yeah, five is poor and then two is inedible.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.560
 Nothing in between.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.480
 - That's very funny.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.480
 - There are various rules.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.480
 To judge a brisket as in a big chest of a cow,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.240
 you have to be able to manipulate it like an accordion.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.160
 - Wow.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.000
 - Oh.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.840
 - Yeah.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:57.680
 - Wow, what a sentence, horrible.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.000
 - I think it's all, I think it's useful.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.920
 - I'm surprised, yeah.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.760
 - Are you?

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.320
 - Because, well, I could play the accordion, right?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.640
 And so you have to move it quite a lot, right?

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.200
 And to move a rib cage,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.160
 I don't feel like that would be possible.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.000
 - Yeah.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.320
 - Maybe the rib cage.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.520
 - That's a terrible cheer.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.440
 But if a couple of the rooms have already been broken,

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.840
 let's hope because Daniel Day Lewis

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.080
 has been living as the cow.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.560
 (laughing)

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.560
 - Tank, I'll ask you a question.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.400
 - Yeah.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.220
 - Australia.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.060
 - Yeah.

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.880
 - You're from there.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.720
 - Yes.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.560
 - Have you ever seen a coin operated barbecue in the past?

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.120
 - I was gonna mention this before I was cut off

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.560
 for my terrible spelling, which was not terrible.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.000
 In Sydney, we actually have not even coin operated.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.400
 You have free barbecues on most of the beaches

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.280
 that you go to.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.640
 So we would go down to Clairville on the weekend.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.360
 You would just press a button and it gets going.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.080
 And your only thing is to just clean it up.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.400
 - Wait, is it like gas,

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.680
 or do you have to bring your own charcoal?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.840
 - Oh, no, no, yeah, just goes up.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.200
 - Isn't it unhygienic?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.040
 - No, you clean.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.400
 So there's a raw sausages on there.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.000
 - I kind of think the thing with barbecue

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.840
 is it doesn't matter if you drop it in the mud,

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.440
 'cause you're cooking it on such a massive, massive heat.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:01.040
 - It's a thousand degrees.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.360
 What's surviving on that?

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.200
 - There's a real pride thing, by the way,

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.440
 of you leave it ready for the next person.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.480
 Yeah, it's a thing that is sort of just part of the way.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.640
 - I see, I see, that's national culture.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.240
 Well, supposedly even some zoos have free barbecues,

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.760
 which I feel is open to misuse.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.800
 - What, do you think that's a bit scary

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.320
 for the animals just sitting around?

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.360
 - Have you seen the wombat?

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.200
 Where's the wombat?

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.160
 (laughing)

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.740
 (upbeat music)

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.680
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.480
 and that is Anna.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.760
 - My fact this week is that epileptic fits

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.480
 can be triggered by thinking about toothpaste.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.320
 - That's wild.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.160
 - Yeah, not widespread, don't worry.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.000
 - Do you have to have a specific condition

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.760
 already for this to happen?

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.000
 Epilepsy, I'm assuming.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.800
 (laughing)

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.760
 - It is more common epileptics, yes.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.000
 But you ask all the right questions, Andy.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.080
 That's why we love to have you in the class.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.160
 This, I just came across this paper from 2006,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.360
 which reported on a patient with epilepsy.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:08.360
 Came across a paper from 2006,

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.440
 which reported on a patient with epilepsy

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.080
 in which seizures were induced

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.560
 both by tooth brushing and by seeing

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.320
 or thinking about toothbrush and toothpaste.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.160
 - That's amazing.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.000
 - It's extraordinary.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.680
 - Is that someone who is stressed

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.680
 about the idea of brushing their teeth

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.160
 and then the stress brings on it?

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.200
 Like, what is bringing it on?

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.640
 - I don't, well, it's very mysterious,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.000
 and I don't think it's quite that.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.200
 It's a type of reflex epilepsy,

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.600
 which is epilepsy that's triggered by something,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.320
 and this type is called thinking epilepsy,

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.360
 and it's where thinking about something,

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.640
 and I don't think it's necessarily something

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.480
 that causes you stress,

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.760
 but thinking about a certain thing triggers it,

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.920
 so there was other cases reported on

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.960
 where someone, when they thought about food,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.920
 whenever they thought about food,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.280
 which is quite debilitating.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.960
 - I read about one who, every time they tried to do Sudoku,

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.400
 they got an epileptic fit.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.360
 - This seems to be a thing, puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.040
 - Oh yeah, I hate a Sudoku.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.680
 - Yeah, but it's not about hating it.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.880
 I don't know, do you have the lying epilepsy?

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.200
 - I'm starting to feel like I might.

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.240
 - But is it because there's a particular location

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.280
 in your brain where the neurons for toothpaste

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.400
 or Sudoku or whatever, or food are kept,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.880
 and there's a crossed wire in there?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.960
 That seems logical, doesn't it?

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.400
 But I don't think anyone really knows.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.920
 - No, no, and it is rare, but it is amazing,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.400
 and some people can think themselves into an epileptic fit.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.360
 It just sounds like the most awful thing,

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.640
 'cause what is the only thing you can do

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.160
 when you're told not to think about something,

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.760
 obviously is think about something.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.520
 If you know that you can't think about this,

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.960
 there was a guy who was taken to hospital,

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.280
 and he had a brain lesion, I think,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.840
 and he had an epileptic fit,

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:42.920
 and the only way you could characterize it was,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.200
 if he started to feel enthusiastic,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.160
 he would then have a fit.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.000
 - Oh, interesting.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.840
 - Can I wonder if you have that?

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.400
 I know we probably never know.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.240
 - Me.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.400
 (all laughing)

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.800
 That's why, actually, I play it safe.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.280
 - So it could be anything, you just got to identify it.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.920
 - So he's not allowed a hobby?

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.080
 - He's not allowed a hobby that he likes, no.

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.400
 He can do Sudoku to his ask and death, actually,

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.840
 but they actually made him induce one,

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.720
 which does feel quite mean.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.920
 They were like, "Could you try and replicate the feeling

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.520
 "when you have one so we can have a look?"

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.400
 So he was like, "Okay, I'll make myself feel enthusiastic.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.600
 "You ready?" - Wow.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.520
 - Toothpaste?

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.360
 - Yes, please.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.360
 How do the stripes get in?

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360
 (all laughing)

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.960
 - Oh my God, the ultimate question.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.800
 - Why don't I know?

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.760
 - I believe there's a couple of different ways of doing it.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.840
 - Yeah, they got a couple of them.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.920
 - But my understanding is that the main one,

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.320
 there's a little thing near the nozzle or something.

00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.160
 - Oh, it's a paintbrush.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.600
 - It's disappointingly technical, the explanation,

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.840
 but knowing that it's not like--

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.040
 - Is it not through the back door?

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.480
 - What do you mean through the back door?

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.720
 There's one rope of toothpaste that goes into the tube.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.920
 - You've got the nozzle at the top,

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.840
 and then you've got the bottom.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.040
 Maybe that's not closed up when the stuff's put in,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:46.880
 and then you seal it up.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.400
 - What you're saying is that one long string

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.440
 of toothpaste is put in,

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:50.720
 and it comes out in the same order

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:51.720
 that it went in the other end.

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.640
 - No, I'm picturing it a bit like Mr. Whippy.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.320
 - What if you get it wrong and squeeze it the wrong way?

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.400
 - How does it work the opposite way round, though?

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.720
 'Cause it would mush inside.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.480
 - It's white on the inside, up to near the nozzle end,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.240
 and then the color, or colors,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.640
 this is one way of doing it, the colors are up at that end,

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.560
 and it's a very thin pipe.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.600
 So as you squeeze from the back end,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.280
 the white goes up through the nozzle,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.960
 but the color bit is also pressed out

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.080
 through the holes in the sides,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.000
 and joins the main white bit.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:18.840
 - Cool.

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.760
 - And the main bit is white,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.560
 and the other colors then are the garnish.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.400
 - That's fantastic.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.240
 - I love it.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.180
 I never knew that.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:26.480
 - So if you don't like the colors,

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.240
 if you get a bit perturbed when you spit it out,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.320
 and it looks like your mouth is bleeding,

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.080
 you can cut your toothpaste tube in half,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.480
 and then just use the bottom of it, and it's just white.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.820
 - That's what I do.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:37.400
 Think of someone who could have had a tube of toothpaste,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.800
 right, a famous person in history.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.120
 - Margaret Thatcher.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.120
 - She could, yes, even more impressively,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.320
 even further back on that.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.520
 - Jim Callaghan.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.920
 - Julius Caesar.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.320
 - Yes, Jim Callaghan, no, do this.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.240
 (laughing)

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240
 - Wilson.

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.560
 - Harold Wilson, yep.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:55.760
 You're just doing PMs.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.360
 - Yeah, just going backwards.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.200
 - I think even before Balfour,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.840
 she could have had it, yeah.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.480
 - I don't know if designing quiz formats is for you.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.920
 - Lord Salisbury.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.760
 - Oh, God.

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.600
 - No.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:11.560
 - Was it between Disraeli's first term

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.120
 and Disraeli's second term?

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.280
 - No, it's after all of Disraelian Gladstone.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.600
 Campbell Bannerman probably could have had, who?

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.440
 - Wow.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.800
 - He was a turn of the 20th century Prime Minister.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.640
 - Atlee.

00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:27.160
 - Yeah, we must say that atlee could have done, James.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.120
 You're not catching up.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.040
 You're not playing the game at all well,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.640
 which is surprising to me, 'cause it's such a good game.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:34.160
 (laughing)

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.520
 - What's your point toothpaste

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.880
 that was invented 100 years ago?

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.560
 - How young, Joan Rivers?

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.960
 - Let's trust him, yeah, all of these people.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:47.040
 So what I'm trying to say is that the squeezy toothpaste tube,

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.000
 the collapsible toothpaste tube,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.760
 was invented in roughly the 1880s, '90s.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.760
 So Queen Victoria could have had a tube of toothpaste,

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.880
 which just makes you think, doesn't it?

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.520
 - What does it make me think?

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.800
 - Well, it's just the tube of toothpaste

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.600
 is older than we might think it is, you know?

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.080
 James thought Clement Atlee was the earliest

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.280
 Prime Minister who could have had one.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:08.200
 But actually, 1880, a dentist from Connecticut,

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:11.040
 confusingly he was called Sheffield, launched it.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.520
 And then it was launched in York,

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.800
 confusingly the place in 1896.

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.160
 So other people who could have enjoyed it

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.240
 include Adolf Sachs, Friedrich Engels,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.040
 William Morris and Rutherford B. Hayes.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.400
 - Goni women there who cleaned the teeth in there.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.000
 - Queen Victoria, I think was the opener.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.840
 - I stopped him.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.840
 - Queen Victoria, Queen Victoria, great.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.600
 Here's a worrying thing for toothpaste, possibly.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.840
 Do you know that sails have dropped by a lot?

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.760
 Some say almost half since the late '90s.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.600
 - What?

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.480
 - Yeah, now riddle me this.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.640
 - Is it that people used to have much bigger toothbrushes?

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.600
 - You got in one, electric toothbrushes.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:49.440
 - Oh, wow!

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.760
 - Electric toothbrushes have such a small little surface area

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.500
 if you put it on that you're not squeezing as much.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.040
 And also the rise of the two for one

00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.680
 or three for two promotion

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.280
 has absolutely knocked out sails for them as well.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.840
 But it's literally that we're using it

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.720
 almost half the amount that we usually would.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.480
 - I'm so surprised, 'cause I don't think a high proportion

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.120
 of people use electric toothbrushes.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.360
 I'm surprised that it's half.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.200
 Do you guys?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.860
 - Well, so the promotions as well, the promotions.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.680
 - I don't, but I tend to just cover my whole flannel

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.760
 with toothpaste and rub that round my mouth.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.600
 - Well, do you know--

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.680
 - So I'm probably keeping the industry going.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.040
 - That would work.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.600
 And this is his, you don't need to put it

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.000
 on a brush or anything.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.960
 And this is something that will really send

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.140
 toothpaste sales plummeting.

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.900
 If they were worried before about this drop,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.720
 it's totally pointless.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.440
 - What's happened to your teeth, Adam?

00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.280
 - Toothbrush.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.320
 - Toothpaste.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.160
 - What?

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.820
 - So, study after study.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.880
 If you're looking at removing plaque,

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.040
 study after study, like dozens and dozens of studies,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.820
 very, very reliable, broad studies,

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.460
 look at the difference between toothbrushing

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.000
 without any toothpaste and toothbrushing with toothpaste,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.300
 and there is absolutely no difference.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.380
 - Your teeth are gonna be stronger if you use fluoride.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.640
 - So the only thing is, the fluoride in toothpaste

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.560
 is in the long term, good for your teeth,

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.880
 only if you do the thing that I've always known

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.560
 you should do, but can't bring myself to do,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.920
 which is not rinse at the end.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.360
 Do you guys all not rinse?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.600
 - I do now, having learned this,

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.120
 'cause we talked about this from QI coming up.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.460
 - Oh, did we?

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.920
 But yeah, it is quite interesting,

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.560
 'cause I think, and there are so many ingredients,

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.900
 but it is literally the only thing

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.040
 is fluoride that does anything,

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.620
 unless except like breath-smelling of mint.

00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.200
 'Cause you get a fluoride-free toothpaste,

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.180
 which I do have friends who use,

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:28.480
 and I'm not judging them, 'cause they're my friends.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.540
 - Yeah, but you can't invite them to the barbecue

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.300
 'cause they can't get through the meat.

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.820
 - How is RFK?

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.980
 Is he all right?

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.060
 It's so interesting how we got fluoride in toothpaste,

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.220
 and in fact in water.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:42.660
 In 1901, there was a young dentist called Frederick Mackay,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:44.860
 and he moved to Colorado Springs in America,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.380
 and he found that people there had a thing called,

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.840
 have you heard of Colorado brown stain?

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.940
 - Well, I wouldn't buy that toothpaste, Brad.

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.240
 - Isn't that one of the spots, team,

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.980
 the Colorado brown stains?

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.820
 - Yes, that's right.

00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.540
 - Go brown stains, yeah, yeah.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.080
 This is insane, 90% of children had it.

00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.480
 Almost no one in the rest of America

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.360
 had Colorado brown stain, or any kind of brown stain.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.880
 The water was tested.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.520
 Turns out the water was very high on fluoride, right?

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.180
 Particular towns of particular water sources

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.040
 had awful brown stain, but the good thing was,

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.760
 they did some experiments, Mackay and Et El,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.100
 and they found that basically this water-borne fluoride

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.580
 changed the color of your tooth enamel,

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.180
 but it also made this mottled tooth enamel

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.740
 that people have was very resistant to decay.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.740
 And so they started thinking, okay, we pop a little bit,

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.660
 these kids have rock hard teeth, basically.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.540
 And they thought, if we put the right amount

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:38.380
 of fluoride in the water, you won't get discolored teeth,

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.100
 but you will get strong teeth.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.780
 And the year after the first place,

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.580
 Grand Rapids in Michigan got fluoride,

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.940
 the number of cavities dropped 60%.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.260
 It's one of the most effective

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.260
 health interventions ever made.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.480
 It's like that thing in Switzerland,

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.960
 where everyone had goiters on their neck,

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.200
 and then they started putting iodine in the salt,

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.860
 just overnight changed it.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.280
 - Well, and bizarrely, we don't do it everywhere in Britain,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.780
 which I actually didn't realize until recently.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.620
 - Not everywhere, no.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.880
 - And lots, in fact, in most places, we don't do it.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.800
 But does that mean we should actually,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:07.120
 or good teeth, mottled brown teeth?

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.480
 Like really, if we want super strong teeth,

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.820
 why not triple the fluoride?

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.180
 - I think you can have too much fluoride.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.240
 - You definitely can, there are advisory levels.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.840
 And people go a bit nuts about it, obviously.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.080
 There's lots of stuff online about it.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.280
 When it was installed in Grand Rapids in 1945,

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.040
 lots of people said, "This fluoride,

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.280
 it's giving me sore teeth and sore enamel,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.620
 and it's really bad."

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:28.460
 And they were told,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.440
 "Yes, we haven't actually put the fluoride in the water yet."

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.420
 That's happening in a few weeks, yeah.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.880
 - So we know now that there's no toothpaste

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.900
 before Campbell Benjamin.

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:38.160
 - Well, there's no tubes, right?

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.000
 - It's usable tubes.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.840
 - Yeah, okay.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:43.700
 But what did the Romans do to keep their mouth nice

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.000
 and healthy, what they use as mouthwash?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.480
 - Oh, like urine.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.720
 - So there is this sort of factoid

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:53.260
 that Romans used urine from Portugal as mouthwash.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.880
 (laughing)

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.800
 And it is put across by lots of popular historians,

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.880
 but it's really probably not true.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.240
 Like if you look for any classical evidence,

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.160
 there is a mention by Catalyst, and it's a poem,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.880
 but he's mocking someone and he's saying,

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:10.120
 "Oh yeah, you're in Spain, you've been to Spain,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.280
 so you probably wash your mouth with urine."

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.120
 - Oh, okay, right.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.720
 - And it might be that maybe some people in Spain did that,

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.840
 but this is a satirical sort of taking the piss.

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.040
 Really, they didn't do this.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.160
 - You mean not only not Portuguese urine,

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.360
 they probably didn't use urine in general.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.680
 - Probably not, nah.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.280
 Otherwise, why would you take the piss out of someone

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.400
 for doing it, having just been to Nigeria?

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.840
 - Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.880
 I thought you were saying like,

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.680
 it's a myth that they imported large quantities

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.040
 of Portuguese urine, and actually,

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.760
 they just used good old fashioned Roman urine.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.600
 (laughing)

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.200
 But you're saying no urine was probably involved.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.880
 - No, I don't think there's any urine involved.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.600
 - There's only often they introduce the urine tariffs,

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.360
 of course, starting getting good at making their own.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.400
 - There's a lot of old methods to clean your teeth

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.120
 and alleviate toothache before it was a paste.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.920
 It was powder, so we were all using powder toothpaste.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.920
 One of my favorite ones, if not my favorite,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.920
 is you would use the ground up ashes of a wolf's head.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.840
 But what you say is when you find that dead wolf

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.680
 and you get its head in order to mash it up and use that,

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.160
 it is a well-known fact too,

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.600
 that there are bones generally found

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.080
 in the excrement of that animal.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.160
 These bones attached to an amulet

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.880
 are protective as well.

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.040
 There's a lot going on.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.160
 - It's an undertaking, isn't it?

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.120
 (laughing)

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.880
 - It's laborious every night, I guess.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.440
 Yeah, you gotta add a toothpaste.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.880
 - Honestly, compared to,

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.720
 'cause I've literally been to the dentist two days ago,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.680
 and compared to that, I'll take the wolf crap.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.480
 - You'll follow a wolf run until it does a shit,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.880
 immediately kill it, turn the shit into a necklace.

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.560
 - Rather than an hour and a half of drilling,

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.400
 yeah, I'll go for it.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.880
 - Fair enough.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.000
 - My dentist said, "Mr. Harkin, you have a very strong tongue."

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.040
 (laughing)

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.200
 - Wow, wow, would you like to join my gentleman's rub club?

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.440
 (laughing)

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.020
 (upbeat music)

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:56.040
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.520
 and that is James.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.440
 - Okay, my fact this week is that things

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:01.520
 that French newspapers were censored

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.280
 from mentioning during World War I included,

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.480
 any use of the word peace without the word victorious,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.080
 any mention of the cold weather,

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.880
 in case it reminded people about the shortage of coal,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.520
 and any reference of a meeting

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.520
 between the president's wife and a wild ape.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.760
 - I mean, what twist?

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.600
 - And did that reference a specific occasion,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.120
 or was it just in case anyone--

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.840
 - It did, it did, yeah, there was an incident

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.600
 involving Henriette Poincaré,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.800
 who was the wife of the president.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.440
 And on the Wikipedia for the Alise Palace,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.000
 it says in 1917, a chimpanzee escaped

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
 from a nearby menagerie, entered the palace,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.120
 and was said to have tried to hold the wife

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.000
 of president Raymond Poincaré into a tree,

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.120
 only to be foiled by the guards.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.160
 And-- - How strong was it

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.440
 that he could have held her into a tree?

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.560
 - Oh, what chimpanzees? - I know chimpanzees are strong,

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.600
 but that's bulky.

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:55.480
 - A teenage girl chimpanzee would beat you in an arm wrestle.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.360
 - I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.880
 - I know you've been bulking up.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.200
 - Thank you, I think a teenage human girl

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.040
 would probably beat Andy in an arm wrestle.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.440
 Oh wow, it's going there, are we?

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.920
 - Can I celebrate strong women, Dan?

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.040
 I'm sorry you don't.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.400
 (all laughing)

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.120
 - Wow, in the metaphorical arm wrestle,

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.920
 but in this discussion, you just got slammed.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.760
 - I got beat shitless, yeah.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.040
 - So I read this on Wikipedia,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.040
 and I looked for some contemporary reports,

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.280
 and I found this mention,

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.400
 actually this was from the 1930s they mentioned it,

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.240
 it was in the London Diary,

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.920
 and it was things that you were not allowed to mention

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.120
 in 1916 in France in World War I.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.440
 So that seemed to be that it might have happened,

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.160
 but then I went further back

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.480
 and found some reports in 1916 in the American press,

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.520
 and this definitely did happen.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.560
 And the Baron Henri de Rothschild

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.800
 had a place near the Elisae Palace,

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.440
 and he'd been to the Far East,

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.920
 which means that maybe this might have been

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.880
 an orangutan, we think.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.400
 He brought it to his home near the Elisae Palace,

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.680
 and it had escaped.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.520
 - Oh my God.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.880
 - And I read one account in the Oldie magazine,

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.040
 a bit more recently, that said,

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:06.040
 "The ape wrapped her in his embrace,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.440
 took her by the waist,

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.200
 and attempted to carry her up a tree."

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.280
 - That was like King Kong.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.720
 - It is King Kong, that's it.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.040
 - And then apparently, Poincaré, the president,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.720
 he apparently put the orangutan up

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:19.000
 against the firing squad.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.400
 - No, according to one article.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.800
 - Which is still King Kong.

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.040
 That's the exact quote.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.280
 - So I mean, whether that's all true or not,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.720
 like it definitely was reported in 1916 when it happened.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.560
 - 'Cause it's really hard, isn't it?

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.000
 'Cause it was censored from the French press.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.280
 - Yes, you've picked a really hard factor, especially.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.480
 - But it was mentioned in the world press around the time.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.160
 And apparently, President Deschanel, who came after him,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.520
 he was so impressed by the ape

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.680
 that he took to jumping in trees during state receptions.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.760
 - Oh, wow.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.480
 - But he was the one who went a bit crazy.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.560
 - He was very mad, wasn't he?

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:55.480
 - Deschanel was the manic pixie dream president, wasn't he?

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.720
 He was, he was the one who woke up on a train,

00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:59.320
 opened the window, fell out of it,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:01.200
 as it was going 35 miles an hour.

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.040
 They didn't know until the next morning that he was gone.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.640
 And he was found by a local rail guy who,

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.120
 he was saying, "I'm the president of France."

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.080
 He goes, "Sure, mate, sure, okay."

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.760
 Brings him to his home and they just keep him there

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.680
 until he convinces them that he is, yeah.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:17.080
 - And then later on, he left the palace

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.760
 to go into the gardens and started chatting

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.600
 to a park worker, but he had no trousers on.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.120
 And then he stepped into an ornamental fountain

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.600
 thinking it was a bath.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.920
 And then he resigned.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.680
 - Yeah, he was in the stress of the job.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.520
 - No, in fairness, like we think now

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:34.520
 that he had some sort of really awful

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.520
 sort of sleep deprivation illness.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.560
 - Help in a syndrome, I think it was called sleep.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.960
 Sleep drunkenness is a, yeah.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.840
 - But yeah, it was basically he would never,

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.520
 he couldn't go into REM sleep or anything.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.680
 So even when he slept,

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.680
 he just wasn't getting his brain refreshed.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.800
 - Oh boy, what a pain.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.440
 - It's so weird 'cause he lasted a long time being fine.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.480
 And then as soon as he became president.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.080
 - Maybe the stress did do something for it.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.160
 - Yeah, his wife was called Jermaine.

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.080
 And I just think I've blown something open

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.280
 but I don't quite know what because she's,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.600
 so Jermaine Deschanel was there.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.080
 She was a society lady.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.600
 She looks like she would have been so good at entertaining

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.120
 'cause your whole role as first lady then

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.360
 was throwing big parties and she was brilliant at that.

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.160
 So such a shame he only lasted about a minute as president.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.240
 But she's called Jermaine.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.760
 They were married in St. Jermaine church

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:28.040
 and he first went mad in St. Jermaine forest.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.960
 - All right, so what's your theory?

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.960
 - Well, I was throwing something open

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:32.800
 but I don't know what it is.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.640
 - Is this like the Peckham Butcher?

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.640
 Do you think she doesn't exist?

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.720
 - Well, she is the devil or something

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.120
 who she drove him mad by embodying a forest

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.120
 and then a church.

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.520
 - I think it's a very Jermaine theory.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.760
 - Oh yeah.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.400
 - And there's the missing piece.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.720
 - Yes.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.560
 - The pun.

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.040
 (all laughing)

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.240
 - You need for any conspiracy theory to be the pun.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.520
 - So this original president's wife,

00:46:58.520 --> 00:46:59.880
 the one who bumped into the orangutan

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.480
 was Madame Poincaré, right?

00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:03.880
 She was, so Mr. Poincaré,

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.680
 her, him indoors, was Raymond who was president,

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.040
 very presently, president for the whole

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.120
 First World War and some years on either side,

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:12.560
 PM three times as well over a longer period,

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.880
 like really, very imminent.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:15.040
 - And then came back to be president again,

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.160
 I think, afterwards.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:17.000
 - Wow.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.040
 Yeah, I mean, so like amazing political career.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.040
 So he would have had tube toothpaste.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.180
 - Right?

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.400
 - He would have had tube toothpaste.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.720
 - Yeah.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:28.640
 - So his cousin was Henri Poincaré,

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:30.200
 mathematician, who James, you might?

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.320
 - Oh, of conjecture fame.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.400
 - Of conjecture fame, and I'm putting big quotes on that.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.600
 - Poincaré, conjecture.

00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.120
 - So he's, yeah, he's really famous, right?

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:38.960
 - Oh yeah.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:39.800
 - In maths world.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.640
 - In maths world, yeah.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.480
 - So I just love this, this is a slight sidebar,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.720
 but he was in a picture, Henri Poincaré,

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:48.800
 which is known as the most intelligent photo ever taken.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.640
 - So there are lots of smart people in it.

00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:51.480
 - Exactly.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.840
 - More than that one from the Oscars

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.600
 with Ellen the generous in it.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.960
 - Amazingly, no, that one,

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.760
 that was not the most intelligent photo I've taken,

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.160
 but this was in 1927.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.760
 So it was the previous record holder.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.000
 Can we guess who's in the photo?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.840
 Would we know?

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.680
 - Let's say Einstein.

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.880
 - Let's say Einstein.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.160
 I'll give you a clue.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.400
 - Neil's bar.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.720
 - Can I give you the clue?

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:11.560
 - Wait.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.400
 - Proust.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.240
 - Please wait.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:14.080
 - Marie Curie.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:14.920
 - Hugo.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:16.240
 - I mean, you kind of hit all of them.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.480
 - The 1927 Solvay conference on quantum mechanics,

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.760
 which was held in Brussels, attracted,

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.840
 there were 29 people in this photo,

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.640
 17 of whom got Nobel prizes.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.480
 - Oh my God.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.320
 - The photo was stunning.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.200
 So you said Einstein.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.560
 You said Marie Curie.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.680
 You said Dirac.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.040
 Someone said Paul Dirac.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.320
 Neil's ball, Max Planck, Heisenberg,

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.440
 Erwin Trödinger, August Picard.

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:40.600
 Like everybody, 17 of them got no bells.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.440
 And just Picard.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.280
 - Wow.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.120
 - I know.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.120
 Yeah, Picard, yeah, yeah.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.000
 But there's just one photo of the,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
 maybe the most intelligent conference

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.840
 that's ever happened.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.160
 - It wasn't in the.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:52.000
 - And Poincaré was in it.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.840
 - Oh, he took it.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.660
 He was in it.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.500
 - He was one of the.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.320
 - Wow.

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.160
 - There were people in it.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.000
 - And that's lots of nuclear physicists

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
 of that period as well, right?

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.840
 - Right.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:00.680
 - 'Cause I wonder if the phrase,

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.760
 "If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now,"

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.600
 would have been used.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.760
 - I'm afraid the atomic bomb hadn't been invented.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.600
 - No, no, no.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:07.440
 Okay.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.260
 Well, a bomb.

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:09.100
 - Is there a phrase that says,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.440
 "If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now"?

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:12.720
 - No, I was just adding that to the bomb.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.640
 If a bomb hit this.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.960
 - If a bomb, right.

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.680
 - If a bomb hit this recording studio we're in right now,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.140
 no effect on global history.

00:49:20.140 --> 00:49:22.120
 (all laughing)

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:22.960
 - Do yourself that.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.020
 - Although next year's top barbecue podcast

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.340
 might be short one candidate.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:28.460
 (all laughing)

00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:32.860
 Can I just ask quickly the censorship over that story,

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:35.620
 is it because it wasn't so much that it was embarrassing?

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.460
 It's just that no matter what interview they gave,

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.580
 the journalist was just desperate to say.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.420
 - You know what Dan?

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.660
 Like I really, I did a lot of very, very in-depth research

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.900
 on this and it's very difficult to research,

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.900
 but I think it was because they were trying to keep morale

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.260
 up in the country.

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.600
 I can't think of anything that would improve morale more

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:57.980
 than if I found out what's the name Starmer

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.780
 that was attacked by a cheetah

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.060
 in the background down on the street.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.180
 (all laughing)

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.600
 - Well, I think also like it could denigrate his authority.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.940
 - Yeah, right.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.180
 Like they're quite good about,

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.000
 well rather they're quite strict about private lives

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:12.840
 in France in particular.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.680
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.500
 - But you're right.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:15.340
 And it's sort of a leading industrialist as well.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.480
 It's like if Alan Sugar's pet Komodo dragon

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:20.120
 had temporarily abducted Mrs. Starmer.

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.180
 - And Starmer's had it shot by a firing squad.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:23.260
 - Yes. - Lovely.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.120
 - She, Madame Poincaré, she was quite controversial.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.440
 In fact, the Queen of England was very snobbish

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.900
 about her, Queen Mary.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:35.000
 They did an official visit in 1914

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.940
 and she refused to be seen with her at first.

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.380
 - Sorry, that's just grinning away

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.380
 at the thought of Queen Mary

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.000
 using some collapsible toothpaste tubes.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.260
 - I was about to say, how did you know?

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:47.620
 - 'Cause I had the same thought then.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.280
 (all laughing)

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.740
 - I don't know the state of her dental hygiene.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.940
 All I know is I'm trying to make the serious point

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:57.100
 that the English, the Brits were very snobbish

00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.300
 because Madame Poincaré, she was very old when she married.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:01.380
 This wasn't why they disapproved.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:03.620
 This is sort of why I disapproved when I read about the story.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:05.460
 She was in her, she was 46

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.740
 and the primus was a bit younger.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.140
 So Queen Mary refused to share a carriage with her

00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:11.860
 because she was divorced and her first husband

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:15.060
 was a cab driver who was still alive.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.380
 - Oh, okay. - Unbelievable.

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.500
 - It's showing because they could have run

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.760
 with the headline Cougar attacked by chimpanzee.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:22.840
 (all laughing)

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:23.680
 - Very good.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.720
 - I mean, that mirrors current prime minister,

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:27.600
 sorry, Brigitte Macron.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.440
 - The French are into it, yeah.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.160
 - And they're also into presidents

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.920
 having lots of mistresses all the way.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.520
 François Hollande, he had four children

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.600
 with his long-term partner,

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.000
 but then when he became president,

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.200
 moved in with his mistress, Valérie Truvile.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:47.400
 But then he cheated on her with an actor

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.100
 with an actress and it was really funny

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.860
 'cause he went off to see this actress

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.700
 with a motorcycle helmet on his head

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:57.420
 thinking that no one would be able to tell it was him.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:58.960
 But he wore the same pair of socks

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.220
 that he'd been wearing at a recent international visit.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.100
 So the photographers took a photo of him

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:04.780
 and went, "I recognize those socks."

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.180
 - Whoa. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.380
 - That was bad luck.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.460
 - What does the sock say, president of France?

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.820
 Like what was-- (all laughing)

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:13.260
 - It must have been quite distinctive.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.100
 - I think it must have been

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.740
 'cause most socks are just quite plain.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.560
 - Most male professionals wear plain black socks.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.640
 - That's why I always wear plain black socks

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.840
 is so I can get away with being a cat.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.560
 - What socks I'm wearing?

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.460
 - Just a shagger on your socks, James.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:28.180
 (all laughing)

00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:30.040
 - I'm wearing part of a girl's socks,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.840
 which I reckon if, oh, look at Dan's.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.040
 He's got bright yellow ones.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.160
 - James, you must be the only man

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:36.120
 in London wearing those socks today.

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:37.760
 - I know, if I have an affair.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.840
 - Yeah, you're screwed.

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.160
 - Dan, what's that?

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.680
 - It's blast skateboards.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.000
 It's their logo.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.880
 I am the only man wearing this in London today,

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.060
 but because of them, I will not be having an affair.

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:49.420
 - I think the same applies to James.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:51.780
 - Show you mine, plain black.

00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.940
 - Lovely, lovely.

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.820
 - If you see a man having an affair

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.100
 and playing back socks, you know it's not me or Dan.

00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:59.000
 - No, and if they've got a little garter

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.060
 and they're tighter than me, you'll know it's me.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:02.740
 (all laughing)

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.940
 He is not, I don't mean to be rude about him,

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.260
 but he's not David Gandhi.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:07.100
 - Oland, who's saying?

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.940
 - Oland, yeah.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:10.140
 He's an example of power being a great aphrodisiac.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.420
 You know, he's sort of just a very average-looking dude

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.020
 who happened to be the president of France.

00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.120
 - He's not David Gandhi, is that the best?

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.960
 - Yeah, I don't know.

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.560
 Is that Mahatma Gandhi's brother?

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.320
 - He's Mahatma Gandhi's, yeah, yeah.

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.120
 Mahatma Gandhi had taken his well-man pills.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.600
 He would have looked like David.

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.160
 - David's one of my top-end model, male model.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.100
 - He's an underpan model.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.600
 - Right. - Oh, yeah.

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:29.600
 - Okay, yeah.

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.040
 - Is this the first ever modern popular culture reference

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.320
 that Andy's ever said on the podcast?

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320
 - I think it might be, yeah.

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.960
 - Maybe that none of us have, well, I've got it,

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.320
 but like that you two haven't heard it.

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.640
 - I can't believe you haven't, Hannah.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.640
 - He's sort of a famous guy.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.040
 - You think I know a lot of male underpan models?

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:45.780
 - He might get a magazine or something, I don't know.

00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:47.020
 - Right, yeah.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.860
 - But Jack Chirac, President of France?

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:49.700
 - Yeah.

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.940
 - He muddled the pants.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:52.300
 - Well, he might as well have done.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.300
 I mean, he certainly showed his pants off a lot.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.140
 - Did he?

00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.180
 - He, when he was mayor of Paris in the 1980s,

00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.140
 he ordered the city council to buy him a coat

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.340
 fitted with a bedroom so he could meet lovers

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:02.500
 on official engagement.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.340
 - Oh, wow.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.540
 - Sorry, a coat fitted with a bedroom.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.380
 - Coat.

00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:06.580
 - Coat, right?

00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.700
 - Coat like a bus.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.340
 - Like a national express.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:11.580
 (laughing)

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:13.680
 - Like a mega bus.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.520
 - Like a mega bus.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.240
 - A really mega bus.

00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.720
 - Was that so he could have lots of affairs

00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.520
 not just so he could sleep between?

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.880
 - No, it was specifically so he could meet lovers.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:24.280
 - Did he say that?

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:28.040
 - Well, he had his private jet when he was president,

00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:30.160
 had a room that was for trists.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.000
 - Lovely.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.120
 He has the weirdest thing, which made me sort of warm to him.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:35.920
 So Jack and Bernadette, his wife,

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.560
 brought a Vietnamese refugee to live with them

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.360
 and sort of adopted a Vietnamese refugee.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.540
 And it was on a whim.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.620
 So this woman was called Anne Dow Traxel.

00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:45.660
 She was actually about 20.

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.260
 But she'd escaped from a refugee camp in 1979

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.220
 when the Vietnamese were having a not very good time.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.820
 And she was crying in the corner of an airport in France.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:56.060
 And Jack Shorak saw her, approached her,

00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.180
 and said, "Don't cry, my dear,

00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.780
 from now on you'll live with us."

00:54:58.780 --> 00:54:59.980
 - Hmm, okay.

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.420
 I've got a special bedroom on the jumper.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.260
 - Yeah.

00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:03.100
 (laughing)

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.500
 - Can I tell you one French heroine I found out,

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.980
 she wasn't First Lady of France or anything,

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:08.540
 but just in the course of researching her,

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.240
 so I found out about her, 'cause she was amazing.

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:12.600
 Her name was Valerie André.

00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.560
 She died this year in February.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.400
 She was the wife of President Peter André,

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.240
 wasn't she?

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.080
 - She was.

00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.720
 And she was a mysterious girl.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.560
 She died this year.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.760
 She was 102 years old, right?

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:25.460
 So she lived 1923 to 2025.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:29.200
 She was, in this order, a brain surgeon, a parachutist,

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.120
 and the first woman to fly helicopter missions

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.480
 in combat zones, and the first French woman

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.320
 to become a general in their army.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.160
 - Wow.

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.660
 - She would do parachute jumps into combat zones

00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:40.540
 if someone had been wounded, right?

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.780
 You know, she would either do parachute jumps in

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.560
 or she would fly a helicopter in herself,

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:46.700
 pick up a wounded soldier in the helicopter,

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.440
 fly them to hospital, and then she'd say,

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.260
 "Hello, I'm gonna be your surgeon today,"

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.420
 and do the operation on them.

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.260
 - That's amazing.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.660
 - I just think I was like, imagine that.

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:58.060
 Imagine you're pilot then becoming a surgeon

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:00.360
 halfway through and patching you up.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.200
 Just crazy.

00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:05.600
 - I think I would feel less confident in her in both roles.

00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.700
 (laughing)

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.300
 - I think you're not putting your full life

00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.860
 into being a helicopter pilot or a surgeon, are you?

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.780
 - Would you say that before she made the first incision,

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:14.980
 or would you maybe wait until?

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.660
 - I'd be like, do we not have someone

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:18.460
 who studied their whole life as a surgeon

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.180
 who could do my surgery, please?

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:22.260
 - Looking at gift horse in the mouth, or what?

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.560
 (laughing)

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.660
 - That's so funny.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.980
 (laughing)

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:27.340
 - I'm not gonna sign this consent form.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.180
 (laughing)

00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:31.760
 (upbeat music)

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:35.240
 - Okay, that's it.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.220
 That is all of our facts.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:37.620
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.660
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:40.740

 we can all be found on our various social media accounts.

 You can find me at @triberland.

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.180

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.780
 or Instagram at no such thing as a fish

 - Yep, or you can head to our website,

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.480
 no such thing as a fish.com.

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.080
 All of our previous episodes are up there.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.520
 There's also links to an upcoming live show

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.400
 that we're doing later this year in Sheffield.

00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:13.920
 It is part of the Crossed Wires Festival.

00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.720
 That's happening on the 6th of July.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.960
 Tickets are available.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.200
 We also have a lot of merch that's up there.

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.320
 We have the entrance to our secret club,

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.000
 which has bonus episodes behind the scenes stuff.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.480
 It has extra compilations of all the outtakes.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.200
 From our show, it's called Club Fish.

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.680
 - Is it still $2.99 then?

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.280
 - At the moment, but I am on the brink of changing

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.660
 that, James.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.020
 So get in quick, get in while that lasts,

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.660
 and yeah, otherwise just come back

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:40.060
 'cause we will be back here with another episode next week

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.980
 and we will see you then, goodbye.

00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.560
 (upbeat music)

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.140
 (upbeat music)

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.720
