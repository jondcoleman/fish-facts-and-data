00:00:02,00:00:15,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:18,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:18,00:00:20,from the QI offices in Hoburn.
00:00:20,00:00:21,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:21,00:00:24,"I am sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski,"
00:00:24,00:00:26,and Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:00:26,00:00:28,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:28,00:00:31,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Starting with fact number one, and that is My Fact."
00:00:37,00:00:40,"My Fact this week is that a lot of the Daniel Day Lewis movie,"
00:00:40,00:00:44,"My Left Foot, was filmed using his right foot."
00:00:44,00:00:46,- What are you saying using?
00:00:46,00:00:48,"Is that, we're operating the camera with his right foot?"
00:00:48,00:00:49,"- Yeah, that's what it sounds like."
00:00:49,00:00:50,- While he filmed his left foot.
00:00:50,00:00:54,"Yes, and when I say a lot, I also mean some."
00:00:54,00:00:56,So let's just put this into context.
00:00:56,00:00:58,This is a movie about an Irish writer
00:00:58,00:01:00,and painter called Christy Brown.
00:01:00,00:01:02,"He was born with cerebral palsy,"
00:01:02,00:01:06,"and by the time he was an older kid, he didn't walk,"
00:01:06,00:01:08,"he couldn't do much, and he only really could operate"
00:01:08,00:01:10,"by moving his left foot,"
00:01:10,00:01:12,particularly the big toe on his left foot.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"As he grew older, he got really excited"
00:01:14,00:01:15,by the idea of becoming an artist.
00:01:15,00:01:17,"He started to learn to paint,"
00:01:17,00:01:19,and then he started to write a book
00:01:19,00:01:22,by using that left toe on a typewriter.
00:01:22,00:01:23,"It was a massive success,"
00:01:23,00:01:26,"and this is what eventually became a biopic,"
00:01:26,00:01:28,which starred Daniel Day-Lewis.
00:01:28,00:01:29,"Now, for anyone who knows Daniel Day-Lewis,"
00:01:29,00:01:30,he's a method actor.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"He loves to really immerse himself,"
00:01:32,00:01:35,"and in this case, he operated most of the movie"
00:01:35,00:01:37,from a wheelchair using his left foot.
00:01:37,00:01:40,"- Yeah, and when you say method actor,"
00:01:40,00:01:42,he basically lived as this character
00:01:42,00:01:43,"throughout the whole time, right?"
00:01:43,00:01:46,"He stayed in the wheelchair the whole time, pretty much."
00:01:46,00:01:48,Like he had to be carried places.
00:01:48,00:01:50,"- Yeah, made the cast and crew feed him."
00:01:50,00:01:52,"- Well, he just was trying to stay in character,"
00:01:52,00:01:53,but here's the thing.
00:01:53,00:01:58,The movie involves some quite intense stunts footwork-wise.
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Okay, the movie is not,"
00:02:00,00:02:01,"I'm sorry, I watched the film yesterday."
00:02:01,00:02:02,It's a terrific film.
00:02:02,00:02:03,Stunts is not a good way to play it.
00:02:03,00:02:04,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"And when you say this movie contains footwork,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,it's not like Ginger Rogers.
00:02:07,00:02:09,(laughing)
00:02:09,00:02:11,"- So there's a couple of scenes where he,"
00:02:11,00:02:13,"as an actor, was unable to do it"
00:02:13,00:02:16,by manipulating his left foot into the right positions.
00:02:16,00:02:17,- But so the scenes are basically
00:02:17,00:02:19,he's holding a paintbrush or a pencil.
00:02:19,00:02:20,- Or writing.
00:02:20,00:02:22,"And the first shot of the whole film,"
00:02:22,00:02:24,it's just a shot of a foot.
00:02:24,00:02:27,And it's taking a vinyl record out of the sleeve.
00:02:27,00:02:28,- Yeah.
00:02:28,00:02:28,- And popping it off the turn.
00:02:28,00:02:29,"- So what you're saying, Dan,"
00:02:29,00:02:31,is that he did that with his right foot
00:02:31,00:02:32,instead of his left foot.
00:02:32,00:02:33,- Exactly.
00:02:33,00:02:34,"- Now my question is,"
00:02:34,00:02:36,how did we not tell the difference in the movie?
00:02:36,00:02:38,- He has them switched around.
00:02:38,00:02:40,It's really the opposite way around.
00:02:40,00:02:41,- That's the method.
00:02:41,00:02:44,He had to speak seven and then reversed.
00:02:44,00:02:45,(laughing)
00:02:45,00:02:47,"- That's exactly it, Andy's got it right."
00:02:47,00:02:48,It was mirror filmed.
00:02:48,00:02:52,So the detail is a bit actually quite hard
00:02:52,00:02:55,to work out if they flipped the film itself
00:02:55,00:02:57,as in they did a mirror image
00:02:57,00:03:00,or if they filmed through a mirror.
00:03:00,00:03:00,"- Right, okay."
00:03:00,00:03:02,- Has anyone else seen it?
00:03:02,00:03:03,"- Yeah, many years ago."
00:03:03,00:03:04,Good film.
00:03:04,00:03:06,"Weirdly, I read the book about 20 years ago."
00:03:06,00:03:07,It was also a great book.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"- Did you, right?"
00:03:08,00:03:10,"- Yes, apparently he's a brilliant writer"
00:03:10,00:03:11,"when the book came out,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,"which bizarrely was when this guy Christy was,"
00:03:14,00:03:16,Christy Brown was only 22.
00:03:16,00:03:18,He was so young to be writing about your experiences
00:03:18,00:03:20,"so far, but I think it was in the 50s."
00:03:20,00:03:21,"And when it came out,"
00:03:21,00:03:23,"someone said, I think the Irish standard or something,"
00:03:23,00:03:25,said that it was the most important book
00:03:25,00:03:27,since Ulysses in Ireland.
00:03:27,00:03:30,- I think that might have been the subsequent book.
00:03:30,00:03:31,"- Sorry, you're absolutely right."
00:03:31,00:03:32,That was his magnum opus.
00:03:32,00:03:33,"Yes, what's it called?"
00:03:33,00:03:34,Down on All Days?
00:03:34,00:03:35,- Down on All Days.
00:03:35,00:03:37,"But I mean, they were both absolutely massive."
00:03:37,00:03:40,"And he was from a family of 22 children,"
00:03:40,00:03:42,not all of whom made it to adulthood.
00:03:42,00:03:43,- I think 11 did.
00:03:43,00:03:45,"- 11 did, yeah, imagine that."
00:03:45,00:03:46,Good grief.
00:03:46,00:03:47,- That's from the birthdays.
00:03:47,00:03:48,- That's the candles.
00:03:48,00:03:49,- That's true.
00:03:49,00:03:51,That's the candles.
00:03:51,00:03:53,"- Oh yeah, I was gonna say you could reuse them,"
00:03:53,00:03:54,"but no, you can't reuse them."
00:03:54,00:03:54,"- No, well, you can."
00:03:54,00:03:57,"- Oh, it depends how quickly you light and blow, right?"
00:03:57,00:03:59,- But most birthday candles are so thin.
00:03:59,00:04:01,Maybe they had a very strict lighting and blowing policy.
00:04:01,00:04:01,Maybe in the--
00:04:01,00:04:02,- You'd have to.
00:04:02,00:04:03,You'd have to.
00:04:03,00:04:05,"Anyway, it's a very--"
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Is that in the book?
00:04:06,00:04:09,"- It's like, it's been 20 years, I can't remember."
00:04:09,00:04:10,"It's definitely not an overwritten book though,"
00:04:10,00:04:12,because he's typing it with one toe.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"So he doesn't go for the incredibly long sentence,"
00:04:15,00:04:15,quite a lot of the time.
00:04:15,00:04:17,"- It's kind of the reverse Ulysses, isn't it, in a way?"
00:04:17,00:04:19,"- Yes, it is, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:04:19,00:04:20,- That was good.
00:04:20,00:04:21,"- And it was a big book, right?"
00:04:21,00:04:24,"So when it came out, it made Splash internationally."
00:04:24,00:04:26,He actually got no correspondence
00:04:26,00:04:28,"with this American woman called Beth Moore,"
00:04:28,00:04:31,"and he eventually went over to hang out with her,"
00:04:31,00:04:33,"and she was married, but they had an affair."
00:04:33,00:04:36,"And this is where he wrote his magnum opus, this novel."
00:04:36,00:04:39,"And she basically is the reason he got it done,"
00:04:39,00:04:40,"because at this point,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,"he did have a bit of an alcohol problem,"
00:04:41,00:04:43,and it was preventing him from getting on with stuff.
00:04:43,00:04:45,"She basically said, ""You're not allowed to drink"
00:04:45,00:04:46,"""until the end of the day,"
00:04:46,00:04:47,"""after you've done a full day's of writing,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,"""and then you can have that."""
00:04:48,00:04:49,And that's how he got the novel done.
00:04:49,00:04:51,He dedicates it to her.
00:04:51,00:04:53,"He goes back to Ireland,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,and then they have more correspondence saying--
00:04:55,00:04:56,- Is he married as well at the time?
00:04:56,00:04:57,'Cause he did marry a couple of times.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"- No, he wasn't married at the time."
00:04:58,00:04:58,"- No, 'cause he's not married."
00:04:58,00:04:59,- He's not married.
00:04:59,00:05:01,"- Yeah, so, but she tells her husband,"
00:05:01,00:05:02,"""I'm gonna marry Christy."""
00:05:02,00:05:04,"And just as that's about to happen,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"Christy meets his wife and gets married,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,and then Beth is stuck.
00:05:08,00:05:10,"- So, bit of an asshole, actually."
00:05:10,00:05:12,"You know, people don't really focus on this bit, do they?"
00:05:12,00:05:16,"Abandoned poor Beth for his new woman,"
00:05:16,00:05:18,"who's the person I think in the film,"
00:05:18,00:05:19,"which I haven't seen, but he goes off with a woman"
00:05:19,00:05:21,"at the very end of the film, I think."
00:05:21,00:05:23,It looks like it's going to be happy.
00:05:23,00:05:25,"But actually, that's the person he went off with."
00:05:25,00:05:27,"And it seems like, based on his life,"
00:05:27,00:05:30,"Beth, who helped him write his great novel,"
00:05:30,00:05:34,"was a lovely woman, and he ended up with this other lady,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"who I think a lot of his family didn't like,"
00:05:36,00:05:39,who turned him into a bit of a recluse.
00:05:39,00:05:42,"She was an alcoholic herself, I believe."
00:05:42,00:05:43,"- There were allegations of abuse,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"so he passed away, quite sadly, at 49."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"- Really young, yeah, yeah."
00:05:46,00:05:49,"- He was choked while eating, but, yeah, on his body,"
00:05:49,00:05:52,"there were sort of unexplained bruises all over,"
00:05:52,00:05:53,"with the abuse. - Yeah, wow."
00:05:53,00:05:54,"What about Daniel De Lewis, eh?"
00:05:54,00:05:55,"- Oof. - Well, not that guy."
00:05:55,00:05:57,- He's a character.
00:05:57,00:05:57,(laughing)
00:05:57,00:06:00,"- Well, more often than he is himself, yeah."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"- So, before this podcast recording time,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,I had never seen any of the films with Daniel De Lewis in.
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Is that right?
00:06:07,00:06:08,- Not one. - That was so cool.
00:06:08,00:06:08,Not one.
00:06:08,00:06:09,- Wow.
00:06:09,00:06:10,"- I thought he was in ""Backman Forever"","
00:06:10,00:06:11,but it turns out that was someone else.
00:06:11,00:06:12,(laughing)
00:06:12,00:06:13,- Don't spell kill them.
00:06:13,00:06:13,"- No, spell kill them."
00:06:13,00:06:15,You're thinking of Jim Carrey.
00:06:15,00:06:17,(laughing)
00:06:17,00:06:20,"- So, I've never seen any of the interests."
00:06:20,00:06:21,- Have you just watched them all?
00:06:21,00:06:22,"Have you seen, how many have you seen now?"
00:06:22,00:06:24,- I've now seen one and a half way through two others.
00:06:24,00:06:25,- Which two?
00:06:25,00:06:26,"- Gangs of New York, have you watched that?"
00:06:26,00:06:27,"- No, I haven't."
00:06:27,00:06:28,"- Oh, that's a brilliant movie."
00:06:28,00:06:29,- It sounds great.
00:06:29,00:06:31,"I've started, not on ""American Werewolf"" in London,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,"but ""The Last Mohican"", sorry."
00:06:32,00:06:33,"- Yep. - Oh, yeah."
00:06:33,00:06:35,"- I started ""The Last Mohican"", terrific."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Was watching that in the small house this morning.
00:06:36,00:06:39,"And I'm also watching ""Stars and Bars"","
00:06:39,00:06:41,which is a goofy comedy he made immediately
00:06:41,00:06:43,"after ""My Left Foot"", which appears to have been"
00:06:43,00:06:45,"the only film for which he's never done any method work,"
00:06:45,00:06:45,whatsoever.
00:06:45,00:06:46,- What was his character in that?
00:06:46,00:06:47,"- The premise is just like,"
00:06:47,00:06:50,what if a goofy British guy went to the deep South of America
00:06:50,00:06:52,and it is so bad?
00:06:52,00:06:53,(laughing)
00:06:53,00:06:55,"- I've managed to watch the only time they know this film,"
00:06:55,00:06:57,which is not like five-star.
00:06:57,00:06:58,This will change your life movie.
00:06:58,00:07:00,"- Well, in ""The Last Mohicans"","
00:07:00,00:07:02,he caught and killed all of his food.
00:07:02,00:07:02,- Brilliant.
00:07:02,00:07:04,"- Apparently, I had to get into that character."
00:07:04,00:07:06,"- Yeah, he lived for a whole month in the wilderness,"
00:07:06,00:07:09,"didn't he, in order to fully immerse himself."
00:07:09,00:07:11,"- He was in ""The Crucible"""
00:07:11,00:07:13,"and he didn't bathe for the entirety of ""The Crucible""."
00:07:13,00:07:15,"Now, I'm not sure, is that about the witch trial?"
00:07:15,00:07:17,"Sorry, is that about Snooker?"
00:07:17,00:07:19,(laughing)
00:07:19,00:07:20,- It's the happy marriage of the two.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- He bathed, but he kept one foot on the floor at all time."
00:07:22,00:07:25,(laughing)
00:07:25,00:07:26,"I think my favorite one,"
00:07:26,00:07:27,"'cause I don't ever heard of him as like this,"
00:07:27,00:07:30,incredible that he lives the role.
00:07:30,00:07:32,"My favorite is the unbearable likeness of being,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,"I'm sure you guys all found this,"
00:07:33,00:07:37,"which is based on a Czech novel by Milan Kundera,"
00:07:37,00:07:38,"and he learned Czech,"
00:07:38,00:07:40,"learned to speak Czech almost fluently for the film,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"despite the fact the film is in English,"
00:07:42,00:07:44,"all of his lines are in English,"
00:07:44,00:07:46,"and he said, ""Yeah, but I can't just do an accent."""
00:07:46,00:07:48,"I need to know where that accent comes from, great."
00:07:48,00:07:50,So he put all of his lines through the Czechy New
00:07:50,00:07:52,"and then back into English to do the accent, I mean, insane."
00:07:52,00:07:55,"- And do you know what people who speak Czech,"
00:07:55,00:07:56,and particularly British people who now live
00:07:56,00:07:57,"in the Czech Republic,"
00:07:57,00:08:00,say that it's a really bad Czech accent?
00:08:00,00:08:02,"- Oh no, he says nothing like a Czech English."
00:08:02,00:08:04,"- If you learn how to speak a language,"
00:08:04,00:08:06,that doesn't mean you learn how to speak English
00:08:06,00:08:09,"in that accent, but that's the one problem"
00:08:09,00:08:11,when you learn a language is you can never nail the accent.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"- Yeah, I also really want to find out how fluent he is,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"'cause there's so much allegation about this,"
00:08:16,00:08:19,"and apparently, according to the Foreign Services Institute,"
00:08:19,00:08:21,"which ranks languages by difficulty,"
00:08:21,00:08:25,Czech is in the fourth out of five hardest languages.
00:08:25,00:08:28,"So I mean, it takes years and years and years to nail."
00:08:28,00:08:29,"So how, I mean, was it,"
00:08:29,00:08:31,"do you think it was like primary school, French level?"
00:08:31,00:08:32,"- I always wonder that,"
00:08:32,00:08:35,whenever you see like a top footballer or a basketball player
00:08:35,00:08:38,"going, I speak nine languages to you."
00:08:38,00:08:40,"Did you Kobe Bryant, did you really?"
00:08:40,00:08:41,"- Well, did you just learn how to say,"
00:08:41,00:08:44,"oh, I got that three points today?"
00:08:44,00:08:46,"- Exactly, 'cause as that fact we did ages ago"
00:08:46,00:08:47,"about umpires and tennis,"
00:08:47,00:08:49,do you need to learn all the swear words
00:08:49,00:08:50,in multiple languages or something on the same?
00:08:50,00:08:51,Maybe it's just that.
00:08:51,00:08:54,"I mean, obviously some of it is myth-making,"
00:08:54,00:08:56,"but I love it, I just love it."
00:08:56,00:08:59,"Like he played Lincoln, President Lincoln."
00:08:59,00:09:01,So he actually-
00:09:01,00:09:02,- He got assassinated for that one.
00:09:02,00:09:05,"- He got assassinated, he had himself made President first."
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And then, so on the set of Lincoln,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,it was just totally a period appropriate.
00:09:11,00:09:14,"So supposedly, nobody was allowed to tell that"
00:09:14,00:09:16,wearing a T-shirt with a logo on.
00:09:16,00:09:19,"Like, I presume all the like thousands of electricians"
00:09:19,00:09:21,of people who work on the film had to be in front coats
00:09:21,00:09:24,"and things like, it's addressed to like union soldiers."
00:09:24,00:09:26,"No shorts, no paper coffee cups."
00:09:26,00:09:28,Lincoln wouldn't have had a paper coffee cup.
00:09:28,00:09:30,I imagine it's more for Daniel Day-Lewis
00:09:30,00:09:31,than it is for everyone else.
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- But you've got to slightly create the scene around him,"
00:09:33,00:09:34,haven't you?
00:09:34,00:09:36,"I mean, like in there's a famous thing in Gangs of New York"
00:09:36,00:09:37,"when he was filming,"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"where first of all, Stephen Graham,"
00:09:39,00:09:41,"who is very famous and brilliant British actor,"
00:09:41,00:09:44,said that he was such a great guy to work with
00:09:44,00:09:46,and they became friends before they started filming
00:09:46,00:09:48,"and they did the training together,"
00:09:48,00:09:49,some martial arts training together.
00:09:49,00:09:51,"And then the first day on set,"
00:09:51,00:09:53,Daniel Day-Lewis walks on the set
00:09:53,00:09:55,"and just touches him on the shoulder and says,"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"""From now on, I call you Shang and you call me Bill."""
00:09:58,00:09:58,And then moves on.
00:09:58,00:09:59,So cool.
00:09:59,00:10:01,- Bill the butcher.
00:10:01,00:10:01,- And then indeed-
00:10:01,00:10:02,- Is that his character?
00:10:02,00:10:03,- Yes.
00:10:03,00:10:05,- I read that he worked as a butcher for some time.
00:10:05,00:10:08,I know I read butchers were flown over to the set.
00:10:08,00:10:09,- It was one butcher.
00:10:09,00:10:11,But I've got a theory about this butcher.
00:10:11,00:10:13,I don't think he's a butcher.
00:10:13,00:10:14,- Okay.
00:10:14,00:10:16,- I think this butcher is the ultimate method actor.
00:10:16,00:10:18,He's a guy called John Dell.
00:10:18,00:10:18,Look him up.
00:10:18,00:10:22,"He's a butcher who runs W, head and co-butchers in Peckham."
00:10:22,00:10:23,- Sounds like he is a butcher.
00:10:23,00:10:26,"- Well, no evidence of that online at all."
00:10:26,00:10:27,- Oh.
00:10:27,00:10:29,- There's like one little company record
00:10:29,00:10:30,of it once existing.
00:10:30,00:10:31,John Dell.
00:10:31,00:10:33,"- How many butchers have websites, though?"
00:10:33,00:10:34,Especially at the time that Gangs of New York
00:10:34,00:10:36,"was the 2002 film, it's early into there."
00:10:36,00:10:37,It wasn't required that a butcher
00:10:37,00:10:41,had to have a buzzing online presence in 2002.
00:10:41,00:10:43,- Everyone's Google reviewed something.
00:10:43,00:10:44,"- Oh, come on."
00:10:44,00:10:45,- I couldn't find nothing.
00:10:45,00:10:46,"He was an amazing character, though."
00:10:46,00:10:48,"When he was interviewed, first of all,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,he was asked by the producer who lived in Peckham
00:10:50,00:10:51,and he knew him.
00:10:51,00:10:53,"And he was like, this guy's a legit butcher."
00:10:53,00:10:55,He knows how to slaughter a pig.
00:10:55,00:10:56,So-
00:10:56,00:10:57,- He's an avatar worker.
00:10:57,00:10:58,"You could clearly, yeah."
00:10:58,00:10:59,"If your butcher's killing the pig,"
00:10:59,00:11:01,that's a problem with the sourcing.
00:11:01,00:11:03,Butchers don't normally kill the animal.
00:11:03,00:11:03,"- No, sorry."
00:11:03,00:11:04,- No butchers.
00:11:04,00:11:06,"I mean, butcher the animal."
00:11:06,00:11:08,But he was very good at butchering pigs.
00:11:08,00:11:11,So he trained Daniel Day-Lewis in how to butcher a pig.
00:11:11,00:11:12,And they got along really well.
00:11:12,00:11:15,He said Daniel Day-Lewis could butcher a pig like no one else.
00:11:15,00:11:17,He'd never seen anyone else with the knife skills.
00:11:17,00:11:18,He'd never seen anyone else
00:11:18,00:11:19,with the natural feel for cutting meat.
00:11:19,00:11:20,- And this is a man who presumably
00:11:20,00:11:22,has known a lot of other butchers.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"- I reckon 'cause they hang out together, don't they?"
00:11:24,00:11:24,- Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:25,- Yeah.
00:11:25,00:11:26,- I love the sound of Daniel Day-Lewis.
00:11:26,00:11:27,He sounds like a really nice bloke.
00:11:27,00:11:28,"And when he's interviewed about it,"
00:11:28,00:11:29,he sounds quite normal.
00:11:29,00:11:30,- Yeah.
00:11:30,00:11:31,- Because I'm just trying to get into the head
00:11:31,00:11:34,"of the character so that when I put it on film, it's real."
00:11:34,00:11:36,- I think he's a big old liar.
00:11:36,00:11:36,- No.
00:11:36,00:11:37,- You think he's just not doing it?
00:11:37,00:11:38,- I genuinely do.
00:11:38,00:11:41,"I think some of it's true, but I think there's some."
00:11:41,00:11:42,"And actually, I think a lot of the lies"
00:11:42,00:11:44,are made up by people around him.
00:11:44,00:11:47,But there was the famous thing where he walked off stage
00:11:47,00:11:49,'cause he thought he saw his dad in the wings
00:11:49,00:11:50,when he was doing Hamlet.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- That's right.
00:11:51,00:11:54,"- And then later on, he did an interview saying"
00:11:54,00:11:55,that's what happened.
00:11:55,00:11:56,"And then later on, he went, ""No, it didn't really happen."""
00:11:56,00:11:58,- He said he was just tired.
00:11:58,00:11:59,He said he was just exhausted
00:11:59,00:12:01,"and you're doing a play for every day for 18 months,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,"whatever, that's really exhausting."
00:12:03,00:12:04,"- But you can imagine if Daniel Del Luis says,"
00:12:04,00:12:06,"""I saw my dad father in the wings,"""
00:12:06,00:12:07,"you're gonna believe that, aren't you?"
00:12:07,00:12:08,"- Absolutely, yeah."
00:12:08,00:12:10,"- And it was, he's never done theater since."
00:12:10,00:12:11,"- But he explains, actually,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,he prefers the medium of film and so on and so forth.
00:12:15,00:12:16,- I kind of agree.
00:12:16,00:12:20,It's sort of like if he was less sort of thespian-like
00:12:20,00:12:22,"and had so much integrity, he's Brian Blessed."
00:12:22,00:12:25,Like all these stories are just tall tales.
00:12:25,00:12:28,"Apparently on my left foot, he broke two ribs"
00:12:28,00:12:30,because he was hunching over so much
00:12:30,00:12:31,"while he was in the wheelchair,"
00:12:31,00:12:33,but they just snapped under the weight of his hunchback.
00:12:33,00:12:34,- I just don't think that breaks your ribs.
00:12:34,00:12:37,"- I hunch over my laptop all day, every day,"
00:12:37,00:12:38,and never have I broken a rib.
00:12:38,00:12:39,- You're not committing to the work
00:12:39,00:12:41,like Del Luis commits to his work.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"No offence, Anna, I'm sorry."
00:12:43,00:12:46,"- But he is a very, very successful actor,"
00:12:46,00:12:47,Daniel Del Luis.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"His Wikipedia, he doesn't have a separate Wikipedia page"
00:12:49,00:12:52,"listing his movies, 'cause he's done so few movies."
00:12:52,00:12:54,I think he's done less than 20 or around 20.
00:12:54,00:12:55,- Wow.
00:12:55,00:12:57,- But he does have a separate page listing all
00:12:57,00:12:58,of his awards.
00:12:58,00:13:01,- Just 'cause he's won so many.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- Yeah, he's done around 20 feature length films"
00:13:03,00:13:08,and he's had 212 major nominations and 139 wins.
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Wow.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"- And not one of them will have been for ""Stars and Bugs""."
00:13:10,00:13:11,I guarantee it.
00:13:11,00:13:14,- What I worked out is if each episode of our podcast
00:13:14,00:13:17,"was as successful as each of his films,"
00:13:17,00:13:19,"then we'd have more than 4,000 awards."
00:13:19,00:13:22,"And if they all weighed the same as an Oscar statuette,"
00:13:22,00:13:25,the total weight would be about the same as two elephants.
00:13:25,00:13:25,- Oh my God.
00:13:25,00:13:27,- So that puts it into perspective.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"- Yeah, it really does. - That's brilliant."
00:13:30,00:13:31,"- Tells you a lot about Daniel Del Luis, that."
00:13:31,00:13:32,- Yeah.
00:13:32,00:13:41,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is Andy."
00:13:41,00:13:45,My fact is that some French unions have special barbecues
00:13:45,00:13:49,that can be used to cook sausages while on a protest march.
00:13:49,00:13:50,- Brilliant.
00:13:50,00:13:51,They do like a strike in France.
00:13:51,00:13:54,- They love a strike and they love a saucy song.
00:13:54,00:13:58,And they found a way of combining the two.
00:13:58,00:14:01,And this does the rounds every now and again.
00:14:01,00:14:02,"But Snopes, the brilliant people at Snopes,"
00:14:02,00:14:03,looked into this picture.
00:14:03,00:14:04,You can find it online.
00:14:04,00:14:07,"There's French people, they're very clearly French union workers."
00:14:07,00:14:10,They're in their hives and they're pushing along
00:14:10,00:14:14,"this mobile barbecue, which is in tram tracks."
00:14:14,00:14:15,- Yeah. - Oh.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"- So they're going the tram route, I presume."
00:14:17,00:14:19,"Oh, they're French train workers who were on strike."
00:14:19,00:14:20,- It was in Nice.
00:14:20,00:14:21,- It was in Nice.
00:14:21,00:14:22,- Very annoying if it's French teachers on strike
00:14:22,00:14:25,and they're confined to the tram route for the whole process.
00:14:25,00:14:28,- It's 'cause they were doing some reform of the SNCF.
00:14:28,00:14:30,- There was some probably mild change
00:14:30,00:14:32,"suggested to working hours and I was like,"
00:14:32,00:14:37,"""Everybody out now, we leave Nice to Rock for a year."""
00:14:37,00:14:39,"- So it's really cool though, isn't it?"
00:14:39,00:14:40,There's actually video footage.
00:14:40,00:14:42,It's like one second of video footage
00:14:42,00:14:44,from what I saw where they're just pushing it down.
00:14:44,00:14:47,It's a massive grill going over the two tram tracks.
00:14:47,00:14:47,- It's very cool. - And they're pushing it along
00:14:47,00:14:49,"and they're, you know."
00:14:49,00:14:51,- So why do they put it on tram tracks
00:14:51,00:14:53,rather than just putting a barbecue on wheels?
00:14:53,00:14:54,- Good call.
00:14:54,00:14:55,Good point.
00:14:55,00:14:58,I suppose they were marching the route of the tracks.
00:14:58,00:15:00,"I mean, I suppose they were only walking the tram route"
00:15:00,00:15:03,to make a point about whatever beef they were having.
00:15:03,00:15:06,With their bosses.
00:15:06,00:15:08,- Maybe it makes the point more emphatically
00:15:08,00:15:10,"if they're like, ""We've even made a barbecue"
00:15:10,00:15:11,"""to make our point."""
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- I mean, we're talking about them now."
00:15:12,00:15:13,This was several years ago.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"- It's worked. - So, you know, it's worked."
00:15:15,00:15:17,- Their wagers will probably shoot up
00:15:17,00:15:19,now that we've discussed it.
00:15:19,00:15:21,- You're welcome.
00:15:21,00:15:21,- Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:23,I didn't actually know the knees had trams.
00:15:23,00:15:25,"I've been to knees, but clearly I wasn't paying attention."
00:15:25,00:15:26,"So, you know."
00:15:26,00:15:31,Is that an all new low in terms of my anecdotes?
00:15:31,00:15:35,"It's 'cause I cycled into knees, that's it."
00:15:35,00:15:36,Now we've hit the rock bottom.
00:15:36,00:15:38,"There we go, there we go."
00:15:38,00:15:43,"- You know, the barbecue I have is a Weber or Weber barbecue."
00:15:43,00:15:43,- Okay.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"- And that is a, it's like a circular one."
00:15:46,00:15:48,It's almost like a ball and some legs.
00:15:48,00:15:49,- I think of that as a classic.
00:15:49,00:15:51,- It's a classic garden barbecue.
00:15:51,00:15:53,"- It's like War of the Worlds, the tripods."
00:15:53,00:15:55,- It is. - Like this is all with a tripod.
00:15:55,00:15:57,- The terrifying aliens leap out of it
00:15:57,00:15:59,if you want to cook the meat.
00:15:59,00:16:00,- Sort of.
00:16:00,00:16:01,Will they climb into your body
00:16:01,00:16:02,and then they leap out several hours later?
00:16:02,00:16:03,- Yes.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"- Well, they were invented in 1952"
00:16:06,00:16:09,from two halves of a steel boy.
00:16:09,00:16:10,- A boy?
00:16:10,00:16:11,"- You know, a boy."
00:16:11,00:16:12,- A boy?
00:16:12,00:16:13,- A boy. - Ocean boy.
00:16:13,00:16:14,"- You know, those things that float to the ocean."
00:16:14,00:16:15,- Yeah.
00:16:15,00:16:17,"- Well, yeah, they decided they wanted"
00:16:17,00:16:18,to make a new kind of barbecue
00:16:18,00:16:21,"and they thought, wouldn't it be nice if it was circular?"
00:16:21,00:16:23,And what do we have that's circular in our iron works?
00:16:23,00:16:24,"Well, we have some boys."
00:16:24,00:16:25,- Boys. - Cool.
00:16:25,00:16:26,- That's brilliant.
00:16:26,00:16:29,- And the guy used it in his garden
00:16:29,00:16:31,and basically all his neighbors called it a spaceship
00:16:31,00:16:33,and laughed at him.
00:16:33,00:16:34,But it turned around.
00:16:34,00:16:35,- And it took off?
00:16:35,00:16:36,- It did.
00:16:36,00:16:40,- So was the previous barbecue not around like a bro?
00:16:40,00:16:43,"- No, because in America where the barbecuing started,"
00:16:43,00:16:45,that's not really what barbecuing is.
00:16:45,00:16:48,It's more like roasting meat for 24 hours
00:16:48,00:16:50,"until it's really, really, really soft."
00:16:50,00:16:52,Isn't it? - Right.
00:16:52,00:16:52,- That's low cut.
00:16:52,00:16:55,"- 'Cause in the, I should say to any Americans listening,"
00:16:55,00:16:57,"in the UK, a barbecue is you sit in the garden"
00:16:57,00:17:00,when it's raining and you put burgers on a grill.
00:17:00,00:17:01,- You go into the house and put them in the oven
00:17:01,00:17:03,if it's really raining yet.
00:17:03,00:17:05,"- As far as I'm concerned, a barbecue is a metal tray"
00:17:05,00:17:08,that you buy from Tesco Metro on a sunny day
00:17:08,00:17:09,and then take to the park.
00:17:09,00:17:10,- You cramp.
00:17:10,00:17:13,- You three bottles of white light in.
00:17:13,00:17:14,"- Yeah, delicious as well."
00:17:14,00:17:17,- I discovered that I spell barbecue differently to you three.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"- No, you spell it wrong,"
00:17:18,00:17:19,which is what I noticed is a document
00:17:19,00:17:21,where we put a tag or a search.
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- Are you spelling it with a Q, Dan?"
00:17:22,00:17:23,"- I'm spelling it with a Q,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,which is the Australian way of spelling it.
00:17:25,00:17:27,That's the actual way of spelling it in Australia.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"Yes, it is, and New Zealand as well."
00:17:28,00:17:30,"And also, ah."
00:17:30,00:17:31,- But you pronounce that barbec.
00:17:31,00:17:32,- Barbeque.
00:17:32,00:17:34,"- They pronounce it Barbie, as we know."
00:17:34,00:17:36,"- Oh, we have a Barbie, but yeah, barbecue."
00:17:36,00:17:37,"And in Sydney, there's a thing."
00:17:37,00:17:39,"- If it was, sorry, if it was meant,"
00:17:39,00:17:41,"if you were spelling it like it was pronounced,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,"but you wanted to include the Q,"
00:17:42,00:17:45,you'd have to end it Q-U-E-U-E.
00:17:45,00:17:47,That's how you do Q.
00:17:47,00:17:48,- Join the barbecue.
00:17:48,00:17:49,- Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:50,"Well, no, I'll bring that up."
00:17:50,00:17:52,And the next time I'm at the Australian Embassy
00:17:52,00:17:54,and they're asking me for my international opinions.
00:17:54,00:17:55,- They've constantly got a barbecue
00:17:55,00:17:56,on the go at the Aussie Embassy.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"- They do, exactly."
00:17:57,00:17:59,- But this relates to a really interesting
00:17:59,00:18:00,"etymology of barbecue,"
00:18:00,00:18:03,because there's a kind of mythic folk belief
00:18:03,00:18:06,that it comes from a French phrase
00:18:06,00:18:10,"from barbecue, which means from beer to tail."
00:18:10,00:18:12,You're eating the whole pig.
00:18:12,00:18:14,"Jokes on you, that pig is Daniel Day-Louis in disguise."
00:18:14,00:18:15,He was method acting.
00:18:15,00:18:16,You're in big trouble now.
00:18:16,00:18:17,You've cooked and eaten him.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- Was he in Babe?
00:18:18,00:18:19,- What was the movie?
00:18:19,00:18:21,(all laughing)
00:18:21,00:18:24,- 'Cause the word Q in English as in to stand in a line
00:18:24,00:18:26,comes from the French for tail as well.
00:18:26,00:18:27,"- Right, right."
00:18:27,00:18:28,- But you're saying this isn't correct.
00:18:28,00:18:29,- It's not from that.
00:18:29,00:18:30,"In fact, we very briefly mentioned years and years ago"
00:18:30,00:18:32,that it's from a guy called William Dampier
00:18:32,00:18:35,"who was a privateer, sailor, pirate, roaster."
00:18:35,00:18:38,"- The original Robinson Crusoe, I want to say."
00:18:38,00:18:42,- He was a buccaneer and a buccaneer is a pirate
00:18:42,00:18:43,who cooks meat.
00:18:43,00:18:45,It's basically the etymology of buccaneer
00:18:45,00:18:46,comes from that as well.
00:18:46,00:18:47,- Yes.
00:18:47,00:18:48,- It's all Caribbean languages basically.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"So there's a barbacao,"
00:18:50,00:18:53,which is from the various Caribbean peoples who got it.
00:18:53,00:18:56,"So it's from the Americas, the word in the first place, yeah."
00:18:56,00:18:58,- There's a fun phrase in Argentina
00:18:58,00:19:00,where barbecuing is huge and it's called asado
00:19:00,00:19:02,"in place like Argentina, Brazil,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,other parts of South America.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"And then you get asado al disco, do you know what that is?"
00:19:07,00:19:08,- A circular.
00:19:08,00:19:10,"- Revolving, yeah, rotating."
00:19:10,00:19:13,"- Oh, the disco gets so hot that you feel like you're cooking."
00:19:13,00:19:15,So they're a ball full of meat.
00:19:15,00:19:16,- Thank you.
00:19:16,00:19:17,I was looking for some disco stuff
00:19:17,00:19:18,"and then I could say no,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,"it's about the first things that you guys said,"
00:19:20,00:19:23,but a disco is the disc from a plow.
00:19:23,00:19:25,So a plow has like very sharp discs
00:19:25,00:19:27,that it cuts the crops with.
00:19:27,00:19:30,"And once they've worn out, then in Argentina,"
00:19:30,00:19:31,you take that off the plow and you cook on it.
00:19:31,00:19:35,"And it's basically like a wok, a giant wok."
00:19:35,00:19:36,And that's Apollo al disco
00:19:36,00:19:38,is using the disc from a plow to barbecue.
00:19:38,00:19:41,"- Yeah, a barbecuing is very common around the world."
00:19:41,00:19:43,And one thing that's quite interesting
00:19:43,00:19:46,is it's very common for men to do the barbecuing
00:19:46,00:19:48,almost everywhere that you go.
00:19:48,00:19:50,So like we think of it in the UK at least
00:19:50,00:19:52,"and probably in America as like,"
00:19:52,00:19:54,the dads go and do the barbecuing
00:19:54,00:19:56,while everyone else does something else.
00:19:56,00:19:56,- That's right.
00:19:56,00:19:59,"And the men obsess over it and they talk,"
00:19:59,00:20:01,"Lou, what charcoal are you cooking with these days?"
00:20:01,00:20:02,You know that kind of stuff.
00:20:02,00:20:04,"- But yeah, Levi Strauss, the anthropologist,"
00:20:04,00:20:07,"he says that yeah, basically if you look all over the world"
00:20:07,00:20:09,"from Amazonian tribes, people in Africa,"
00:20:09,00:20:12,it's often the men's work for the barbecuing.
00:20:12,00:20:15,There was a book called the complete barbecue book
00:20:15,00:20:18,"by John and Marie Robertson who put it,"
00:20:18,00:20:20,they said that the man who does the barbecuing
00:20:20,00:20:23,takes on a somewhat god-like stature.
00:20:23,00:20:27,"As for the ladies, well, they're virtually your slaves."
00:20:27,00:20:29,"I feel like John wrote that bit, not Marie, probably."
00:20:29,00:20:31,- Who is it?
00:20:31,00:20:34,- Anthropologist of food rides called Calvin Trillin
00:20:34,00:20:36,"records that if you want to be a good barbecueist,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,you have to be basically a mishandthrope
00:20:38,00:20:41,because you're going in the garden on your own.
00:20:41,00:20:43,You're not really talking to anyone else.
00:20:43,00:20:45,"Your friend is the meat, as opposed to the--"
00:20:45,00:20:46,"- Oh God, it's such a lovely chance"
00:20:46,00:20:48,not to have to fulfill your social obligations
00:20:48,00:20:50,and just stand there feeling used to it.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"- I would say in Australia,"
00:20:51,00:20:53,"I don't know what it's like here properly,"
00:20:53,00:20:55,but it's the water cooler.
00:20:55,00:20:57,It's everywhere when it hangs around the barbecue.
00:20:57,00:20:58,- What are you driving these days?
00:20:58,00:20:59,"Yeah, that kind of thing."
00:20:59,00:21:01,"- Exactly that kind of thing, yeah."
00:21:01,00:21:03,- But then this guy says that actually it's quite good
00:21:03,00:21:07,"as a hobby because golf and sailing and fishing,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,these are also things where men sort of like to go
00:21:09,00:21:10,just a couple of men on their own
00:21:10,00:21:12,"and not see anyone else misanthropically,"
00:21:12,00:21:13,"but at least in this case,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,everyone gets some food out of it at the end.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"- That's true, I'm not guaranteed with fishing."
00:21:16,00:21:20,I'm very rare with golf unless you really hit something.
00:21:20,00:21:22,"- Yeah, I think misanthropically,"
00:21:22,00:21:24,"for activities like fishing,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,"which is so dominated by men,"
00:21:25,00:21:27,"we need to replace the word misanthrope,"
00:21:27,00:21:30,"which has a kind of coolness to it with unhelpful,"
00:21:30,00:21:31,because that's all it is.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"That's just men pissing off and not helping out, isn't it?"
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- So when my wife says to me,"
00:21:34,00:21:36,"""Why have you not taken the bins out?"""
00:21:36,00:21:38,"I could just say, ""Oh, it's been misanthropic."""
00:21:38,00:21:40,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:21:40,00:21:41,"The male thing is interesting though,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,"and going back to French barbecues,"
00:21:42,00:21:45,a green politician in France got in trouble in 2022
00:21:45,00:21:48,"'cause they were saying obviously meat,"
00:21:48,00:21:49,"very bad for the environment,"
00:21:49,00:21:53,20% of our greenhouse gases still come from the meat industry.
00:21:53,00:21:55,"And she was saying,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"""We have to change our mentality"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"""so that eating a barbecued Andracot"
00:21:58,00:22:01,"""is no longer a symbol of virility."""
00:22:01,00:22:02,"And basically people said,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,"""You're blaming men for killing the planet."""
00:22:04,00:22:06,- I don't think I've ever heard someone say the word
00:22:06,00:22:09,"""Andracot"" and think that is a virile person."
00:22:09,00:22:12,- France is a very different place to Bolton James.
00:22:12,00:22:15,The interesting male thing about barbecuing a meat
00:22:15,00:22:17,"is that men just do eat more meat,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,"and actually we don't know why,"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"but around the world, in almost every country--"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"- It must be cultural, it can't be biological."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"- Well, a lot of people think it's biological,"
00:22:25,00:22:28,so there are arguments that female hormones suppress
00:22:28,00:22:29,"the desire to eat meat around your period,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"or when you're pregnant, which sounds very implausible to me."
00:22:32,00:22:33,There's another argument that says
00:22:33,00:22:35,men behave in more risky ways.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"So evolutionarily, they need to eat more protein"
00:22:38,00:22:40,"to make their bones stronger, more meat."
00:22:40,00:22:42,"- But also cooking a sausage for three minutes a day,"
00:22:42,00:22:44,"I was probably fine, that is a risky behavior."
00:22:44,00:22:45,(laughing)
00:22:45,00:22:46,"- But it's really interesting,"
00:22:46,00:22:49,"and also there was a study looking at 23 countries,"
00:22:49,00:22:52,"and the wealthier and more gender equality we have,"
00:22:52,00:22:54,"what would you think, as you get more gender equality,"
00:22:54,00:22:56,"which tends to happen in more developed countries,"
00:22:56,00:22:58,does the gap between men and women's meat
00:22:58,00:23:00,seem to get bigger or smaller?
00:23:00,00:23:01,"- Well, you think it would get smaller."
00:23:01,00:23:03,- You think it would get smaller and it gets bigger?
00:23:03,00:23:05,"- It doesn't, 'cause men are trying to cling"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"to something to show their blokes, is that it?"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"- We don't know, but I like that's a nice interpretation."
00:23:09,00:23:12,- Have you heard of transglutaminase?
00:23:12,00:23:15,"I'd be really surprised if you had, no."
00:23:15,00:23:16,- Some kind of molecule.
00:23:16,00:23:19,"- It's a molecule, all right, it's an enzyme,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and it's a thing that gets called meat glue.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"- Oh, that's not the answer."
00:23:23,00:23:26,"- And if you buy a big piece of steak, you may notice,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"it might be skewered, and if it's skewered,"
00:23:28,00:23:29,there's a good chance.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"This is in America, this stuff is not legal in the EU,"
00:23:31,00:23:36,"that it's been had meat glue sort of painted on it,"
00:23:36,00:23:39,"and if you paint meat glue on it and squish it all together,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,"you can make a big, expensive looking steak"
00:23:40,00:23:42,out of several pieces of small scrap meat.
00:23:42,00:23:43,"- Oh, cool."
00:23:43,00:23:45,"- And that's how it's not cool, it's really horrible."
00:23:45,00:23:46,"- No, but it's cool that you could bring"
00:23:46,00:23:48,"a dino burger basically, right?"
00:23:48,00:23:49,"- Yeah, it's like the Power Rangers,"
00:23:49,00:23:50,they combine their forces.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:23:51,00:23:54,- If you're listening to this after the Trump tariffs
00:23:54,00:23:56,"have forced us to do a trade deal with America,"
00:23:56,00:23:58,then you two could be eating one right now.
00:23:58,00:24:00,- We'll eat these days.
00:24:00,00:24:04,"- Yeah, I was looking at sort of out-of-place barbecues,"
00:24:04,00:24:05,"like the one on the tram line,"
00:24:05,00:24:07,"and there was a really cool thing I found,"
00:24:07,00:24:08,which is there used to be a tour
00:24:08,00:24:10,called the Vans Warp Tour.
00:24:10,00:24:13,"It's basically a festival that you would have like 20 bands,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,and they would go from city to city together.
00:24:15,00:24:17,So not like class and regis or what.
00:24:17,00:24:20,"Yeah, and they came to Australia in 1998,"
00:24:20,00:24:21,and I remember it being a big deal.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"So they had big bands,"
00:24:23,00:24:26,"you'd get people like Blink 182 and No Effects and stuff,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,but then they would also give opportunities
00:24:28,00:24:29,to younger newer bands.
00:24:29,00:24:32,And one of the conditions of being on the Warp Tour
00:24:32,00:24:33,was you could be the barbecue band.
00:24:33,00:24:36,"You get a slot on stage, but when it's done,"
00:24:36,00:24:39,"you go backstage and you're in charge of the barbecue,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,and you cook for everyone.
00:24:40,00:24:41,"And so that's the condition,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,the trade-off of you being on the tour.
00:24:43,00:24:45,"- Don't we know any bands that went on to be massive,"
00:24:45,00:24:46,having begun as barbecues?
00:24:46,00:24:50,"- Yeah, the Dropkick Murphy's, Art of Shock,"
00:24:50,00:24:54,"Gorilla's, Gorilla's, Gorilla's."
00:24:54,00:24:55,"- Yes. - Yeah, yeah."
00:24:55,00:24:57,- Yeah.
00:24:57,00:24:57,- Was he in it?
00:24:57,00:24:58,(laughing)
00:24:58,00:24:59,- I was in it.
00:24:59,00:25:02,"- I think Gorilla's is what belongs, isn't it?"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"- Oh, you mean, I think. - Damon Aldon, you mean."
00:25:03,00:25:04,"- Yeah, Damon Aldon."
00:25:04,00:25:05,"- Yeah, well, it's a good one."
00:25:05,00:25:06,"- Damon Aldon, I mean, he belongs on a farm anyway."
00:25:06,00:25:09,(laughing)
00:25:09,00:25:11,"So you know, there are these rubs."
00:25:11,00:25:12,"- Yeah, meat rub. - It's a big thing."
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Meat rub. - Meat rub.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- Yeah.
00:25:14,00:25:16,- So it's basically a load of spices
00:25:16,00:25:19,that you rub over your meat to marinate it.
00:25:19,00:25:20,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:25:20,00:25:21,"And there's a shop named Me,"
00:25:21,00:25:22,which stocks something by what's called
00:25:22,00:25:24,the Gentleman's Rub Club.
00:25:24,00:25:25,"And I have tried to,"
00:25:25,00:25:29,and I've tried to find any evidence that it existed online
00:25:29,00:25:30,'cause I remembered it running up to this podcast
00:25:30,00:25:31,and they're nowhere.
00:25:31,00:25:34,"- The thing is, it's a bit like Butchers in the 1980s."
00:25:34,00:25:37,You don't necessarily have to have a massive online presence
00:25:37,00:25:39,if you're a rub club.
00:25:39,00:25:41,- But the fairly the first rule of Gentleman's Rub Club.
00:25:41,00:25:44,(laughing)
00:25:44,00:25:46,"But this just got me off onto like,"
00:25:46,00:25:49,"so it got me off onto, got me onto grilling awards,"
00:25:49,00:25:51,barbecue awards.
00:25:51,00:25:54,"So I was looking at the NBBQA,"
00:25:54,00:25:56,"National Barbecue and Grilling Association,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,'cause they have an awards of excellence every year.
00:25:58,00:26:01,I think it's an American thing.
00:26:01,00:26:03,"So they've got beef rub, pork rub, poultry rub,"
00:26:03,00:26:04,"seafood rub, spicy rub."
00:26:04,00:26:07,"And I just, I wanted to read a few of the prizes"
00:26:07,00:26:09,from the latest awards.
00:26:09,00:26:09,They're terrific.
00:26:09,00:26:13,Barbecue apparel category.
00:26:13,00:26:16,"First prize, a t-shirt reading, wanna see my rack."
00:26:16,00:26:20,- First prize. - First prize.
00:26:20,00:26:21,- Third prize.
00:26:21,00:26:23,"- Well, they try and encourage women to get into it, aren't they?"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"- Second prize, wanna see my sausage."
00:26:25,00:26:27,(laughing)
00:26:27,00:26:30,"- Third prize, t-shirt reading, I got sourced."
00:26:30,00:26:33,"Fourth hat reading, my dad's barbecue."
00:26:33,00:26:35,But there's a barbecue book of the year.
00:26:35,00:26:35,- Oh yeah.
00:26:35,00:26:37,"- A barbecue, badass backyard cooking."
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- Oh, dear."
00:26:38,00:26:39,"- Oh, cool."
00:26:39,00:26:42,- There's even an award for best barbecue audio series.
00:26:42,00:26:43,There's barbecue podcasts.
00:26:43,00:26:45,Could we put this section up for it?
00:26:45,00:26:46,- I think so.
00:26:46,00:26:49,If we wanna dethrone the smoking hot confessions
00:26:49,00:26:50,of the BBQ podcast.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"- Well, I definitely wanna check out my rack t-shirt"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"or whatever it is, so let's do it."
00:26:54,00:26:55,(laughing)
00:26:55,00:26:57,"They're massive, the barbecue contest in America."
00:26:57,00:27:00,They're all run by the Kansas City Barbecue Society
00:27:00,00:27:04,"and it's trained over 15,000 judges to judge barbecues"
00:27:04,00:27:06,and the rules are very tight.
00:27:06,00:27:09,"So, judges are not allowed to eat with utensils,"
00:27:09,00:27:11,but you're also not allowed to lick your fingers.
00:27:11,00:27:12,Why?
00:27:12,00:27:13,No one knows.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"You just have fingers covered in like,"
00:27:15,00:27:16,- I do? - Barbecue meat the whole time.
00:27:16,00:27:18,- How can you eat some ribs
00:27:18,00:27:19,without licking your fingers?
00:27:19,00:27:20,That's unnatural.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- Well, I think it's not a challenge."
00:27:21,00:27:22,- Maybe you have wipes.
00:27:22,00:27:23,- Gloves?
00:27:23,00:27:23,- Yes.
00:27:23,00:27:24,- I don't even like gloves.
00:27:24,00:27:25,- They've got the glove culture they want.
00:27:25,00:27:27,(laughing)
00:27:27,00:27:28,- Like a snooker referee.
00:27:28,00:27:31,"- I need another 20,000 pounds of linen gloves please, yeah."
00:27:31,00:27:34,"- The scores are on a scale of one to nine,"
00:27:34,00:27:35,"but there's no three and four, weirdly."
00:27:35,00:27:37,(laughing)
00:27:37,00:27:38,- Come on.
00:27:38,00:27:39,- Five.
00:27:39,00:27:41,"- What, one, two, five, six, seven and nine."
00:27:41,00:27:42,- That's so funny.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- Yeah, five is poor and then two is inedible."
00:27:44,00:27:45,Nothing in between.
00:27:45,00:27:47,- That's very funny.
00:27:47,00:27:48,- There are various rules.
00:27:48,00:27:51,"To judge a brisket as in a big chest of a cow,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,you have to be able to manipulate it like an accordion.
00:27:54,00:27:55,- Wow.
00:27:55,00:27:56,- Oh.
00:27:56,00:27:56,- Yeah.
00:27:56,00:27:57,"- Wow, what a sentence, horrible."
00:27:57,00:27:59,"- I think it's all, I think it's useful."
00:27:59,00:27:59,"- I'm surprised, yeah."
00:27:59,00:28:00,- Are you?
00:28:00,00:28:02,"- Because, well, I could play the accordion, right?"
00:28:02,00:28:04,"And so you have to move it quite a lot, right?"
00:28:04,00:28:06,"And to move a rib cage,"
00:28:06,00:28:08,I don't feel like that would be possible.
00:28:08,00:28:09,- Yeah.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Maybe the rib cage.
00:28:10,00:28:12,- That's a terrible cheer.
00:28:12,00:28:14,"But if a couple of the rooms have already been broken,"
00:28:14,00:28:15,let's hope because Daniel Day Lewis
00:28:15,00:28:17,has been living as the cow.
00:28:17,00:28:18,(laughing)
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- Tank, I'll ask you a question."
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Australia.
00:28:21,00:28:22,- Yeah.
00:28:22,00:28:22,- You're from there.
00:28:22,00:28:23,- Yes.
00:28:23,00:28:26,- Have you ever seen a coin operated barbecue in the past?
00:28:26,00:28:28,- I was gonna mention this before I was cut off
00:28:28,00:28:30,"for my terrible spelling, which was not terrible."
00:28:30,00:28:34,"In Sydney, we actually have not even coin operated."
00:28:34,00:28:36,You have free barbecues on most of the beaches
00:28:36,00:28:37,that you go to.
00:28:37,00:28:39,So we would go down to Clairville on the weekend.
00:28:39,00:28:42,You would just press a button and it gets going.
00:28:42,00:28:44,And your only thing is to just clean it up.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"- Wait, is it like gas,"
00:28:45,00:28:46,or do you have to bring your own charcoal?
00:28:46,00:28:48,"- Oh, no, no, yeah, just goes up."
00:28:48,00:28:50,- Isn't it unhygienic?
00:28:50,00:28:51,"- No, you clean."
00:28:51,00:28:52,So there's a raw sausages on there.
00:28:52,00:28:54,- I kind of think the thing with barbecue
00:28:54,00:28:56,"is it doesn't matter if you drop it in the mud,"
00:28:56,00:28:59,"'cause you're cooking it on such a massive, massive heat."
00:28:59,00:29:01,- It's a thousand degrees.
00:29:01,00:29:02,What's surviving on that?
00:29:02,00:29:04,"- There's a real pride thing, by the way,"
00:29:04,00:29:06,of you leave it ready for the next person.
00:29:06,00:29:09,"Yeah, it's a thing that is sort of just part of the way."
00:29:09,00:29:10,"- I see, I see, that's national culture."
00:29:10,00:29:14,"Well, supposedly even some zoos have free barbecues,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,which I feel is open to misuse.
00:29:16,00:29:17,"- What, do you think that's a bit scary"
00:29:17,00:29:19,for the animals just sitting around?
00:29:19,00:29:20,- Have you seen the wombat?
00:29:20,00:29:21,Where's the wombat?
00:29:21,00:29:22,(laughing)
00:29:22,00:29:24,(upbeat music)
00:29:24,00:29:29,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:29,00:29:31,and that is Anna.
00:29:31,00:29:33,- My fact this week is that epileptic fits
00:29:33,00:29:37,can be triggered by thinking about toothpaste.
00:29:37,00:29:38,- That's wild.
00:29:38,00:29:41,"- Yeah, not widespread, don't worry."
00:29:41,00:29:43,- Do you have to have a specific condition
00:29:43,00:29:44,already for this to happen?
00:29:44,00:29:46,"Epilepsy, I'm assuming."
00:29:46,00:29:48,(laughing)
00:29:48,00:29:50,"- It is more common epileptics, yes."
00:29:50,00:29:54,"But you ask all the right questions, Andy."
00:29:54,00:29:56,That's why we love to have you in the class.
00:29:56,00:30:00,"This, I just came across this paper from 2006,"
00:30:00,00:30:02,which reported on a patient with epilepsy.
00:30:02,00:30:08,"Came across a paper from 2006,"
00:30:08,00:30:10,which reported on a patient with epilepsy
00:30:10,00:30:12,in which seizures were induced
00:30:12,00:30:14,both by tooth brushing and by seeing
00:30:14,00:30:17,or thinking about toothbrush and toothpaste.
00:30:17,00:30:18,- That's amazing.
00:30:18,00:30:19,- It's extraordinary.
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Is that someone who is stressed
00:30:20,00:30:22,about the idea of brushing their teeth
00:30:22,00:30:24,and then the stress brings on it?
00:30:24,00:30:25,"Like, what is bringing it on?"
00:30:25,00:30:26,"- I don't, well, it's very mysterious,"
00:30:26,00:30:28,and I don't think it's quite that.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"It's a type of reflex epilepsy,"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"which is epilepsy that's triggered by something,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,"and this type is called thinking epilepsy,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,"and it's where thinking about something,"
00:30:37,00:30:38,and I don't think it's necessarily something
00:30:38,00:30:39,"that causes you stress,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,"but thinking about a certain thing triggers it,"
00:30:41,00:30:44,so there was other cases reported on
00:30:44,00:30:47,"where someone, when they thought about food,"
00:30:47,00:30:48,"whenever they thought about food,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,which is quite debilitating.
00:30:50,00:30:53,"- I read about one who, every time they tried to do Sudoku,"
00:30:53,00:30:55,they got an epileptic fit.
00:30:55,00:30:58,"- This seems to be a thing, puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku."
00:30:58,00:31:00,"- Oh yeah, I hate a Sudoku."
00:31:00,00:31:01,"- Yeah, but it's not about hating it."
00:31:01,00:31:03,"I don't know, do you have the lying epilepsy?"
00:31:03,00:31:06,- I'm starting to feel like I might.
00:31:06,00:31:08,- But is it because there's a particular location
00:31:08,00:31:10,in your brain where the neurons for toothpaste
00:31:10,00:31:12,"or Sudoku or whatever, or food are kept,"
00:31:12,00:31:13,and there's a crossed wire in there?
00:31:13,00:31:15,"That seems logical, doesn't it?"
00:31:15,00:31:17,But I don't think anyone really knows.
00:31:17,00:31:21,"- No, no, and it is rare, but it is amazing,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,and some people can think themselves into an epileptic fit.
00:31:24,00:31:26,"It just sounds like the most awful thing,"
00:31:26,00:31:27,'cause what is the only thing you can do
00:31:27,00:31:29,"when you're told not to think about something,"
00:31:29,00:31:30,obviously is think about something.
00:31:30,00:31:33,"If you know that you can't think about this,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,"there was a guy who was taken to hospital,"
00:31:35,00:31:38,"and he had a brain lesion, I think,"
00:31:38,00:31:40,"and he had an epileptic fit,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,"and the only way you could characterize it was,"
00:31:42,00:31:45,"if he started to feel enthusiastic,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,he would then have a fit.
00:31:47,00:31:48,"- Oh, interesting."
00:31:48,00:31:48,- Can I wonder if you have that?
00:31:48,00:31:50,I know we probably never know.
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Me.
00:31:51,00:31:53,(all laughing)
00:31:53,00:31:55,"That's why, actually, I play it safe."
00:31:55,00:31:58,"- So it could be anything, you just got to identify it."
00:31:58,00:31:59,- So he's not allowed a hobby?
00:31:59,00:32:02,"- He's not allowed a hobby that he likes, no."
00:32:02,00:32:04,"He can do Sudoku to his ask and death, actually,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,"but they actually made him induce one,"
00:32:06,00:32:07,which does feel quite mean.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"They were like, ""Could you try and replicate the feeling"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"""when you have one so we can have a look?"""
00:32:12,00:32:14,"So he was like, ""Okay, I'll make myself feel enthusiastic."
00:32:14,00:32:15,"""You ready?"" - Wow."
00:32:15,00:32:16,- Toothpaste?
00:32:16,00:32:17,"- Yes, please."
00:32:17,00:32:20,How do the stripes get in?
00:32:20,00:32:21,(all laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:22,"- Oh my God, the ultimate question."
00:32:22,00:32:24,- Why don't I know?
00:32:24,00:32:26,- I believe there's a couple of different ways of doing it.
00:32:26,00:32:27,"- Yeah, they got a couple of them."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"- But my understanding is that the main one,"
00:32:29,00:32:32,there's a little thing near the nozzle or something.
00:32:32,00:32:33,"- Oh, it's a paintbrush."
00:32:33,00:32:35,"- It's disappointingly technical, the explanation,"
00:32:35,00:32:36,but knowing that it's not like--
00:32:36,00:32:38,- Is it not through the back door?
00:32:38,00:32:39,- What do you mean through the back door?
00:32:39,00:32:41,There's one rope of toothpaste that goes into the tube.
00:32:41,00:32:42,"- You've got the nozzle at the top,"
00:32:42,00:32:43,and then you've got the bottom.
00:32:43,00:32:46,"Maybe that's not closed up when the stuff's put in,"
00:32:46,00:32:46,and then you seal it up.
00:32:46,00:32:48,- What you're saying is that one long string
00:32:48,00:32:49,"of toothpaste is put in,"
00:32:49,00:32:50,and it comes out in the same order
00:32:50,00:32:51,that it went in the other end.
00:32:51,00:32:53,"- No, I'm picturing it a bit like Mr. Whippy."
00:32:53,00:32:55,- What if you get it wrong and squeeze it the wrong way?
00:32:55,00:32:56,"- How does it work the opposite way round, though?"
00:32:56,00:32:57,'Cause it would mush inside.
00:32:57,00:33:01,"- It's white on the inside, up to near the nozzle end,"
00:33:01,00:33:03,"and then the color, or colors,"
00:33:03,00:33:06,"this is one way of doing it, the colors are up at that end,"
00:33:06,00:33:07,and it's a very thin pipe.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"So as you squeeze from the back end,"
00:33:10,00:33:13,"the white goes up through the nozzle,"
00:33:13,00:33:14,but the color bit is also pressed out
00:33:14,00:33:16,"through the holes in the sides,"
00:33:16,00:33:18,and joins the main white bit.
00:33:18,00:33:18,- Cool.
00:33:18,00:33:19,"- And the main bit is white,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,and the other colors then are the garnish.
00:33:21,00:33:22,- That's fantastic.
00:33:22,00:33:23,- I love it.
00:33:23,00:33:24,I never knew that.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"- So if you don't like the colors,"
00:33:26,00:33:28,"if you get a bit perturbed when you spit it out,"
00:33:28,00:33:29,"and it looks like your mouth is bleeding,"
00:33:29,00:33:31,"you can cut your toothpaste tube in half,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,"and then just use the bottom of it, and it's just white."
00:33:33,00:33:34,- That's what I do.
00:33:34,00:33:37,"Think of someone who could have had a tube of toothpaste,"
00:33:37,00:33:39,"right, a famous person in history."
00:33:39,00:33:41,- Margaret Thatcher.
00:33:41,00:33:43,"- She could, yes, even more impressively,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,even further back on that.
00:33:44,00:33:47,- Jim Callaghan.
00:33:47,00:33:48,- Julius Caesar.
00:33:48,00:33:50,"- Yes, Jim Callaghan, no, do this."
00:33:50,00:33:52,(laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:53,- Wilson.
00:33:53,00:33:54,"- Harold Wilson, yep."
00:33:54,00:33:55,You're just doing PMs.
00:33:55,00:33:57,"- Yeah, just going backwards."
00:33:57,00:33:59,"- I think even before Balfour,"
00:33:59,00:34:00,"she could have had it, yeah."
00:34:00,00:34:03,- I don't know if designing quiz formats is for you.
00:34:03,00:34:04,- Lord Salisbury.
00:34:04,00:34:05,"- Oh, God."
00:34:05,00:34:06,- No.
00:34:06,00:34:11,- Was it between Disraeli's first term
00:34:11,00:34:13,and Disraeli's second term?
00:34:13,00:34:18,"- No, it's after all of Disraelian Gladstone."
00:34:18,00:34:20,"Campbell Bannerman probably could have had, who?"
00:34:20,00:34:21,- Wow.
00:34:21,00:34:23,- He was a turn of the 20th century Prime Minister.
00:34:23,00:34:24,- Atlee.
00:34:24,00:34:27,"- Yeah, we must say that atlee could have done, James."
00:34:27,00:34:28,You're not catching up.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"You're not playing the game at all well,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"which is surprising to me, 'cause it's such a good game."
00:34:32,00:34:34,(laughing)
00:34:34,00:34:35,- What's your point toothpaste
00:34:35,00:34:36,that was invented 100 years ago?
00:34:36,00:34:38,"- How young, Joan Rivers?"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"- Let's trust him, yeah, all of these people."
00:34:42,00:34:47,"So what I'm trying to say is that the squeezy toothpaste tube,"
00:34:47,00:34:49,"the collapsible toothpaste tube,"
00:34:49,00:34:51,"was invented in roughly the 1880s, '90s."
00:34:51,00:34:54,"So Queen Victoria could have had a tube of toothpaste,"
00:34:54,00:34:55,"which just makes you think, doesn't it?"
00:34:55,00:34:57,- What does it make me think?
00:34:57,00:34:58,"- Well, it's just the tube of toothpaste"
00:34:58,00:35:00,"is older than we might think it is, you know?"
00:35:00,00:35:03,James thought Clement Atlee was the earliest
00:35:03,00:35:04,Prime Minister who could have had one.
00:35:04,00:35:08,"But actually, 1880, a dentist from Connecticut,"
00:35:08,00:35:11,"confusingly he was called Sheffield, launched it."
00:35:11,00:35:12,"And then it was launched in York,"
00:35:12,00:35:14,confusingly the place in 1896.
00:35:14,00:35:16,So other people who could have enjoyed it
00:35:16,00:35:19,"include Adolf Sachs, Friedrich Engels,"
00:35:19,00:35:22,William Morris and Rutherford B. Hayes.
00:35:22,00:35:24,- Goni women there who cleaned the teeth in there.
00:35:24,00:35:26,"- Queen Victoria, I think was the opener."
00:35:26,00:35:26,- I stopped him.
00:35:26,00:35:30,"- Queen Victoria, Queen Victoria, great."
00:35:30,00:35:34,"Here's a worrying thing for toothpaste, possibly."
00:35:34,00:35:37,Do you know that sails have dropped by a lot?
00:35:37,00:35:40,Some say almost half since the late '90s.
00:35:40,00:35:41,- What?
00:35:41,00:35:43,"- Yeah, now riddle me this."
00:35:43,00:35:46,- Is it that people used to have much bigger toothbrushes?
00:35:46,00:35:48,"- You got in one, electric toothbrushes."
00:35:48,00:35:49,"- Oh, wow!"
00:35:49,00:35:52,- Electric toothbrushes have such a small little surface area
00:35:52,00:35:55,if you put it on that you're not squeezing as much.
00:35:55,00:35:58,And also the rise of the two for one
00:35:58,00:35:59,or three for two promotion
00:35:59,00:36:02,has absolutely knocked out sails for them as well.
00:36:02,00:36:03,But it's literally that we're using it
00:36:03,00:36:05,almost half the amount that we usually would.
00:36:05,00:36:07,"- I'm so surprised, 'cause I don't think a high proportion"
00:36:07,00:36:09,of people use electric toothbrushes.
00:36:09,00:36:10,I'm surprised that it's half.
00:36:10,00:36:11,Do you guys?
00:36:11,00:36:12,"- Well, so the promotions as well, the promotions."
00:36:12,00:36:15,"- I don't, but I tend to just cover my whole flannel"
00:36:15,00:36:17,with toothpaste and rub that round my mouth.
00:36:17,00:36:18,"- Well, do you know--"
00:36:18,00:36:19,- So I'm probably keeping the industry going.
00:36:19,00:36:21,- That would work.
00:36:21,00:36:24,"And this is his, you don't need to put it"
00:36:24,00:36:26,on a brush or anything.
00:36:26,00:36:27,And this is something that will really send
00:36:27,00:36:29,toothpaste sales plummeting.
00:36:29,00:36:30,"If they were worried before about this drop,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,it's totally pointless.
00:36:32,00:36:34,"- What's happened to your teeth, Adam?"
00:36:34,00:36:35,- Toothbrush.
00:36:35,00:36:36,- Toothpaste.
00:36:36,00:36:37,- What?
00:36:37,00:36:38,"- So, study after study."
00:36:38,00:36:40,"If you're looking at removing plaque,"
00:36:40,00:36:44,"study after study, like dozens and dozens of studies,"
00:36:44,00:36:45,"very, very reliable, broad studies,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,look at the difference between toothbrushing
00:36:47,00:36:50,"without any toothpaste and toothbrushing with toothpaste,"
00:36:50,00:36:52,and there is absolutely no difference.
00:36:52,00:36:54,- Your teeth are gonna be stronger if you use fluoride.
00:36:54,00:36:57,"- So the only thing is, the fluoride in toothpaste"
00:36:57,00:37:00,"is in the long term, good for your teeth,"
00:37:00,00:37:02,only if you do the thing that I've always known
00:37:02,00:37:04,"you should do, but can't bring myself to do,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,which is not rinse at the end.
00:37:06,00:37:08,Do you guys all not rinse?
00:37:08,00:37:09,"- I do now, having learned this,"
00:37:09,00:37:12,'cause we talked about this from QI coming up.
00:37:12,00:37:13,"- Oh, did we?"
00:37:13,00:37:14,"But yeah, it is quite interesting,"
00:37:14,00:37:16,"'cause I think, and there are so many ingredients,"
00:37:16,00:37:17,but it is literally the only thing
00:37:17,00:37:19,"is fluoride that does anything,"
00:37:19,00:37:21,unless except like breath-smelling of mint.
00:37:21,00:37:23,"'Cause you get a fluoride-free toothpaste,"
00:37:23,00:37:25,"which I do have friends who use,"
00:37:25,00:37:28,"and I'm not judging them, 'cause they're my friends."
00:37:28,00:37:30,"- Yeah, but you can't invite them to the barbecue"
00:37:30,00:37:32,'cause they can't get through the meat.
00:37:32,00:37:33,- How is RFK?
00:37:33,00:37:34,Is he all right?
00:37:34,00:37:38,"It's so interesting how we got fluoride in toothpaste,"
00:37:38,00:37:40,and in fact in water.
00:37:40,00:37:42,"In 1901, there was a young dentist called Frederick Mackay,"
00:37:42,00:37:44,"and he moved to Colorado Springs in America,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"and he found that people there had a thing called,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,have you heard of Colorado brown stain?
00:37:51,00:37:54,"- Well, I wouldn't buy that toothpaste, Brad."
00:37:54,00:37:56,"- Isn't that one of the spots, team,"
00:37:56,00:37:57,the Colorado brown stains?
00:37:57,00:37:58,"- Yes, that's right."
00:37:58,00:38:01,"- Go brown stains, yeah, yeah."
00:38:01,00:38:04,"This is insane, 90% of children had it."
00:38:04,00:38:05,Almost no one in the rest of America
00:38:05,00:38:08,"had Colorado brown stain, or any kind of brown stain."
00:38:08,00:38:09,The water was tested.
00:38:09,00:38:12,"Turns out the water was very high on fluoride, right?"
00:38:12,00:38:14,Particular towns of particular water sources
00:38:14,00:38:17,"had awful brown stain, but the good thing was,"
00:38:17,00:38:19,"they did some experiments, Mackay and Et El,"
00:38:19,00:38:23,and they found that basically this water-borne fluoride
00:38:23,00:38:24,"changed the color of your tooth enamel,"
00:38:24,00:38:27,but it also made this mottled tooth enamel
00:38:27,00:38:29,that people have was very resistant to decay.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"And so they started thinking, okay, we pop a little bit,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,"these kids have rock hard teeth, basically."
00:38:33,00:38:35,"And they thought, if we put the right amount"
00:38:35,00:38:38,"of fluoride in the water, you won't get discolored teeth,"
00:38:38,00:38:40,but you will get strong teeth.
00:38:40,00:38:42,"And the year after the first place,"
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Grand Rapids in Michigan got fluoride,"
00:38:44,00:38:46,the number of cavities dropped 60%.
00:38:46,00:38:48,It's one of the most effective
00:38:48,00:38:49,health interventions ever made.
00:38:49,00:38:50,"It's like that thing in Switzerland,"
00:38:50,00:38:51,"where everyone had goiters on their neck,"
00:38:51,00:38:54,"and then they started putting iodine in the salt,"
00:38:54,00:38:55,just overnight changed it.
00:38:55,00:38:58,"- Well, and bizarrely, we don't do it everywhere in Britain,"
00:38:58,00:38:59,which I actually didn't realize until recently.
00:38:59,00:39:00,"- Not everywhere, no."
00:39:00,00:39:02,"- And lots, in fact, in most places, we don't do it."
00:39:02,00:39:04,"But does that mean we should actually,"
00:39:04,00:39:07,"or good teeth, mottled brown teeth?"
00:39:07,00:39:09,"Like really, if we want super strong teeth,"
00:39:09,00:39:10,why not triple the fluoride?
00:39:10,00:39:12,- I think you can have too much fluoride.
00:39:12,00:39:15,"- You definitely can, there are advisory levels."
00:39:15,00:39:16,"And people go a bit nuts about it, obviously."
00:39:16,00:39:18,There's lots of stuff online about it.
00:39:18,00:39:22,"When it was installed in Grand Rapids in 1945,"
00:39:22,00:39:24,"lots of people said, ""This fluoride,"
00:39:24,00:39:26,"it's giving me sore teeth and sore enamel,"
00:39:26,00:39:27,"and it's really bad."""
00:39:27,00:39:28,"And they were told,"
00:39:28,00:39:31,"""Yes, we haven't actually put the fluoride in the water yet."""
00:39:31,00:39:32,"That's happening in a few weeks, yeah."
00:39:32,00:39:34,- So we know now that there's no toothpaste
00:39:34,00:39:36,before Campbell Benjamin.
00:39:36,00:39:38,"- Well, there's no tubes, right?"
00:39:38,00:39:39,- It's usable tubes.
00:39:39,00:39:39,"- Yeah, okay."
00:39:39,00:39:43,But what did the Romans do to keep their mouth nice
00:39:43,00:39:46,"and healthy, what they use as mouthwash?"
00:39:46,00:39:47,"- Oh, like urine."
00:39:47,00:39:49,- So there is this sort of factoid
00:39:49,00:39:53,that Romans used urine from Portugal as mouthwash.
00:39:53,00:39:54,(laughing)
00:39:54,00:39:57,"And it is put across by lots of popular historians,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,but it's really probably not true.
00:39:59,00:40:02,"Like if you look for any classical evidence,"
00:40:02,00:40:06,"there is a mention by Catalyst, and it's a poem,"
00:40:06,00:40:07,"but he's mocking someone and he's saying,"
00:40:07,00:40:10,"""Oh yeah, you're in Spain, you've been to Spain,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"so you probably wash your mouth with urine."""
00:40:12,00:40:13,"- Oh, okay, right."
00:40:13,00:40:15,"- And it might be that maybe some people in Spain did that,"
00:40:15,00:40:17,but this is a satirical sort of taking the piss.
00:40:17,00:40:19,"Really, they didn't do this."
00:40:19,00:40:21,"- You mean not only not Portuguese urine,"
00:40:21,00:40:22,they probably didn't use urine in general.
00:40:22,00:40:23,"- Probably not, nah."
00:40:23,00:40:25,"Otherwise, why would you take the piss out of someone"
00:40:25,00:40:27,"for doing it, having just been to Nigeria?"
00:40:27,00:40:28,"- Yeah, yeah, that makes sense."
00:40:28,00:40:29,"I thought you were saying like,"
00:40:29,00:40:31,it's a myth that they imported large quantities
00:40:31,00:40:33,"of Portuguese urine, and actually,"
00:40:33,00:40:34,they just used good old fashioned Roman urine.
00:40:34,00:40:35,(laughing)
00:40:35,00:40:37,But you're saying no urine was probably involved.
00:40:37,00:40:38,"- No, I don't think there's any urine involved."
00:40:38,00:40:40,"- There's only often they introduce the urine tariffs,"
00:40:40,00:40:43,"of course, starting getting good at making their own."
00:40:43,00:40:47,- There's a lot of old methods to clean your teeth
00:40:47,00:40:50,and alleviate toothache before it was a paste.
00:40:50,00:40:52,"It was powder, so we were all using powder toothpaste."
00:40:52,00:40:54,"One of my favorite ones, if not my favorite,"
00:40:54,00:40:59,is you would use the ground up ashes of a wolf's head.
00:40:59,00:41:02,But what you say is when you find that dead wolf
00:41:02,00:41:05,"and you get its head in order to mash it up and use that,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,"it is a well-known fact too,"
00:41:07,00:41:08,that there are bones generally found
00:41:08,00:41:10,in the excrement of that animal.
00:41:10,00:41:12,These bones attached to an amulet
00:41:12,00:41:13,are protective as well.
00:41:13,00:41:15,There's a lot going on.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"- It's an undertaking, isn't it?"
00:41:16,00:41:17,(laughing)
00:41:17,00:41:18,"- It's laborious every night, I guess."
00:41:18,00:41:21,"Yeah, you gotta add a toothpaste."
00:41:21,00:41:22,"- Honestly, compared to,"
00:41:22,00:41:25,"'cause I've literally been to the dentist two days ago,"
00:41:25,00:41:28,"and compared to that, I'll take the wolf crap."
00:41:28,00:41:30,"- You'll follow a wolf run until it does a shit,"
00:41:30,00:41:32,"immediately kill it, turn the shit into a necklace."
00:41:32,00:41:34,"- Rather than an hour and a half of drilling,"
00:41:34,00:41:35,"yeah, I'll go for it."
00:41:35,00:41:36,- Fair enough.
00:41:36,00:41:40,"- My dentist said, ""Mr. Harkin, you have a very strong tongue."""
00:41:40,00:41:41,(laughing)
00:41:41,00:41:45,"- Wow, wow, would you like to join my gentleman's rub club?"
00:41:45,00:41:47,(laughing)
00:41:47,00:41:50,(upbeat music)
00:41:50,00:41:56,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:41:56,00:41:57,and that is James.
00:41:57,00:41:59,"- Okay, my fact this week is that things"
00:41:59,00:42:01,that French newspapers were censored
00:42:01,00:42:04,"from mentioning during World War I included,"
00:42:04,00:42:07,"any use of the word peace without the word victorious,"
00:42:07,00:42:09,"any mention of the cold weather,"
00:42:09,00:42:11,"in case it reminded people about the shortage of coal,"
00:42:11,00:42:13,and any reference of a meeting
00:42:13,00:42:16,between the president's wife and a wild ape.
00:42:16,00:42:17,"- I mean, what twist?"
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- And did that reference a specific occasion,"
00:42:19,00:42:21,or was it just in case anyone--
00:42:21,00:42:24,"- It did, it did, yeah, there was an incident"
00:42:24,00:42:27,"involving Henriette Poincaré,"
00:42:27,00:42:29,who was the wife of the president.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"And on the Wikipedia for the Alise Palace,"
00:42:33,00:42:36,"it says in 1917, a chimpanzee escaped"
00:42:36,00:42:38,"from a nearby menagerie, entered the palace,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,and was said to have tried to hold the wife
00:42:40,00:42:43,"of president Raymond Poincaré into a tree,"
00:42:43,00:42:45,only to be foiled by the guards.
00:42:45,00:42:46,And-- - How strong was it
00:42:46,00:42:47,that he could have held her into a tree?
00:42:47,00:42:49,"- Oh, what chimpanzees? - I know chimpanzees are strong,"
00:42:49,00:42:51,but that's bulky.
00:42:51,00:42:55,- A teenage girl chimpanzee would beat you in an arm wrestle.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"- I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it."
00:42:57,00:42:58,- I know you've been bulking up.
00:42:58,00:43:01,"- Thank you, I think a teenage human girl"
00:43:01,00:43:04,would probably beat Andy in an arm wrestle.
00:43:04,00:43:06,"Oh wow, it's going there, are we?"
00:43:06,00:43:07,"- Can I celebrate strong women, Dan?"
00:43:07,00:43:09,I'm sorry you don't.
00:43:09,00:43:12,(all laughing)
00:43:12,00:43:15,"- Wow, in the metaphorical arm wrestle,"
00:43:15,00:43:17,"but in this discussion, you just got slammed."
00:43:17,00:43:19,"- I got beat shitless, yeah."
00:43:19,00:43:22,"- So I read this on Wikipedia,"
00:43:22,00:43:24,"and I looked for some contemporary reports,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,"and I found this mention,"
00:43:25,00:43:27,"actually this was from the 1930s they mentioned it,"
00:43:27,00:43:29,"it was in the London Diary,"
00:43:29,00:43:30,and it was things that you were not allowed to mention
00:43:30,00:43:34,in 1916 in France in World War I.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"So that seemed to be that it might have happened,"
00:43:36,00:43:38,but then I went further back
00:43:38,00:43:42,"and found some reports in 1916 in the American press,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,and this definitely did happen.
00:43:44,00:43:46,And the Baron Henri de Rothschild
00:43:46,00:43:49,"had a place near the Elisae Palace,"
00:43:49,00:43:51,"and he'd been to the Far East,"
00:43:51,00:43:52,which means that maybe this might have been
00:43:52,00:43:54,"an orangutan, we think."
00:43:54,00:43:57,"He brought it to his home near the Elisae Palace,"
00:43:57,00:43:59,and it had escaped.
00:43:59,00:44:00,- Oh my God.
00:44:00,00:44:02,"- And I read one account in the Oldie magazine,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,"a bit more recently, that said,"
00:44:04,00:44:06,"""The ape wrapped her in his embrace,"
00:44:06,00:44:07,"took her by the waist,"
00:44:07,00:44:10,"and attempted to carry her up a tree."""
00:44:10,00:44:11,- That was like King Kong.
00:44:11,00:44:12,"- It is King Kong, that's it."
00:44:12,00:44:15,"- And then apparently, Poincaré, the president,"
00:44:15,00:44:17,he apparently put the orangutan up
00:44:17,00:44:19,against the firing squad.
00:44:19,00:44:21,"- No, according to one article."
00:44:21,00:44:22,- Which is still King Kong.
00:44:22,00:44:24,That's the exact quote.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"- So I mean, whether that's all true or not,"
00:44:26,00:44:29,like it definitely was reported in 1916 when it happened.
00:44:29,00:44:30,"- 'Cause it's really hard, isn't it?"
00:44:30,00:44:32,'Cause it was censored from the French press.
00:44:32,00:44:35,"- Yes, you've picked a really hard factor, especially."
00:44:35,00:44:38,- But it was mentioned in the world press around the time.
00:44:38,00:44:42,"And apparently, President Deschanel, who came after him,"
00:44:42,00:44:45,he was so impressed by the ape
00:44:45,00:44:48,that he took to jumping in trees during state receptions.
00:44:48,00:44:49,"- Oh, wow."
00:44:49,00:44:51,- But he was the one who went a bit crazy.
00:44:51,00:44:53,"- He was very mad, wasn't he?"
00:44:53,00:44:55,"- Deschanel was the manic pixie dream president, wasn't he?"
00:44:55,00:44:57,"He was, he was the one who woke up on a train,"
00:44:57,00:44:59,"opened the window, fell out of it,"
00:44:59,00:45:01,as it was going 35 miles an hour.
00:45:01,00:45:04,They didn't know until the next morning that he was gone.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"And he was found by a local rail guy who,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,"he was saying, ""I'm the president of France."""
00:45:08,00:45:10,"He goes, ""Sure, mate, sure, okay."""
00:45:10,00:45:11,Brings him to his home and they just keep him there
00:45:11,00:45:13,"until he convinces them that he is, yeah."
00:45:13,00:45:17,"- And then later on, he left the palace"
00:45:17,00:45:19,to go into the gardens and started chatting
00:45:19,00:45:22,"to a park worker, but he had no trousers on."
00:45:22,00:45:25,And then he stepped into an ornamental fountain
00:45:25,00:45:26,thinking it was a bath.
00:45:26,00:45:27,And then he resigned.
00:45:27,00:45:30,"- Yeah, he was in the stress of the job."
00:45:30,00:45:32,"- No, in fairness, like we think now"
00:45:32,00:45:34,that he had some sort of really awful
00:45:34,00:45:36,sort of sleep deprivation illness.
00:45:36,00:45:38,"- Help in a syndrome, I think it was called sleep."
00:45:38,00:45:40,"Sleep drunkenness is a, yeah."
00:45:40,00:45:42,"- But yeah, it was basically he would never,"
00:45:42,00:45:45,he couldn't go into REM sleep or anything.
00:45:45,00:45:46,"So even when he slept,"
00:45:46,00:45:48,he just wasn't getting his brain refreshed.
00:45:48,00:45:49,"- Oh boy, what a pain."
00:45:49,00:45:52,- It's so weird 'cause he lasted a long time being fine.
00:45:52,00:45:54,And then as soon as he became president.
00:45:54,00:45:56,- Maybe the stress did do something for it.
00:45:56,00:45:59,"- Yeah, his wife was called Jermaine."
00:45:59,00:46:02,And I just think I've blown something open
00:46:02,00:46:04,"but I don't quite know what because she's,"
00:46:04,00:46:05,so Jermaine Deschanel was there.
00:46:05,00:46:07,She was a society lady.
00:46:07,00:46:10,She looks like she would have been so good at entertaining
00:46:10,00:46:13,'cause your whole role as first lady then
00:46:13,00:46:15,was throwing big parties and she was brilliant at that.
00:46:15,00:46:18,So such a shame he only lasted about a minute as president.
00:46:18,00:46:21,But she's called Jermaine.
00:46:21,00:46:24,They were married in St. Jermaine church
00:46:24,00:46:28,and he first went mad in St. Jermaine forest.
00:46:28,00:46:30,"- All right, so what's your theory?"
00:46:30,00:46:31,"- Well, I was throwing something open"
00:46:31,00:46:32,but I don't know what it is.
00:46:32,00:46:33,- Is this like the Peckham Butcher?
00:46:33,00:46:35,Do you think she doesn't exist?
00:46:35,00:46:37,"- Well, she is the devil or something"
00:46:37,00:46:41,who she drove him mad by embodying a forest
00:46:41,00:46:42,and then a church.
00:46:42,00:46:44,- I think it's a very Jermaine theory.
00:46:44,00:46:45,- Oh yeah.
00:46:45,00:46:47,- And there's the missing piece.
00:46:47,00:46:48,- Yes.
00:46:48,00:46:49,- The pun.
00:46:49,00:46:52,(all laughing)
00:46:52,00:46:55,- You need for any conspiracy theory to be the pun.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- So this original president's wife,"
00:46:58,00:46:59,the one who bumped into the orangutan
00:46:59,00:47:01,"was Madame Poincaré, right?"
00:47:01,00:47:03,"She was, so Mr. Poincaré,"
00:47:03,00:47:06,"her, him indoors, was Raymond who was president,"
00:47:06,00:47:08,"very presently, president for the whole"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"First World War and some years on either side,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,"PM three times as well over a longer period,"
00:47:12,00:47:13,"like really, very imminent."
00:47:13,00:47:15,"- And then came back to be president again,"
00:47:15,00:47:16,"I think, afterwards."
00:47:16,00:47:17,- Wow.
00:47:17,00:47:19,"Yeah, I mean, so like amazing political career."
00:47:19,00:47:21,So he would have had tube toothpaste.
00:47:21,00:47:22,- Right?
00:47:22,00:47:23,- He would have had tube toothpaste.
00:47:23,00:47:24,- Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:28,"- So his cousin was Henri Poincaré,"
00:47:28,00:47:30,"mathematician, who James, you might?"
00:47:30,00:47:32,"- Oh, of conjecture fame."
00:47:32,00:47:35,"- Of conjecture fame, and I'm putting big quotes on that."
00:47:35,00:47:36,"- Poincaré, conjecture."
00:47:36,00:47:38,"- So he's, yeah, he's really famous, right?"
00:47:38,00:47:38,- Oh yeah.
00:47:38,00:47:39,- In maths world.
00:47:39,00:47:40,"- In maths world, yeah."
00:47:40,00:47:42,"- So I just love this, this is a slight sidebar,"
00:47:42,00:47:44,"but he was in a picture, Henri Poincaré,"
00:47:44,00:47:48,which is known as the most intelligent photo ever taken.
00:47:48,00:47:50,- So there are lots of smart people in it.
00:47:50,00:47:51,- Exactly.
00:47:51,00:47:52,- More than that one from the Oscars
00:47:52,00:47:54,with Ellen the generous in it.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"- Amazingly, no, that one,"
00:47:56,00:47:58,"that was not the most intelligent photo I've taken,"
00:47:58,00:48:00,but this was in 1927.
00:48:00,00:48:02,So it was the previous record holder.
00:48:02,00:48:04,Can we guess who's in the photo?
00:48:04,00:48:04,Would we know?
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Let's say Einstein.
00:48:05,00:48:06,- Let's say Einstein.
00:48:06,00:48:08,I'll give you a clue.
00:48:08,00:48:09,- Neil's bar.
00:48:09,00:48:10,- Can I give you the clue?
00:48:10,00:48:11,- Wait.
00:48:11,00:48:12,- Proust.
00:48:12,00:48:13,- Please wait.
00:48:13,00:48:14,- Marie Curie.
00:48:14,00:48:14,- Hugo.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"- I mean, you kind of hit all of them."
00:48:16,00:48:19,"- The 1927 Solvay conference on quantum mechanics,"
00:48:19,00:48:21,"which was held in Brussels, attracted,"
00:48:21,00:48:23,"there were 29 people in this photo,"
00:48:23,00:48:25,17 of whom got Nobel prizes.
00:48:25,00:48:26,- Oh my God.
00:48:26,00:48:27,- The photo was stunning.
00:48:27,00:48:29,So you said Einstein.
00:48:29,00:48:30,You said Marie Curie.
00:48:30,00:48:31,You said Dirac.
00:48:31,00:48:33,Someone said Paul Dirac.
00:48:33,00:48:36,"Neil's ball, Max Planck, Heisenberg,"
00:48:36,00:48:38,"Erwin Trödinger, August Picard."
00:48:38,00:48:40,"Like everybody, 17 of them got no bells."
00:48:40,00:48:41,And just Picard.
00:48:41,00:48:42,- Wow.
00:48:42,00:48:43,- I know.
00:48:43,00:48:45,"Yeah, Picard, yeah, yeah."
00:48:45,00:48:47,"But there's just one photo of the,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,maybe the most intelligent conference
00:48:49,00:48:49,that's ever happened.
00:48:49,00:48:51,- It wasn't in the.
00:48:51,00:48:52,- And Poincaré was in it.
00:48:52,00:48:52,"- Oh, he took it."
00:48:52,00:48:53,He was in it.
00:48:53,00:48:54,- He was one of the.
00:48:54,00:48:55,- Wow.
00:48:55,00:48:56,- There were people in it.
00:48:56,00:48:58,- And that's lots of nuclear physicists
00:48:58,00:48:59,"of that period as well, right?"
00:48:59,00:48:59,- Right.
00:48:59,00:49:00,"- 'Cause I wonder if the phrase,"
00:49:00,00:49:03,"""If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now,"""
00:49:03,00:49:04,would have been used.
00:49:04,00:49:05,- I'm afraid the atomic bomb hadn't been invented.
00:49:05,00:49:06,"- No, no, no."
00:49:06,00:49:07,Okay.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"Well, a bomb."
00:49:08,00:49:09,"- Is there a phrase that says,"
00:49:09,00:49:10,"""If an atomic bomb dropped on us right now""?"
00:49:10,00:49:12,"- No, I was just adding that to the bomb."
00:49:12,00:49:13,If a bomb hit this.
00:49:13,00:49:14,"- If a bomb, right."
00:49:14,00:49:15,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:49:15,00:49:18,"- If a bomb hit this recording studio we're in right now,"
00:49:18,00:49:20,no effect on global history.
00:49:20,00:49:22,(all laughing)
00:49:22,00:49:22,- Do yourself that.
00:49:22,00:49:25,- Although next year's top barbecue podcast
00:49:25,00:49:26,might be short one candidate.
00:49:26,00:49:28,(all laughing)
00:49:28,00:49:32,"Can I just ask quickly the censorship over that story,"
00:49:32,00:49:35,is it because it wasn't so much that it was embarrassing?
00:49:35,00:49:38,"It's just that no matter what interview they gave,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,the journalist was just desperate to say.
00:49:40,00:49:41,- You know what Dan?
00:49:41,00:49:44,"Like I really, I did a lot of very, very in-depth research"
00:49:44,00:49:46,"on this and it's very difficult to research,"
00:49:46,00:49:49,but I think it was because they were trying to keep morale
00:49:49,00:49:51,up in the country.
00:49:51,00:49:54,I can't think of anything that would improve morale more
00:49:54,00:49:57,than if I found out what's the name Starmer
00:49:57,00:49:59,that was attacked by a cheetah
00:49:59,00:50:02,in the background down on the street.
00:50:02,00:50:04,(all laughing)
00:50:04,00:50:07,"- Well, I think also like it could denigrate his authority."
00:50:07,00:50:08,"- Yeah, right."
00:50:08,00:50:10,"Like they're quite good about,"
00:50:10,00:50:12,well rather they're quite strict about private lives
00:50:12,00:50:12,in France in particular.
00:50:12,00:50:13,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:50:13,00:50:14,- But you're right.
00:50:14,00:50:15,And it's sort of a leading industrialist as well.
00:50:15,00:50:17,It's like if Alan Sugar's pet Komodo dragon
00:50:17,00:50:20,had temporarily abducted Mrs. Starmer.
00:50:20,00:50:22,- And Starmer's had it shot by a firing squad.
00:50:22,00:50:23,- Yes. - Lovely.
00:50:23,00:50:28,"- She, Madame Poincaré, she was quite controversial."
00:50:28,00:50:30,"In fact, the Queen of England was very snobbish"
00:50:30,00:50:31,"about her, Queen Mary."
00:50:31,00:50:35,They did an official visit in 1914
00:50:35,00:50:37,and she refused to be seen with her at first.
00:50:37,00:50:40,"- Sorry, that's just grinning away"
00:50:40,00:50:41,at the thought of Queen Mary
00:50:41,00:50:44,using some collapsible toothpaste tubes.
00:50:44,00:50:46,"- I was about to say, how did you know?"
00:50:46,00:50:47,- 'Cause I had the same thought then.
00:50:47,00:50:49,(all laughing)
00:50:49,00:50:51,- I don't know the state of her dental hygiene.
00:50:51,00:50:53,All I know is I'm trying to make the serious point
00:50:53,00:50:57,"that the English, the Brits were very snobbish"
00:50:57,00:51:00,"because Madame Poincaré, she was very old when she married."
00:51:00,00:51:01,This wasn't why they disapproved.
00:51:01,00:51:03,This is sort of why I disapproved when I read about the story.
00:51:03,00:51:05,"She was in her, she was 46"
00:51:05,00:51:06,and the primus was a bit younger.
00:51:06,00:51:09,So Queen Mary refused to share a carriage with her
00:51:09,00:51:11,because she was divorced and her first husband
00:51:11,00:51:15,was a cab driver who was still alive.
00:51:15,00:51:16,"- Oh, okay. - Unbelievable."
00:51:16,00:51:17,- It's showing because they could have run
00:51:17,00:51:19,with the headline Cougar attacked by chimpanzee.
00:51:19,00:51:22,(all laughing)
00:51:22,00:51:23,- Very good.
00:51:23,00:51:26,"- I mean, that mirrors current prime minister,"
00:51:26,00:51:27,"sorry, Brigitte Macron."
00:51:27,00:51:29,"- The French are into it, yeah."
00:51:29,00:51:31,- And they're also into presidents
00:51:31,00:51:33,having lots of mistresses all the way.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"François Hollande, he had four children"
00:51:36,00:51:37,"with his long-term partner,"
00:51:37,00:51:40,"but then when he became president,"
00:51:40,00:51:44,"moved in with his mistress, Valérie Truvile."
00:51:44,00:51:47,But then he cheated on her with an actor
00:51:47,00:51:50,with an actress and it was really funny
00:51:50,00:51:52,'cause he went off to see this actress
00:51:52,00:51:54,with a motorcycle helmet on his head
00:51:54,00:51:57,thinking that no one would be able to tell it was him.
00:51:57,00:51:58,But he wore the same pair of socks
00:51:58,00:52:01,that he'd been wearing at a recent international visit.
00:52:01,00:52:03,So the photographers took a photo of him
00:52:03,00:52:04,"and went, ""I recognize those socks."""
00:52:04,00:52:06,"- Whoa. - Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:06,00:52:07,- That was bad luck.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"- What does the sock say, president of France?"
00:52:09,00:52:11,Like what was-- (all laughing)
00:52:11,00:52:13,- It must have been quite distinctive.
00:52:13,00:52:14,- I think it must have been
00:52:14,00:52:15,'cause most socks are just quite plain.
00:52:15,00:52:17,- Most male professionals wear plain black socks.
00:52:17,00:52:19,- That's why I always wear plain black socks
00:52:19,00:52:22,is so I can get away with being a cat.
00:52:22,00:52:24,- What socks I'm wearing?
00:52:24,00:52:26,"- Just a shagger on your socks, James."
00:52:26,00:52:28,(all laughing)
00:52:28,00:52:30,"- I'm wearing part of a girl's socks,"
00:52:30,00:52:32,"which I reckon if, oh, look at Dan's."
00:52:32,00:52:34,He's got bright yellow ones.
00:52:34,00:52:35,"- James, you must be the only man"
00:52:35,00:52:36,in London wearing those socks today.
00:52:36,00:52:37,"- I know, if I have an affair."
00:52:37,00:52:38,"- Yeah, you're screwed."
00:52:38,00:52:40,"- Dan, what's that?"
00:52:40,00:52:41,- It's blast skateboards.
00:52:41,00:52:43,It's their logo.
00:52:43,00:52:44,"I am the only man wearing this in London today,"
00:52:44,00:52:48,"but because of them, I will not be having an affair."
00:52:48,00:52:49,- I think the same applies to James.
00:52:49,00:52:51,"- Show you mine, plain black."
00:52:51,00:52:52,"- Lovely, lovely."
00:52:52,00:52:54,- If you see a man having an affair
00:52:54,00:52:57,"and playing back socks, you know it's not me or Dan."
00:52:57,00:52:59,"- No, and if they've got a little garter"
00:52:59,00:53:01,"and they're tighter than me, you'll know it's me."
00:53:01,00:53:02,(all laughing)
00:53:02,00:53:04,"He is not, I don't mean to be rude about him,"
00:53:04,00:53:06,but he's not David Gandhi.
00:53:06,00:53:07,"- Oland, who's saying?"
00:53:07,00:53:07,"- Oland, yeah."
00:53:07,00:53:10,He's an example of power being a great aphrodisiac.
00:53:10,00:53:12,"You know, he's sort of just a very average-looking dude"
00:53:12,00:53:14,who happened to be the president of France.
00:53:14,00:53:16,"- He's not David Gandhi, is that the best?"
00:53:16,00:53:16,"- Yeah, I don't know."
00:53:16,00:53:18,Is that Mahatma Gandhi's brother?
00:53:18,00:53:20,"- He's Mahatma Gandhi's, yeah, yeah."
00:53:20,00:53:22,Mahatma Gandhi had taken his well-man pills.
00:53:22,00:53:23,He would have looked like David.
00:53:23,00:53:26,"- David's one of my top-end model, male model."
00:53:26,00:53:27,- He's an underpan model.
00:53:27,00:53:28,"- Right. - Oh, yeah."
00:53:28,00:53:29,"- Okay, yeah."
00:53:29,00:53:33,- Is this the first ever modern popular culture reference
00:53:33,00:53:34,that Andy's ever said on the podcast?
00:53:34,00:53:35,"- I think it might be, yeah."
00:53:35,00:53:36,"- Maybe that none of us have, well, I've got it,"
00:53:36,00:53:38,but like that you two haven't heard it.
00:53:38,00:53:39,"- I can't believe you haven't, Hannah."
00:53:39,00:53:40,- He's sort of a famous guy.
00:53:40,00:53:43,- You think I know a lot of male underpan models?
00:53:43,00:53:45,"- He might get a magazine or something, I don't know."
00:53:45,00:53:47,"- Right, yeah."
00:53:47,00:53:48,"- But Jack Chirac, President of France?"
00:53:48,00:53:49,- Yeah.
00:53:49,00:53:50,- He muddled the pants.
00:53:50,00:53:52,"- Well, he might as well have done."
00:53:52,00:53:54,"I mean, he certainly showed his pants off a lot."
00:53:54,00:53:55,- Did he?
00:53:55,00:53:57,"- He, when he was mayor of Paris in the 1980s,"
00:53:57,00:53:59,he ordered the city council to buy him a coat
00:53:59,00:54:01,fitted with a bedroom so he could meet lovers
00:54:01,00:54:02,on official engagement.
00:54:02,00:54:03,"- Oh, wow."
00:54:03,00:54:04,"- Sorry, a coat fitted with a bedroom."
00:54:04,00:54:05,- Coat.
00:54:05,00:54:06,"- Coat, right?"
00:54:06,00:54:07,- Coat like a bus.
00:54:07,00:54:09,- Like a national express.
00:54:09,00:54:11,(laughing)
00:54:12,00:54:13,- Like a mega bus.
00:54:13,00:54:15,- Like a mega bus.
00:54:15,00:54:17,- A really mega bus.
00:54:17,00:54:18,- Was that so he could have lots of affairs
00:54:18,00:54:20,not just so he could sleep between?
00:54:20,00:54:22,"- No, it was specifically so he could meet lovers."
00:54:22,00:54:24,- Did he say that?
00:54:24,00:54:28,"- Well, he had his private jet when he was president,"
00:54:28,00:54:30,had a room that was for trists.
00:54:30,00:54:31,- Lovely.
00:54:31,00:54:34,"He has the weirdest thing, which made me sort of warm to him."
00:54:34,00:54:35,"So Jack and Bernadette, his wife,"
00:54:35,00:54:38,brought a Vietnamese refugee to live with them
00:54:38,00:54:40,and sort of adopted a Vietnamese refugee.
00:54:40,00:54:41,And it was on a whim.
00:54:41,00:54:43,So this woman was called Anne Dow Traxel.
00:54:43,00:54:45,She was actually about 20.
00:54:45,00:54:48,But she'd escaped from a refugee camp in 1979
00:54:48,00:54:50,when the Vietnamese were having a not very good time.
00:54:50,00:54:53,And she was crying in the corner of an airport in France.
00:54:53,00:54:56,"And Jack Shorak saw her, approached her,"
00:54:56,00:54:57,"and said, ""Don't cry, my dear,"
00:54:57,00:54:58,"from now on you'll live with us."""
00:54:58,00:54:59,"- Hmm, okay."
00:54:59,00:55:01,I've got a special bedroom on the jumper.
00:55:01,00:55:02,- Yeah.
00:55:02,00:55:03,(laughing)
00:55:03,00:55:05,"- Can I tell you one French heroine I found out,"
00:55:05,00:55:06,"she wasn't First Lady of France or anything,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,"but just in the course of researching her,"
00:55:08,00:55:11,"so I found out about her, 'cause she was amazing."
00:55:11,00:55:12,Her name was Valerie André.
00:55:12,00:55:14,She died this year in February.
00:55:14,00:55:16,"She was the wife of President Peter André,"
00:55:16,00:55:17,wasn't she?
00:55:17,00:55:18,- She was.
00:55:18,00:55:20,And she was a mysterious girl.
00:55:20,00:55:21,She died this year.
00:55:21,00:55:22,"She was 102 years old, right?"
00:55:22,00:55:25,So she lived 1923 to 2025.
00:55:25,00:55:29,"She was, in this order, a brain surgeon, a parachutist,"
00:55:29,00:55:31,and the first woman to fly helicopter missions
00:55:31,00:55:33,"in combat zones, and the first French woman"
00:55:33,00:55:35,to become a general in their army.
00:55:35,00:55:36,- Wow.
00:55:36,00:55:38,- She would do parachute jumps into combat zones
00:55:38,00:55:40,"if someone had been wounded, right?"
00:55:40,00:55:42,"You know, she would either do parachute jumps in"
00:55:42,00:55:44,"or she would fly a helicopter in herself,"
00:55:44,00:55:46,"pick up a wounded soldier in the helicopter,"
00:55:46,00:55:49,"fly them to hospital, and then she'd say,"
00:55:49,00:55:51,"""Hello, I'm gonna be your surgeon today,"""
00:55:51,00:55:53,and do the operation on them.
00:55:53,00:55:54,- That's amazing.
00:55:54,00:55:55,"- I just think I was like, imagine that."
00:55:55,00:55:58,Imagine you're pilot then becoming a surgeon
00:55:58,00:56:00,halfway through and patching you up.
00:56:00,00:56:01,Just crazy.
00:56:01,00:56:05,- I think I would feel less confident in her in both roles.
00:56:05,00:56:06,(laughing)
00:56:06,00:56:09,- I think you're not putting your full life
00:56:09,00:56:11,"into being a helicopter pilot or a surgeon, are you?"
00:56:11,00:56:13,"- Would you say that before she made the first incision,"
00:56:13,00:56:14,or would you maybe wait until?
00:56:14,00:56:16,"- I'd be like, do we not have someone"
00:56:16,00:56:18,who studied their whole life as a surgeon
00:56:18,00:56:20,"who could do my surgery, please?"
00:56:20,00:56:22,"- Looking at gift horse in the mouth, or what?"
00:56:22,00:56:23,(laughing)
00:56:23,00:56:24,- That's so funny.
00:56:24,00:56:25,(laughing)
00:56:25,00:56:27,- I'm not gonna sign this consent form.
00:56:27,00:56:29,(laughing)
00:56:29,00:56:31,(upbeat music)
00:56:31,00:56:35,"- Okay, that's it."
00:56:35,00:56:36,That is all of our facts.
00:56:36,00:56:37,Thank you so much for listening.
