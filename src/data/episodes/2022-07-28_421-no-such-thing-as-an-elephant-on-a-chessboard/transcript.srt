00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we want to let you know we have a very exciting guest on.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,560
 It's none other than the undercover economist himself, Tim Harford.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,160
 Tim Harford is a brilliant writer, thinker.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,120
 He makes books, he makes radio shows.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,780
 He makes books. He's a bookmaker.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,620
 He's a book binder.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,120
 He makes, he turns trees into paper.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,120
 He's bound a million books.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,320
 It's so amazing.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,560
 You know, if you've heard of Messi or 50 things that made the modern economy or the undercover economist, all of these books, they're by him.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,840
 They are, and he's got a podcast called Cautionary Tales, which I would massively recommend.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
 I've just been listening to a bunch of them.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,440
 They are brilliant and true life stories, which teach you things about how humans behave.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,760
 I've been listening to one about the mummy's curse.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,880
 There's an excellent one on Hansel and Gretel, which is really amazing.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,240
 And they often have a little twist at the end and really well told.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,880
 So check out that podcast.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,700
 But first of all, listen to this one.

19
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,680
 On with the show.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,660
 On with the show.

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:19,740
. Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, the weekly podcast coming to you this week from four top secret underground undisclosed locations.

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:28,620
 My name is Anna Toshinsky, and I am sitting here today with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and our very special guest, Tim Harford.

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:38,180
 And once again, we've gathered around our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Tim.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:48,060
 My fact is that in 1939, a young doctor at Boston City Hospital went on a scurvy producing diet to see what would happen.

25
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:58,260
 In May 1940, his fellow doctors staged an intervention after his skin started to bleed from his follicles and an old post-operative scar reopened.

26
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,940
 Oh, no.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,980
 Lovely.

28
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:05,420
 Why did because the people sort of knew what happened when he got scurvy at that point, right?

29
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,460
 Why? Why was he doing this?

30
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,900
 They did. So he survived, by the way.

31
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:14,700
 So I read the medical paper that he and a colleague wrote after this experiment.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,580
 So the puzzle was, I mean, people had been suffering from scurvy.

33
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,820
 And worrying about scurvy for hundreds of years and kind of discovering cures and then forgetting cures.

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,820
 It's all very fascinating.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:30,300
 But by the 1930s, they'd figured out that scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C.

36
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,900
 But the puzzle was, if you deprive people of vitamin C, it very quickly leaves the body.

37
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,340
 So after a week or so, you've got no vitamin C, but then everything's fine.

38
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,380
 And people don't actually develop any symptoms for weeks or even months.

39
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,500
 And so this guy, his name was John Crandon and his colleagues were just trying to figure out,

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:55,700
 well, how long can you go and what happens and what order do these terrible symptoms appear in?

41
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,900
 And he said, well, no one else is going to do it.

42
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,140
 So I'm going to do it. And so he did.

43
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,500
 And yeah, he was absolutely fine for two or three months.

44
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
 And then I read the description of what happened.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,700
 He started on October the 19th, 1939.

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,500
 His scurvy producing diet was actually his hands.

47
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,740
 OK, it's eggs, cheese, bread, butter, chocolate and coffee gets a bit boring after a little bit.

48
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,860
 But it's fine for a while.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,500
 Genuinely, that is my diet.

50
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,380
 You can add some red wine in there.

51
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,540
 And then that's basically it after we finish this.

52
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,700
 You're really going to start wanting some orange juice to add to that, James, I think.

53
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,260
 So he says he says after about four and a half months,

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,580
 hyperkeratotic papules had developed on the buttocks.

55
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,940
 Now, that doesn't sound good at all.

56
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,780
 I was going to Google hyperkeratotic buttock papules and then I decided I wasn't going to do that.

57
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,460
 Don't worry, Tim, I've been eating nothing but chocolate and bread for the last six months.

58
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,300
 I can tell you exactly what they are.

59
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,460
 Oh, please don't.

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,860
 James has just taken his trousers down and shown us his buttocks.

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,260
 And it is disgusting.

62
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,940
 It's really I'm not going to be able to take that image out of my mind now.

63
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,260
 And then after five months, he started just started bleeding around the hair follicles on his legs.

64
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,380
 He got incredibly tired.

65
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:20,060
 He used to run on a treadmill and by the end of this, he could do 50 meters on a treadmill.

66
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,700
 It took him 16 seconds to do 50 meters, which is not very fast.

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,380
 And then that was too much.

68
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,100
 And he was quite a young man.

69
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,820
 And at six months, they made a surgical incision basically just to see whether it would heal.

70
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,020
 And it didn't.

71
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,900
 And I think they probably shouldn't have been surprised at that

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,980
 because he had a scar from a 15-year-old appendectomy that was reopening by this point.

73
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,500
 And then they said, "All right, you've done enough.

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,380
 You've done enough."

75
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,980
 And they started giving him intravenous vitamin C and he was fine.

76
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,780
 That's so scientific to say, well, your old scar has reopened.

77
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,900
 But just in case, we're going to have to make another scar

78
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,620
 and see if that also fails to heal.

79
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,900
 Like, that's so impressive, the scientific method, I think.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,980
 Is it?

81
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,060
 I think so.

82
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:10,100
 I find that one of the most kind of morbid things about scurvy

83
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,180
 is the whole wounds reopening.

84
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,660
 It takes you back in time, but in just a way that you really don't want to go back in time,

85
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,860
 the idea that these ancient and bone breaks re-break, don't they?

86
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,940
 Because I think you start making collagen, which basically holds your body together.

87
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,940
 And so, I don't know, the idea of all these ancient wounds

88
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,180
 you'd completely forgotten about reopening is pretty fine.

89
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,380
 All your exes ring up and break up with you all over again.

90
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,060
 It's another unknown symptom.

91
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,540
 It's really mad that it's two or three months that you're fine for,

92
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,900
 because I guess that explains why in the age of sale,

93
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,060
 sailors got scurvy because it was just long enough to get really, really, really far away from the nearest lemon.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,980
 As in, if you've got it within a day of not having any vitamin C,

95
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,660
 then everyone would immediately come back to port and say, "Well, we die at sea, so we're not going to go."

96
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,700
 It's quite cool. It's almost like a lemon detector, isn't it?

97
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,940
 You can tell how far away you are from a lemon, just by how much blood is coming out of your paws.

98
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,860
 Not very. You can only tell to within three months away.

99
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,260
 I mean, it's not that accurate.

100
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,420
 There are easier ways to detect lemons, and actually, it's...

101
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,060
 - Are there? - It's difficult.

102
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,180
 The reason I got interested in this is because I discovered that

103
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,180
 Scott of the Antarctic suffered from scurvy.

104
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,660
 It's controversial as to whether his final mission was affected by scurvy,

105
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,300
 but certainly earlier missions were, and some of the people he went to

106
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,860
 who tried to get to the South Pole with were affected by scurvy.

107
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,020
 And I thought, "Hang on a minute. He's a British Navy captain."

108
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,540
 And didn't the British Navy figure all this out in 1747?

109
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,100
 James Lindes famously did this, the first ever randomized controlled trial, people say,

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,620
 and discovered that you could prevent scurvy with lemons.

111
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,980
 And then they started calling British sailors limies because they used to have lime juice.

112
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,220
 And so, what happened? How could the British Navy forget this?

113
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,020
 And it is partly because it's not a very good lemon detector.

114
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,340
 It turns out there's vitamin C in almost everything.

115
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,100
 You have to work quite hard.

116
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,740
 I mean, James is doing this hard work.

117
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,060
 You have to work quite hard to completely deprive yourself of vitamin C.

118
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,700
 So people get confused, so basically the signals get very mixed.

119
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,060
 And what Andy was saying about these sea voyages,

120
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,700
 another reason the British Navy started getting confused

121
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,500
 is because they switched to steamships.

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,660
 And so they were still taking a remedy for scurvy that turns out wasn't working.

123
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,100
 But because they were all on steamships, steamships travel quite quickly.

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,620
 They have to refuel.

125
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,180
 Every time you refuel, you take on fresh food.

126
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,900
 And so they were sticking to this cure for scurvy they thought was working.

127
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,820
 It wasn't working.

128
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,420
 It didn't matter because there wasn't time for anybody to develop scurvy.

129
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,540
 And then suddenly these Arctic and Antarctic explorers all started coming down with scurvy.

130
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,140
 And everybody got monumentally confused at that point.

131
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,460
 So the lemons and limes don't really work that well.

132
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,660
 Is that what we're saying?

133
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,780
 So there's two things.

134
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,820
 One is that limes, although they're more acidic, have less vitamin C in.

135
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,860
 So they still work.

136
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,460
 They used to be using Sicilian lemons and they're really juicy

137
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,620
 and got loads of vitamin C, and then they switched for geopolitical reasons

138
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,860
 to West Indian limes and that they're less effective.

139
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,740
 But the other thing is vitamin C is destroyed really easily.

140
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,580
 It's destroyed by contact with copper.

141
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,900
 And a lot of these ships had copper vessels.

142
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,100
 It's destroyed by contact with sunlight.

143
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,780
 It's destroyed by heat.

144
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,220
 And so you had this sort of old lime juice that was going a bit rancid.

145
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,220
 And there wasn't any vitamin C in it anymore, but people were still taking it.

146
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,220
 And so then when they started taking lime juice on Arctic expeditions and it didn't work,

147
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,140
 they lost faith and they started there.

148
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,100
 And at the same time, there's germ theory being developed.

149
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,780
 And they started going, oh, maybe scurvy is nothing to do with lemons and limes at all.

150
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,540
 Maybe it's to do with some kind of germ that we can't see,

151
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,620
 which of course was completely up the wrong tree.

152
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,700
 It's just crazy when you read about the history of scurvy,

153
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,300
 how early on they suggested that citrus was a cure and how many hundreds of years

154
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,540
 they skirt around it, skirt around it.

155
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,900
 And sort of just like, yeah, I think it is.

156
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,300
 And then go, actually, maybe not.

157
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,780
 It's so frustrating because it's so easy to sort out once you definitely know.

158
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,260
 But I found, you know, it's really quick.

159
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,460
 You know, Scott, one of the people on his expeditions who got scurvy was Shackleton,

160
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,340
 which I didn't know that they did an expedition together.

161
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,540
 But yeah, there was a bit of bad blood.

162
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
 They didn't like each other.

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
 It was quite a rivalry.

164
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,540
 Indeed, there seems to be a bit of a conspiracy theory that maybe Shackleton wasn't that ill

165
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,140
 and Scott sort of kicked him off the expedition because he wasn't really getting along with him.

166
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,380
 Shackleton was like the fun, spontaneous one, wasn't he?

167
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,420
 And Scott was a bit more of a serious bore.

168
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,500
 Really? So Scott said, oh, you're definitely, you're far too ill.

169
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,540
 You've definitely got scurvy.

170
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,340
 And Shackleton was like, well, I haven't even got any hyperkinetic papules.

171
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,580
 The point where Shackleton pulled down his pants to display his buttocks.

172
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
 Look at this.

173
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,740
 And that's when he got chucked off the expedition.

174
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,620
 And guinea pigs get scurvy.

175
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,620
 Do they?

176
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,620
 Yeah.

177
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,460
 Because they mean, if I eat guinea pig, then I would not get any vitamin C.

178
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,420
 I think if you eat a healthy guinea pig, you'll be fine.

179
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,420
 Because I know James did as well as the diet you eat.

180
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,660
 I have eaten a guinea pig.

181
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,420
 But you occasionally have guinea pig mints on your bread and with your coffee.

182
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,820
 No, because they, they can't make their own vitamin C and that's, we can't do that either.

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,980
 And we're all, there's this weird club of crap animals, including humans,

184
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,460
 which can't make their own vitamin C.

185
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,340
 So it's fruit bats, guinea pigs, some of the apes and humans are the ones that can't do it.

186
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,940
 Every other animal doesn't get scurvy because they can just generate vitamin C.

187
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,060
 I guess from internally, somehow they're generating it.

188
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,980
 Like, well, like we generate, you know, we basically, what a vitamin is,

189
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,300
 is the things that we need from our diet, because we can't generate them

190
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,660
 and everything else we can generate.

191
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,380
 And I suppose these animals can.

192
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,620
 But maybe we should form that club with those guys, like a really sad rejects club.

193
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,260
 Like, what are those people?

194
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,620
 What's that club called of some men who've decided that they've abandoned women

195
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,620
 because women hate them in cells.

196
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,420
 This could be the new in cells.

197
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,020
 Us fruit bats, guinea pigs.

198
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,820
 I'm just a bit worried the guinea pigs won't let me in

199
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,180
 because I've just admitted that I won't say some guinea pig.

200
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,020
 It turned out to be really important.

201
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:11,220
 So people were being confused, as Anna says, just getting confused about scurvy

202
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,460
 and what causes it and how to cure it for centuries.

203
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,820
 And they keep sort of figuring it out and then not figuring it out

204
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,340
 and getting confused and forgetting.

205
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,180
 And then finally, in 1907, these two Norwegian scientists,

206
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,460
 Holst and Fröhlich, figure out that guinea pigs also get scurvy,

207
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,820
 which is this absolute breakthrough moment.

208
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,060
 And then once you can do that, how can you tell that a guinea pig has scurvy?

209
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,140
 Is it because it can only run 50 meters on its little bowl?

210
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,420
 That must be it. That and the papules.

211
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,260
 I think it's those two things.

212
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,460
 Once they figured that out, it was it was easy to clear up this massive confusion

213
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,500
 about whether scurvy was caused by some kind of toxin or some kind of bacteria

214
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,620
 or whether it was a deficiency.

215
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,860
 And they figured it all out.

216
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,340
 And then they turned around and they told Fritschhoff Nansen,

217
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,580
 who's a great Norwegian polar explorer and a mentor to both Robert Scott

218
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,740
 and Rold Amundsen.

219
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,260
 And Nansen said, yeah, no, I don't believe any of that.

220
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,700
 You can't learn anything from guinea pigs.

221
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,660
 Trust me, it's fresh seal meat you need.

222
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,180
 And so he basically told them to bugger off

223
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,420
 and both Amundsen and Scott then went to the Antarctica gear later.

224
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,460
 And and Scott's whole crew probably got scurvy.

225
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,180
 If there was ever a lesson to listen to the scientists, people,

226
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,060
 it really is the history of scurvy.

227
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,580
 It's wild how much people ignore them.

228
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:35,340
 So the reason that this is all puzzling is because the the story

229
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,540
 that randomized controlled trials nerds tell is that in 1747,

230
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,620
 this guy, James Lind, who was a surgeon on the HMS Salisbury,

231
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,180
 figured it all out. That's the story they tell.

232
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,100
 And and and he did sort of run a controlled trial.

233
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,700
 He gave to had a whole bunch of sailors who had scurvy.

234
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,300
 He gave two of them a quarter of cider a day.

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,700
 Sounds quite nice, but it's not going to work.

236
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,420
 He gave two of them 75 drops a day of sulfuric acid.

237
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,420
 He gave two of them vinegar, gave two of them a paste of garlic,

238
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,140
 mustard, horseradish and aromatic plant extracts,

239
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,060
 which sounds like it might be nice.

240
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,460
 But but none of that worked.

241
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,180
 But he gave he gave the last two two oranges and a lemon

242
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,860
 each day for six days.

243
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,020
 And at that point, they made a complete recovery.

244
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,420
 Unfortunately, that was the ship's entire stock of lemons.

245
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,860
 So it was unfortunate for everybody else.

246
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,820
 But the weird thing is that even James Lind, I mean, you would have thought,

247
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:31,380
 OK, brilliant, you ran a randomized trial, you figured it all out.

248
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,220
 Perfect. But then he published this book

249
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,820
 all about how to cure scurvy, which had this write up of this trial,

250
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,500
 but had loads of other stuff about, oh, like, maybe it's excess sweating

251
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,900
 or maybe it's to do with ventilation or this or that.

252
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,180
 It's the whole who who can say?

253
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,500
 I mean, it was bizarre what the conclusion he came to.

254
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,460
 And in the end, he said, anyway, my cure for scurvy is

255
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,700
 lemon juice that's been boiled into a syrup preserved under olive oil.

256
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,500
 And it turns out that doesn't work because if you boil lemon juice

257
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,340
 into a syrup, you've destroyed all the vitamin C.

258
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,140
 So he runs this randomized trial.

259
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,620
 He doesn't understand what he's done.

260
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,420
 And then the conclusion he draws is this completely ineffective remedy.

261
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,780
 And there you go. That's science 1747.

262
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,980
 I just can't believe that one of the groups was given sulfuric acid,

263
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,700
 which feels like, you know, you could literally give the other group

264
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,780
 American cheese and white bread and they're going to do better than the group

265
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,940
 you gave sulfuric acid to. Sure. Yes.

266
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,620
 Throatless Jimmy, we call him.

267
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,020
 Yeah.

268
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,700
 I really like the the old theory about how to cure scurvy,

269
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,420
 which was to bury yourself in soil.

270
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,700
 And that was such a good idea.

271
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,100
 It's such, you know, it really does make sense

272
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,300
 because you were getting scurvy when you were away from earth, right?

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,620
 You were on the on the water, you were thousands of miles from 11.

274
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,220
 You're going to get sick.

275
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,540
 And so what was obviously the thing that you were missing?

276
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,100
 You were missing dry land.

277
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,420
 And so they used to just bury people up to the neck in soil

278
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,260
 and think that this would make them better.

279
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,940
 So funny. It's such a good idea.

280
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,820
 And what they would do is they would take boxes of earth with them on the voyages.

281
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,340
 And if someone got sick, they would bury them on the ship in the in the earth.

282
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,300
 There was one captain called Thomas Melville, who found that it actually worked

283
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,540
 and it made people feel better.

284
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,580
 But he was feeding people vegetables while they were in the earth all the time.

285
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,980
 So probably the other thing, though,

286
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,340
 it's so good because it means you can also, as well as getting vegetables,

287
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,500
 you can disguise your ship as a small island.

288
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,780
 And so you can sneak up on other ships undetected

289
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,260
 because they just see a load of soil.

290
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,420
 Well, they see a load of soil, don't they? You know.

291
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,940
 Yeah, clever. Get a donkey, a little windmill.

292
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,220
 Palm tree, maybe?

293
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,700
 Yes, I'm just thinking my idea of like

294
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,180
 my idea of the islands is more like palm trees and hammocks, not donkeys and windmills.

295
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,620
 A donkey and a windmill and a famous cartoon trope of someone on a desert island.

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,220
 How can you tell they're on a desert island?

297
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,100
 There's a donkey and a windmill.

298
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,860
 Yeah, it's a classic.

299
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:08,900
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

300
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,780
 OK, my fact this week is that there are more people alive today

301
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,180
 who have been world chess champion than there are people skillful enough

302
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,380
 to carve a knight for use in a world championship chess match.

303
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,420
 Amazing. What are the numbers?

304
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,620
 What are we talking about?

305
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,020
 Well, the numbers are 10 who can do the night.

306
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,100
 This is according to a video which I saw, which was posted by Business Insider

307
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,740
 called Why Championship Chess Sets Are So Expensive.

308
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,700
 As part of that, they said there are only 10 people alive

309
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,340
 who can make the little horses that you use in chess.

310
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,100
 And so I thought I wonder how that compares with people who have won the world

311
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,980
 championship and I went on to the on to Wikipedia and looked at the list

312
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,180
 of the people who are still alive and there's more than 10 as it doesn't.

313
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,980
 I think how good do these things have to be?

314
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,820
 I mean, because I would have thought it's quite easy to carve a night.

315
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,500
 Most professional whittlers, I know, which is a lot,

316
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,380
 could probably do a passable chess night.

317
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,660
 What's so special about these ones?

318
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,940
 Well, you you take all of the whittlers.

319
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,940
 Some of them can do it.

320
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,220
 Some of them can and you go down and down and down.

321
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,220
 And eventually you get the 10.

322
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,540
 Yeah, you got it, Andy. You can see what I'm going there.

323
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,620
 No, they're made.

324
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,660
 These nights are made in a place called Amritsar, which is in India.

325
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,100
 Very specific factory makes them.

326
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,500
 They only make two hundred and fifty per year.

327
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,980
 One night to kind of whittle it down takes two hours.

328
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,060
 And it takes five to six years to learn how to make this night.

329
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,700
 All the other pieces take about four to five months to make.

330
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,100
 And so if you were to buy a very, very high end chess set,

331
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,460
 the nights are worth approximately 50 percent of the entire set.

332
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,660
 The value comes from just the nights.

333
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,700
 That's what this is so funny.

334
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,820
 It's about it's about five hundred dollars for one of these sets.

335
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,620
 They sound I think I read the same piece, James.

336
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,620
 It says this that the the blocks of wood that they use for the pieces

337
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,380
 were once large trunks dried for three to six months,

338
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,540
 cut down a shape to the necessary size, which does make it sound like they're

339
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,820
 using one large tree trunk.

340
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,940
 Yeah. Knocked down a giant redwood for one pawn.

341
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,700
 They are really beautiful to watch them being carved on the on the lathe.

342
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
 And it's a little bit like watching pottery.

343
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,380
 It's that kind of beautiful sort of hypnotic view of this thing taking shape.

344
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,100
 But I have to say it's all nonsense, isn't it?

345
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,300
 Because when this I saw this this short film and at one point they say,

346
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,900
 oh, yeah, it helps these grandmasters to not make any mistakes.

347
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,700
 That's just nonsense.

348
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,740
 Grandmasters, they can play blindfold.

349
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,260
 I mean, you literally don't actually need the chessboard or the chess pieces.

350
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,300
 They can play blindfold. What is this?

351
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,380
 I don't know what you're talking about.

352
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,060
 The video I've I've drunk the cool aid and I believe this.

353
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,420
 It's they say that because if you don't make the chess pieces properly

354
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,300
 and the king isn't the tallest piece, then you might accidentally move

355
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,460
 one of the other pawns, maybe thinking it's the king.

356
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,060
 Or if they're not weighted correctly, they might fall over

357
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,020
 and you accidentally kind of resign.

358
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,500
 You're OK. OK, OK, it's not. No, no, no, no, it's true.

359
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,420
 No, the thing about chess players is that they're very stupid people.

360
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:32,060
 James, that falling over thing I read that, too, is that

361
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,180
 if you accidentally knock your piece over and then you press, you know,

362
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,340
 because they're playing timed against each other in some matches.

363
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,500
 So you you knock a piece over and then you press the timer

364
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,860
 to move it onto your opponent's turn and then you pick your piece back up.

365
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,860
 You can be disqualified from the whole match

366
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,060
 because you're technically eating into your opponent's time there.

367
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,420
 And that has happened recently.

368
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,980
 There was a game in 2016 where a grandmaster,

369
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,580
 very good chess player, lost because he dropped his queen and then did that.

370
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,900
 Really? And we we we're claiming that these these 10 people

371
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,020
 who can make the night are the only people who can make a night

372
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,300
 that can successfully stand up if you can't.

373
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,740
 If you can't feel the bridle on the night is positioned correctly,

374
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,100
 it'll completely throw off your game.

375
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,540
 That's why Casparov lost against Deep Blue.

376
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,900
 So there's a slight discrepancy in the reins.

377
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,660
 I want to see the chess grandmasters rant when he like sort of a tennis player

378
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,140
 with a broken racket when he seizes a night waving at the umpire.

379
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,060
 What the hell is this shit?

380
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:30,260
 I would love to see these artisans, these craftspeople from Amritsar.

381
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,140
 I would love to see them wrestle with a classic Prussian

382
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,700
 wargame chess crossovers because there are some amazing kind of chess

383
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,460
 mutations from a few hundred years ago that I think would pose a real challenge.

384
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:49,420
 So any of you have heard of Gross's Konigspiel, which is a 1664 chess variant?

385
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,660
 Well, I mean, you can play with a number of players.

386
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,340
 There's a six player variant.

387
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,700
 The board looks a bit like a snowflake, but the eight player variant,

388
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,700
 I think would give everyone gets very sensitive in that game.

389
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,140
 Yeah, no one wins.

390
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,340
 It's just a tie at the end, regardless.

391
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:08,180
 So the eight player variant has 240 pieces.

392
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:14,180
 It has pieces, including the king, the marshal, the colonel, the captain,

393
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,660
 the chancellor, the herald, the chaplain, the knight, the courier,

394
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,660
 the adjutant, bodyguards, halbadiers, and there are private soldiers

395
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,260
 and 240 pieces in total.

396
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,420
 But that is nothing.

397
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,060
 The Duke of Rutland's chess variant has the concubine,

398
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,180
 which is a rook night mix, and even that pales into insignificance

399
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,620
 compared to the game that was developed by Johann Christian Ludwig Helwig.

400
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,660
 He was alive in the late 1700s, early 1800s.

401
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,180
 He he was a successful academic.

402
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:49,380
 He taught maths to Gauss, the most brilliant mathematician of all time.

403
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,660
 Actually, in fairness, he sort of said to Gauss, to be honest,

404
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,860
 you don't need to bother turning up to the lectures because he seemed to have it all sorted.

405
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,100
 He collected he collected so many insects,

406
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,060
 it formed the the heart of the University of Berlin's museum of entomology.

407
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,020
 And and his chess variant, which is called Creekspiel, which means war game,

408
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,940
 it includes the elephant, which is a rook night combo.

409
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,180
 The jumping bishop, which is a bishop night, the jumping queen,

410
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,380
 not to be confused with the dancing queen of Aberfeen, that's a night queen.

411
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,740
 It contains 40 pawns, four rooks, four bishops, 30 knights,

412
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,740
 work on that one in Amaritsa, six queens, five jumping queens,

413
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,340
 eight jumping bishops and seven elephants and the borders up to 2000 squares.

414
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,860
 So what does the partridge in the poetry make?

415
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,580
 That's the that's the hardest to carve, actually, the partridge.

416
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,100
 That is absolutely amazing.

417
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,500
 Do you think he invented this amazingly complicated chess game

418
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,660
 because his main job was teaching Gauss how to do maths?

419
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,660
 And he's like, I have so much spare time now.

420
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,220
 I might as well collect every single insect in the world.

421
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,060
 And I mean, they must take forever a game.

422
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,220
 I think it does.

423
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,540
 I mean, I suppose it's before TV, wasn't it?

424
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,420
 But it feels like there's no need to make chess more complicated.

425
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,660
 It's already quite challenging for most people.

426
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,860
 So there was this movement to make chess more like actual war,

427
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,100
 because chess is quite stylized, really.

428
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,460
 I mean, it's you're not going to learn that much about military tactics from playing chess.

429
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,260
 So in I mean, this is a Prussian thing.

430
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,780
 They're trying to teach their young officers how to make decisions on the battlefield.

431
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,020
 And so there's this tendency towards more and more complex versions of chess.

432
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,220
 And in the end, they kind of went to these war games or role playing games.

433
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,060
 But you've got different pieces.

434
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,100
 You've got you've got different terrains.

435
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,660
 And and they're trying to train people how to make military decisions.

436
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,380
 It's good. It's really I think it's really good because I do think that,

437
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,940
 you know, war game exercises are like they are good up to a point,

438
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,580
 but they're never enough concubines.

439
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,380
 It just it's not realistic without the concubines or elephants.

440
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,020
 It's the elephants and concubines that really make a war.

441
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,740
 Yeah, I thought Chancellor was a weird one as well.

442
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,980
 What does he like?

443
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,020
 He just does some photo option that takes 20 percent of all your money.

444
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:08,300
 Well, the thing is about chess didn't used to be military at all.

445
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,940
 So and I don't think it should be. It used to be sexy.

446
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,940
 This it was this was back and actually the person who ruined it

447
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,420
 and turned it into a military game initially was the queen.

448
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,140
 Sadly, as we've talked before about how the queen was introduced

449
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,700
 at various moments in history in various different countries

450
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,980
 from about like fourteen hundred onwards, thirteen hundred onwards.

451
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,220
 But instead of a queen before that, you had the Vizier as in the royal as in Jafar.

452
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,340
 And the Vizier couldn't move as broadly and widely as the queen

453
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,300
 was much more limited and it made chess a much slower game.

454
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,020
 And so I was reading that back in medieval times,

455
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,420
 it was a completely gender equal game.

456
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,140
 Women and men played at equal amount.

457
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,140
 And it was more a thing you'd have and play throughout a day

458
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,700
 at a or a soiree of a drinks and chats.

459
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,620
 And it became really associated with romance and sex.

460
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,620
 And because there were lots of stories of people falling in love over a game of chess,

461
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,700
 you know, opponents would fall in love in in fourteen hundred.

462
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,820
 There was a famous book at the time called The Edifying Book of Erotic Chess,

463
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,580
 which sort of talked about that.

464
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,380
 Yeah, is that is that why we call it Pond?

465
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,180
 Yeah, that's correct.

466
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,580
 That's why they're all naked if you look closely at the pawns.

467
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,260
 But yeah, then the queen came on board

468
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,820
 and it became very martial and competitive and serious.

469
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,140
 And it was thought to be unsuitable for women.

470
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,900
 Do you know the rules, the ten rules of whittling?

471
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,260
 Have you memorized those, everyone?

472
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,420
 I've only got the first four. Sorry.

473
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,700
 Oh, you know, 40 percent. It's it's just about a pass.

474
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,700
 This is according to Master Carver, Chris Loopcoman,

475
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:46,660
 who actually has the Guinness World Record for what he describes

476
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,500
 as the smallest rooster in the world on his YouTube channel.

477
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,900
 What's another word for rooster?

478
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,660
 I think of any because I'm pretty sure I have that record.

479
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,780
 I wonder why I had to be over 18 to access that video.

480
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,420
 It's it's not the smallest rooster.

481
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,100
 It's not even a thing.

482
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,740
 It's the smallest wooden carved thing in the world, according to Guinness.

483
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,900
 It's a tiny little rooster, an eighth of an inch tall.

484
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,980
 Anyway, he's an amazing whittler.

485
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,100
 His ten rules is rule number one is actually make sure your knife is sharp.

486
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,260
 A rule number two, any guesses?

487
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,700
 Don't run with scissors.

488
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,820
 You're you're actually close.

489
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,140
 It's your knife must be really sharp.

490
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,580
 It's rule number two. Oh, what?

491
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,620
 Anna, is this Fight Club?

492
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:37,220
 Could I just check out the other eight rules also to do with sharp knives?

493
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,660
 I'm so I'm so glad that you've saved me having to read all of the other rules.

494
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,660
 They're all different ways of saying before starting to carve.

495
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,140
 Check to see if your knife is sharp.

496
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,820
 If your knife is really sharp, it'll cut much better.

497
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,260
 Rule number ten is refer back to rules one to nine,

498
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,660
 which are indeed different ways of saying have a sharp knife.

499
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,700
 Very good. So whittlers out there, take note.

500
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,100
 Modern board games often have these little carved wooden pieces.

501
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,940
 They're quite simple.

502
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,860
 They look a little bit like if you carved the the sign for the gents toilets,

503
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,700
 the little man, if you carved those into wood and painted them different colors.

504
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,540
 That's what they look like.

505
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,100
 Does anybody know what they're called?

506
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,260
 There was there was a there was a term of art for these things.

507
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,860
 Wait for what for modern chess pieces?

508
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,940
 Well, modern board game pieces, not chess pieces, just board games in general.

509
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,260
 I didn't even know what they were, but no, gone.

510
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,340
 They're called Meeples, which is which is a sort of shortening of my people.

511
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,260
 And so the so Meeples is a board game thing.

512
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,660
 And there are, you know, their cafes based on Meeples and Meeple's clubs and so on.

513
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,740
 But I think they're like tiny, tiny cafes that Meeples attend.

514
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,820
 Yeah, but this one I'm speaking to you from Oxford.

515
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:47,700
 And there's there's a cafe about two minutes walk away from me called Thirsty Meeples.

516
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,140
 And you can go you can have your hot chocolate or a cup of coffee.

517
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,300
 Then you can play board games surrounded by my by Meeples.

518
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:58,420
 But I I reckon this whole this whole kind of chess piece carving thing.

519
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:01,500
 It's basically a conspiracy by Big Meeple.

520
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,740
 Because there is.

521
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,300
 Wait, hang on, Tim, Tim, Tim, Big Meeples are just people, aren't they?

522
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,380
 You could be right.

523
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,100
 You're absolutely right. You've caught me there.

524
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,380
 Anyway, it's a conspiracy.

525
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,620
 I'll figure out who's behind it sooner or later, because there's a problem

526
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,220
 with a lot of games that if you're trying to make money selling the game,

527
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,020
 the game is actually quite cheap.

528
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,780
 And you buy a game like chess, it just cost a few pounds.

529
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,660
 And then you could just play forever.

530
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,740
 So how do you make money?

531
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:35,020
 And so there's this increased focus on getting very, very fancy pieces,

532
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,180
 very expensive pieces.

533
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,620
 So these guys in Amritsar, this is an example of this.

534
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,100
 But I think the the most striking example is Games Workshop.

535
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,460
 So Games Workshop is this company that I remember from the 1980s,

536
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,540
 when I was a young nerd used to sell Dungeons and Dragons

537
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,260
 and used to sell all kinds of games.

538
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,180
 And then they basically got taken over by a division of the inside the company

539
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,540
 called Citadel Miniatures, which just made toy soldiers and toy and miniature figures.

540
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,060
 And these miniature figures were so profitable that during lockdown,

541
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,580
 Games Workshop had a higher profit margin than Google.

542
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,220
 And Henry Cavill, the actor who plays Superman,

543
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,380
 described these these little miniature figures as plastic crack

544
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,700
 so that all the money is in the pieces, the money is not in the games.

545
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,100
 That's true. I mean, I used to collect those pieces.

546
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,540
 And there were some which were simply unaffordable for me with my 14 year old's budget.

547
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,660
 Really? I used to have I used to collect them a little bit, not much.

548
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,900
 But I was always really scared that I was going to die of lead poisoning

549
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,580
 because there was lead in them.

550
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,940
 And I don't know, someone had once told me that you could die of lead poisoning

551
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,540
 and these pieces had lead in them.

552
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,860
 And I was just I was convinced that I was going to die.

553
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,540
 No, I think you're eating them.

554
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,620
 No, but I was like because I was painting them and stuff

555
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,140
 and I didn't want to lick my fingers and stuff.

556
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,020
 And you're closing your huff huffing away, you know, huffing away a little.

557
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,220
 Paints used to be water based.

558
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,500
 Well, the paints still are water based.

559
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,860
 So you could you'd sort of paint and then you'd kind of lick your paintbrush

560
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,060
 to get a fine point on the paintbrush and the paint is non-toxic.

561
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,260
 But the but you're painting these lead figures.

562
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,420
 So they probably were very dangerous.

563
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
 But anyway, they're all they're all made of plastic crack.

564
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,900
 Now, as as as Henry Cavill puts it.

565
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,180
 You're a bunch of crackheads.

566
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,100
 It's the least cool kind of being a crackhead.

567
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,500
 And being a crackhead isn't cool.

568
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,980
 I want to emphasize, but this is even less cool.

569
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,140
 It's so annoying when people tell you that it's like just like you were saying,

570
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,140
 James, with the the lead and the paint and the danger thing.

571
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,460
 Well, I always remember my friend Christopher when I was about, I don't know,

572
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,660
 18, telling me that if I kept drawing on my hand, I'd die.

573
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,500
 Yeah, because the ink would get into my bloodstream somehow.

574
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,460
 And I just wanted to say a big old fuck you to Christopher writing notes

575
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,860
 on my hand since then. And I'm as fit as a fiddle.

576
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,780
 Yeah, I don't know.

577
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,060
 I think that explains something about it could be like a conceal.

578
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,620
 It could be a John Crandon thing.

579
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,780
 It could be just a matter of time.

580
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,900
 You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

581
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,860
 And then suddenly he's actually dropped dead.

582
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,380
 Here's one thing on people who carve wood for a living.

583
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,180
 Oh, yeah. You guys, I'm sure, have heard of Grindling Gibbons.

584
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,460
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Who hasn't?

585
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,620
 But just for anyone who's.

586
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,100
 It's a horrible thing you do to great apes, isn't it?

587
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,580
 You've been outlawed in most places.

588
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,060
 It's such a weird name. You're right.

589
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,820
 I think it was Dutch.

590
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,580
 It was basically the most famous woodcarver in history.

591
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,460
 And I know that he's quite an obscure figure now.

592
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,540
 But in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, he was catnip.

593
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,500
 He's all over the UK, because he worked in England mostly.

594
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,140
 There are these incredible woodcarvings.

595
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,860
 I've seen some of them and they're amazing.

596
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,100
 As in he could he could do the fuzz on a peach, but carved in wood, you know?

597
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,220
 Wow, really?

598
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,180
 He's called the Michelangelo of Wood by some people, by some people.

599
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:46,180
 And yeah, why his mum?

600
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,980
 He lives with. Anyway, one of his crowning.

601
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,260
 It was really, he was extremely famous.

602
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,620
 I mean, it's not fair. Why would somebody who whittles be regarded

603
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,180
 as less admirable than someone like Michelangelo who works in stone?

604
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
 It doesn't make. Exactly, exactly.

605
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,380
 Get this, could Michelangelo do this?

606
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,820
 I bet he couldn't. In 1690, he made a wooden cravat.

607
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,220
 I have a wooden bow tie.

608
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,220
 It's completely different.

609
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,300
 Is it?

610
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,180
 He really deflated Andy there.

611
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,740
 The bow tie is designed to be stiff.

612
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,980
 You could any any any chump can make a bow tie out of wood.

613
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,060
 Just two two cross bits of wood.

614
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:29,100
 They like to get the fine the cravat, the most flowing of all ice.

615
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,580
 I quite like I quite like how you just accepted that I have a wooden bow tie.

616
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,220
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

617
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,220
 Sorry, there's a there's a much better point.

618
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,620
 What I just went to the place in Portugal where all the cork trees are

619
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,500
 and they sell a lot of merch and one of them is a bow tie.

620
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,340
 And I thought it'd be really cool, but I've never found the outfits.

621
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,660
 I go with it. I must admit.

622
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,220
 It's so weird, so weird.

623
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,540
 You need the full wooden suit to go with it, didn't you, really?

624
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,860
 Well, James, if you tell you what, if you if you stand next to a donkey

625
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:58,500
 and you put on your wooden bow tie and you make it rotate,

626
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,660
 Anna will think you're a desert island.

627
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:07,900
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

628
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,220
 And that is my fact.

629
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,660
 My fact this week is that in Ecuador,

630
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,620
 cleaners are people who rub you down with stinging nettles.

631
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:20,820
 And it's not as people pay for this service.

632
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,540
 Yeah, people.

633
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,620
 I think people pay maybe even more than cleaners in the UK,

634
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,340
 which is not even more than cleaners in the UK.

635
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,180
 The highest paid bracket in the country.

636
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,940
 It's not possible, Anna.

637
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,260
 It's a travesty and you'll spin off podcasts.

638
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
 Our cleaners paid too much.

639
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,340
 I wish you all the best.

640
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,420
 But these are Olympiadores in Ecuador and they are spiritual cleaners.

641
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,380
 But Olympiadores just means a cleaner, like it's just the word for a cleaner.

642
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,420
 But these are people who sort of cleanse your aura.

643
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:55,260
 And it's a deep rooted tradition in traditional cultures,

644
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,540
 particularly up in the mountains.

645
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:01,260
 A lot of people have this service and it's you're rubbed up and down

646
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,060
 with stinging nettles and it removes all your bad energy and bad luck.

647
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,980
 And it hurts quite a lot.

648
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,860
 And that just shows that it's working, apparently.

649
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,620
 Is it like cleaners in the UK where they come around?

650
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,420
 They sort of do an initial site visit of your aura and they say,

651
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,940
 well, this aura probably is going to need about a couple of hours a week.

652
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:24,700
 I'd say maybe two visits, actually, because it's prone to become disgusting quite fast.

653
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,420
 Yeah. Is it like cleaners in the UK where when they whip you with nettles,

654
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,740
 they sometimes miss the corners?

655
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,580
 Yeah. And you're too embarrassed to say anything about it

656
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,100
 because you don't you don't want to make a fuss.

657
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,180
 But so I just whip my own corners.

658
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,700
 Anyone else got any complaints about their cleaners?

659
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,580
 It's very first world problems little interaction we're having now.

660
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,700
 No. OK.

661
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,780
 So I think with these guys, they they're professionals.

662
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,140
 The best ones, they don't miss any spots.

663
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,900
 And in fact, they have an extra service where if you're actually ill

664
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,820
 and you go to, again, Olympia service, then they have a diagnostic tool

665
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:09,220
 first where you get rubbed with an egg and a dead black guinea pig.

666
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,020
 And that. Did it die of scurvy?

667
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,940
 Yeah. What?

668
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,340
 Egg and a dead black guinea pig.

669
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,780
 Yeah. And somehow that diagnoses the problem.

670
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,420
 Then you sort of inspect the egg is weird.

671
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,340
 Obviously, the guinea pig makes no sense.

672
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:29,500
 So this nettle stuff might have could it have helped like nettles?

673
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,060
 Are they good for you or not?

674
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,140
 I don't not not in this way.

675
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:37,940
 It's just a it's a traditional herbal treatment, very popular.

676
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,260
 And it's but it is still used quite widely.

677
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,100
 So even in hospitals in the big cities in Ecuador, apparently, doctors

678
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,300
 will let these limpia doris work alongside them.

679
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,820
 And, you know, so the doctors will give the conventional treatment

680
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,700
 and then will accept that the patient will also ask for a rub down with the nettles.

681
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,860
 I think it is good for you. I think a little bit.

682
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,460
 Yeah, I read something in a few rubbed nettles onto an arthritic thumb.

683
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,100
 The nettles will sting you, but you may get some relief from the arthritis.

684
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,660
 There are quite a lot of claims.

685
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,340
 Yeah, is is that I don't know how much has been scientifically proven,

686
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,860
 but that's not to say it doesn't work.

687
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,580
 There was a person who died of nettle stings.

688
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,380
 I found one. Right.

689
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,420
 This was a tree nettle in New Zealand called Ertica ferrox.

690
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,020
 Ertica is like the family of nettles.

691
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,420
 And apparently there was a lightly clad hunter

692
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,140
 who died five hours after walking through a dense patch of nettles.

693
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,220
 We don't really know what happened to him.

694
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,980
 Apart from that, I guess it could be anaphylaxis.

695
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,180
 You can get that through nettles.

696
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,140
 But yeah, and apparently this nettle in New Zealand, according to Maori folklore,

697
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:45,100
 one of their kind of gods, Kupe, kind of used them to hinder pursuers

698
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,020
 when he stole their wives so he would steal their wives.

699
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,460
 He would run away and he would throw down nettles

700
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,100
 so that people couldn't follow him.

701
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,300
 I'm feeling more guilty about something I did at primary school.

702
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,580
 I've actually never confessed this to anybody, but just between the four of us.

703
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,340
 So a friend of mine, I've got very vague memories of this,

704
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,180
 but a friend of mine and I decided that for some reason

705
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,780
 we were going to set a nettle trap, which I now realise could have been fatal.

706
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,900
 And this nettle trap involves we've got some nettles

707
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,220
 and we just put them somewhere on the playground where somebody might find them.

708
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,540
 And then and then I think my friend said, oh, they only sting you on the edge.

709
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,260
 I don't know if that's true or not.

710
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,500
 And we thought, but maybe people won't.

711
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,820
 I don't know why we thought this is a good idea.

712
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,820
 But we thought maybe people won't pick up the nettles and they won't be stung.

713
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,620
 So we then letter, we wrote a little note that said, please touch these leaves.

714
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,460
 And then then my friend is like, but they only sting on the edge.

715
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,380
 So then we added, please touch these leaves on the edge.

716
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,180
 I don't know if there were any fatalities, but I'm burdened by guilt.

717
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,660
 What a genius ruse, master criminal.

718
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,020
 I assume it's just no fell for it.

719
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,260
 Yeah, there's just no trick there, is there really?

720
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,940
 It's like you're not trying to disguise them as anything or anything like that.

721
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,060
 It's like literally straight on the nose.

722
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,620
 Please injure yourself with our trap.

723
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,340
 Put a hand in Mousetrap.

724
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,100
 Oh, I love that.

725
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:07,620
 You I'm sure I'm sure in the course of your research,

726
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:10,100
 you guys came across the world nettle eating championships.

727
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,980
 No. Oh, it sounds really crazy.

728
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,780
 Well, they happen in they happen in Dorset.

729
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,980
 Of course, very near Bridport, which we've mentioned before on the podcast,

730
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,220
 has the world's only thatched brewery.

731
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,420
 But we don't there's no time to rake over that old boom.

732
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,660
 So it's basically happened at a pub called The Bottle Inn until 2019.

733
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,260
 But the pub's been closed lots on and off.

734
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,220
 But it is happening this year.

735
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,660
 It's moving to a farm nearby.

736
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,820
 And the competition is because of nettle based fatalities

737
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,460
 shot down by health and safety at this point.

738
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,380
 So the the farm is taking it over, taking the reins this year, which is great.

739
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,220
 And the the measure is by length.

740
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,500
 That's how you measure whether you're successful at eating nettles or not.

741
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,780
 Is how long in feet?

742
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,340
 Time. Oh, no, as in literally got it.

743
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,340
 How yeah, how many how many feet of now do you can eat?

744
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:03,220
 So that and so it's the length of stalk that is that remains

745
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,060
 after you've stripped all the little nettle leaves off it and eat.

746
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,900
 Well, do you work your way down like a the side of a road

747
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:13,500
 and just eat as many?

748
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,180
 It's I understand it's the stalk because I understand it was originally

749
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,380
 two farmers got into an argument about who had the biggest nettles.

750
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,260
 And it was and they said, if you can grow a longer nettle

751
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,580
 than I've got growing on my farm, I'll eat it.

752
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,700
 Yeah. And so I think the idea is you strip the leaves off.

753
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,100
 And then you it's the stalk that remains is your measure of nettle.

754
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,020
 It's I think that I think that argument was about more than I think

755
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,860
 that was about the length of the farmer's roosters.

756
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:43,420
 I mean, when I when I encountered this, I thought, oh, yeah,

757
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,300
 can be competitive nettle eating, it's crazy.

758
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,140
 But it's like, you know, the competitive chili eating

759
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,860
 or the competitive hot dog eating or so on.

760
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
 So it's like, oh, how many can you eat in one minute?

761
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,540
 Or how many can you eat in three minutes?

762
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:59,700
 But no, it's how many can you eat in an hour to spend an hour eating nettles?

763
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,780
 And it's too long.

764
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,700
 It doesn't count if you don't keep the nettles down.

765
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:07,500
 And there was one guy a few years ago who was way ahead.

766
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,540
 And at 57 minutes, he went to just threw up in the pub car park

767
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:13,780
 and he was disqualified. Can you imagine?

768
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,300
 It's the winner, the all time record winner is called Philip Thorn.

769
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,020
 Now, nettles don't have thorns, admittedly, but it's quite close.

770
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,220
 His record 104 feet.

771
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,260
 So impressive, which is long.

772
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,860
 Do you know what I find most amazing about that is what it says

773
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:35,220
 about the human capacity to improve?

774
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,580
 Because about 10 years before he got the record, which was in 2018,

775
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,980
 the winner of the same competition, eight 48 feet of nettles.

776
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,140
 Now, in just a decade, Phil Thorn has more than doubled that.

777
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:51,900
 How have humans got so much better at nettle eating in the space of ten years?

778
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,300
 That's like if in ten years time, we can do the hundred meters in four and a half

779
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,180
 seconds, isn't it? Exactly.

780
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,860
 Yeah.

781
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,060
 Well, get Phil Thorn in the hundred meters.

782
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,500
 So there's nettles at the end at the finish line.

783
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,500
 You're not allowed to cook them, I guess, right?

784
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,340
 You just have to eat them raw.

785
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,500
 They're raw, freshly picked.

786
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
 Your tongue goes black from all the iron in them.

787
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,820
 It's painful, apparently, almost immediately.

788
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,860
 Within 20 seconds, it's very painful.

789
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,860
 And you then only got another 3,580 seconds to get through.

790
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,340
 That's horrific.

791
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,900
 I don't know how people do it.

792
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,260
 And you're not allowed to bring your own nettles and you're not allowed to bring

793
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,940
 any substances that might numb your mouth, although I'm sure some people have

794
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,780
 been tempted to try and smear Vaseline on.

795
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,300
 I don't know, because I just thought of a trick, but then I only thought of the trick

796
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,380
 after you told me the thing you're not allowed to do.

797
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,900
 So that's that's not going to work.

798
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,420
 But I think from memory in Hawaii, I think the nettles don't have stings on them.

799
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,900
 I think you turn you turn up wearing your lay with your with your

800
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,420
 sun hat on in your in your tropical shirt.

801
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
 Whatever you like.

802
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,460
 Just just just exeter, you know, I think I was smuggling some broccoli

803
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,300
 or something and say, oh, no, it's definitely nettles.

804
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,420
 I think that they might have evolved to have no sting

805
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,540
 because they don't have any animals that eat them or something.

806
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,540
 Oh, really? So they don't need to repel.

807
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,940
 That's amazing.

808
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:14,140
 What you can do at the nettle eating championships

809
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:18,060
 is drink, you can either drink water or you can drink beer.

810
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:22,420
 I don't know if it has to be beer sourced from a thatch brewery or not.

811
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,820
 It's going to be cider now that it's a cider farm.

812
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,940
 Cider is allowed.

813
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,500
 Cider is allowed because I think that would help go on.

814
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,060
 So one, in fact, as we're talking about incredible moments

815
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,260
 in the history of nettle eating in 2019, the women's winner,

816
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:39,620
 Lindy Rogers, I don't know why the competition is divided by sex.

817
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
 I have no idea.

818
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,340
 But there's a men's and a women's championship.

819
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,780
 The women's winner, Lindy Rogers, had an incredible

820
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:49,540
 Fosbury flop moment because she dipped her nettles inside her.

821
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:54,740
 Inside her or inside.

822
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,620
 I mean, first of all, that's disgusting.

823
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,100
 Second of all, I feel like it would hurt just as much.

824
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:02,900
 In apple cider.

825
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:05,220
 Oh, sorry. Exactly.

826
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,420
 And so that's that's a method that apparently helps to take

827
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,940
 take a bit of the sting out of it.

828
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,220
 That feels like a loophole.

829
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,540
 Because they've got to close that one.

830
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,580
 That should be a loophole, you know, it's all it's all loopholes.

831
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,900
 It's all loopholes on here on here.

832
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,380
 Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

833
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,700
 So the in the war in the First World War,

834
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,660
 the Germans were encouraged to collect nettles.

835
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:32,140
 Can you guess why, maybe ammunition shortage is really biting.

836
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,620
 We're just going to have to thrash the British with our nettle bundles.

837
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,660
 Were they planning to steal everybody's wives

838
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:41,460
 and then throw the nettles down to foil the pursuers?

839
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,420
 Very good.

840
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,500
 Just setting a nettle trap in the playground,

841
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,900
 taking literally a leaf out of Tim's book.

842
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,900
 Better touch and see here.

843
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,340
 No, it was to make uniforms.

844
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,940
 So you can take the stocks off nettles

845
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,180
 and you can make like kind of material with it.

846
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,100
 The month at university in Leicester

847
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,060
 have got a thing called the Sting Project

848
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,620
 and they've been trying to find things that you can do with nettles.

849
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,020
 And one of their team, a designer called Alex Deer,

850
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,140
 has invented underwear that's made from nettles.

851
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:18,060
 They made a pink camisole top and pants made from nettles.

852
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,220
 And according to Alex Deer, they said, it is quite a hairy fibre.

853
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,180
 So you probably wouldn't want all of your underwear made of it.

854
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:30,020
 But we are trying to make a point of what is possible with this plant.

855
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,020
 Wow.

856
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,220
 I don't want to dip them inside it, wouldn't you?

857
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,220
 Or have sex with someone who wears dockleaf pants.

858
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,820
 Oh, James, come on.

859
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,620
 You know, that's a myth.

860
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,380
 Don't propagate it for the kids.

861
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,620
 Some myths are nice, Anna.

862
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:46,380
 Some myths are nice.

863
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,220
 It's good.

864
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,260
 It takes your mind off the stinging agony

865
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,540
 when looking for a dockleaf.

866
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,260
 So I maintain there's a placebo effect.

867
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,940
 I go to the dockleaf eating championships

868
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:57,420
 and I got to say, my record is pretty strong.

869
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,060
 Have you guys heard of the Hornet ordeal?

870
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,140
 This is the El Gayo people in Kenya do this.

871
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,180
 This was an article by a guy called F.B.

872
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,180
 Wellborn, who underwent the initiation, who's Kenyan.

873
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,940
 And what it is, is that boys are forced to crawl

874
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:18,300
 through tunnels made of stinging nettles.

875
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,620
 And then once you get out of this tunnel of stinging nettles,

876
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,820
 then you have the nettles rubbed on your genitals.

877
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,300
 And then you have live Hornets dropped on your back.

878
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,100
 And the reason that they do all this is that the nettles are there

879
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,580
 to prepare you for the Hornets.

880
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,180
 So like the pain is to prepare you for the Hornet pain.

881
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,540
 And then the Hornet pain is there to prepare you

882
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,780
 for the circumcision that comes straight afterwards.

883
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,380
 Wow.

884
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,860
 I think the world nettle eating championship should should go for this.

885
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,820
 So after me and the nettles, then the Hornets.

886
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:52,180
 And then that would explain why there's a separate category

887
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:52,860
 for men and women.

888
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,940
 How is the circumcision contest judged?

889
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:55,940
 Is that by length?

890
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:56,940
 How's that working?

891
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:00,340
 I haven't worked out all the details yet.

892
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,780
 Wow, that sounds really horrible, James.

893
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,940
 Yeah, no, it is.

894
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,220
 It's the second. What is the circumcision prepare you for?

895
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,620
 Life as an animal.

896
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,260
 Oh, boy.

897
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,460
 Gets worse.

898
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,540
 Dealing with a bloody council.

899
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:26,300
 All right, it is time for our final fact, and that is Andy's fact.

900
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,660
 My fact this week is that the people of the remote island

901
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,580
 of St. Kilda used to yell if they saw themselves

902
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,540
 in a visiting tourist's mirror.

903
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,140
 They actually had plenty of mirrors.

904
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,940
 They just wanted to keep the tourists coming.

905
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:44,340
 So this is about the remote, very remote

906
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:45,900
 island of St. Kilda.

907
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,620
 And it features in a new book called Shadowlands by Matthew Green,

908
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,500
 which is about various forgotten, fascinating places.

909
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,260
 And St. Kilda had people on it for about a thousand years.

910
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,700
 They lived there until 1930.

911
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,460
 The island was evacuated in 1930.

912
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,180
 In the 19th century, they started getting visitors

913
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,300
 by ship Victorian tourists, not very many, because it's so far away.

914
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:08,700
 But they played up to it massively and they would do this thing.

915
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,740
 They would, you know, they would scream or pretend

916
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,220
 to be incredibly surprised if someone showed them a mirror.

917
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,420
 They would look behind the mirror saying, what, there's no one behind?

918
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:17,260
 What's going on?

919
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,780
 I mean, they were literally they were clean shaven.

920
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:21,460
 They had mirrors. They had shaved that morning.

921
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,140
 I read this was in an article by Neil McKenzie,

922
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,460
 who was the person who was kind of in charge.

923
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:30,500
 He was like the Reverend who kind of went there

924
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,140
 and he's kind of in charge of anything

925
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,220
 and helped the islanders for quite a long time.

926
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,580
 And he said they would pick up pieces of coal

927
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,340
 and affect surprise at not being able to eat them.

928
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,700
 And when they came in front of a looking glass,

929
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,940
 they would start and express great surprise

930
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,780
 at not being able to find the person who appeared behind it.

931
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,580
 It's so fun. It's like they really work out.

932
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:54,060
 Sometimes they would go on a border yacht, a visiting tourist yacht,

933
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,300
 and they pretended that they thought all the brass on it was gold.

934
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,540
 You've got all this gold.

935
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,580
 You must be the richest man in the world.

936
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,860
 And they knew they knew about brass.

937
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,020
 You know, they were hamming it up.

938
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,340
 Did it did it work?

939
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,660
 Were the tourists locking to St Kilda

940
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,820
 to see these people be amazed at their own reflection?

941
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,140
 Because it's hard to get to.

942
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:13,380
 I don't know if I take a holiday.

943
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,300
 Fucking it didn't become a major tourist economy,

944
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,820
 which is why the island economy fell apart.

945
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,580
 The place was evacuated in 1930,

946
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,860
 but they were doing their best to keep some money coming in.

947
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,820
 Yeah, apparently, according to McKenzie,

948
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,460
 they would all the time when they were doing this,

949
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:26,300
 they'd be talking to each other in Gaelic

950
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,380
 and they'd be saying, if we seem to be paying great attention

951
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,060
 and make them believe we are simple,

952
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,820
 they will be sure before they go away to give us something even better.

953
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,700
 Yeah, so they just did this

954
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,940
 and they thought if they kind of make them think we're stupid,

955
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,460
 then eventually we'll get some really awesome booty from them.

956
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,020
 Yeah, smart guys. Yeah.

957
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,660
 So so I'm trying to work out what they were what they were pretending to be.

958
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,700
 And so is it that they're pretending that they thought they were vampires

959
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,140
 and were surprised to realise that they weren't actually vampires?

960
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,820
 The mirror didn't.

961
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,460
 They were surprised. Oh, I thought I didn't leave a reflection in a mirror

962
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,740
 because I was a vampire, but I realised I'm human after all.

963
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,020
 That would surprise me. That's what it was.

964
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:06,860
 And that's actually why the island broke down. Everyone was scared off.

965
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,060
 One of my favourite short poems is by John Hegley.

966
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,980
 And it has the title, A Vampire Considered Buying a New Mirror.

967
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:19,380
 And the poem is simply on reflection.

968
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,500
 No, brilliant. Very nice.

969
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,140
 That's really good, isn't it?

970
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,580
 It's also a good one to be able to memorise back myself to remember that.

971
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,180
 For the school, like the citation competition.

972
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,540
 Yeah, yeah.

973
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,380
 I was trying to look it up.

974
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,980
 I saw it about 25 years ago and I was trying to look it up somewhere

975
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,260
 and I can't find it on the internet.

976
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,860
 And then I thought, you know, I can actually remember that joke.

977
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,220
 That's fine.

978
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,460
 It's been it's held fascination for people for hundreds of years,

979
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,940
 hasn't it, St Kilda? People have been visiting it.

980
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,620
 And it is it's over 100 miles off the coast of Scotland.

981
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,060
 And it's a rocky ride to get there.

982
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,740
 And it's quite unclear when people have lived there and when they haven't.

983
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:05,460
 But there was definitely a society established by the 16th century wasn't there.

984
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,180
 That's when we know that there was like a community of people

985
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:08,460
 who are living there successfully.

986
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,340
 So it's not like it's been populated forever.

987
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,540
 And then people have travelled there ever since.

988
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,220
 There was the first proper account of the islanders was written in 1698

989
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:21,900
 called A Late Voyage to St Kilda, which I still don't know what he meant by late.

990
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,260
 I don't know if he meant to go 10 years earlier and died about five years earlier.

991
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:30,980
 Anyway, this is a writer called Martin Martin.

992
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,180
 Brilliant. I actually I read his book.

993
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,260
 It's fascinating.

994
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:37,740
 One of the things he says is they're extremely good climbers.

995
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,620
 And so they they live by hunting the birds, mostly the island birds.

996
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,100
 So they'll climb up and then they'll catch the birds.

997
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,820
 And he described a particularly very high rock called the thumb,

998
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,900
 which was as high as a tall steeple.

999
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,940
 And he said that the only way that you could get to the top

1000
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,180
 of the thumb is by at one point you swing your entire body sort of up

1001
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,340
 onto a ledge by holding onto a protruding bit of rock,

1002
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:03,220
 which is only big enough to accommodate your thumb.

1003
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:03,940
 Oh, my God.

1004
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,020
 So you've got to get your whole body

1005
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:11,340
 bouncing on your thumb as you propel it up onto the next bit of rock.

1006
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,340
 Quite impressive.

1007
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,660
 And then the person who swung his way up there onto the thumb

1008
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,980
 gets drops of rope down and hoist the others up.

1009
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,580
 And then that person gets an extra four foul at the end of the day.

1010
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,820
 For his achievements in the birds, right?

1011
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:25,220
 Because that's what the people of St.

1012
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,900
 Kilda mostly lived off birds and stuff.

1013
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,660
 Yes, what birds and poo, of course.

1014
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:32,380
 So it's left hand big, why wouldn't they just leave the rope up?

1015
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,380
 It takes a lot of the fun out of it, isn't it?

1016
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,500
 It is such a fascinating place.

1017
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,460
 And it was unbelievably inhospitable.

1018
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:42,220
 And it's amazing that people managed to scratch out a living there at all.

1019
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,300
 So sometimes it would just rain for three weeks without stopping.

1020
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,580
 Not once. It just rained for three weeks on end.

1021
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:54,380
 I mean, in fairness, in Bolton or even in Manchester, I think I could survive.

1022
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,740
 All right. All right.

1023
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,460
 There was once a storm that was so fierce that everyone on the island

1024
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,180
 was left deaf for a week.

1025
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,460
 It's it was like I read that.

1026
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,060
 It's just not true. It can't be true.

1027
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,620
 Can it? It's not. I think it can.

1028
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,260
 I think it can.

1029
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,140
 It was so windy.

1030
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,940
 The island of sheep would sometimes just be blown over the cliffs.

1031
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:14,380
 I cannot. Yeah.

1032
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,740
 That is understandable.

1033
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,180
 But everyone on the island going deaf for a week, that doesn't make that.

1034
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,700
 Can't be true. It's just not a thing.

1035
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,620
 We should mention the amazing way that they used to communicate

1036
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:30,260
 with the mainland, the St Kildons, in the 19th century, which was via mailboats.

1037
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,620
 They didn't have a postal service until the early 20th century.

1038
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,620
 And so they would just get a letter, write it, pop it on a homemade mailboat,

1039
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,980
 like a hollowed out bit of wood with a little tin placed inside into which

1040
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:46,500
 they'd put their letter and then they'd burn onto the surface of this tiny boat.

1041
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,980
 The words please open and they'd inflate a sheep's bladder, attach it to the boat,

1042
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,220
 send it off and hope that it got to land somewhere.

1043
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,780
 And according to one report I read, two thirds of messages

1044
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,300
 reached their destination as in they'd reach a destination,

1045
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,700
 either the coast of Scotland or Scandinavia sometimes.

1046
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,620
 And then those people would open the message

1047
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,500
 and find the actual address inside and post it on.

1048
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,660
 It's very good.

1049
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,220
 It's roughly the same strike rate as the Royal Mail at the moment.

1050
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,660
 So yeah, that's really cool.

1051
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,940
 Pyrography, it's called when you burn words onto bits of wood.

1052
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,980
 It's kind of a subsection of whittling.

1053
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,900
 I don't know if you can across it in your whittling research.

1054
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,620
 It used to be a very male dominated area.

1055
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,140
 And then in the turn of the 20th century, there's a Melbourne architect

1056
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,300
 called Alfred Smart, who invented a new way of pyrography,

1057
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,540
 pyrographising a new type of pyrography.

1058
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:47,540
 And the way that he did that, he had a pencil with like some fuel attached to it.

1059
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:51,420
 And so you could use and you could change the amount of fuel that came in and out.

1060
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,340
 So you could start doing shading and stuff like that and do amazing patterns.

1061
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,700
 And then it became a kind of a relatively not very common,

1062
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:04,980
 but a relatively common hobby for women at the in the start of the 20th century.

1063
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:10,620
 And I was reading about someone called Joe Schwartz, who's a wood burner.

1064
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:14,900
 And she was the first person to ever teach wood burning in Antarctica.

1065
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:21,140
 I mean, it's it's right down on the list of survivability skills.

1066
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,340
 Especially in a continent with no trees.

1067
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,300
 But, you know, she's got a record.

1068
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,580
 So that's good being the second person.

1069
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,260
 Imagine going to Antarctica when I teach them wood burning.

1070
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,820
 What is that? Oh, not even the first one to do this.

1071
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:41,140
 You see the Schwartz panel being hung up over the tent nightmare.

1072
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,260
 Can I tell you one quick thing about the the evacuation of us at Kilda?

1073
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:44,940
 Yes, please.

1074
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,500
 Because when they because life got harder and harder

1075
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,140
 and a lot of able-bodied young men went to the mainland

1076
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:56,100
 and as it was largely a subsistence economy, so like hunting birds and farming sheep.

1077
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,580
 That was a big problem for the island's survival.

1078
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,740
 In fact, they got close to starving on several occasions.

1079
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,820
 And so in 1930, they they contacted the mainland and said,

1080
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,060
 look, we're going to tap out with this horrible, we don't like it.

1081
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,620
 We're all deaf.

1082
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,820
 They the government said, yeah, of course, we'll bring you over.

1083
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,300
 By that point, two thirds of the population

1084
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,300
 shared the same two surnames as in the diversity of families

1085
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,420
 had really been, you know, whittled down over the years.

1086
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:26,900
 And at the end of it, in 1930, they ceremonially closed down the post office.

1087
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,020
 I think it's amazing.

1088
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,420
 They held one final church service and they drowned their dogs off the pier.

1089
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,700
 Oh, my God. I don't know why.

1090
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,100
 I don't know why.

1091
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:36,860
 Oh, no.

1092
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,980
 They must have been sad.

1093
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,940
 That took such a horrible turn at the end of that sentence.

1094
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,860
 Really? Sorry.

1095
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:43,860
 They must have been guys.

1096
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:45,620
 There's room on the boat for the dogs.

1097
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,980
 But then when they got to the mainland,

1098
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,460
 the government arranged for most of the men to be given jobs in the Forestry Commission.

1099
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,860
 But unfortunately, most of them had never seen a tree

1100
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:56,060
 because there are no trees on Sir Kilda.

1101
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,660
 We're just chopping everything down, weren't they?

1102
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,220
 They'd chop down lampposts, tulips.

1103
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,380
 Well, presumably, they were going to get jobs at the RSPCA.

1104
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,700
 Hurriedly rearranged.

1105
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,980
 All right, that's it.

1106
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:13,020
 That's all of our facts.

1107
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,580
 Thank you so much, everybody, for listening.

1108
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,820
 Thanks so much, Tim, for coming on.

1109
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,700
 If you want to get in touch with any of us,

1110
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,260
 you can find these guys on Twitter, I believe.

1111
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,420
 James, you're on.

1112
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:24,340
 That's James Harkin.

1113
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:24,940
 Andy.

1114
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,860
 At Andrew Hunter M.

1115
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,260
 And Tim, have you fallen prey to the scourge that is Twitter?

1116
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,620
 I'm Tim Harford on Twitter, but I don't really pay any attention.

1117
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,780
 I think people should just listen to the Cautionary Tales podcast instead

1118
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,660
 and not tweet me.

1119
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,460
 Great. So if you want to be completely ignored,

1120
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,700
 then tweet @timharford.

1121
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,140
 But do definitely go and listen to his Cautionary Tales podcast.

1122
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,420
 It is brilliant.

1123
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,940
 And if you want to know anything more about this podcast,

1124
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,380
 no such thing as a fish, go to nosuchthingasafish.com,

00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,340
 We will see you again next week with another episode.

1129
