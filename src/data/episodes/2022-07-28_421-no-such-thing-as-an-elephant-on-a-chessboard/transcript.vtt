00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
 Hi everybody, just before we start this week's show, we want to let you know we have a very exciting guest on.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.560
 It's none other than the undercover economist himself, Tim Harford.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.160
 Tim Harford is a brilliant writer, thinker.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.120
 He makes books, he makes radio shows.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 He makes books. He's a bookmaker.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.620
 He's a book binder.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.120
 He makes, he turns trees into paper.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.120
 He's bound a million books.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.320
 It's so amazing.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.560
 You know, if you've heard of Messi or 50 things that made the modern economy or the undercover economist, all of these books, they're by him.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.840
 They are, and he's got a podcast called Cautionary Tales, which I would massively recommend.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.600
 I've just been listening to a bunch of them.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.440
 They are brilliant and true life stories, which teach you things about how humans behave.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 I've been listening to one about the mummy's curse.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.880
 There's an excellent one on Hansel and Gretel, which is really amazing.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.240
 And they often have a little twist at the end and really well told.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.880
 So check out that podcast.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.700
 But first of all, listen to this one.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.680
 On with the show.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.660
 On with the show.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:19.740
. Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, the weekly podcast coming to you this week from four top secret underground undisclosed locations.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:28.620
 My name is Anna Toshinsky, and I am sitting here today with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and our very special guest, Tim Harford.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:38.180
 And once again, we've gathered around our microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Tim.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:48.060
 My fact is that in 1939, a young doctor at Boston City Hospital went on a scurvy producing diet to see what would happen.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:58.260
 In May 1940, his fellow doctors staged an intervention after his skin started to bleed from his follicles and an old post-operative scar reopened.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.940
 Oh, no.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.980
 Lovely.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.420
 Why did because the people sort of knew what happened when he got scurvy at that point, right?

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.460
 Why? Why was he doing this?

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.900
 They did. So he survived, by the way.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.700
 So I read the medical paper that he and a colleague wrote after this experiment.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.580
 So the puzzle was, I mean, people had been suffering from scurvy.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.820
 And worrying about scurvy for hundreds of years and kind of discovering cures and then forgetting cures.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 It's all very fascinating.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.300
 But by the 1930s, they'd figured out that scurvy is caused by not having enough vitamin C.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.900
 But the puzzle was, if you deprive people of vitamin C, it very quickly leaves the body.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.340
 So after a week or so, you've got no vitamin C, but then everything's fine.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.380
 And people don't actually develop any symptoms for weeks or even months.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.500
 And so this guy, his name was John Crandon and his colleagues were just trying to figure out,

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.700
 well, how long can you go and what happens and what order do these terrible symptoms appear in?

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.900
 And he said, well, no one else is going to do it.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140
 So I'm going to do it. And so he did.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.500
 And yeah, he was absolutely fine for two or three months.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500
 And then I read the description of what happened.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.700
 He started on October the 19th, 1939.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.500
 His scurvy producing diet was actually his hands.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.740
 OK, it's eggs, cheese, bread, butter, chocolate and coffee gets a bit boring after a little bit.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.860
 But it's fine for a while.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.500
 Genuinely, that is my diet.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.380
 You can add some red wine in there.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.540
 And then that's basically it after we finish this.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.700
 You're really going to start wanting some orange juice to add to that, James, I think.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.260
 So he says he says after about four and a half months,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.580
 hyperkeratotic papules had developed on the buttocks.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.940
 Now, that doesn't sound good at all.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.780
 I was going to Google hyperkeratotic buttock papules and then I decided I wasn't going to do that.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.460
 Don't worry, Tim, I've been eating nothing but chocolate and bread for the last six months.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.300
 I can tell you exactly what they are.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.460
 Oh, please don't.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.860
 James has just taken his trousers down and shown us his buttocks.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.260
 And it is disgusting.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.940
 It's really I'm not going to be able to take that image out of my mind now.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.260
 And then after five months, he started just started bleeding around the hair follicles on his legs.

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.380
 He got incredibly tired.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.060
 He used to run on a treadmill and by the end of this, he could do 50 meters on a treadmill.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.700
 It took him 16 seconds to do 50 meters, which is not very fast.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.380
 And then that was too much.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.100
 And he was quite a young man.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.820
 And at six months, they made a surgical incision basically just to see whether it would heal.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.020
 And it didn't.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.900
 And I think they probably shouldn't have been surprised at that

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.980
 because he had a scar from a 15-year-old appendectomy that was reopening by this point.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.500
 And then they said, "All right, you've done enough.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.380
 You've done enough."

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.980
 And they started giving him intravenous vitamin C and he was fine.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.780
 That's so scientific to say, well, your old scar has reopened.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.900
 But just in case, we're going to have to make another scar

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.620
 and see if that also fails to heal.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.900
 Like, that's so impressive, the scientific method, I think.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.980
 Is it?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.060
 I think so.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.100
 I find that one of the most kind of morbid things about scurvy

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.180
 is the whole wounds reopening.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.660
 It takes you back in time, but in just a way that you really don't want to go back in time,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.860
 the idea that these ancient and bone breaks re-break, don't they?

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.940
 Because I think you start making collagen, which basically holds your body together.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.940
 And so, I don't know, the idea of all these ancient wounds

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.180
 you'd completely forgotten about reopening is pretty fine.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.380
 All your exes ring up and break up with you all over again.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.060
 It's another unknown symptom.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.540
 It's really mad that it's two or three months that you're fine for,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.900
 because I guess that explains why in the age of sale,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.060
 sailors got scurvy because it was just long enough to get really, really, really far away from the nearest lemon.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.980
 As in, if you've got it within a day of not having any vitamin C,

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.660
 then everyone would immediately come back to port and say, "Well, we die at sea, so we're not going to go."

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.700
 It's quite cool. It's almost like a lemon detector, isn't it?

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.940
 You can tell how far away you are from a lemon, just by how much blood is coming out of your paws.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.860
 Not very. You can only tell to within three months away.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.260
 I mean, it's not that accurate.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.420
 There are easier ways to detect lemons, and actually, it's...

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.060
 - Are there? - It's difficult.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.180
 The reason I got interested in this is because I discovered that

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.180
 Scott of the Antarctic suffered from scurvy.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.660
 It's controversial as to whether his final mission was affected by scurvy,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.300
 but certainly earlier missions were, and some of the people he went to

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.860
 who tried to get to the South Pole with were affected by scurvy.

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.020
 And I thought, "Hang on a minute. He's a British Navy captain."

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.540
 And didn't the British Navy figure all this out in 1747?

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.100
 James Lindes famously did this, the first ever randomized controlled trial, people say,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620
 and discovered that you could prevent scurvy with lemons.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.980
 And then they started calling British sailors limies because they used to have lime juice.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.220
 And so, what happened? How could the British Navy forget this?

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.020
 And it is partly because it's not a very good lemon detector.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.340
 It turns out there's vitamin C in almost everything.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.100
 You have to work quite hard.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.740
 I mean, James is doing this hard work.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.060
 You have to work quite hard to completely deprive yourself of vitamin C.

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.700
 So people get confused, so basically the signals get very mixed.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.060
 And what Andy was saying about these sea voyages,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.700
 another reason the British Navy started getting confused

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.500
 is because they switched to steamships.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.660
 And so they were still taking a remedy for scurvy that turns out wasn't working.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.100
 But because they were all on steamships, steamships travel quite quickly.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.620
 They have to refuel.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.180
 Every time you refuel, you take on fresh food.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.900
 And so they were sticking to this cure for scurvy they thought was working.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.820
 It wasn't working.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.420
 It didn't matter because there wasn't time for anybody to develop scurvy.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.540
 And then suddenly these Arctic and Antarctic explorers all started coming down with scurvy.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.140
 And everybody got monumentally confused at that point.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.460
 So the lemons and limes don't really work that well.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.660
 Is that what we're saying?

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.780
 So there's two things.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.820
 One is that limes, although they're more acidic, have less vitamin C in.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:01.860
 So they still work.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.460
 They used to be using Sicilian lemons and they're really juicy

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.620
 and got loads of vitamin C, and then they switched for geopolitical reasons

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.860
 to West Indian limes and that they're less effective.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.740
 But the other thing is vitamin C is destroyed really easily.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:17.580
 It's destroyed by contact with copper.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.900
 And a lot of these ships had copper vessels.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.100
 It's destroyed by contact with sunlight.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.780
 It's destroyed by heat.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.220
 And so you had this sort of old lime juice that was going a bit rancid.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.220
 And there wasn't any vitamin C in it anymore, but people were still taking it.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.220
 And so then when they started taking lime juice on Arctic expeditions and it didn't work,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.140
 they lost faith and they started there.

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.100
 And at the same time, there's germ theory being developed.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.780
 And they started going, oh, maybe scurvy is nothing to do with lemons and limes at all.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.540
 Maybe it's to do with some kind of germ that we can't see,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.620
 which of course was completely up the wrong tree.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.700
 It's just crazy when you read about the history of scurvy,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:58.300
 how early on they suggested that citrus was a cure and how many hundreds of years

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.540
 they skirt around it, skirt around it.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.900
 And sort of just like, yeah, I think it is.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.300
 And then go, actually, maybe not.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.780
 It's so frustrating because it's so easy to sort out once you definitely know.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.260
 But I found, you know, it's really quick.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.460
 You know, Scott, one of the people on his expeditions who got scurvy was Shackleton,

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.340
 which I didn't know that they did an expedition together.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.540
 But yeah, there was a bit of bad blood.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.540
 They didn't like each other.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.620
 It was quite a rivalry.

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:27.540
 Indeed, there seems to be a bit of a conspiracy theory that maybe Shackleton wasn't that ill

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.140
 and Scott sort of kicked him off the expedition because he wasn't really getting along with him.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.380
 Shackleton was like the fun, spontaneous one, wasn't he?

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.420
 And Scott was a bit more of a serious bore.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.500
 Really? So Scott said, oh, you're definitely, you're far too ill.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.540
 You've definitely got scurvy.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:45.340
 And Shackleton was like, well, I haven't even got any hyperkinetic papules.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.580
 The point where Shackleton pulled down his pants to display his buttocks.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.580
 Look at this.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.740
 And that's when he got chucked off the expedition.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.620
 And guinea pigs get scurvy.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.620
 Do they?

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.620
 Yeah.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:00.460
 Because they mean, if I eat guinea pig, then I would not get any vitamin C.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.420
 I think if you eat a healthy guinea pig, you'll be fine.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.420
 Because I know James did as well as the diet you eat.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.660
 I have eaten a guinea pig.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:14.420
 But you occasionally have guinea pig mints on your bread and with your coffee.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:19.820
 No, because they, they can't make their own vitamin C and that's, we can't do that either.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.980
 And we're all, there's this weird club of crap animals, including humans,

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.460
 which can't make their own vitamin C.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.340
 So it's fruit bats, guinea pigs, some of the apes and humans are the ones that can't do it.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.940
 Every other animal doesn't get scurvy because they can just generate vitamin C.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.060
 I guess from internally, somehow they're generating it.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.980
 Like, well, like we generate, you know, we basically, what a vitamin is,

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.300
 is the things that we need from our diet, because we can't generate them

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.660
 and everything else we can generate.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.380
 And I suppose these animals can.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.620
 But maybe we should form that club with those guys, like a really sad rejects club.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.260
 Like, what are those people?

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.620
 What's that club called of some men who've decided that they've abandoned women

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.620
 because women hate them in cells.

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.420
 This could be the new in cells.

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.020
 Us fruit bats, guinea pigs.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.820
 I'm just a bit worried the guinea pigs won't let me in

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.180
 because I've just admitted that I won't say some guinea pig.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.020
 It turned out to be really important.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:11.220
 So people were being confused, as Anna says, just getting confused about scurvy

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.460
 and what causes it and how to cure it for centuries.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.820
 And they keep sort of figuring it out and then not figuring it out

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.340
 and getting confused and forgetting.

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:24.180
 And then finally, in 1907, these two Norwegian scientists,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.460
 Holst and Fröhlich, figure out that guinea pigs also get scurvy,

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.820
 which is this absolute breakthrough moment.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.060
 And then once you can do that, how can you tell that a guinea pig has scurvy?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.140
 Is it because it can only run 50 meters on its little bowl?

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.420
 That must be it. That and the papules.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.260
 I think it's those two things.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:49.460
 Once they figured that out, it was it was easy to clear up this massive confusion

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.500
 about whether scurvy was caused by some kind of toxin or some kind of bacteria

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.620
 or whether it was a deficiency.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.860
 And they figured it all out.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:00.340
 And then they turned around and they told Fritschhoff Nansen,

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.580
 who's a great Norwegian polar explorer and a mentor to both Robert Scott

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.740
 and Rold Amundsen.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.260
 And Nansen said, yeah, no, I don't believe any of that.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.700
 You can't learn anything from guinea pigs.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.660
 Trust me, it's fresh seal meat you need.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.180
 And so he basically told them to bugger off

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.420
 and both Amundsen and Scott then went to the Antarctica gear later.

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:22.460
 And and Scott's whole crew probably got scurvy.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.180
 If there was ever a lesson to listen to the scientists, people,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:28.060
 it really is the history of scurvy.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.580
 It's wild how much people ignore them.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.340
 So the reason that this is all puzzling is because the the story

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.540
 that randomized controlled trials nerds tell is that in 1747,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.620
 this guy, James Lind, who was a surgeon on the HMS Salisbury,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.180
 figured it all out. That's the story they tell.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.100
 And and and he did sort of run a controlled trial.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.700
 He gave to had a whole bunch of sailors who had scurvy.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.300
 He gave two of them a quarter of cider a day.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.700
 Sounds quite nice, but it's not going to work.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:01.420
 He gave two of them 75 drops a day of sulfuric acid.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.420
 He gave two of them vinegar, gave two of them a paste of garlic,

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.140
 mustard, horseradish and aromatic plant extracts,

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.060
 which sounds like it might be nice.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.460
 But but none of that worked.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.180
 But he gave he gave the last two two oranges and a lemon

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.860
 each day for six days.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.020
 And at that point, they made a complete recovery.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.420
 Unfortunately, that was the ship's entire stock of lemons.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.860
 So it was unfortunate for everybody else.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.820
 But the weird thing is that even James Lind, I mean, you would have thought,

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.380
 OK, brilliant, you ran a randomized trial, you figured it all out.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.220
 Perfect. But then he published this book

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.820
 all about how to cure scurvy, which had this write up of this trial,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.500
 but had loads of other stuff about, oh, like, maybe it's excess sweating

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.900
 or maybe it's to do with ventilation or this or that.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.180
 It's the whole who who can say?

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.500
 I mean, it was bizarre what the conclusion he came to.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.460
 And in the end, he said, anyway, my cure for scurvy is

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.700
 lemon juice that's been boiled into a syrup preserved under olive oil.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.500
 And it turns out that doesn't work because if you boil lemon juice

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.340
 into a syrup, you've destroyed all the vitamin C.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.140
 So he runs this randomized trial.

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.620
 He doesn't understand what he's done.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.420
 And then the conclusion he draws is this completely ineffective remedy.

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.780
 And there you go. That's science 1747.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.980
 I just can't believe that one of the groups was given sulfuric acid,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.700
 which feels like, you know, you could literally give the other group

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.780
 American cheese and white bread and they're going to do better than the group

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.940
 you gave sulfuric acid to. Sure. Yes.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.620
 Throatless Jimmy, we call him.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.020
 Yeah.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.700
 I really like the the old theory about how to cure scurvy,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.420
 which was to bury yourself in soil.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.700
 And that was such a good idea.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.100
 It's such, you know, it really does make sense

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.300
 because you were getting scurvy when you were away from earth, right?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.620
 You were on the on the water, you were thousands of miles from 11.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.220
 You're going to get sick.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.540
 And so what was obviously the thing that you were missing?

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.100
 You were missing dry land.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.420
 And so they used to just bury people up to the neck in soil

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.260
 and think that this would make them better.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.940
 So funny. It's such a good idea.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.820
 And what they would do is they would take boxes of earth with them on the voyages.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:07.340
 And if someone got sick, they would bury them on the ship in the in the earth.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.300
 There was one captain called Thomas Melville, who found that it actually worked

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.540
 and it made people feel better.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.580
 But he was feeding people vegetables while they were in the earth all the time.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.980
 So probably the other thing, though,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.340
 it's so good because it means you can also, as well as getting vegetables,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.500
 you can disguise your ship as a small island.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.780
 And so you can sneak up on other ships undetected

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.260
 because they just see a load of soil.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.420
 Well, they see a load of soil, don't they? You know.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.940
 Yeah, clever. Get a donkey, a little windmill.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.220
 Palm tree, maybe?

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.700
 Yes, I'm just thinking my idea of like

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:49.180
 my idea of the islands is more like palm trees and hammocks, not donkeys and windmills.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.620
 A donkey and a windmill and a famous cartoon trope of someone on a desert island.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.220
 How can you tell they're on a desert island?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.100
 There's a donkey and a windmill.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.860
 Yeah, it's a classic.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:08.900
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.780
 OK, my fact this week is that there are more people alive today

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.180
 who have been world chess champion than there are people skillful enough

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.380
 to carve a knight for use in a world championship chess match.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.420
 Amazing. What are the numbers?

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.620
 What are we talking about?

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.020
 Well, the numbers are 10 who can do the night.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.100
 This is according to a video which I saw, which was posted by Business Insider

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.740
 called Why Championship Chess Sets Are So Expensive.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.700
 As part of that, they said there are only 10 people alive

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.340
 who can make the little horses that you use in chess.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.100
 And so I thought I wonder how that compares with people who have won the world

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.980
 championship and I went on to the on to Wikipedia and looked at the list

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.180
 of the people who are still alive and there's more than 10 as it doesn't.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.980
 I think how good do these things have to be?

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.820
 I mean, because I would have thought it's quite easy to carve a night.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.500
 Most professional whittlers, I know, which is a lot,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.380
 could probably do a passable chess night.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.660
 What's so special about these ones?

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:11.940
 Well, you you take all of the whittlers.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.940
 Some of them can do it.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.220
 Some of them can and you go down and down and down.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.220
 And eventually you get the 10.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.540
 Yeah, you got it, Andy. You can see what I'm going there.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.620
 No, they're made.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.660
 These nights are made in a place called Amritsar, which is in India.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.100
 Very specific factory makes them.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.500
 They only make two hundred and fifty per year.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.980
 One night to kind of whittle it down takes two hours.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.060
 And it takes five to six years to learn how to make this night.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.700
 All the other pieces take about four to five months to make.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:49.100
 And so if you were to buy a very, very high end chess set,

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.460
 the nights are worth approximately 50 percent of the entire set.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.660
 The value comes from just the nights.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.700
 That's what this is so funny.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.820
 It's about it's about five hundred dollars for one of these sets.

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:04.620
 They sound I think I read the same piece, James.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.620
 It says this that the the blocks of wood that they use for the pieces

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.380
 were once large trunks dried for three to six months,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.540
 cut down a shape to the necessary size, which does make it sound like they're

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.820
 using one large tree trunk.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.940
 Yeah. Knocked down a giant redwood for one pawn.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:28.700
 They are really beautiful to watch them being carved on the on the lathe.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.700
 And it's a little bit like watching pottery.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.380
 It's that kind of beautiful sort of hypnotic view of this thing taking shape.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.100
 But I have to say it's all nonsense, isn't it?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.300
 Because when this I saw this this short film and at one point they say,

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:46.900
 oh, yeah, it helps these grandmasters to not make any mistakes.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.700
 That's just nonsense.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.740
 Grandmasters, they can play blindfold.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:55.260
 I mean, you literally don't actually need the chessboard or the chess pieces.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.300
 They can play blindfold. What is this?

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.380
 I don't know what you're talking about.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.060
 The video I've I've drunk the cool aid and I believe this.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.420
 It's they say that because if you don't make the chess pieces properly

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:11.300
 and the king isn't the tallest piece, then you might accidentally move

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:14.460
 one of the other pawns, maybe thinking it's the king.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:18.060
 Or if they're not weighted correctly, they might fall over

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.020
 and you accidentally kind of resign.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:22.500
 You're OK. OK, OK, it's not. No, no, no, no, it's true.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.420
 No, the thing about chess players is that they're very stupid people.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:32.060
 James, that falling over thing I read that, too, is that

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.180
 if you accidentally knock your piece over and then you press, you know,

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.340
 because they're playing timed against each other in some matches.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:40.500
 So you you knock a piece over and then you press the timer

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.860
 to move it onto your opponent's turn and then you pick your piece back up.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.860
 You can be disqualified from the whole match

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.060
 because you're technically eating into your opponent's time there.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.420
 And that has happened recently.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.980
 There was a game in 2016 where a grandmaster,

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.580
 very good chess player, lost because he dropped his queen and then did that.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.900
 Really? And we we we're claiming that these these 10 people

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.020
 who can make the night are the only people who can make a night

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.300
 that can successfully stand up if you can't.

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.740
 If you can't feel the bridle on the night is positioned correctly,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.100
 it'll completely throw off your game.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:12.540
 That's why Casparov lost against Deep Blue.

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.900
 So there's a slight discrepancy in the reins.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.660
 I want to see the chess grandmasters rant when he like sort of a tennis player

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.140
 with a broken racket when he seizes a night waving at the umpire.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.060
 What the hell is this shit?

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:30.260
 I would love to see these artisans, these craftspeople from Amritsar.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:35.140
 I would love to see them wrestle with a classic Prussian

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.700
 wargame chess crossovers because there are some amazing kind of chess

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.460
 mutations from a few hundred years ago that I think would pose a real challenge.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:49.420
 So any of you have heard of Gross's Konigspiel, which is a 1664 chess variant?

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.660
 Well, I mean, you can play with a number of players.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.340
 There's a six player variant.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.700
 The board looks a bit like a snowflake, but the eight player variant,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.700
 I think would give everyone gets very sensitive in that game.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.140
 Yeah, no one wins.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.340
 It's just a tie at the end, regardless.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.180
 So the eight player variant has 240 pieces.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:14.180
 It has pieces, including the king, the marshal, the colonel, the captain,

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.660
 the chancellor, the herald, the chaplain, the knight, the courier,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:23.660
 the adjutant, bodyguards, halbadiers, and there are private soldiers

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.260
 and 240 pieces in total.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.420
 But that is nothing.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:31.060
 The Duke of Rutland's chess variant has the concubine,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:35.180
 which is a rook night mix, and even that pales into insignificance

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.620
 compared to the game that was developed by Johann Christian Ludwig Helwig.

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.660
 He was alive in the late 1700s, early 1800s.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.180
 He he was a successful academic.

00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:49.380
 He taught maths to Gauss, the most brilliant mathematician of all time.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:51.660
 Actually, in fairness, he sort of said to Gauss, to be honest,

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.860
 you don't need to bother turning up to the lectures because he seemed to have it all sorted.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.100
 He collected he collected so many insects,

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:04.060
 it formed the the heart of the University of Berlin's museum of entomology.

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.020
 And and his chess variant, which is called Creekspiel, which means war game,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.940
 it includes the elephant, which is a rook night combo.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.180
 The jumping bishop, which is a bishop night, the jumping queen,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.380
 not to be confused with the dancing queen of Aberfeen, that's a night queen.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:24.740
 It contains 40 pawns, four rooks, four bishops, 30 knights,

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.740
 work on that one in Amaritsa, six queens, five jumping queens,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:33.340
 eight jumping bishops and seven elephants and the borders up to 2000 squares.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:35.860
 So what does the partridge in the poetry make?

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.580
 That's the that's the hardest to carve, actually, the partridge.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.100
 That is absolutely amazing.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.500
 Do you think he invented this amazingly complicated chess game

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.660
 because his main job was teaching Gauss how to do maths?

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.660
 And he's like, I have so much spare time now.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.220
 I might as well collect every single insect in the world.

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:58.060
 And I mean, they must take forever a game.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.220
 I think it does.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.540
 I mean, I suppose it's before TV, wasn't it?

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.420
 But it feels like there's no need to make chess more complicated.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.660
 It's already quite challenging for most people.

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.860
 So there was this movement to make chess more like actual war,

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.100
 because chess is quite stylized, really.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.460
 I mean, it's you're not going to learn that much about military tactics from playing chess.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.260
 So in I mean, this is a Prussian thing.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.780
 They're trying to teach their young officers how to make decisions on the battlefield.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:30.020
 And so there's this tendency towards more and more complex versions of chess.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.220
 And in the end, they kind of went to these war games or role playing games.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.060
 But you've got different pieces.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.100
 You've got you've got different terrains.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.660
 And and they're trying to train people how to make military decisions.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:42.380
 It's good. It's really I think it's really good because I do think that,

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.940
 you know, war game exercises are like they are good up to a point,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.580
 but they're never enough concubines.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.380
 It just it's not realistic without the concubines or elephants.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.020
 It's the elephants and concubines that really make a war.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:57.740
 Yeah, I thought Chancellor was a weird one as well.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.980
 What does he like?

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.020
 He just does some photo option that takes 20 percent of all your money.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:08.300
 Well, the thing is about chess didn't used to be military at all.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.940
 So and I don't think it should be. It used to be sexy.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:15.940
 This it was this was back and actually the person who ruined it

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.420
 and turned it into a military game initially was the queen.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.140
 Sadly, as we've talked before about how the queen was introduced

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.700
 at various moments in history in various different countries

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.980
 from about like fourteen hundred onwards, thirteen hundred onwards.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.220
 But instead of a queen before that, you had the Vizier as in the royal as in Jafar.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:38.340
 And the Vizier couldn't move as broadly and widely as the queen

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.300
 was much more limited and it made chess a much slower game.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.020
 And so I was reading that back in medieval times,

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.420
 it was a completely gender equal game.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.140
 Women and men played at equal amount.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.140
 And it was more a thing you'd have and play throughout a day

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.700
 at a or a soiree of a drinks and chats.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.620
 And it became really associated with romance and sex.

00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.620
 And because there were lots of stories of people falling in love over a game of chess,

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.700
 you know, opponents would fall in love in in fourteen hundred.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.820
 There was a famous book at the time called The Edifying Book of Erotic Chess,

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.580
 which sort of talked about that.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.380
 Yeah, is that is that why we call it Pond?

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:18.180
 Yeah, that's correct.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.580
 That's why they're all naked if you look closely at the pawns.

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:23.260
 But yeah, then the queen came on board

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:25.820
 and it became very martial and competitive and serious.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.140
 And it was thought to be unsuitable for women.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:31.900
 Do you know the rules, the ten rules of whittling?

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.260
 Have you memorized those, everyone?

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.420
 I've only got the first four. Sorry.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.700
 Oh, you know, 40 percent. It's it's just about a pass.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.700
 This is according to Master Carver, Chris Loopcoman,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.660
 who actually has the Guinness World Record for what he describes

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.500
 as the smallest rooster in the world on his YouTube channel.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.900
 What's another word for rooster?

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:58.660
 I think of any because I'm pretty sure I have that record.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.780
 I wonder why I had to be over 18 to access that video.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.420
 It's it's not the smallest rooster.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.100
 It's not even a thing.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.740
 It's the smallest wooden carved thing in the world, according to Guinness.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.900
 It's a tiny little rooster, an eighth of an inch tall.

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.980
 Anyway, he's an amazing whittler.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:19.100
 His ten rules is rule number one is actually make sure your knife is sharp.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.260
 A rule number two, any guesses?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.700
 Don't run with scissors.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.820
 You're you're actually close.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.140
 It's your knife must be really sharp.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.580
 It's rule number two. Oh, what?

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.620
 Anna, is this Fight Club?

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.220
 Could I just check out the other eight rules also to do with sharp knives?

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.660
 I'm so I'm so glad that you've saved me having to read all of the other rules.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.660
 They're all different ways of saying before starting to carve.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:47.140
 Check to see if your knife is sharp.

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.820
 If your knife is really sharp, it'll cut much better.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.260
 Rule number ten is refer back to rules one to nine,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.660
 which are indeed different ways of saying have a sharp knife.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.700
 Very good. So whittlers out there, take note.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:02.100
 Modern board games often have these little carved wooden pieces.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:02.940
 They're quite simple.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.860
 They look a little bit like if you carved the the sign for the gents toilets,

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:11.700
 the little man, if you carved those into wood and painted them different colors.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.540
 That's what they look like.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.100
 Does anybody know what they're called?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.260
 There was there was a there was a term of art for these things.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.860
 Wait for what for modern chess pieces?

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.940
 Well, modern board game pieces, not chess pieces, just board games in general.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.260
 I didn't even know what they were, but no, gone.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:30.340
 They're called Meeples, which is which is a sort of shortening of my people.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.260
 And so the so Meeples is a board game thing.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.660
 And there are, you know, their cafes based on Meeples and Meeple's clubs and so on.

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.740
 But I think they're like tiny, tiny cafes that Meeples attend.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.820
 Yeah, but this one I'm speaking to you from Oxford.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.700
 And there's there's a cafe about two minutes walk away from me called Thirsty Meeples.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.140
 And you can go you can have your hot chocolate or a cup of coffee.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.300
 Then you can play board games surrounded by my by Meeples.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:58.420
 But I I reckon this whole this whole kind of chess piece carving thing.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.500
 It's basically a conspiracy by Big Meeple.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.740
 Because there is.

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.300
 Wait, hang on, Tim, Tim, Tim, Big Meeples are just people, aren't they?

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.380
 You could be right.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:13.100
 You're absolutely right. You've caught me there.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:14.380
 Anyway, it's a conspiracy.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.620
 I'll figure out who's behind it sooner or later, because there's a problem

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:21.220
 with a lot of games that if you're trying to make money selling the game,

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.020
 the game is actually quite cheap.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.780
 And you buy a game like chess, it just cost a few pounds.

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.660
 And then you could just play forever.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.740
 So how do you make money?

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:35.020
 And so there's this increased focus on getting very, very fancy pieces,

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.180
 very expensive pieces.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.620
 So these guys in Amritsar, this is an example of this.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:43.100
 But I think the the most striking example is Games Workshop.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.460
 So Games Workshop is this company that I remember from the 1980s,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.540
 when I was a young nerd used to sell Dungeons and Dragons

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.260
 and used to sell all kinds of games.

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.180
 And then they basically got taken over by a division of the inside the company

00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:00.540
 called Citadel Miniatures, which just made toy soldiers and toy and miniature figures.

00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:04.060
 And these miniature figures were so profitable that during lockdown,

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.580
 Games Workshop had a higher profit margin than Google.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.220
 And Henry Cavill, the actor who plays Superman,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.380
 described these these little miniature figures as plastic crack

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.700
 so that all the money is in the pieces, the money is not in the games.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.100
 That's true. I mean, I used to collect those pieces.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.540
 And there were some which were simply unaffordable for me with my 14 year old's budget.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.660
 Really? I used to have I used to collect them a little bit, not much.

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.900
 But I was always really scared that I was going to die of lead poisoning

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.580
 because there was lead in them.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.940
 And I don't know, someone had once told me that you could die of lead poisoning

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.540
 and these pieces had lead in them.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:39.860
 And I was just I was convinced that I was going to die.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.540
 No, I think you're eating them.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.620
 No, but I was like because I was painting them and stuff

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.140
 and I didn't want to lick my fingers and stuff.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.020
 And you're closing your huff huffing away, you know, huffing away a little.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.220
 Paints used to be water based.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.500
 Well, the paints still are water based.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.860
 So you could you'd sort of paint and then you'd kind of lick your paintbrush

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:01.060
 to get a fine point on the paintbrush and the paint is non-toxic.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.260
 But the but you're painting these lead figures.

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.420
 So they probably were very dangerous.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.420
 But anyway, they're all they're all made of plastic crack.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.900
 Now, as as as Henry Cavill puts it.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.180
 You're a bunch of crackheads.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.100
 It's the least cool kind of being a crackhead.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.500
 And being a crackhead isn't cool.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.980
 I want to emphasize, but this is even less cool.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:21.140
 It's so annoying when people tell you that it's like just like you were saying,

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.140
 James, with the the lead and the paint and the danger thing.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.460
 Well, I always remember my friend Christopher when I was about, I don't know,

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.660
 18, telling me that if I kept drawing on my hand, I'd die.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.500
 Yeah, because the ink would get into my bloodstream somehow.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:38.460
 And I just wanted to say a big old fuck you to Christopher writing notes

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:40.860
 on my hand since then. And I'm as fit as a fiddle.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.780
 Yeah, I don't know.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.060
 I think that explains something about it could be like a conceal.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.620
 It could be a John Crandon thing.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:49.780
 It could be just a matter of time.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:50.900
 You're fine, you're fine, you're fine.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.860
 And then suddenly he's actually dropped dead.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.380
 Here's one thing on people who carve wood for a living.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.180
 Oh, yeah. You guys, I'm sure, have heard of Grindling Gibbons.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:04.460
 Oh, yeah. Yeah. Who hasn't?

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.620
 But just for anyone who's.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.100
 It's a horrible thing you do to great apes, isn't it?

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.580
 You've been outlawed in most places.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.060
 It's such a weird name. You're right.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.820
 I think it was Dutch.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.580
 It was basically the most famous woodcarver in history.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:22.460
 And I know that he's quite an obscure figure now.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.540
 But in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, he was catnip.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.500
 He's all over the UK, because he worked in England mostly.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.140
 There are these incredible woodcarvings.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.860
 I've seen some of them and they're amazing.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:38.100
 As in he could he could do the fuzz on a peach, but carved in wood, you know?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.220
 Wow, really?

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.180
 He's called the Michelangelo of Wood by some people, by some people.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.180
 And yeah, why his mum?

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.980
 He lives with. Anyway, one of his crowning.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:52.260
 It was really, he was extremely famous.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.620
 I mean, it's not fair. Why would somebody who whittles be regarded

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.180
 as less admirable than someone like Michelangelo who works in stone?

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:02.180
 It doesn't make. Exactly, exactly.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.380
 Get this, could Michelangelo do this?

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.820
 I bet he couldn't. In 1690, he made a wooden cravat.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.220
 I have a wooden bow tie.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.220
 It's completely different.

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.300
 Is it?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.180
 He really deflated Andy there.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.740
 The bow tie is designed to be stiff.

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.980
 You could any any any chump can make a bow tie out of wood.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.060
 Just two two cross bits of wood.

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:29.100
 They like to get the fine the cravat, the most flowing of all ice.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.580
 I quite like I quite like how you just accepted that I have a wooden bow tie.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.220
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.220
 Sorry, there's a there's a much better point.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.620
 What I just went to the place in Portugal where all the cork trees are

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.500
 and they sell a lot of merch and one of them is a bow tie.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.340
 And I thought it'd be really cool, but I've never found the outfits.

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.660
 I go with it. I must admit.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.220
 It's so weird, so weird.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:52.540
 You need the full wooden suit to go with it, didn't you, really?

00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:55.860
 Well, James, if you tell you what, if you if you stand next to a donkey

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.500
 and you put on your wooden bow tie and you make it rotate,

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.660
 Anna will think you're a desert island.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:07.900
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.220
 And that is my fact.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.660
 My fact this week is that in Ecuador,

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:15.620
 cleaners are people who rub you down with stinging nettles.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.820
 And it's not as people pay for this service.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:21.540
 Yeah, people.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.620
 I think people pay maybe even more than cleaners in the UK,

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.340
 which is not even more than cleaners in the UK.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.180
 The highest paid bracket in the country.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.940
 It's not possible, Anna.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.260
 It's a travesty and you'll spin off podcasts.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.260
 Our cleaners paid too much.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.340
 I wish you all the best.

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:44.420
 But these are Olympiadores in Ecuador and they are spiritual cleaners.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:48.380
 But Olympiadores just means a cleaner, like it's just the word for a cleaner.

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.420
 But these are people who sort of cleanse your aura.

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.260
 And it's a deep rooted tradition in traditional cultures,

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.540
 particularly up in the mountains.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.260
 A lot of people have this service and it's you're rubbed up and down

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.060
 with stinging nettles and it removes all your bad energy and bad luck.

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.980
 And it hurts quite a lot.

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.860
 And that just shows that it's working, apparently.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.620
 Is it like cleaners in the UK where they come around?

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.420
 They sort of do an initial site visit of your aura and they say,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.940
 well, this aura probably is going to need about a couple of hours a week.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.700
 I'd say maybe two visits, actually, because it's prone to become disgusting quite fast.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.420
 Yeah. Is it like cleaners in the UK where when they whip you with nettles,

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.740
 they sometimes miss the corners?

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.580
 Yeah. And you're too embarrassed to say anything about it

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.100
 because you don't you don't want to make a fuss.

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.180
 But so I just whip my own corners.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.700
 Anyone else got any complaints about their cleaners?

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:47.580
 It's very first world problems little interaction we're having now.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.700
 No. OK.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.780
 So I think with these guys, they they're professionals.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:56.140
 The best ones, they don't miss any spots.

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:59.900
 And in fact, they have an extra service where if you're actually ill

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:04.820
 and you go to, again, Olympia service, then they have a diagnostic tool

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.220
 first where you get rubbed with an egg and a dead black guinea pig.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.020
 And that. Did it die of scurvy?

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:15.940
 Yeah. What?

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.340
 Egg and a dead black guinea pig.

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:20.780
 Yeah. And somehow that diagnoses the problem.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.420
 Then you sort of inspect the egg is weird.

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.340
 Obviously, the guinea pig makes no sense.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:29.500
 So this nettle stuff might have could it have helped like nettles?

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.060
 Are they good for you or not?

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.140
 I don't not not in this way.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:37.940
 It's just a it's a traditional herbal treatment, very popular.

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.260
 And it's but it is still used quite widely.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:44.100
 So even in hospitals in the big cities in Ecuador, apparently, doctors

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.300
 will let these limpia doris work alongside them.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.820
 And, you know, so the doctors will give the conventional treatment

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.700
 and then will accept that the patient will also ask for a rub down with the nettles.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.860
 I think it is good for you. I think a little bit.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.460
 Yeah, I read something in a few rubbed nettles onto an arthritic thumb.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:03.100
 The nettles will sting you, but you may get some relief from the arthritis.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:04.660
 There are quite a lot of claims.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.340
 Yeah, is is that I don't know how much has been scientifically proven,

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.860
 but that's not to say it doesn't work.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.580
 There was a person who died of nettle stings.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.380
 I found one. Right.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.420
 This was a tree nettle in New Zealand called Ertica ferrox.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.020
 Ertica is like the family of nettles.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:24.420
 And apparently there was a lightly clad hunter

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.140
 who died five hours after walking through a dense patch of nettles.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.220
 We don't really know what happened to him.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.980
 Apart from that, I guess it could be anaphylaxis.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.180
 You can get that through nettles.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:39.140
 But yeah, and apparently this nettle in New Zealand, according to Maori folklore,

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:45.100
 one of their kind of gods, Kupe, kind of used them to hinder pursuers

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.020
 when he stole their wives so he would steal their wives.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.460
 He would run away and he would throw down nettles

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.100
 so that people couldn't follow him.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.300
 I'm feeling more guilty about something I did at primary school.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:58.580
 I've actually never confessed this to anybody, but just between the four of us.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:02.340
 So a friend of mine, I've got very vague memories of this,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.180
 but a friend of mine and I decided that for some reason

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.780
 we were going to set a nettle trap, which I now realise could have been fatal.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.900
 And this nettle trap involves we've got some nettles

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:15.220
 and we just put them somewhere on the playground where somebody might find them.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.540
 And then and then I think my friend said, oh, they only sting you on the edge.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:20.260
 I don't know if that's true or not.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.500
 And we thought, but maybe people won't.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.820
 I don't know why we thought this is a good idea.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:26.820
 But we thought maybe people won't pick up the nettles and they won't be stung.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.620
 So we then letter, we wrote a little note that said, please touch these leaves.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.460
 And then then my friend is like, but they only sting on the edge.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.380
 So then we added, please touch these leaves on the edge.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.180
 I don't know if there were any fatalities, but I'm burdened by guilt.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.660
 What a genius ruse, master criminal.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:48.020
 I assume it's just no fell for it.

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.260
 Yeah, there's just no trick there, is there really?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:53.940
 It's like you're not trying to disguise them as anything or anything like that.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.060
 It's like literally straight on the nose.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:58.620
 Please injure yourself with our trap.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.340
 Put a hand in Mousetrap.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:03.100
 Oh, I love that.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:07.620
 You I'm sure I'm sure in the course of your research,

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:10.100
 you guys came across the world nettle eating championships.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:12.980
 No. Oh, it sounds really crazy.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:14.780
 Well, they happen in they happen in Dorset.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.980
 Of course, very near Bridport, which we've mentioned before on the podcast,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.220
 has the world's only thatched brewery.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.420
 But we don't there's no time to rake over that old boom.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:30.660
 So it's basically happened at a pub called The Bottle Inn until 2019.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.260
 But the pub's been closed lots on and off.

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:33.220
 But it is happening this year.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.660
 It's moving to a farm nearby.

00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.820
 And the competition is because of nettle based fatalities

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:41.460
 shot down by health and safety at this point.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.380
 So the the farm is taking it over, taking the reins this year, which is great.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.220
 And the the measure is by length.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.500
 That's how you measure whether you're successful at eating nettles or not.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.780
 Is how long in feet?

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.340
 Time. Oh, no, as in literally got it.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.340
 How yeah, how many how many feet of now do you can eat?

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.220
 So that and so it's the length of stalk that is that remains

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.060
 after you've stripped all the little nettle leaves off it and eat.

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.900
 Well, do you work your way down like a the side of a road

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.500
 and just eat as many?

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.180
 It's I understand it's the stalk because I understand it was originally

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.380
 two farmers got into an argument about who had the biggest nettles.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:24.260
 And it was and they said, if you can grow a longer nettle

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:26.580
 than I've got growing on my farm, I'll eat it.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.700
 Yeah. And so I think the idea is you strip the leaves off.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.100
 And then you it's the stalk that remains is your measure of nettle.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.020
 It's I think that I think that argument was about more than I think

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.860
 that was about the length of the farmer's roosters.

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:43.420
 I mean, when I when I encountered this, I thought, oh, yeah,

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.300
 can be competitive nettle eating, it's crazy.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.140
 But it's like, you know, the competitive chili eating

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.860
 or the competitive hot dog eating or so on.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.860
 So it's like, oh, how many can you eat in one minute?

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.540
 Or how many can you eat in three minutes?

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:59.700
 But no, it's how many can you eat in an hour to spend an hour eating nettles?

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.780
 And it's too long.

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:04.700
 It doesn't count if you don't keep the nettles down.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.500
 And there was one guy a few years ago who was way ahead.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.540
 And at 57 minutes, he went to just threw up in the pub car park

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:13.780
 and he was disqualified. Can you imagine?

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:17.300
 It's the winner, the all time record winner is called Philip Thorn.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:23.020
 Now, nettles don't have thorns, admittedly, but it's quite close.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.220
 His record 104 feet.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:29.260
 So impressive, which is long.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.860
 Do you know what I find most amazing about that is what it says

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.220
 about the human capacity to improve?

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.580
 Because about 10 years before he got the record, which was in 2018,

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.980
 the winner of the same competition, eight 48 feet of nettles.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:48.140
 Now, in just a decade, Phil Thorn has more than doubled that.

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:51.900
 How have humans got so much better at nettle eating in the space of ten years?

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.300
 That's like if in ten years time, we can do the hundred meters in four and a half

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.180
 seconds, isn't it? Exactly.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.860
 Yeah.

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.060
 Well, get Phil Thorn in the hundred meters.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:04.500
 So there's nettles at the end at the finish line.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.500
 You're not allowed to cook them, I guess, right?

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.340
 You just have to eat them raw.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.500
 They're raw, freshly picked.

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.500
 Your tongue goes black from all the iron in them.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.820
 It's painful, apparently, almost immediately.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.860
 Within 20 seconds, it's very painful.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.860
 And you then only got another 3,580 seconds to get through.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.340
 That's horrific.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.900
 I don't know how people do it.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.260
 And you're not allowed to bring your own nettles and you're not allowed to bring

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.940
 any substances that might numb your mouth, although I'm sure some people have

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.780
 been tempted to try and smear Vaseline on.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.300
 I don't know, because I just thought of a trick, but then I only thought of the trick

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.380
 after you told me the thing you're not allowed to do.

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.900
 So that's that's not going to work.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:44.420
 But I think from memory in Hawaii, I think the nettles don't have stings on them.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.900
 I think you turn you turn up wearing your lay with your with your

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.420
 sun hat on in your in your tropical shirt.

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.420
 Whatever you like.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:58.460
 Just just just exeter, you know, I think I was smuggling some broccoli

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.300
 or something and say, oh, no, it's definitely nettles.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.420
 I think that they might have evolved to have no sting

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.540
 because they don't have any animals that eat them or something.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.540
 Oh, really? So they don't need to repel.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.940
 That's amazing.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.140
 What you can do at the nettle eating championships

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.060
 is drink, you can either drink water or you can drink beer.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.420
 I don't know if it has to be beer sourced from a thatch brewery or not.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.820
 It's going to be cider now that it's a cider farm.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.940
 Cider is allowed.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.500
 Cider is allowed because I think that would help go on.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.060
 So one, in fact, as we're talking about incredible moments

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.260
 in the history of nettle eating in 2019, the women's winner,

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.620
 Lindy Rogers, I don't know why the competition is divided by sex.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.620
 I have no idea.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:43.340
 But there's a men's and a women's championship.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.780
 The women's winner, Lindy Rogers, had an incredible

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:49.540
 Fosbury flop moment because she dipped her nettles inside her.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.740
 Inside her or inside.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.620
 I mean, first of all, that's disgusting.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.100
 Second of all, I feel like it would hurt just as much.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.900
 In apple cider.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.220
 Oh, sorry. Exactly.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:08.420
 And so that's that's a method that apparently helps to take

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.940
 take a bit of the sting out of it.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.220
 That feels like a loophole.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.540
 Because they've got to close that one.

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:15.580
 That should be a loophole, you know, it's all it's all loopholes.

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.900
 It's all loopholes on here on here.

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.380
 Yeah. Yeah. Wow.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.700
 So the in the war in the First World War,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.660
 the Germans were encouraged to collect nettles.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:32.140
 Can you guess why, maybe ammunition shortage is really biting.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.620
 We're just going to have to thrash the British with our nettle bundles.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.660
 Were they planning to steal everybody's wives

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:41.460
 and then throw the nettles down to foil the pursuers?

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.420
 Very good.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:44.500
 Just setting a nettle trap in the playground,

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.900
 taking literally a leaf out of Tim's book.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.900
 Better touch and see here.

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.340
 No, it was to make uniforms.

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.940
 So you can take the stocks off nettles

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:00.180
 and you can make like kind of material with it.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.100
 The month at university in Leicester

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.060
 have got a thing called the Sting Project

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.620
 and they've been trying to find things that you can do with nettles.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:10.020
 And one of their team, a designer called Alex Deer,

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.140
 has invented underwear that's made from nettles.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:18.060
 They made a pink camisole top and pants made from nettles.

00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:23.220
 And according to Alex Deer, they said, it is quite a hairy fibre.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.180
 So you probably wouldn't want all of your underwear made of it.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:30.020
 But we are trying to make a point of what is possible with this plant.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.020
 Wow.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.220
 I don't want to dip them inside it, wouldn't you?

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.220
 Or have sex with someone who wears dockleaf pants.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.820
 Oh, James, come on.

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.620
 You know, that's a myth.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.380
 Don't propagate it for the kids.

00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.620
 Some myths are nice, Anna.

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.380
 Some myths are nice.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.220
 It's good.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:49.260
 It takes your mind off the stinging agony

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:50.540
 when looking for a dockleaf.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:52.260
 So I maintain there's a placebo effect.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.940
 I go to the dockleaf eating championships

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.420
 and I got to say, my record is pretty strong.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:02.060
 Have you guys heard of the Hornet ordeal?

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.140
 This is the El Gayo people in Kenya do this.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.180
 This was an article by a guy called F.B.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.180
 Wellborn, who underwent the initiation, who's Kenyan.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.940
 And what it is, is that boys are forced to crawl

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.300
 through tunnels made of stinging nettles.

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.620
 And then once you get out of this tunnel of stinging nettles,

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.820
 then you have the nettles rubbed on your genitals.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:27.300
 And then you have live Hornets dropped on your back.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:32.100
 And the reason that they do all this is that the nettles are there

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.580
 to prepare you for the Hornets.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.180
 So like the pain is to prepare you for the Hornet pain.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.540
 And then the Hornet pain is there to prepare you

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.780
 for the circumcision that comes straight afterwards.

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.380
 Wow.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.860
 I think the world nettle eating championship should should go for this.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.820
 So after me and the nettles, then the Hornets.

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.180
 And then that would explain why there's a separate category

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.860
 for men and women.

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:54.940
 How is the circumcision contest judged?

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:55.940
 Is that by length?

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:56.940
 How's that working?

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.340
 I haven't worked out all the details yet.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.780
 Wow, that sounds really horrible, James.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.940
 Yeah, no, it is.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.220
 It's the second. What is the circumcision prepare you for?

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.620
 Life as an animal.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:12.260
 Oh, boy.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.460
 Gets worse.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.540
 Dealing with a bloody council.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:26.300
 All right, it is time for our final fact, and that is Andy's fact.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:29.660
 My fact this week is that the people of the remote island

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:32.580
 of St. Kilda used to yell if they saw themselves

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.540
 in a visiting tourist's mirror.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.140
 They actually had plenty of mirrors.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.940
 They just wanted to keep the tourists coming.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:44.340
 So this is about the remote, very remote

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.900
 island of St. Kilda.

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:48.620
 And it features in a new book called Shadowlands by Matthew Green,

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:51.500
 which is about various forgotten, fascinating places.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.260
 And St. Kilda had people on it for about a thousand years.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.700
 They lived there until 1930.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:46:59.460
 The island was evacuated in 1930.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.180
 In the 19th century, they started getting visitors

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.300
 by ship Victorian tourists, not very many, because it's so far away.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.700
 But they played up to it massively and they would do this thing.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.740
 They would, you know, they would scream or pretend

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:13.220
 to be incredibly surprised if someone showed them a mirror.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.420
 They would look behind the mirror saying, what, there's no one behind?

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:17.260
 What's going on?

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:18.780
 I mean, they were literally they were clean shaven.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:21.460
 They had mirrors. They had shaved that morning.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.140
 I read this was in an article by Neil McKenzie,

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.460
 who was the person who was kind of in charge.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.500
 He was like the Reverend who kind of went there

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.140
 and he's kind of in charge of anything

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:34.220
 and helped the islanders for quite a long time.

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.580
 And he said they would pick up pieces of coal

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.340
 and affect surprise at not being able to eat them.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.700
 And when they came in front of a looking glass,

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:43.940
 they would start and express great surprise

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:46.780
 at not being able to find the person who appeared behind it.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.580
 It's so fun. It's like they really work out.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:54.060
 Sometimes they would go on a border yacht, a visiting tourist yacht,

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:57.300
 and they pretended that they thought all the brass on it was gold.

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.540
 You've got all this gold.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.580
 You must be the richest man in the world.

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:02.860
 And they knew they knew about brass.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.020
 You know, they were hamming it up.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.340
 Did it did it work?

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.660
 Were the tourists locking to St Kilda

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.820
 to see these people be amazed at their own reflection?

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.140
 Because it's hard to get to.

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.380
 I don't know if I take a holiday.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:15.300
 Fucking it didn't become a major tourist economy,

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.820
 which is why the island economy fell apart.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.580
 The place was evacuated in 1930,

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.860
 but they were doing their best to keep some money coming in.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.820
 Yeah, apparently, according to McKenzie,

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.460
 they would all the time when they were doing this,

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.300
 they'd be talking to each other in Gaelic

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:29.380
 and they'd be saying, if we seem to be paying great attention

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.060
 and make them believe we are simple,

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.820
 they will be sure before they go away to give us something even better.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:36.700
 Yeah, so they just did this

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.940
 and they thought if they kind of make them think we're stupid,

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.460
 then eventually we'll get some really awesome booty from them.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.020
 Yeah, smart guys. Yeah.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:48.660
 So so I'm trying to work out what they were what they were pretending to be.

00:48:48.660 --> 00:48:52.700
 And so is it that they're pretending that they thought they were vampires

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.140
 and were surprised to realise that they weren't actually vampires?

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.820
 The mirror didn't.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.460
 They were surprised. Oh, I thought I didn't leave a reflection in a mirror

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.740
 because I was a vampire, but I realised I'm human after all.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.020
 That would surprise me. That's what it was.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.860
 And that's actually why the island broke down. Everyone was scared off.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.060
 One of my favourite short poems is by John Hegley.

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.980
 And it has the title, A Vampire Considered Buying a New Mirror.

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.380
 And the poem is simply on reflection.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.500
 No, brilliant. Very nice.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.140
 That's really good, isn't it?

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:29.580
 It's also a good one to be able to memorise back myself to remember that.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.180
 For the school, like the citation competition.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.540
 Yeah, yeah.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.380
 I was trying to look it up.

00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:37.980
 I saw it about 25 years ago and I was trying to look it up somewhere

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.260
 and I can't find it on the internet.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.860
 And then I thought, you know, I can actually remember that joke.

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.220
 That's fine.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:47.460
 It's been it's held fascination for people for hundreds of years,

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:49.940
 hasn't it, St Kilda? People have been visiting it.

00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.620
 And it is it's over 100 miles off the coast of Scotland.

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.060
 And it's a rocky ride to get there.

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.740
 And it's quite unclear when people have lived there and when they haven't.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:05.460
 But there was definitely a society established by the 16th century wasn't there.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:07.180
 That's when we know that there was like a community of people

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.460
 who are living there successfully.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.340
 So it's not like it's been populated forever.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:13.540
 And then people have travelled there ever since.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.220
 There was the first proper account of the islanders was written in 1698

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:21.900
 called A Late Voyage to St Kilda, which I still don't know what he meant by late.

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:26.260
 I don't know if he meant to go 10 years earlier and died about five years earlier.

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.980
 Anyway, this is a writer called Martin Martin.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.180
 Brilliant. I actually I read his book.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.260
 It's fascinating.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:37.740
 One of the things he says is they're extremely good climbers.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.620
 And so they they live by hunting the birds, mostly the island birds.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.100
 So they'll climb up and then they'll catch the birds.

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:48.820
 And he described a particularly very high rock called the thumb,

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.900
 which was as high as a tall steeple.

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.940
 And he said that the only way that you could get to the top

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:58.180
 of the thumb is by at one point you swing your entire body sort of up

00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.340
 onto a ledge by holding onto a protruding bit of rock,

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:03.220
 which is only big enough to accommodate your thumb.

00:51:03.220 --> 00:51:03.940
 Oh, my God.

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:07.020
 So you've got to get your whole body

00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:11.340
 bouncing on your thumb as you propel it up onto the next bit of rock.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.340
 Quite impressive.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:14.660
 And then the person who swung his way up there onto the thumb

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.980
 gets drops of rope down and hoist the others up.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:20.580
 And then that person gets an extra four foul at the end of the day.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.820
 For his achievements in the birds, right?

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.220
 Because that's what the people of St.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:27.900
 Kilda mostly lived off birds and stuff.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.660
 Yes, what birds and poo, of course.

00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.380
 So it's left hand big, why wouldn't they just leave the rope up?

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.380
 It takes a lot of the fun out of it, isn't it?

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:37.500
 It is such a fascinating place.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:39.460
 And it was unbelievably inhospitable.

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.220
 And it's amazing that people managed to scratch out a living there at all.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.300
 So sometimes it would just rain for three weeks without stopping.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.580
 Not once. It just rained for three weeks on end.

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:54.380
 I mean, in fairness, in Bolton or even in Manchester, I think I could survive.

00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.740
 All right. All right.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.460
 There was once a storm that was so fierce that everyone on the island

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:01.180
 was left deaf for a week.

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.460
 It's it was like I read that.

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.060
 It's just not true. It can't be true.

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.620
 Can it? It's not. I think it can.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.260
 I think it can.

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:10.140
 It was so windy.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.940
 The island of sheep would sometimes just be blown over the cliffs.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.380
 I cannot. Yeah.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.740
 That is understandable.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.180
 But everyone on the island going deaf for a week, that doesn't make that.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:21.700
 Can't be true. It's just not a thing.

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:24.620
 We should mention the amazing way that they used to communicate

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:30.260
 with the mainland, the St Kildons, in the 19th century, which was via mailboats.

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.620
 They didn't have a postal service until the early 20th century.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.620
 And so they would just get a letter, write it, pop it on a homemade mailboat,

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:41.980
 like a hollowed out bit of wood with a little tin placed inside into which

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:46.500
 they'd put their letter and then they'd burn onto the surface of this tiny boat.

00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:50.980
 The words please open and they'd inflate a sheep's bladder, attach it to the boat,

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:55.220
 send it off and hope that it got to land somewhere.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.780
 And according to one report I read, two thirds of messages

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.300
 reached their destination as in they'd reach a destination,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:04.700
 either the coast of Scotland or Scandinavia sometimes.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.620
 And then those people would open the message

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.500
 and find the actual address inside and post it on.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.660
 It's very good.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.220
 It's roughly the same strike rate as the Royal Mail at the moment.

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.660
 So yeah, that's really cool.

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:20.940
 Pyrography, it's called when you burn words onto bits of wood.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:23.980
 It's kind of a subsection of whittling.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.900
 I don't know if you can across it in your whittling research.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.620
 It used to be a very male dominated area.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.140
 And then in the turn of the 20th century, there's a Melbourne architect

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:39.300
 called Alfred Smart, who invented a new way of pyrography,

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.540
 pyrographising a new type of pyrography.

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:47.540
 And the way that he did that, he had a pencil with like some fuel attached to it.

00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.420
 And so you could use and you could change the amount of fuel that came in and out.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.340
 So you could start doing shading and stuff like that and do amazing patterns.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.700
 And then it became a kind of a relatively not very common,

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.980
 but a relatively common hobby for women at the in the start of the 20th century.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:10.620
 And I was reading about someone called Joe Schwartz, who's a wood burner.

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:14.900
 And she was the first person to ever teach wood burning in Antarctica.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:21.140
 I mean, it's it's right down on the list of survivability skills.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.340
 Especially in a continent with no trees.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.300
 But, you know, she's got a record.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.580
 So that's good being the second person.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.260
 Imagine going to Antarctica when I teach them wood burning.

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.820
 What is that? Oh, not even the first one to do this.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.140
 You see the Schwartz panel being hung up over the tent nightmare.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.260
 Can I tell you one quick thing about the the evacuation of us at Kilda?

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:44.940
 Yes, please.

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.500
 Because when they because life got harder and harder

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:49.140
 and a lot of able-bodied young men went to the mainland

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:56.100
 and as it was largely a subsistence economy, so like hunting birds and farming sheep.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.580
 That was a big problem for the island's survival.

00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:00.740
 In fact, they got close to starving on several occasions.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.820
 And so in 1930, they they contacted the mainland and said,

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:08.060
 look, we're going to tap out with this horrible, we don't like it.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:09.620
 We're all deaf.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.820
 They the government said, yeah, of course, we'll bring you over.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:14.300
 By that point, two thirds of the population

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.300
 shared the same two surnames as in the diversity of families

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:21.420
 had really been, you know, whittled down over the years.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.900
 And at the end of it, in 1930, they ceremonially closed down the post office.

00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.020
 I think it's amazing.

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:32.420
 They held one final church service and they drowned their dogs off the pier.

00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:34.700
 Oh, my God. I don't know why.

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.100
 I don't know why.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:36.860
 Oh, no.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.980
 They must have been sad.

00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:41.940
 That took such a horrible turn at the end of that sentence.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:42.860
 Really? Sorry.

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:43.860
 They must have been guys.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.620
 There's room on the boat for the dogs.

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:46.980
 But then when they got to the mainland,

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.460
 the government arranged for most of the men to be given jobs in the Forestry Commission.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.860
 But unfortunately, most of them had never seen a tree

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:56.060
 because there are no trees on Sir Kilda.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.660
 We're just chopping everything down, weren't they?

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.220
 They'd chop down lampposts, tulips.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:03.380
 Well, presumably, they were going to get jobs at the RSPCA.

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.700
 Hurriedly rearranged.

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:11.980
 All right, that's it.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:13.020
 That's all of our facts.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.580
 Thank you so much, everybody, for listening.

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:17.820
 Thanks so much, Tim, for coming on.

00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.700
 If you want to get in touch with any of us,

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:22.260
 you can find these guys on Twitter, I believe.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:23.420
 James, you're on.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.340
 That's James Harkin.

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:24.940
 Andy.

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:25.860
 At Andrew Hunter M.

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:29.260
 And Tim, have you fallen prey to the scourge that is Twitter?

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:32.620
 I'm Tim Harford on Twitter, but I don't really pay any attention.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.780
 I think people should just listen to the Cautionary Tales podcast instead

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.660
 and not tweet me.

00:56:36.660 --> 00:56:39.460
 Great. So if you want to be completely ignored,
