00:00:14,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to"
00:00:19,00:00:25,"you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with"
00:00:25,00:00:31,"Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around"
00:00:31,00:00:36,the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order
00:00:36,00:00:45,here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that for cheaters
00:00:45,00:00:51,slowing down is more important than running fast or speeding up. Wow more important in what way?
00:00:51,00:00:59,Yeah in the successful kill rate. Is that because if they just carried on speeding up forever they'd
00:00:59,00:01:03,have no time to eat their kill? You can't just run and run and run and expect to have a meal at the
00:01:03,00:01:10,end of the day. It's not quite that so this is a few studies that have been done actually into
00:01:10,00:01:16,kind of cheater locomotion. The one I was reading was 2013 and the scientist spent nearly 10 years
00:01:16,00:01:22,designing a battery-powered solar-charged kind of tracking collar and then they put it on cheaters
00:01:22,00:01:26,"and so it measured exactly you know when they're speeding up, when they're slowing down etc and"
00:01:26,00:01:31,then it looked at when they were successful in hunts and when they weren't and basically one of
00:01:31,00:01:35,the things it said is they don't actually run that fast when they're hunting so people think
00:01:35,00:01:40,that they're cracking 60 miles an hour all the time but they basically don't go over 40 really
00:01:40,00:01:46,when they're hunting and it said that the key factor that affected whether or not they caught
00:01:46,00:01:54,something seemed to be how fast they slowed down. Is that all the decision over whether the prey
00:01:54,00:01:58,lives or dies is made right at the kind of end game? You know the cheater is really good at
00:01:58,00:02:04,getting right up close but actually once they're slowed down that's where the zebra either lives
00:02:04,00:02:09,or dies and it's in the manoeuvrability. That's a good way of describing it. You really kill
00:02:09,00:02:15,something when you're motionless don't you? It's amazing it bothers to run at all considering
00:02:15,00:02:20,that this is the... We should just wait for the zebras to come to it. Pretty much yeah. Just stand
00:02:20,00:02:25,still with your mouth open like a cartoon. Some animals do that don't they? Some animals you'll
00:02:25,00:02:30,get like worms who live in the sand in the ocean and they just sit there waiting until
00:02:30,00:02:35,something comes past and then they suck it up. Do you remember those snakes that live in the cave
00:02:35,00:02:40,and they just hang around hovering near the mouth of a cave and as the bats fly out of the cave at
00:02:40,00:02:46,night bang they grab them. Yeah or bears that sit in the river that have the salmon just flying
00:02:46,00:02:51,into their mouth. Oh yeah. You know when they're leaping up. Yeah see the cheaters have watched
00:02:51,00:02:56,all these documentaries and gone why am I just doing that? Or us just kind of sitting at home
00:02:56,00:03:02,waiting for Deliveroo to arrive with our pizzas. There's a difference between that and actually
00:03:02,00:03:07,going to McDonald's and getting a takeaway yourself isn't it? That's basically the analogy here.
00:03:07,00:03:11,Yeah. There we go we've hit on it. Took us a while but we got there. I get the door pretty
00:03:11,00:03:15,damn fast and Deliveroo driver arrives. My acceleration is through. But the thing is you
00:03:15,00:03:19,have to stop when he gets there otherwise you're going to run straight past him. That's what we're
00:03:19,00:03:24,saying. That's a good point. It's the same thing. Do you know what the most impressive bit of the
00:03:24,00:03:31,cheater is or yeah physically the most impressive thing? I thought like maybe it's legs or it's
00:03:31,00:03:35,lungs or something. Yeah well me being a controversialist I picked the inner ear.
00:03:35,00:03:41,So this is it genuinely is a bit of the cheater which is really really good at its job. It has
00:03:41,00:03:48,this unbelievably massive inner ear system and the reason that's good is that while it moves
00:03:48,00:03:52,it means it can keep its head unbelievably still because if any one of us was running at 40 miles
00:03:52,00:03:56,"an hour, firstly we'd be doing very well and secondly our head would be all over the place."
00:03:56,00:04:00,We wouldn't be able to see what we were doing. We'd be sort of bobbing around going ah but the
00:04:00,00:04:06,cheater can keep completely locked on its prey and that's because it has a huge inner ear so it
00:04:06,00:04:10,keeps its visual stability even while it's going at 40 or 50 miles an hour. And probably really
00:04:10,00:04:15,important when it changes direction as well right? Yeah because we can go at 40 miles an hour in a
00:04:15,00:04:20,car for instance and we don't like our heads don't explode but it's all the movement and stuff right.
00:04:20,00:04:24,Well speak for yourself James. I've never tried getting up to those speeds myself.
00:04:25,00:04:31,"You're on the motorway in the inner lane, 39 all the way. There's this theory that cheaters"
00:04:31,00:04:38,they heat up too much that's why they have really short running speeds like they run for a short
00:04:38,00:04:42,amount of time and then they stop because if they don't they'll overheat. And the reason we think
00:04:42,00:04:48,that is because there was a study in 1973 in Harvard and they got some cheaters and they flew
00:04:48,00:04:54,them over to Harvard and they made them run on treadmills with thermometers stuck up their buns
00:04:54,00:04:59,and it was these readings that they used to say well obviously they can only run a certain amount
00:04:59,00:05:05,of time before they overheat but of course in the wild cheaters don't run with thermometers
00:05:05,00:05:11,up their buns in Harvard on treadmills and so there was a scientist called Robin Heaton from
00:05:11,00:05:18,a university of Witwatersrand in South Africa and she actually put some she put some actual
00:05:18,00:05:23,sensors inside of the cheaters like surgically put them really really small ones and so we
00:05:23,00:05:27,can get a much better idea of what they do and she's disproved this idea that they overheat
00:05:27,00:05:33,when running. Because they do overheat when eating apparently this might be part of the
00:05:33,00:05:38,same thing and this is because they are super stressed when they eat so dinner is not a fun
00:05:38,00:05:42,experience for a cheater because they think it's because of the anxiety that someone's going to
00:05:42,00:05:47,come and steal your food and so when they're eating they're prey their body temperature goes up.
00:05:48,00:05:53,Right. The closest that one of these sort of let's say the Harvard-esque cheaters so the ones
00:05:53,00:05:59,that were collared that were zoo-reared got to was 59 so they can actually still get to these
00:05:59,00:06:05,high points as well and the one that managed to do that was called Ferrari which is rather nice
00:06:05,00:06:11,that was the cheaters name but what was weird was in the study as well because they did 367
00:06:11,00:06:17,runs of clocking them and seeing how fast they could go only a quarter of those ended in a kill
00:06:17,00:06:22,and apparently cheaters are quite crap but actually doing the deal.
00:06:22,00:06:26,This was in Harvard they were doing that. Who were they killing? They were just going after
00:06:26,00:06:32,"students. Endless post-grad students. No, these are not the Harvard ones. These are the ones"
00:06:32,00:06:36,from the other study. I was saying the similar to the Harvard ones. They're on the treadmill.
00:06:36,00:06:40,They're on the treadmill in front running as fast as they can on their treadmill.
00:06:40,00:06:46,Interestingly in the cheater world if you say you went to Harvard that's actually a lame thing to be
00:06:46,00:06:50,because you didn't run quite as fast but you had a thermometer up your bum.
00:06:50,00:06:54,"Yeah, but you're super smart, you know. So that's where the cue does it."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"Not smart enough to remove the thermometer, are you?"
00:06:56,00:07:02,"That feels like one of those sorority pranks, doesn't it? You strip naked, thermometer up the"
00:07:02,00:07:09,"ass, put on a treadmill. Do you know who the first European to scientifically describe the cheater"
00:07:09,00:07:16,"was? Well, someone who went to Africa. So like Mary Kingsley or someone, no."
00:07:16,00:07:20,Interesting. It was actually Daniel von Schreiber.
00:07:20,00:07:24,What? You're kidding.
00:07:24,00:07:28,"Your former self, Dan, your career's really taken a nose dive but in 1777 it was,"
00:07:28,00:07:35,he's called Johann Christian Daniel von Schreiber and he actually didn't even see a cheater.
00:07:35,00:07:39,He based his description on the skin of a cheater and he gave it a scientific name
00:07:39,00:07:42,"and described it. So there you go, Dan, your namesake. Well done."
00:07:42,00:07:46,"And everything you said just sounds like it could have been me as well. Didn't actually see it,"
00:07:46,00:07:48,"didn't actually have anything, wasn't actually there."
00:07:48,00:07:54,"Another thing about cheaters is unlike all the other big cats, they're kind of quite close to"
00:07:54,00:08:01,house cats and one way you can tell this especially is that they don't roar like a lion does or a tiger
00:08:01,00:08:07,does. They meow and they purr because they have a different kind of voice box to lions and tigers
00:08:07,00:08:12,and stuff. It's not as flexible and so they can't really do these big sounds. They can only kind of
00:08:12,00:08:19,"go meow, meow. It's mental when you look at it and they also chirp like birds. So if you watch,"
00:08:19,00:08:27,look up cheater tweeting and it's incredible. You've got this beautiful noble big cat opens
00:08:27,00:08:34,its mouth and it goes... I just did an impression of a cheater then and my cat who was sat in the
00:08:34,00:08:39,room sort of looked up at me and I don't know if she thought I was a cheater or just a weird human
00:08:39,00:08:46,doing a cat sound. I think we know. There's another noise they can make. The males specifically bark.
00:08:46,00:08:51,"It's called a stutter bark and it's kind of shout, it's just a kind of cheater shout,"
00:08:51,00:08:57,but it's insane because what it does is it literally turns females on. It triggers female
00:08:57,00:09:02,cheaters to produce reproductive hormones and I think this is unique in mammals. There's no other
00:09:02,00:09:08,mammal species where the male just says something effectively and the female gets ready for sex
00:09:08,00:09:15,"instantly. Tom Jones does that, doesn't he? Sorry, it's the cheaters and Tom Jones I was"
00:09:15,00:09:20,forgetting. Do you remember years ago on the podcast I said that there's a secret word that's
00:09:20,00:09:26,been lost according to secret societies that if said directly to a woman will get her pregnant
00:09:26,00:09:32,instantly. This is the closest that we have to this so it's good to know. It's not impossible.
00:09:32,00:09:43,"There's an article on the BBC news website and the headline is just, ""Is it possible to escape a"
00:09:43,00:09:48,"cheater?"" and I love thinking of the people who are desperately waiting for that to load"
00:09:50,00:09:50,as it approaches.
00:09:50,00:09:57,"Oh, the signal's bad. Sorry."
00:09:57,00:10:01,"What's the answer? Oh, I didn't read the article."
00:10:01,00:10:07,"Imagine if someone right now is being chased out by a cheater, they happen to be listening"
00:10:07,00:10:12,"to our podcast and they're going, ""I can't believe my fucking luck. I'm about to be told how to"
00:10:12,00:10:18,"escape this thing."" And then you didn't read the article. Mate, you're part of the problem here."
00:10:19,00:10:22,"I'm sure it's possible if you believe in yourself, yeah."
00:10:22,00:10:25,"If you are being chased, just believe in yourself."
00:10:25,00:10:34,"I read that small cheater cubs in the wild, they have a silver-gray"
00:10:34,00:10:39,sort of bit of fur that goes over their head and it travels down their neck and their back
00:10:39,00:10:44,and it's basically camouflaged for them so that if they have any predators coming around they can
00:10:44,00:10:52,either hide into their surroundings or they can pretend to be a fake honey badger because they
00:10:52,00:10:56,"look so similar to a honey badger. Sorry Dan, we're not talking about honey badgers today."
00:10:56,00:11:00,I demand we talk honey badgers at some point on this podcast.
00:11:00,00:11:10,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James."
00:11:10,00:11:16,"Okay, my fact this week is that Napoleon Bonaparte made his sister Caroline the queen of Naples,"
00:11:16,00:11:22,"but when the old guard reclaimed the city, she reinvented herself as Countess of Lepona,"
00:11:22,00:11:29,"which was an invented place, which was an anagram of Napoli and Napoli being the Italian word for"
00:11:29,00:11:35,"Naples. Clever. Yeah, she just wanted to be a queen. She wanted to be royalty and, you know,"
00:11:35,00:11:41,"Napoleon had taken over and she saw her chance and she basically, you know, lobbied him to"
00:11:41,00:11:45,try and get anywhere in the world that she could become a Countess of and eventually he said that
00:11:45,00:11:50,she could go to Naples and then it was okay for a few years and then eventually he got kicked out
00:11:50,00:11:55,at Waterloo and then she got kicked out of there and then she basically cosplayed it for the rest
00:11:55,00:12:03,"of her life. It's clever that it was Napoli and she was Napoleon's sister. Oh yeah, I never thought"
00:12:03,00:12:07,"of that. Yeah, she could have made a little joke about that in her kind of welcome speech."
00:12:07,00:12:16,"She had a successful stand-up career, didn't she, after Waterloo? Was she successful in"
00:12:16,00:12:22,"maintaining this whole queen charade, do we know? When people said, ""Where's Lepona? What did she say?"""
00:12:22,00:12:27,"Yeah. Well, it's wherever you want it to be, Andrew. It can be, you know, it's everywhere and nowhere."
00:12:27,00:12:31,It's here and it's there. It's in and it's out. It's up and it's down.
00:12:32,00:12:40,"I think that was, who was that? Katie Perry for a moment there, I went. No, she, when they got"
00:12:40,00:12:46,"deposed, a lot of the Bonaparte family were kind of appeased when she was allowed to live in the"
00:12:46,00:12:53,"south of Austria in her own little castle and that was what she kind of, she didn't call that Lepona"
00:12:53,00:12:58,but she took visitors and stuff and said that that's what she was. She seemed to have a very
00:12:58,00:13:05,bizarre relationship with Napoleon. So she was the very young sister of Napoleon and when
00:13:05,00:13:10,"they were forced out to sort of, they grew up quite rich and then they became quite poor and"
00:13:10,00:13:15,then Napoleon got very rich and he put them all through school. So she went to a finishing school
00:13:15,00:13:20,that was run or at least she was taught by the former lady in waiting to marry Marie Antoinette.
00:13:20,00:13:27,So she learned to sort of be someone who wanted to become the heights of a princess or a queen
00:13:27,00:13:33,even and Napoleon started handing around all of these different royal titles to his family but
00:13:33,00:13:40,not to her to begin with and there's accounts of her getting these kind of subpar titles and
00:13:40,00:13:43,"they would have dinners as an account saying that Madame Murat, because she was married at this"
00:13:43,00:13:47,"point and that's the surname she took on, Madame Murat was excessively angry and during the dinner"
00:13:47,00:13:52,had so little control over herself that she could not restrain her tears and she ended up the next
00:13:52,00:13:58,night getting in a massive fight fainting because she was so angry. She was obsessed with becoming
00:13:58,00:14:02,"this princess and he just really held off from giving her that. Like she was, yeah, she was"
00:14:02,00:14:07,always throwing these tantrums and fainting. She had this terrible jealousy of all of her sisters
00:14:07,00:14:13,"and of Hortense who was, so that was Josephine's daughter and they went to the same school, Caroline"
00:14:13,00:14:18,"and Hortense and Hortense was sort of the perfect pupil, did really, really well in school, was very"
00:14:18,00:14:27,"refined and Caroline was a bit more brash, a bit less well bred and so Napoleon often preferred"
00:14:27,00:14:33,"Hortense and this caused a lot of problems and she hated Josephine so much, Caroline hated Josephine"
00:14:33,00:14:37,"so much that when she had a daughter who was to be called Josephine, she insisted on calling the"
00:14:37,00:14:43,"daughter Joseph because she says, I'm not going to allow my daughter to take that name and had to"
00:14:43,00:14:47,"be properly controlled. She could have thought of something that was less close to Josephine,"
00:14:47,00:14:53,"surely like Sandra or... Barony, we had to be sticking within the Josephine format at that moment."
00:14:53,00:15:00,"God. Well, she wasn't all bad though, was she? Like she was one of the main people who helped to"
00:15:00,00:15:05,excavate Pompeii because she was really interested in archaeology. She started a school for girls in
00:15:05,00:15:11,"Naples but then on the other hand, as soon as it looked like Napoleon might be losing, she suddenly"
00:15:11,00:15:16,"got on the side of the opponents and just went, oh yeah, yeah, no, we're on your side, we're on your"
00:15:16,00:15:21,"side, please don't kick us out of Naples and Napoleon was absolutely furious about that."
00:15:21,00:15:27,Napoleon was just surrounded by these bloody siblings who all wanted stuff from him. They
00:15:27,00:15:31,were all hopeless. Not one of them had the military now. It's insane. He was one of eight
00:15:31,00:15:36,"children and he gave all his siblings jobs and thrones. He was, you know, a rest of development."
00:15:36,00:15:40,He's like the Michael Bluth who's just trying to keep things together. All the other useless
00:15:40,00:15:45,"magician siblings just turn up. I really like this a cat. So he had another sister called,"
00:15:45,00:15:52,"sorry, he had a wife, Josephine, of course, he married and made the Empress of France"
00:15:52,00:15:59,"at his coronation. At the coronation, which was I think 1804, his sisters and his sisters in law,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,"so his brother's wives, they were told, look, Josephine is becoming the Empress of France."
00:16:03,00:16:08,"So in the ceremony, we'd like you to carry the train of her dress along the, you know,"
00:16:08,00:16:13,along the aisle at Notre Dame where the ceremony is happening. Joseph was so furious about this.
00:16:13,00:16:18,"He said he was going to move to Germany just to spite Napoleon. And then Pauline, Pauline was"
00:16:18,00:16:22,"one of the best Napoleon's of the lot. She was so entertaining. She and the other two sisters,"
00:16:22,00:16:28,they only agreed to carry Josephine's train if they would have other people carrying their trains.
00:16:28,00:16:34,"So there was this mad conga of dresses along the aisle. And then, and then just as Josephine got to"
00:16:34,00:16:38,"the actual throne and was about to turn and sit down, Napoleon's sisters who were carrying it,"
00:16:38,00:16:44,"they all pulled it back so she couldn't move. Yes, they just held her up. And Napoleon gave"
00:16:44,00:16:47,them an extremely angry look. And then they relented and let go and she sat down. And it's
00:16:47,00:16:53,just mad. Why didn't they relent and let go at the exact moment that would mean she fell flat on
00:16:53,00:16:59,"her face? Surely that's the finale. It's really interesting because lots of, I mean, lots of"
00:16:59,00:17:03,"the siblings, especially I think the brothers who were given, you know, bits of Spain and Portugal"
00:17:03,00:17:10,and all of this were just not as talented. But this was Napoleon's attempt to recreate a royal
00:17:10,00:17:14,"family. And if he hadn't done that, I wonder how much more successful he would have been in his"
00:17:14,00:17:19,"attempt to take over the whole of Europe. But because he went into dynasty mode, you know,"
00:17:19,00:17:22,it was one of the things that led to disaster anyway.
00:17:22,00:17:25,"Yeah, it's Trump. He was the Trump of his time, wasn't he?"
00:17:25,00:17:27,Kind of. Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:30,You've got to put your kids and siblings in high places.
00:17:30,00:17:35,"I was reading a bit more about Paulie, one of the other sisters, one of the older sisters."
00:17:35,00:17:40,"She was amazing. She had a life-size statue of herself commissioned by her husband,"
00:17:40,00:17:45,which could revolve. It just had this inner mechanical system and it just would turn around.
00:17:45,00:17:50,"I've no idea how. But my favourite thing about her is that she liked to bathe in milk, right?"
00:17:50,00:17:55,"Which is, you know, classic, you know, very affluent lady stuff. But then she would follow"
00:17:55,00:17:59,her milk bath with a milk shower just to wash off the milk that was from the milk bath.
00:17:59,00:18:02,Why? How did they do that when they used to have milk showers and milk baths?
00:18:02,00:18:07,Did they then have a water surf or did they just smell a rank gone off milk all the time?
00:18:07,00:18:09,I don't know.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"I just, I think that was the desirable fragrance."
00:18:11,00:18:12,What? Gone off milk?
00:18:12,00:18:14,It was still a proper shower. Gone off milk.
00:18:14,00:18:17,"Everyone likes cheese, James. Everyone likes cheese."
00:18:17,00:18:20,"Yeah. I like cheese, I must say. I do like cheese."
00:18:20,00:18:23,Imagine a woman smelling like a lovely red lester.
00:18:26,00:18:30,"Pauline was, yeah, she was wild. She was the wild one. And I've been trying to verify this,"
00:18:30,00:18:35,but in one book it said she once asked a servant to lie on the floor with her breasts out so that
00:18:35,00:18:40,"she could warm her feet in them, apparently. And she was really..."
00:18:40,00:18:41,In the breasts.
00:18:41,00:18:45,"No, within the cleavage, right? You'd be within the cleavage and you would use the breasts."
00:18:45,00:18:48,"You would have to hold the cleavage together, I imagine."
00:18:48,00:18:50,You need a wunderbar for that.
00:18:50,00:18:51,"You would do, yeah."
00:18:51,00:18:53,But you'd have to have two servants. You'd have to have one foot.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"You'd have to have one foot per cleavage, wouldn't you?"
00:18:55,00:18:56,Yes.
00:18:56,00:18:59,"And actually, do you know that if you used to go to clerks in the olden days,"
00:18:59,00:19:04,that's how you used to measure your feet. There would be someone laying there with their breasts
00:19:04,00:19:08,"open and you would put your foot in between them and they'd say, ""You're a size 12."""
00:19:08,00:19:10,"God, it was a different time, wasn't it?"
00:19:10,00:19:11,You're a double C.
00:19:11,00:19:15,"I sort of imagined it, actually, is going under the breasts."
00:19:15,00:19:20,"So I was weirdly imagining it, I suppose, of a rather elderly servant with heavy sag,"
00:19:20,00:19:24,"where you could slot a foot under each breast, which would also work."
00:19:24,00:19:26,Also nice.
00:19:26,00:19:29,Marat Caroline Tosman was a character as well.
00:19:29,00:19:33,"And they actually sound a little bit like, I want to say,"
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, maybe."
00:19:35,00:19:38,So they were both very flashy.
00:19:38,00:19:42,"He was called the Dandy King because he liked to parade around the streets of Paris,"
00:19:42,00:19:44,dressed like a stage king.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Dressed like Desperate Dad.
00:19:45,00:19:49,"Yeah, that's right."
00:19:49,00:19:50,With a huge cow pie.
00:19:50,00:19:52,He was very good looking.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"I think he was slightly out of Caroline's league, maybe, looks wise."
00:19:56,00:19:59,"And he was so vain that even at the end, he was executed by a firing squad"
00:19:59,00:20:02,for sticking with Napoleon a little bit too long.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"And before he was executed, his very last words were,"
00:20:05,00:20:09,"""Soldiers, do your duty straight to the heart, but spare the face."""
00:20:09,00:20:10,Wow.
00:20:10,00:20:15,Couldn't bear the idea of his face being lost to the world.
00:20:15,00:20:18,"Not going to be much use to him after he's lost his heart, though, is it?"
00:20:18,00:20:18,Yeah.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"No, but at least he looks fit at the funeral."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"I understand that impulse, I must say."
00:20:23,00:20:24,"I do, too."
00:20:24,00:20:26,I can kind of say the same thing.
00:20:26,00:20:27,Yeah?
00:20:27,00:20:29,"I'm not claiming to be a looker, I'm just saying."
00:20:29,00:20:32,"""Go for the heart or the face, but spare the inner ear."""
00:20:32,00:20:40,"Josephine was originally called Rose, wasn't she?"
00:20:40,00:20:41,She was called Rose.
00:20:41,00:20:44,And then Napoleon decided that he wanted to call her Josephine.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Possibly.
00:20:45,00:20:50,"We're not sure why, but possibly because her previous lovers will have called her Rose."
00:20:51,00:20:56,And he didn't want her to have the same name as her ex-boyfriends knew her as.
00:20:56,00:20:58,And she kind of put up with it.
00:20:58,00:21:04,"But on the other hand, she was massively into roses later in life."
00:21:04,00:21:09,And a lot of people wonder if maybe the reason she was so into roses was just to annoy Napoleon.
00:21:09,00:21:13,And so she would get roses brought over from England and plant them in Paris.
00:21:13,00:21:18,"And she would get special passports for these roses so that when the war was happening,"
00:21:18,00:21:22,they could still come from overseas because she loved roses so much.
00:21:22,00:21:27,"She needs a therapist to work through that with her, I think, the rose session."
00:21:27,00:21:29,"Yeah, she's got some unresolved issues there."
00:21:29,00:21:32,I think that's Napoleon being a bit controlling there.
00:21:32,00:21:36,"And I know he was famously quite a controlling man, CF all of Europe."
00:21:36,00:21:41,"But I think it's definitely true that when you would ask your girlfriend to change her name,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,that is controlling.
00:21:43,00:21:48,"Yeah, I like that in the initial change, people would have got confused and ended up calling her"
00:21:48,00:21:52,Rosophine and just sounding like Scooby-Doo.
00:21:52,00:21:54,Rosophine!
00:21:54,00:21:59,The only other thing about Napoleon's marriage to Josephine that I know is that on his actual
00:21:59,00:22:03,"wedding night, he kept Josephine waiting for two hours because he was busy planning the invasion"
00:22:03,00:22:07,of Italy. And he got so excited and carried away that he forgot the time.
00:22:07,00:22:09,He just turned up at midnight or whatever.
00:22:10,00:22:12,Did she think it was a euphemism for the first hour and a half?
00:22:12,00:22:15,"He said, ""I'm planning the invasion of Italy, my love."""
00:22:15,00:22:18,"No, this is way around a metaphor."
00:22:18,00:22:29,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy."
00:22:29,00:22:32,My fact is that a Chinese tech firm has recently been busted
00:22:32,00:22:35,for spying on its employees via their bottoms.
00:22:38,00:22:42,This is just a story that was in the news lately. It's a firm called Hebo Logistic Technology.
00:22:42,00:22:46,"It's a tech firm, and they issued all their stuff with smart cushions, and these cushions were"
00:22:46,00:22:49,going to monitor their health and make sure they were staying healthy in the workplace.
00:22:49,00:22:53,"These cushions are incredible. You sit on them, they monitor your heart rate, your breathing,"
00:22:53,00:22:59,"how tired you are, your posture, everything. But the problem was the cushion was also a snitch,"
00:22:59,00:23:04,"and it reported when you were not sitting at your desk, and the company had full data,"
00:23:04,00:23:07,"and it just started asking people, ""Hey, why are you not at your desk at these times?"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"Hey, you've been leaving 10 minutes early a few days in a row."
00:23:09,00:23:15,You're missing. Human resources just completely went off on one and started using
00:23:15,00:23:18,"the Robo Cushion Bum Spies for evil."""
00:23:18,00:23:26,"The company did deny it, didn't it? The company said that they're just collecting trial data,"
00:23:26,00:23:31,"not monitoring employees, but then they don't explain how a couple of HR staffers were going"
00:23:31,00:23:33,"up to people saying, ""Oh, notice you're knocking off a bit early."""
00:23:34,00:23:38,Yeah. Maybe HR just went broke. You know what HR are like.
00:23:38,00:23:44,Do you now go into the company headquarters and everyone's just got their cushions strapped to
00:23:44,00:23:49,"their arse? Because that's what I do. Yeah, that's a good idea. Feet the tech."
00:23:49,00:23:52,But then it would think that you'd suddenly become extremely light.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"You've lost a lot of weight, sure."
00:23:54,00:24:00,"You could just have a sack of beetroots and leave that on your desk at all times, and it would..."
00:24:00,00:24:06,"Oh, yeah. You could do that Indiana Jones thing of swapping the golden icon for a bag of..."
00:24:06,00:24:10,"I think a bag of beetroots though, is that's going to leave a telltale red stain on your cushion,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,isn't it? I'm not going to...
00:24:12,00:24:13,"Don't be more worried about your health, to be honest."
00:24:13,00:24:18,You appear to be bleeding heavily every day you sit down.
00:24:18,00:24:25,"The Chinese Communist Party official organ, which is the Global Times, the newspaper,"
00:24:26,00:24:31,they had someone who was a lawyer who said that they think this is probably illegal.
00:24:31,00:24:36,So even the Communist Party are kind of on the employee side of this.
00:24:36,00:24:41,They're saying you can kind of maybe test people and see what's happening.
00:24:41,00:24:46,"But if you're giving the information to even to another employee, even to HR, then that might be"
00:24:46,00:24:51,an issue. It does keep happening though. This kind of workplace buying technology is normally
00:24:51,00:24:56,"computer-based, obviously, because it's easier than giving people cushions."
00:24:56,00:24:58,There must be computers in the cushions though.
00:24:58,00:25:02,"You're right. What is a computer, I guess, is what we're asking? What is a cushion?"
00:25:02,00:25:09,"The age old question, first posed by Plato, never answered since."
00:25:09,00:25:14,"No, this happens everywhere. I couldn't believe it. Spyware."
00:25:14,00:25:18,"So in 2018, it was reported that half of large companies are using some kind of monitoring"
00:25:18,00:25:24,techniques on their employees. So that's things like you have software set up that analyzes the
00:25:24,00:25:29,"text of their emails, their social media messages of biometric data."
00:25:29,00:25:34,"And then in COVID, that's massively searched because people are working at home."
00:25:34,00:25:38,"So I think demand has gone up by 108%. So you're all being spied on, guys."
00:25:38,00:25:43,"Yeah, there was Barclays in 2017. This was in the UK thing."
00:25:43,00:25:50,"And they put a black box underneath everyone's desk and people just went into the office and went,"
00:25:50,00:25:53,"""Why is there a black box under my desk?"" And they went, ""Oh, no, it's nothing. It's nothing."""
00:25:53,00:25:59,"And it turned out to be something called Occupy, which is like Occupy, but EYE at the end."
00:25:59,00:26:04,And it's a heat and motion sensor that can tell whether you're sat at your desk or not.
00:26:04,00:26:08,"And according to Barclays, the sensors weren't monitoring you. They weren't checking if you"
00:26:08,00:26:12,were at your desk. They were just seeing whether the office space was being used efficiently.
00:26:12,00:26:18,"And maybe if you're not your desk very often, we could put a water cooler there or something."
00:26:19,00:26:24,"I don't know about that, but they were saying that, ""Oh, no, it's not to check up on people."""
00:26:24,00:26:29,"The Daily Telegraph did that, too. They got busted because they happened to employ a few"
00:26:29,00:26:32,journalists there who noticed what the hell was this.
00:26:32,00:26:36,"It's the easiest day of work of your life, isn't it? That investigative projects"
00:26:36,00:26:40,"literally didn't have to leave my desk, which is good because my employees are monitoring me all"
00:26:40,00:26:47,"the time. I was just surprised generally, actually, how much of our planet probably is spying on us"
00:26:47,00:26:54,"and us not knowing it. Because looking into the '50s and '60s of the CIA, FBI, the Chinese government,"
00:26:54,00:27:02,"like, everything seems to have been bugged. Dog poo using as transmitter devices."
00:27:02,00:27:05,"So if you see dog poo on the ground, it's quite possible it's not dog poo,"
00:27:05,00:27:07,it's a listening device or a tracking device.
00:27:07,00:27:14,"Yeah, I mean, anything's possible. It's extremely unlikely that if you see dog poo on the ground,"
00:27:14,00:27:15,that is a listening device people.
00:27:15,00:27:20,"But James, whenever I want to have a close personal conversation with someone,"
00:27:20,00:27:24,"and I don't want anyone to overhear it, I make sure to have a conversation near some dog poo"
00:27:24,00:27:27,"so that people see the dog poo and think, ""Oh, I don't want to go near those guys having a chat."""
00:27:27,00:27:31,"One interesting thing is that, obviously, the thing is when you and I are having a chat in the"
00:27:31,00:27:36,"street, Andy, let's say, obviously, we're going to be at least, you know, five and a half, six"
00:27:36,00:27:41,feet away from the dog poo. So that's when they started this theory that you should hang it on
00:27:41,00:27:46,trees so that it's always at a head height so that you can hear people talking when I go.
00:27:46,00:27:51,"But that's assuming you have a bag on you, right? So the whole idea of this is that"
00:27:51,00:27:56,who's going to pick up raw poo off the ground? So your transmitter device or your bugging device
00:27:56,00:27:59,is just going to remain dormant there because why would you ever touch it?
00:27:59,00:28:03,"But people who have got poo all the time, we have people who are employed to clean the streets."
00:28:03,00:28:06,"Oh, maybe one of those filthy days."
00:28:06,00:28:10,"This is an old, this is a 1970s technology before we invented string cleaning."
00:28:10,00:28:12,When there was four everywhere.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"Yeah. But before there was two and it was shit-laden everywhere. Yeah, exactly."
00:28:16,00:28:17,How have we invented the bin?
00:28:17,00:28:21,"Freaked out, would you be if you trodden some dog poo, thought, ""Oh, no, I've troddened"
00:28:21,00:28:24,"in some dog poo."" And then you looked down and there was just sort of glistening microphone"
00:28:24,00:28:27,entrails inside there. You'd go mad.
00:28:27,00:28:31,Or that when you went on Facebook and you got adverts for dog poo cleaning products.
00:28:31,00:28:34,Dan. On your shoes.
00:28:34,00:28:39,"You've made this assertion here, but you haven't explained, you know, what..."
00:28:39,00:28:41,Yes. What was the context? Yeah.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Oh, well, I would say."
00:28:42,00:28:45,"Why were they doing it? Why were they doing it, et cetera?"
00:28:45,00:28:51,So this was 1970s. These were part of devices that have all been invented by the CIA in order to
00:28:51,00:28:55,"track, to bug, to... Yeah, so it would be everything from..."
00:28:55,00:29:00,"Yeah, they created these poos and you can see examples of them that were tracking devices."
00:29:00,00:29:06,You can see tree stumps that they invent or that they built that when you open them up had a huge
00:29:06,00:29:13,tracking and radio transmission device inside. So they would leave those sort of cut off trees in
00:29:13,00:29:19,"the wood near places where they knew spies might be active. They have the great rectal tool kit,"
00:29:19,00:29:23,"which is not quite for spying in the sense that we're talking about, but was a nice little"
00:29:23,00:29:25,addition in the list. It's like this big giant pill that you would shove.
00:29:25,00:29:32,"It's not as big. Dan, I've been to the museum in Washington, DC, where they have this rectal"
00:29:32,00:29:38,"tool kit and when you just showed us on the zoom how big it was, you were talking probably the"
00:29:38,00:29:42,"size of an American football and I could see... No, no, no, no. It's more of a Coke. I'd say"
00:29:42,00:29:47,"it's a Coke can that Dan's showing us. I'm showing a Coke can size. Yeah, exactly."
00:29:47,00:29:51,"What size are you talking? It was full of knives. Yeah, what are we talking then,"
00:29:51,00:29:54,James? How big was it? It would be a chunky tampon for sure.
00:29:54,00:30:00,"A super heavy flow tampon. Well, it's a lot bigger than a tampon, I would say. It's like"
00:30:01,00:30:04,three tampons strapped together. Everything seems like a reasonable size until you have
00:30:04,00:30:11,"to put it up your bump, you know? James, didn't you see when you were at that museum,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,didn't you see a pair of fake testicles to wear over your testicles?
00:30:14,00:30:21,"Scrotum, yeah, yeah. Fake scrotum, yeah. Again, normal scrotum sized. Well, slightly bigger."
00:30:21,00:30:27,"Slightly bigger, yeah. That is incredible, that fake scrotum thing, because it's so clever."
00:30:28,00:30:32,"I don't think it was really ever used properly in the field, but it had a radio in it."
00:30:32,00:30:37,"So, if you were dropped over in enemy lines, they're going to look for stuff on you,"
00:30:37,00:30:40,but they're possibly not going to look inside your scrotum.
00:30:40,00:30:44,"Right. They may look at your scrotum, but they wouldn't know it would be paranoid enough."
00:30:44,00:30:47,"They would look at it if it was plain, smooth FM or something like that."
00:30:47,00:30:52,Exactly. Archer's theme tune coming out. Zoe Ball starts talking.
00:30:52,00:30:58,"Zoe Ball. Oh, dear."
00:30:58,00:31:02,"Yeah. None of these things were ever any use, is what I think. I think it's been McIntyre"
00:31:02,00:31:05,"or someone else who's sort of gone through and gone, why are they putting so much effort"
00:31:05,00:31:10,"into these stupid technologies, which were never useful, rather than actually just making peace?"
00:31:10,00:31:14,"Well, possibly. I mean, to make the Soviets think that you're doing these crazy things,"
00:31:14,00:31:20,"when actually you're useful things, which are tiny little listening devices that are on things"
00:31:20,00:31:23,that actually go into embassies they don't think of. Yeah.
00:31:23,00:31:28,"Yeah. On companies buying on you, but for good reasons, for health purposes,"
00:31:28,00:31:33,"Stanford University have created this smart toilet. I think we've researched this for QI this year,"
00:31:33,00:31:39,"but it is pretty amazing. So, it scans employees' bums, and the idea of that is that it can build"
00:31:39,00:31:43,"up a whole health profile of you. So, without knowing it, it can diagnose you with some,"
00:31:43,00:31:46,"you know, horrible illness that you wouldn't have known you have for three years."
00:31:47,00:31:55,"And it's because, basically, our anuses are all individual, are all special. So, the lining,"
00:31:55,00:31:59,"the anoderm, the lining of your anus is like a fingerprint."
00:31:59,00:32:03,I've just learned a new word. That's really anoderm. Yeah.
00:32:03,00:32:04,The anoderm. Yeah.
00:32:04,00:32:09,"Oh, I thought you said anoderm, which sounds a lot more, well, Mad Max than anoderm."
00:32:09,00:32:15,You will be given this American football.
00:32:16,00:32:26,"It's not an inverted dome. It's a dome. And basically, it scans it so it can tell who you are,"
00:32:26,00:32:32,"and then it analyses the quality of your excretions. So, you know, if you've got a green poo,"
00:32:32,00:32:37,"it's your wee bit funny smelling, and then it will upload this onto your kind of health"
00:32:37,00:32:42,"profile that it keeps, and it can alert you if your health is, you know, bit dodged."
00:32:42,00:32:47,It needs to be a bit of consistency. Isn't that nice? And it's all it said was the press release
00:32:47,00:32:52,from Stanford said the only thing holding it back really is that to fully reap the benefits of the
00:32:52,00:32:57,"smart toilet, users must make peace with the camera that scans their anus when they go to the loo."
00:32:57,00:32:59,"Yeah, that's the thing."
00:32:59,00:33:05,Is that the future of higher security to getting into these sort of top secret rooms? You've got
00:33:05,00:33:09,"to take your trousers down and scan them. You always see them scanning their palm or their iris,"
00:33:09,00:33:14,"don't you? Yeah. But what if, like, one of the bad guys steals your anal derm to try and get"
00:33:14,00:33:19,"into the top secret place? Next Mission Impossible movie, please use this advice."
00:33:19,00:33:28,"Anyway, so I was looking at CCTV and looking at the inventor of that, and this was an African"
00:33:28,00:33:35,"American lady called Marie Van Britton Brown. And she lived in Queens, and there was a very high"
00:33:35,00:33:41,crime rate. And so she started off by getting her door and she put three peep holes in her door at
00:33:41,00:33:47,"different heights, sort of one high, one medium and one low. And the idea was that tall, average"
00:33:47,00:33:51,heights and children would all be able to look in a different peep hole. So this was her first
00:33:51,00:33:58,idea of a security thing. And then she set up a camera outside so that people who look through
00:33:58,00:34:03,the peep hole will be able to see like around the corner and stuff like that. And then she put loads
00:34:03,00:34:08,of cameras in and she came up with a wireless television system where you'd be able to see
00:34:08,00:34:12,from all the different cameras. And this was the first ever radio controlled wireless system for
00:34:12,00:34:20,cameras and the first ever CCTV. When was that? She got the patents in 1969. And this is the best
00:34:20,00:34:25,"thing about her, which I'd love to believe this. I've only seen this on Wikipedia, so it might not"
00:34:25,00:34:32,"be true. But her mother, father and grandmother were all named DD. Isn't that weird? I mean,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,"that is just going to be, that's a sitcom waiting to be read, isn't it?"
00:34:35,00:34:42,"No, that's the thing to play. That's one of Shakespeare's most awful comedies where everyone's"
00:34:42,00:34:47,got the same name and happens to look identical. And they're all on the CCTV. She should have called
00:34:47,00:34:54,"it DDTV. Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess the future Shakespeare's will be writing about everyone"
00:34:54,00:35:00,who had the same name and identical anuses. That's right. Can't tell one DD anus from the next.
00:35:02,00:35:07,Henry Ford was maybe the first employer to really standardize spying on your employees.
00:35:07,00:35:13,"And I didn't know the extent to which he did this, but he used to just send out secret agents to go"
00:35:13,00:35:18,"and watch his employees in their private lives. Well, they weren't secret because actually everyone"
00:35:18,00:35:24,"knew that he was doing it, so they were agents. But this is like 1914 and everyone wants to work"
00:35:24,00:35:30,in its factories because they're the big cheese. And he employed a team of 200 agents who would go
00:35:30,00:35:34,"and question all his employees on their personal lives, on their marriages, on what they ate,"
00:35:34,00:35:39,"on, I don't know, their exercise routines and check. And he said it was to check that you are"
00:35:39,00:35:47,"clean living and then your wages would depend on how clean living you were. And so, yeah, I know,"
00:35:47,00:35:51,"it's not great. Wait a minute. No, because what's the point of being clean living to get loads more"
00:35:51,00:35:56,money? What are you going to spend your extra money on if you can't spend it on huckers and cocaine?
00:35:56,00:35:59,I guess you've just got to buy one of Henry Ford's cars. Maybe that's the aim.
00:35:59,00:36:06,"People used to cheat it. Apparently, there was a boarding house, for instance, where 11 of his"
00:36:06,00:36:11,workers lived. And it was run by this landlady and agents would come round and interview them but
00:36:11,00:36:17,one at a time. And each one would always borrow the landlady to stand in as their wife when they
00:36:17,00:36:23,"got interviewed to say that they were married. So funny. So what, they just went house to house"
00:36:23,00:36:28,"and they saw the same woman popping up again and again. Yeah, yeah, this is like a Shakespearean"
00:36:28,00:36:42,"play. And your name is also DD, I see. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that"
00:36:42,00:36:49,"is my fact. My fact is, in 2014, a former Apple employee called Sam Sung raised money for a"
00:36:49,00:36:55,"charity by auctioning his last remaining Apple business card that read, Sam Sung Specialist."
00:36:55,00:37:00,"That's amazing. They must have employed him because of his name. Listen,"
00:37:00,00:37:06,I don't know why would you know why employ your rival company to be saying they're
00:37:06,00:37:11,"Sam Sung Specialist within your shops? Well, because then Apple could sell a load of Samsung"
00:37:11,00:37:18,"products but pretend that they're named after this guy. Yeah, yeah, because that drinking is in"
00:37:18,00:37:26,"Peru, which is from the collar people and contains cocoa leaves and they call it Coca-Cola."
00:37:26,00:37:33,Wasn't it in the year 1304 or something? There was a girl in Europe called Diet Coke.
00:37:33,00:37:37,Yes. Yeah. Although she didn't capitalise on it like an idiot.
00:37:37,00:37:45,"The only group of people in the world who can go, yes, to someone saying, wasn't it in 1304?"
00:37:45,00:37:53,"It was. Did Sam really capitalise on this? I mean, how much did he actually make for this"
00:37:53,00:38:00,"business? He did. Okay. Well, no, I mean, he was an employee. He worked in an Apple store in Vancouver"
00:38:00,00:38:04,"at a Pacific centre, which is on his card. And he worked there for a couple of years."
00:38:04,00:38:10,"And he quit or left for whatever reasons. He was thinking, because people always used to ask him,"
00:38:10,00:38:14,"could I have a business card? And they always found it so funny. He just thought, you know,"
00:38:14,00:38:20,I want to raise some money for some children's charities. And what a good way to try and see
00:38:20,00:38:24,"if this generates anything. So what he did was he auctioned it as his final business card,"
00:38:24,00:38:32,"but not only that, he framed his former Apple employee T-shirt, his lanyard and the card in"
00:38:32,00:38:36,"there. And he put it up on eBay. He wasn't really expecting anything. And very quickly,"
00:38:36,00:38:43,"the auction price went up to $80,000. Yeah, but like with those things, he sort of went,"
00:38:43,00:38:48,"hang on, this can't be real. So he knocked them out and he went down to what he thought"
00:38:48,00:38:55,"must be the only genuine one and which ended up being in the $2,000 region. So still a nice,"
00:38:55,00:39:00,"yeah, a nice amount and just a nice little quirky. To be honest, it's the kind of thing I would buy"
00:39:00,00:39:06,on eBay. Yeah. Saying that's the kind of thing I would buy on eBay. That doesn't limit it to
00:39:06,00:39:12,anything on eBay. It doesn't narrow it down one bit. But it does answer what was going to be my
00:39:12,00:39:15,"next question, which was, who on earth would buy something like that?"
00:39:15,00:39:21,It narrows it down from anything that has any possible use.
00:39:21,00:39:27,"Yeah, you're right. Something that'll keep its value. We know it's not going to be that."
00:39:27,00:39:30,Wow. That's cool though. That's good.
00:39:30,00:39:36,"Yeah, you've got to love an imaginative attempt to raise money for charity. Did you guys read"
00:39:36,00:39:43,"about Joe Cooper, who was the 24 year old builder who him and 10 friends actually agreed to get"
00:39:43,00:39:48,their hair waxed off for a local hospital charity and there were onlookers doing it.
00:39:48,00:39:53,I think onlookers got to bid to be allowed to wax off a bit of hair and his mates had their chest
00:39:53,00:39:58,"hair waxed and then they pulled out and they said, ""I've had enough."" And he said, ""I'm going to go"
00:39:58,00:40:06,"for the testicles because it's for charity."" And he had a radio hidden in there that they"
00:40:06,00:40:12,didn't realise. The CIA had snuck in there. Yeah. His testicles are actually made of dog poo.
00:40:12,00:40:20,I think the phrase testicles made of dog poo is the worst thing we've said in 365 episodes.
00:40:20,00:40:27,"Well, you wait for the next bit. His friends paid various amounts to have a chance to rip off"
00:40:27,00:40:31,some of the hairs on his testicles. One of his friends pulled too enthusiastically
00:40:31,00:40:37,"and ripped off his six outer layers of skin, of seven, apparently. And he had to go to hospital"
00:40:37,00:40:40,and they told him that one more layer of skin and his testicle would have gone.
00:40:40,00:40:45,Wow. That's useful to know that we all have seven layers of skin on our testicles.
00:40:45,00:40:52,"Well, he claimed this is what the hospital told him. It's quite specific."
00:40:52,00:40:56,"And he only raised three grand, which I think is not enough. We're almost losing it all."
00:40:56,00:41:01,No. It doesn't even cover the costs of what it would have cost the hospital in money.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"Yeah, exactly. That's presumably the hospital he was raising money for."
00:41:05,00:41:08,Shit. That's a really good point. Does that cover the NHS cost of sowing someone's skin
00:41:08,00:41:14,"back onto their ball? Well, that is a thing, isn't it? There was a study of parachute jumps in"
00:41:14,00:41:19,Scotland a few years ago. These are all charity parachute jumps. And they looked at how much
00:41:19,00:41:24,you made compared to how much it cost the NHS when you landed badly and broke your ankles.
00:41:24,00:41:32,"And they turned out, I think it was for every pound that you got for the NHS."
00:41:32,00:41:38,It cost the NHS £13.75 and returned to look after you. And that's on average.
00:41:38,00:41:41,"Wait, so is that including the parachute jumps that go right?"
00:41:41,00:41:43,"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no."
00:41:43,00:41:48,"So basically, you only get a few hours. This was what the people were saying. I'm sure some"
00:41:48,00:41:52,"parachute jumps are different than this, but they were saying that they only got like six hours"
00:41:52,00:41:58,"of training. And when they were kind of falling down, the earth is rushing up and you just forget"
00:41:58,00:42:02,everything that you've been taught and you just kind of panic. And loads of people were like
00:42:02,00:42:07,getting broken ankles and stuff. And a couple of people went into surgery and surgery is very
00:42:07,00:42:12,expensive. And I think people were on average only making about 30 or 40 quid for charity.
00:42:12,00:42:15,"Well, it's just like... A parachute jump."
00:42:15,00:42:18,"Yeah. But it's, you know, you do it because your friends are doing it, right? Your friends"
00:42:18,00:42:22,"go, ""Do you want to do a parachute jump?"" You go, ""Yeah, sure."" And then it's hard to get people"
00:42:22,00:42:27,"to give money. Yeah. So there's a thing called the Martyrdom Effect, which is where people are"
00:42:27,00:42:33,willing to donate more if a fundraising effort will require pain or exertion. And we are recording
00:42:33,00:42:40,this obviously the day before we do 20 hours of podcasting in a row. And I think that world
00:42:40,00:42:45,calls pain and exertion. But have you guys heard of Peter Tripp? I don't think we've mentioned him
00:42:45,00:42:52,"before. Peter Tripp. He was a DJ. And in 1959, he decided to broadcast his regular show from Times"
00:42:52,00:43:00,Square for 200 hours. He sat in a booth and it went really badly wrong for him. It was bad.
00:43:00,00:43:07,Thanks for letting us know that. Literally under 24 hours before we do ours.
00:43:07,00:43:08,He died.
00:43:08,00:43:13,He was going 10 times longer than we're going.
00:43:13,00:43:18,"Yeah. So after 100 hours, which I don't think we're not going to run over and do 100 hours"
00:43:18,00:43:23,"tomorrow accidentally, but after 100 hours, he was no longer able to do simple maths or recite"
00:43:23,00:43:29,"the alphabet. After 120, he... Dan, have you been doing 19 hours before we started today?"
00:43:29,00:43:37,"Sorry. I'd like to kick into it, you know, just to get warm enough."
00:43:37,00:43:40,It was an open goal. I couldn't do anything. It just hit me a month in.
00:43:40,00:43:48,"So that was 100 hours. After 120, he walked into a nearby hotel to shower and change and he"
00:43:48,00:43:52,"opened a chest of drawers and he saw flames shooting out of it. At which point, he did not"
00:43:52,00:43:57,"think I'm hallucinating. He thought, ah, the scientists are trying to trick me. So he developed"
00:43:57,00:44:03,serious paranoid delusions. He was basically having dreams while awake and he started confessing to
00:44:03,00:44:07,"everyone around him. Thought, although everyone thought he was Peter Tripp, he was not actually"
00:44:07,00:44:12,Peter Tripp anymore. And he was drugged for the last 66 hours. I have no idea why someone didn't
00:44:12,00:44:17,"step in and say, we think this is not a bit far. And he did it. He made it through. But I think the"
00:44:17,00:44:23,"effects were lasted a while, a lifetime. So did you say he was broadcasting?"
00:44:23,00:44:28,"Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what the last 66 hours when he was drugged,"
00:44:28,00:44:31,but still awake and still broadcasting must have been like. They can't have been great.
00:44:31,00:44:38,"I was just looking at stupid charity attempts. And one is, well, it's actually a yearly"
00:44:38,00:44:45,"charity fundraising event in Japan. It's called Stop AIDS. So stop exclamation mark and then AIDS,"
00:44:45,00:44:49,which is a really weird place to put the exclamation mark in that sentence. But it's
00:44:49,00:44:57,so it's a Japanese charity that raises awareness by HIV and AIDS. And they hold an event and they've
00:44:57,00:45:03,"been doing it since the early 2000s, which the name loosely translates to boob aid. And it's but"
00:45:03,00:45:11,it's this event is run by an adult TV channel by porn channel. And what happens is they have their
00:45:11,00:45:20,"actresses stand and let people squeeze their, squeeze their breasts and pay money for them."
00:45:20,00:45:26,Do they let you warm your feet up? I think you have to pay double for that.
00:45:26,00:45:34,"And so it's very controversial, obviously, because it's raising money. But it does involve"
00:45:34,00:45:40,basically lots of sleazy men going up and squeezing a porn star's boob in order to do so.
00:45:40,00:45:43,"Yeah, it doesn't, the optics are not good. Yeah, the optics are poor."
00:45:43,00:45:48,"I mean, presumably they, they have to be told that you're not allowed to squeeze more than once"
00:45:48,00:45:55,"or whatever. I mean, they'd have, they'd have to be pulled off. You can squeeze multiple times,"
00:45:55,00:45:59,"but you have to pay multiple times. Anna, you're responding to something that really..."
00:45:59,00:46:03,"Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't believe you were doing that. So..."
00:46:03,00:46:07,"And for the, for the listener, Andy did a little dance afterwards while Anna was trying to..."
00:46:08,00:46:12,He grabbed his own breasts. Very nicely.
00:46:12,00:46:16,I will make a charitable donation to myself later on for doing it.
00:46:16,00:46:21,"That's disgusting. I honestly thought, I can't, I can't respond to that."
00:46:21,00:46:23,"Yes, they'd have to be pulled off. Thank you."
00:46:23,00:46:31,"There was a, there was a sheriff in America who I, I quite like. He's called Leon Lott,"
00:46:31,00:46:36,which is a good name. And he allowed himself to be tased to raise money for charity.
00:46:36,00:46:40,"So for every thousand dollars that was bid, he would let the tasing go on for an extra second."
00:46:40,00:46:46,"The winning bid was $2,000, which meant he was tased for two seconds, but I think that's probably..."
00:46:46,00:46:48,Yeah.
00:46:48,00:46:51,I don't know how much longer he could have let the bidding go on for before he would have
00:46:51,00:46:53,just been killed by the tasing.
00:46:53,00:46:55,I think Ed Ball's got tased.
00:46:55,00:46:58,"Yeah, but not for charity. It was for his documentary about..."
00:46:58,00:46:59,Yeah.
00:46:59,00:47:00,Something.
00:47:00,00:47:01,Didn't even want to raise money.
00:47:01,00:47:04,Interesting thing about Ed Ball's seven layers of skin.
00:47:04,00:47:05,Interesting.
00:47:05,00:47:14,One charity thing that I really like was from 1943.
00:47:14,00:47:20,And this was a book that was published in aid of the Famine Relief Committee
00:47:20,00:47:22,"called Famous People's Pigs, Blindfold."
00:47:22,00:47:27,And the way that this worked is they got a load of famous people to put on a blindfold
00:47:27,00:47:31,and draw a picture of a pig and then they put it in the book.
00:47:32,00:47:36,And they had Arthur Conan Dial did it.
00:47:36,00:47:39,George Bernard Shaw did it.
00:47:39,00:47:41,Jasper Maskeling did it.
00:47:41,00:47:46,Hiram Maxim who invented the machine gun did it.
00:47:46,00:47:51,They had some real big hitters who put on a blindfold and drew a picture of the pig.
00:47:51,00:47:54,I just wanted to make sure Miss understood and drew pig mainly.
00:47:54,00:47:56,Very good.
00:47:56,00:47:59,But yeah.
00:47:59,00:48:00,That's so funny.
00:48:00,00:48:02,And the pictures are online.
00:48:02,00:48:03,You can see them.
00:48:03,00:48:10,The one that Hiram Maxim drew is one of the worst things I have ever seen in my entire
00:48:10,00:48:11,really.
00:48:11,00:48:14,It just looks like nothing.
00:48:14,00:48:18,"It's just loads of lines and you could kind of make out that it's supposed to be an animal,"
00:48:18,00:48:22,but the legs are in the middle of the body and the heads kind of off the body and stuff like that.
00:48:22,00:48:25,And then they asked him about it afterwards.
00:48:25,00:48:27,"They said, what's going on with this pig?"
00:48:27,00:48:33,"And he said, I have just a suspicion that the pigs that are so well drawn in your album are by"
00:48:33,00:48:35,people who had their eyes partly open.
00:48:35,00:48:40,The trouble with my pig is that my eyes were too tightly closed.
00:48:40,00:48:43,So he thought everyone else was cheating.
00:48:43,00:48:45,He was so shit at drawing a pig.
00:48:45,00:48:47,What an accusation to throw around.
00:48:47,00:48:47,Wow.
00:48:47,00:48:49,That looks like sour grapes to me.
00:48:49,00:48:50,"Sounds like it, doesn't it?"
00:48:50,00:48:52,Let's hope he didn't design his gun blindfolded.
00:48:52,00:48:54,No.
00:48:54,00:48:55,Bit disaster.
00:48:55,00:48:58,"James, when you said famous people's pigs blindfolded, my mind immediately went to there"
00:48:58,00:49:03,must have been enough celebrity pig owners in the UK who will be willing to put a blindfold
00:49:03,00:49:04,on their own pig.
00:49:04,00:49:09,And then I guess you would have to guess as the reader who whose pig is this.
00:49:09,00:49:10,Who the pig it would belong to.
00:49:10,00:49:13,"Agatha Christie's pig wearing a blindfold, but yours is better."
00:49:13,00:49:14,I can see that.
00:49:14,00:49:18,"That's suggesting though, Andy, we would recognize celebrities pigs based on their eyes, right?"
00:49:18,00:49:21,"That's Agatha's, isn't it?"
00:49:21,00:49:22,"Yeah, you're absolutely right."
00:49:22,00:49:24,You've got to blindfold them.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"You could get Rebecca Loose's pig, of course."
00:49:26,00:49:30,"But then if you don't want to ruin the picture, she doesn't have to be pulled off."
00:49:30,00:49:33,"Oh, good."
00:49:33,00:49:34,"That's staying in, is it?"
00:49:34,00:49:40,"Okay, that's it."
00:49:40,00:49:41,That is all of our facts.

00:50:23,00:50:26,"I couldn't believe that last couple of hours when Andy,"
00:50:26,00:50:27,we put him on a load of drugs.
00:50:27,00:50:28,Do you remember?
00:50:28,00:50:29,Oh yeah.
00:50:29,00:50:30,Yeah.
00:50:30,00:50:30,I'm not Andy.
00:50:30,00:50:31,I'm not Andy.
00:50:31,00:50:35,"Well done, whoever sent pie to his chest of drawers."
00:50:35,00:50:36,That really freaks him out.
