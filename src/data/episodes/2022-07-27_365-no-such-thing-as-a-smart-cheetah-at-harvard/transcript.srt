00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,840
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,840
 you from four undisclosed locations in the UK. My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,040
 Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,080
 the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:45,120
 here we go. Starting with fact number one and that is Anna. My fact this week is that for cheaters

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,200
 slowing down is more important than running fast or speeding up. Wow more important in what way?

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,200
 Yeah in the successful kill rate. Is that because if they just carried on speeding up forever they'd

9
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,840
 have no time to eat their kill? You can't just run and run and run and expect to have a meal at the

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,800
 end of the day. It's not quite that so this is a few studies that have been done actually into

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,240
 kind of cheater locomotion. The one I was reading was 2013 and the scientist spent nearly 10 years

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,400
 designing a battery-powered solar-charged kind of tracking collar and then they put it on cheaters

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
 and so it measured exactly you know when they're speeding up, when they're slowing down etc and

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,360
 then it looked at when they were successful in hunts and when they weren't and basically one of

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,520
 the things it said is they don't actually run that fast when they're hunting so people think

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,160
 that they're cracking 60 miles an hour all the time but they basically don't go over 40 really

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,880
 when they're hunting and it said that the key factor that affected whether or not they caught

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,320
 something seemed to be how fast they slowed down. Is that all the decision over whether the prey

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
 lives or dies is made right at the kind of end game? You know the cheater is really good at

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
 getting right up close but actually once they're slowed down that's where the zebra either lives

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
 or dies and it's in the manoeuvrability. That's a good way of describing it. You really kill

22
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
 something when you're motionless don't you? It's amazing it bothers to run at all considering

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,800
 that this is the... We should just wait for the zebras to come to it. Pretty much yeah. Just stand

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,520
 still with your mouth open like a cartoon. Some animals do that don't they? Some animals you'll

25
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
 get like worms who live in the sand in the ocean and they just sit there waiting until

26
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,600
 something comes past and then they suck it up. Do you remember those snakes that live in the cave

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,400
 and they just hang around hovering near the mouth of a cave and as the bats fly out of the cave at

28
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,640
 night bang they grab them. Yeah or bears that sit in the river that have the salmon just flying

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,280
 into their mouth. Oh yeah. You know when they're leaping up. Yeah see the cheaters have watched

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,240
 all these documentaries and gone why am I just doing that? Or us just kind of sitting at home

31
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,400
 waiting for Deliveroo to arrive with our pizzas. There's a difference between that and actually

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,680
 going to McDonald's and getting a takeaway yourself isn't it? That's basically the analogy here.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
 Yeah. There we go we've hit on it. Took us a while but we got there. I get the door pretty

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,920
 damn fast and Deliveroo driver arrives. My acceleration is through. But the thing is you

35
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,920
 have to stop when he gets there otherwise you're going to run straight past him. That's what we're

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
 saying. That's a good point. It's the same thing. Do you know what the most impressive bit of the

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,040
 cheater is or yeah physically the most impressive thing? I thought like maybe it's legs or it's

38
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,600
 lungs or something. Yeah well me being a controversialist I picked the inner ear.

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 So this is it genuinely is a bit of the cheater which is really really good at its job. It has

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,000
 this unbelievably massive inner ear system and the reason that's good is that while it moves

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,720
 it means it can keep its head unbelievably still because if any one of us was running at 40 miles

42
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
 an hour, firstly we'd be doing very well and secondly our head would be all over the place.

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,320
 We wouldn't be able to see what we were doing. We'd be sort of bobbing around going ah but the

44
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,480
 cheater can keep completely locked on its prey and that's because it has a huge inner ear so it

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,640
 keeps its visual stability even while it's going at 40 or 50 miles an hour. And probably really

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,600
 important when it changes direction as well right? Yeah because we can go at 40 miles an hour in a

47
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,800
 car for instance and we don't like our heads don't explode but it's all the movement and stuff right.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,400
 Well speak for yourself James. I've never tried getting up to those speeds myself.

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,680
 You're on the motorway in the inner lane, 39 all the way. There's this theory that cheaters

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,400
 they heat up too much that's why they have really short running speeds like they run for a short

51
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,640
 amount of time and then they stop because if they don't they'll overheat. And the reason we think

52
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,880
 that is because there was a study in 1973 in Harvard and they got some cheaters and they flew

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,160
 them over to Harvard and they made them run on treadmills with thermometers stuck up their buns

54
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,920
 and it was these readings that they used to say well obviously they can only run a certain amount

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,200
 of time before they overheat but of course in the wild cheaters don't run with thermometers

56
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:11,600
 up their buns in Harvard on treadmills and so there was a scientist called Robin Heaton from

57
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,240
 a university of Witwatersrand in South Africa and she actually put some she put some actual

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
 sensors inside of the cheaters like surgically put them really really small ones and so we

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
 can get a much better idea of what they do and she's disproved this idea that they overheat

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,200
 when running. Because they do overheat when eating apparently this might be part of the

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:38,400
 same thing and this is because they are super stressed when they eat so dinner is not a fun

62
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
 experience for a cheater because they think it's because of the anxiety that someone's going to

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,120
 come and steal your food and so when they're eating they're prey their body temperature goes up.

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,360
 Right. The closest that one of these sort of let's say the Harvard-esque cheaters so the ones

65
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,840
 that were collared that were zoo-reared got to was 59 so they can actually still get to these

66
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,840
 high points as well and the one that managed to do that was called Ferrari which is rather nice

67
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,600
 that was the cheaters name but what was weird was in the study as well because they did 367

68
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,520
 runs of clocking them and seeing how fast they could go only a quarter of those ended in a kill

69
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,480
 and apparently cheaters are quite crap but actually doing the deal.

70
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,960
 This was in Harvard they were doing that. Who were they killing? They were just going after

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,880
 students. Endless post-grad students. No, these are not the Harvard ones. These are the ones

72
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
 from the other study. I was saying the similar to the Harvard ones. They're on the treadmill.

73
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,960
 They're on the treadmill in front running as fast as they can on their treadmill.

74
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
 Interestingly in the cheater world if you say you went to Harvard that's actually a lame thing to be

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,320
 because you didn't run quite as fast but you had a thermometer up your bum.

76
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,320
 Yeah, but you're super smart, you know. So that's where the cue does it.

77
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,160
 Not smart enough to remove the thermometer, are you?

78
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,960
 That feels like one of those sorority pranks, doesn't it? You strip naked, thermometer up the

79
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,920
 ass, put on a treadmill. Do you know who the first European to scientifically describe the cheater

80
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,720
 was? Well, someone who went to Africa. So like Mary Kingsley or someone, no.

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,000
 Interesting. It was actually Daniel von Schreiber.

82
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 What? You're kidding.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,960
 Your former self, Dan, your career's really taken a nose dive but in 1777 it was,

84
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,360
 he's called Johann Christian Daniel von Schreiber and he actually didn't even see a cheater.

85
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,600
 He based his description on the skin of a cheater and he gave it a scientific name

86
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,880
 and described it. So there you go, Dan, your namesake. Well done.

87
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
 And everything you said just sounds like it could have been me as well. Didn't actually see it,

88
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 didn't actually have anything, wasn't actually there.

89
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,640
 Another thing about cheaters is unlike all the other big cats, they're kind of quite close to

90
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,200
 house cats and one way you can tell this especially is that they don't roar like a lion does or a tiger

91
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,280
 does. They meow and they purr because they have a different kind of voice box to lions and tigers

92
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,000
 and stuff. It's not as flexible and so they can't really do these big sounds. They can only kind of

93
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,680
 go meow, meow. It's mental when you look at it and they also chirp like birds. So if you watch,

94
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,840
 look up cheater tweeting and it's incredible. You've got this beautiful noble big cat opens

95
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,400
 its mouth and it goes... I just did an impression of a cheater then and my cat who was sat in the

96
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,120
 room sort of looked up at me and I don't know if she thought I was a cheater or just a weird human

97
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,080
 doing a cat sound. I think we know. There's another noise they can make. The males specifically bark.

98
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
 It's called a stutter bark and it's kind of shout, it's just a kind of cheater shout,

99
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,760
 but it's insane because what it does is it literally turns females on. It triggers female

100
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,080
 cheaters to produce reproductive hormones and I think this is unique in mammals. There's no other

101
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,160
 mammal species where the male just says something effectively and the female gets ready for sex

102
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,120
 instantly. Tom Jones does that, doesn't he? Sorry, it's the cheaters and Tom Jones I was

103
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,880
 forgetting. Do you remember years ago on the podcast I said that there's a secret word that's

104
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,000
 been lost according to secret societies that if said directly to a woman will get her pregnant

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,240
 instantly. This is the closest that we have to this so it's good to know. It's not impossible.

106
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:43,360
 There's an article on the BBC news website and the headline is just, "Is it possible to escape a

107
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,880
 cheater?" and I love thinking of the people who are desperately waiting for that to load

108
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,960
 as it approaches.

109
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,120
 Oh, the signal's bad. Sorry.

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,120
 What's the answer? Oh, I didn't read the article.

111
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,680
 Imagine if someone right now is being chased out by a cheater, they happen to be listening

112
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,720
 to our podcast and they're going, "I can't believe my fucking luck. I'm about to be told how to

113
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,560
 escape this thing." And then you didn't read the article. Mate, you're part of the problem here.

114
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,400
 I'm sure it's possible if you believe in yourself, yeah.

115
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,600
 If you are being chased, just believe in yourself.

116
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,240
 I read that small cheater cubs in the wild, they have a silver-gray

117
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,200
 sort of bit of fur that goes over their head and it travels down their neck and their back

118
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,320
 and it's basically camouflaged for them so that if they have any predators coming around they can

119
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,000
 either hide into their surroundings or they can pretend to be a fake honey badger because they

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,880
 look so similar to a honey badger. Sorry Dan, we're not talking about honey badgers today.

121
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,640
 I demand we talk honey badgers at some point on this podcast.

122
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:10,320
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

123
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,240
 Okay, my fact this week is that Napoleon Bonaparte made his sister Caroline the queen of Naples,

124
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,560
 but when the old guard reclaimed the city, she reinvented herself as Countess of Lepona,

125
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,040
 which was an invented place, which was an anagram of Napoli and Napoli being the Italian word for

126
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,600
 Naples. Clever. Yeah, she just wanted to be a queen. She wanted to be royalty and, you know,

127
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,040
 Napoleon had taken over and she saw her chance and she basically, you know, lobbied him to

128
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,600
 try and get anywhere in the world that she could become a Countess of and eventually he said that

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,640
 she could go to Naples and then it was okay for a few years and then eventually he got kicked out

130
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,440
 at Waterloo and then she got kicked out of there and then she basically cosplayed it for the rest

131
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,200
 of her life. It's clever that it was Napoli and she was Napoleon's sister. Oh yeah, I never thought

132
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,760
 of that. Yeah, she could have made a little joke about that in her kind of welcome speech.

133
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,560
 She had a successful stand-up career, didn't she, after Waterloo? Was she successful in

134
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,560
 maintaining this whole queen charade, do we know? When people said, "Where's Lepona? What did she say?"

135
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,760
 Yeah. Well, it's wherever you want it to be, Andrew. It can be, you know, it's everywhere and nowhere.

136
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,600
 It's here and it's there. It's in and it's out. It's up and it's down.

137
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,480
 I think that was, who was that? Katie Perry for a moment there, I went. No, she, when they got

138
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,640
 deposed, a lot of the Bonaparte family were kind of appeased when she was allowed to live in the

139
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:53,200
 south of Austria in her own little castle and that was what she kind of, she didn't call that Lepona

140
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,640
 but she took visitors and stuff and said that that's what she was. She seemed to have a very

141
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,040
 bizarre relationship with Napoleon. So she was the very young sister of Napoleon and when

142
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,880
 they were forced out to sort of, they grew up quite rich and then they became quite poor and

143
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,600
 then Napoleon got very rich and he put them all through school. So she went to a finishing school

144
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,640
 that was run or at least she was taught by the former lady in waiting to marry Marie Antoinette.

145
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:27,520
 So she learned to sort of be someone who wanted to become the heights of a princess or a queen

146
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,200
 even and Napoleon started handing around all of these different royal titles to his family but

147
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,000
 not to her to begin with and there's accounts of her getting these kind of subpar titles and

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,520
 they would have dinners as an account saying that Madame Murat, because she was married at this

149
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,600
 point and that's the surname she took on, Madame Murat was excessively angry and during the dinner

150
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,320
 had so little control over herself that she could not restrain her tears and she ended up the next

151
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,240
 night getting in a massive fight fainting because she was so angry. She was obsessed with becoming

152
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,400
 this princess and he just really held off from giving her that. Like she was, yeah, she was

153
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,680
 always throwing these tantrums and fainting. She had this terrible jealousy of all of her sisters

154
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,520
 and of Hortense who was, so that was Josephine's daughter and they went to the same school, Caroline

155
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,960
 and Hortense and Hortense was sort of the perfect pupil, did really, really well in school, was very

156
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:27,280
 refined and Caroline was a bit more brash, a bit less well bred and so Napoleon often preferred

157
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:33,120
 Hortense and this caused a lot of problems and she hated Josephine so much, Caroline hated Josephine

158
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,920
 so much that when she had a daughter who was to be called Josephine, she insisted on calling the

159
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,040
 daughter Joseph because she says, I'm not going to allow my daughter to take that name and had to

160
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,520
 be properly controlled. She could have thought of something that was less close to Josephine,

161
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,600
 surely like Sandra or... Barony, we had to be sticking within the Josephine format at that moment.

162
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,080
 God. Well, she wasn't all bad though, was she? Like she was one of the main people who helped to

163
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,360
 excavate Pompeii because she was really interested in archaeology. She started a school for girls in

164
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,280
 Naples but then on the other hand, as soon as it looked like Napoleon might be losing, she suddenly

165
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,320
 got on the side of the opponents and just went, oh yeah, yeah, no, we're on your side, we're on your

166
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
 side, please don't kick us out of Naples and Napoleon was absolutely furious about that.

167
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,760
 Napoleon was just surrounded by these bloody siblings who all wanted stuff from him. They

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,920
 were all hopeless. Not one of them had the military now. It's insane. He was one of eight

169
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,320
 children and he gave all his siblings jobs and thrones. He was, you know, a rest of development.

170
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,720
 He's like the Michael Bluth who's just trying to keep things together. All the other useless

171
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,680
 magician siblings just turn up. I really like this a cat. So he had another sister called,

172
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,800
 sorry, he had a wife, Josephine, of course, he married and made the Empress of France

173
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,600
 at his coronation. At the coronation, which was I think 1804, his sisters and his sisters in law,

174
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,920
 so his brother's wives, they were told, look, Josephine is becoming the Empress of France.

175
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,720
 So in the ceremony, we'd like you to carry the train of her dress along the, you know,

176
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,200
 along the aisle at Notre Dame where the ceremony is happening. Joseph was so furious about this.

177
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,240
 He said he was going to move to Germany just to spite Napoleon. And then Pauline, Pauline was

178
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,640
 one of the best Napoleon's of the lot. She was so entertaining. She and the other two sisters,

179
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,320
 they only agreed to carry Josephine's train if they would have other people carrying their trains.

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,320
 So there was this mad conga of dresses along the aisle. And then, and then just as Josephine got to

181
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,240
 the actual throne and was about to turn and sit down, Napoleon's sisters who were carrying it,

182
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,160
 they all pulled it back so she couldn't move. Yes, they just held her up. And Napoleon gave

183
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,920
 them an extremely angry look. And then they relented and let go and she sat down. And it's

184
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,360
 just mad. Why didn't they relent and let go at the exact moment that would mean she fell flat on

185
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,440
 her face? Surely that's the finale. It's really interesting because lots of, I mean, lots of

186
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,920
 the siblings, especially I think the brothers who were given, you know, bits of Spain and Portugal

187
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,720
 and all of this were just not as talented. But this was Napoleon's attempt to recreate a royal

188
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
 family. And if he hadn't done that, I wonder how much more successful he would have been in his

189
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,040
 attempt to take over the whole of Europe. But because he went into dynasty mode, you know,

190
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,320
 it was one of the things that led to disaster anyway.

191
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,920
 Yeah, it's Trump. He was the Trump of his time, wasn't he?

192
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,360
 Kind of. Yeah.

193
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,320
 You've got to put your kids and siblings in high places.

194
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,200
 I was reading a bit more about Paulie, one of the other sisters, one of the older sisters.

195
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,640
 She was amazing. She had a life-size statue of herself commissioned by her husband,

196
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,840
 which could revolve. It just had this inner mechanical system and it just would turn around.

197
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,480
 I've no idea how. But my favourite thing about her is that she liked to bathe in milk, right?

198
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,040
 Which is, you know, classic, you know, very affluent lady stuff. But then she would follow

199
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,200
 her milk bath with a milk shower just to wash off the milk that was from the milk bath.

200
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,880
 Why? How did they do that when they used to have milk showers and milk baths?

201
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,920
 Did they then have a water surf or did they just smell a rank gone off milk all the time?

202
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,120
 I don't know.

203
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,600
 I just, I think that was the desirable fragrance.

204
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,320
 What? Gone off milk?

205
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,480
 It was still a proper shower. Gone off milk.

206
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,600
 Everyone likes cheese, James. Everyone likes cheese.

207
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,640
 Yeah. I like cheese, I must say. I do like cheese.

208
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
 Imagine a woman smelling like a lovely red lester.

209
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,800
 Pauline was, yeah, she was wild. She was the wild one. And I've been trying to verify this,

210
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:35,280
 but in one book it said she once asked a servant to lie on the floor with her breasts out so that

211
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,240
 she could warm her feet in them, apparently. And she was really...

212
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,680
 In the breasts.

213
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,600
 No, within the cleavage, right? You'd be within the cleavage and you would use the breasts.

214
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,240
 You would have to hold the cleavage together, I imagine.

215
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,160
 You need a wunderbar for that.

216
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,040
 You would do, yeah.

217
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,600
 But you'd have to have two servants. You'd have to have one foot.

218
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,680
 You'd have to have one foot per cleavage, wouldn't you?

219
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,160
 Yes.

220
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
 And actually, do you know that if you used to go to clerks in the olden days,

221
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,240
 that's how you used to measure your feet. There would be someone laying there with their breasts

222
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,240
 open and you would put your foot in between them and they'd say, "You're a size 12."

223
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,000
 God, it was a different time, wasn't it?

224
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
 You're a double C.

225
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,840
 I sort of imagined it, actually, is going under the breasts.

226
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,800
 So I was weirdly imagining it, I suppose, of a rather elderly servant with heavy sag,

227
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,880
 where you could slot a foot under each breast, which would also work.

228
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,320
 Also nice.

229
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,520
 Marat Caroline Tosman was a character as well.

230
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
 And they actually sound a little bit like, I want to say,

231
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,280
 Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, maybe.

232
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,080
 So they were both very flashy.

233
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,480
 He was called the Dandy King because he liked to parade around the streets of Paris,

234
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
 dressed like a stage king.

235
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
 Dressed like Desperate Dad.

236
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
 Yeah, that's right.

237
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,720
 With a huge cow pie.

238
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
 He was very good looking.

239
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,000
 I think he was slightly out of Caroline's league, maybe, looks wise.

240
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,840
 And he was so vain that even at the end, he was executed by a firing squad

241
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,080
 for sticking with Napoleon a little bit too long.

242
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,840
 And before he was executed, his very last words were,

243
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,120
 "Soldiers, do your duty straight to the heart, but spare the face."

244
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,320
 Wow.

245
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,440
 Couldn't bear the idea of his face being lost to the world.

246
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,480
 Not going to be much use to him after he's lost his heart, though, is it?

247
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,720
 Yeah.

248
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,120
 No, but at least he looks fit at the funeral.

249
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,360
 I understand that impulse, I must say.

250
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,880
 I do, too.

251
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
 I can kind of say the same thing.

252
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,200
 Yeah?

253
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,120
 I'm not claiming to be a looker, I'm just saying.

254
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,400
 "Go for the heart or the face, but spare the inner ear."

255
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:40,240
 Josephine was originally called Rose, wasn't she?

256
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,120
 She was called Rose.

257
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,240
 And then Napoleon decided that he wanted to call her Josephine.

258
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,840
 Possibly.

259
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,720
 We're not sure why, but possibly because her previous lovers will have called her Rose.

260
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,320
 And he didn't want her to have the same name as her ex-boyfriends knew her as.

261
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
 And she kind of put up with it.

262
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,160
 But on the other hand, she was massively into roses later in life.

263
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,440
 And a lot of people wonder if maybe the reason she was so into roses was just to annoy Napoleon.

264
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,680
 And so she would get roses brought over from England and plant them in Paris.

265
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:18,400
 And she would get special passports for these roses so that when the war was happening,

266
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,960
 they could still come from overseas because she loved roses so much.

267
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,760
 She needs a therapist to work through that with her, I think, the rose session.

268
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,920
 Yeah, she's got some unresolved issues there.

269
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,720
 I think that's Napoleon being a bit controlling there.

270
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,400
 And I know he was famously quite a controlling man, CF all of Europe.

271
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,760
 But I think it's definitely true that when you would ask your girlfriend to change her name,

272
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,800
 that is controlling.

273
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,960
 Yeah, I like that in the initial change, people would have got confused and ended up calling her

274
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,880
 Rosophine and just sounding like Scooby-Doo.

275
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
 Rosophine!

276
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,520
 The only other thing about Napoleon's marriage to Josephine that I know is that on his actual

277
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,680
 wedding night, he kept Josephine waiting for two hours because he was busy planning the invasion

278
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,680
 of Italy. And he got so excited and carried away that he forgot the time.

279
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,680
 He just turned up at midnight or whatever.

280
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,960
 Did she think it was a euphemism for the first hour and a half?

281
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,440
 He said, "I'm planning the invasion of Italy, my love."

282
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,880
 No, this is way around a metaphor.

283
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:29,840
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Andy.

284
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,960
 My fact is that a Chinese tech firm has recently been busted

285
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,840
 for spying on its employees via their bottoms.

286
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,080
 This is just a story that was in the news lately. It's a firm called Hebo Logistic Technology.

287
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,480
 It's a tech firm, and they issued all their stuff with smart cushions, and these cushions were

288
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,840
 going to monitor their health and make sure they were staying healthy in the workplace.

289
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,680
 These cushions are incredible. You sit on them, they monitor your heart rate, your breathing,

290
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,360
 how tired you are, your posture, everything. But the problem was the cushion was also a snitch,

291
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,560
 and it reported when you were not sitting at your desk, and the company had full data,

292
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,680
 and it just started asking people, "Hey, why are you not at your desk at these times?

293
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,920
 Hey, you've been leaving 10 minutes early a few days in a row.

294
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:15,280
 You're missing. Human resources just completely went off on one and started using

295
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
 the Robo Cushion Bum Spies for evil."

296
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:26,000
 The company did deny it, didn't it? The company said that they're just collecting trial data,

297
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,440
 not monitoring employees, but then they don't explain how a couple of HR staffers were going

298
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,920
 up to people saying, "Oh, notice you're knocking off a bit early."

299
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,400
 Yeah. Maybe HR just went broke. You know what HR are like.

300
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,960
 Do you now go into the company headquarters and everyone's just got their cushions strapped to

301
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,600
 their arse? Because that's what I do. Yeah, that's a good idea. Feet the tech.

302
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
 But then it would think that you'd suddenly become extremely light.

303
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
 You've lost a lot of weight, sure.

304
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,320
 You could just have a sack of beetroots and leave that on your desk at all times, and it would...

305
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,320
 Oh, yeah. You could do that Indiana Jones thing of swapping the golden icon for a bag of...

306
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,880
 I think a bag of beetroots though, is that's going to leave a telltale red stain on your cushion,

307
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,000
 isn't it? I'm not going to...

308
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,920
 Don't be more worried about your health, to be honest.

309
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,480
 You appear to be bleeding heavily every day you sit down.

310
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,360
 The Chinese Communist Party official organ, which is the Global Times, the newspaper,

311
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,440
 they had someone who was a lawyer who said that they think this is probably illegal.

312
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,960
 So even the Communist Party are kind of on the employee side of this.

313
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,680
 They're saying you can kind of maybe test people and see what's happening.

314
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,880
 But if you're giving the information to even to another employee, even to HR, then that might be

315
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,440
 an issue. It does keep happening though. This kind of workplace buying technology is normally

316
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,000
 computer-based, obviously, because it's easier than giving people cushions.

317
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
 There must be computers in the cushions though.

318
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,640
 You're right. What is a computer, I guess, is what we're asking? What is a cushion?

319
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,520
 The age old question, first posed by Plato, never answered since.

320
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,320
 No, this happens everywhere. I couldn't believe it. Spyware.

321
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,720
 So in 2018, it was reported that half of large companies are using some kind of monitoring

322
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,080
 techniques on their employees. So that's things like you have software set up that analyzes the

323
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,520
 text of their emails, their social media messages of biometric data.

324
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240
 And then in COVID, that's massively searched because people are working at home.

325
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,800
 So I think demand has gone up by 108%. So you're all being spied on, guys.

326
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,520
 Yeah, there was Barclays in 2017. This was in the UK thing.

327
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,400
 And they put a black box underneath everyone's desk and people just went into the office and went,

328
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,840
 "Why is there a black box under my desk?" And they went, "Oh, no, it's nothing. It's nothing."

329
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,680
 And it turned out to be something called Occupy, which is like Occupy, but EYE at the end.

330
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,000
 And it's a heat and motion sensor that can tell whether you're sat at your desk or not.

331
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,480
 And according to Barclays, the sensors weren't monitoring you. They weren't checking if you

332
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,720
 were at your desk. They were just seeing whether the office space was being used efficiently.

333
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
 And maybe if you're not your desk very often, we could put a water cooler there or something.

334
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,240
 I don't know about that, but they were saying that, "Oh, no, it's not to check up on people."

335
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,600
 The Daily Telegraph did that, too. They got busted because they happened to employ a few

336
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,080
 journalists there who noticed what the hell was this.

337
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,800
 It's the easiest day of work of your life, isn't it? That investigative projects

338
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,800
 literally didn't have to leave my desk, which is good because my employees are monitoring me all

339
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:47,920
 the time. I was just surprised generally, actually, how much of our planet probably is spying on us

340
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:54,720
 and us not knowing it. Because looking into the '50s and '60s of the CIA, FBI, the Chinese government,

341
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,080
 like, everything seems to have been bugged. Dog poo using as transmitter devices.

342
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,760
 So if you see dog poo on the ground, it's quite possible it's not dog poo,

343
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,920
 it's a listening device or a tracking device.

344
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:14,240
 Yeah, I mean, anything's possible. It's extremely unlikely that if you see dog poo on the ground,

345
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,760
 that is a listening device people.

346
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,480
 But James, whenever I want to have a close personal conversation with someone,

347
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,160
 and I don't want anyone to overhear it, I make sure to have a conversation near some dog poo

348
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,600
 so that people see the dog poo and think, "Oh, I don't want to go near those guys having a chat."

349
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,440
 One interesting thing is that, obviously, the thing is when you and I are having a chat in the

350
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,320
 street, Andy, let's say, obviously, we're going to be at least, you know, five and a half, six

351
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,280
 feet away from the dog poo. So that's when they started this theory that you should hang it on

352
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,960
 trees so that it's always at a head height so that you can hear people talking when I go.

353
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,200
 But that's assuming you have a bag on you, right? So the whole idea of this is that

354
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,640
 who's going to pick up raw poo off the ground? So your transmitter device or your bugging device

355
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,920
 is just going to remain dormant there because why would you ever touch it?

356
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,920
 But people who have got poo all the time, we have people who are employed to clean the streets.

357
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,640
 Oh, maybe one of those filthy days.

358
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,880
 This is an old, this is a 1970s technology before we invented string cleaning.

359
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,320
 When there was four everywhere.

360
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,240
 Yeah. But before there was two and it was shit-laden everywhere. Yeah, exactly.

361
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,680
 How have we invented the bin?

362
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,360
 Freaked out, would you be if you trodden some dog poo, thought, "Oh, no, I've troddened

363
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
 in some dog poo." And then you looked down and there was just sort of glistening microphone

364
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,200
 entrails inside there. You'd go mad.

365
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,360
 Or that when you went on Facebook and you got adverts for dog poo cleaning products.

366
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,560
 Dan. On your shoes.

367
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,200
 You've made this assertion here, but you haven't explained, you know, what...

368
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,360
 Yes. What was the context? Yeah.

369
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
 Oh, well, I would say.

370
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,440
 Why were they doing it? Why were they doing it, et cetera?

371
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,680
 So this was 1970s. These were part of devices that have all been invented by the CIA in order to

372
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,360
 track, to bug, to... Yeah, so it would be everything from...

373
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,560
 Yeah, they created these poos and you can see examples of them that were tracking devices.

374
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:06,240
 You can see tree stumps that they invent or that they built that when you open them up had a huge

375
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,120
 tracking and radio transmission device inside. So they would leave those sort of cut off trees in

376
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:19,200
 the wood near places where they knew spies might be active. They have the great rectal tool kit,

377
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,440
 which is not quite for spying in the sense that we're talking about, but was a nice little

378
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
 addition in the list. It's like this big giant pill that you would shove.

379
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,000
 It's not as big. Dan, I've been to the museum in Washington, DC, where they have this rectal

380
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,080
 tool kit and when you just showed us on the zoom how big it was, you were talking probably the

381
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,720
 size of an American football and I could see... No, no, no, no. It's more of a Coke. I'd say

382
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,680
 it's a Coke can that Dan's showing us. I'm showing a Coke can size. Yeah, exactly.

383
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,200
 What size are you talking? It was full of knives. Yeah, what are we talking then,

384
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
 James? How big was it? It would be a chunky tampon for sure.

385
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,640
 A super heavy flow tampon. Well, it's a lot bigger than a tampon, I would say. It's like

386
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,880
 three tampons strapped together. Everything seems like a reasonable size until you have

387
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,440
 to put it up your bump, you know? James, didn't you see when you were at that museum,

388
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,800
 didn't you see a pair of fake testicles to wear over your testicles?

389
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:21,920
 Scrotum, yeah, yeah. Fake scrotum, yeah. Again, normal scrotum sized. Well, slightly bigger.

390
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:27,360
 Slightly bigger, yeah. That is incredible, that fake scrotum thing, because it's so clever.

391
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,880
 I don't think it was really ever used properly in the field, but it had a radio in it.

392
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,600
 So, if you were dropped over in enemy lines, they're going to look for stuff on you,

393
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,160
 but they're possibly not going to look inside your scrotum.

394
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,320
 Right. They may look at your scrotum, but they wouldn't know it would be paranoid enough.

395
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,360
 They would look at it if it was plain, smooth FM or something like that.

396
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,640
 Exactly. Archer's theme tune coming out. Zoe Ball starts talking.

397
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
 Zoe Ball. Oh, dear.

398
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,080
 Yeah. None of these things were ever any use, is what I think. I think it's been McIntyre

399
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,360
 or someone else who's sort of gone through and gone, why are they putting so much effort

400
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,160
 into these stupid technologies, which were never useful, rather than actually just making peace?

401
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:14,640
 Well, possibly. I mean, to make the Soviets think that you're doing these crazy things,

402
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,000
 when actually you're useful things, which are tiny little listening devices that are on things

403
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,280
 that actually go into embassies they don't think of. Yeah.

404
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,080
 Yeah. On companies buying on you, but for good reasons, for health purposes,

405
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,840
 Stanford University have created this smart toilet. I think we've researched this for QI this year,

406
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,200
 but it is pretty amazing. So, it scans employees' bums, and the idea of that is that it can build

407
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,760
 up a whole health profile of you. So, without knowing it, it can diagnose you with some,

408
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,480
 you know, horrible illness that you wouldn't have known you have for three years.

409
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:55,520
 And it's because, basically, our anuses are all individual, are all special. So, the lining,

410
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:59,600
 the anoderm, the lining of your anus is like a fingerprint.

411
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,200
 I've just learned a new word. That's really anoderm. Yeah.

412
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,960
 The anoderm. Yeah.

413
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,120
 Oh, I thought you said anoderm, which sounds a lot more, well, Mad Max than anoderm.

414
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,920
 You will be given this American football.

415
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:26,320
 It's not an inverted dome. It's a dome. And basically, it scans it so it can tell who you are,

416
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,560
 and then it analyses the quality of your excretions. So, you know, if you've got a green poo,

417
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,920
 it's your wee bit funny smelling, and then it will upload this onto your kind of health

418
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,880
 profile that it keeps, and it can alert you if your health is, you know, bit dodged.

419
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,440
 It needs to be a bit of consistency. Isn't that nice? And it's all it said was the press release

420
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,320
 from Stanford said the only thing holding it back really is that to fully reap the benefits of the

421
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,120
 smart toilet, users must make peace with the camera that scans their anus when they go to the loo.

422
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
 Yeah, that's the thing.

423
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,120
 Is that the future of higher security to getting into these sort of top secret rooms? You've got

424
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,280
 to take your trousers down and scan them. You always see them scanning their palm or their iris,

425
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,960
 don't you? Yeah. But what if, like, one of the bad guys steals your anal derm to try and get

426
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,920
 into the top secret place? Next Mission Impossible movie, please use this advice.

427
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:28,960
 Anyway, so I was looking at CCTV and looking at the inventor of that, and this was an African

428
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,520
 American lady called Marie Van Britton Brown. And she lived in Queens, and there was a very high

429
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:41,200
 crime rate. And so she started off by getting her door and she put three peep holes in her door at

430
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,520
 different heights, sort of one high, one medium and one low. And the idea was that tall, average

431
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,760
 heights and children would all be able to look in a different peep hole. So this was her first

432
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,400
 idea of a security thing. And then she set up a camera outside so that people who look through

433
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,600
 the peep hole will be able to see like around the corner and stuff like that. And then she put loads

434
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,160
 of cameras in and she came up with a wireless television system where you'd be able to see

435
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,880
 from all the different cameras. And this was the first ever radio controlled wireless system for

436
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:20,560
 cameras and the first ever CCTV. When was that? She got the patents in 1969. And this is the best

437
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,680
 thing about her, which I'd love to believe this. I've only seen this on Wikipedia, so it might not

438
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:32,560
 be true. But her mother, father and grandmother were all named DD. Isn't that weird? I mean,

439
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,840
 that is just going to be, that's a sitcom waiting to be read, isn't it?

440
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,400
 No, that's the thing to play. That's one of Shakespeare's most awful comedies where everyone's

441
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,920
 got the same name and happens to look identical. And they're all on the CCTV. She should have called

442
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:54,080
 it DDTV. Yeah. Well, yeah, I guess the future Shakespeare's will be writing about everyone

443
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,720
 who had the same name and identical anuses. That's right. Can't tell one DD anus from the next.

444
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,520
 Henry Ford was maybe the first employer to really standardize spying on your employees.

445
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,760
 And I didn't know the extent to which he did this, but he used to just send out secret agents to go

446
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,320
 and watch his employees in their private lives. Well, they weren't secret because actually everyone

447
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,320
 knew that he was doing it, so they were agents. But this is like 1914 and everyone wants to work

448
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,080
 in its factories because they're the big cheese. And he employed a team of 200 agents who would go

449
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,720
 and question all his employees on their personal lives, on their marriages, on what they ate,

450
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,840
 on, I don't know, their exercise routines and check. And he said it was to check that you are

451
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:47,040
 clean living and then your wages would depend on how clean living you were. And so, yeah, I know,

452
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,600
 it's not great. Wait a minute. No, because what's the point of being clean living to get loads more

453
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:56,480
 money? What are you going to spend your extra money on if you can't spend it on huckers and cocaine?

454
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,920
 I guess you've just got to buy one of Henry Ford's cars. Maybe that's the aim.

455
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,480
 People used to cheat it. Apparently, there was a boarding house, for instance, where 11 of his

456
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,680
 workers lived. And it was run by this landlady and agents would come round and interview them but

457
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,520
 one at a time. And each one would always borrow the landlady to stand in as their wife when they

458
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,120
 got interviewed to say that they were married. So funny. So what, they just went house to house

459
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,240
 and they saw the same woman popping up again and again. Yeah, yeah, this is like a Shakespearean

460
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:42,240
 play. And your name is also DD, I see. Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that

461
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,840
 is my fact. My fact is, in 2014, a former Apple employee called Sam Sung raised money for a

462
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:55,760
 charity by auctioning his last remaining Apple business card that read, Sam Sung Specialist.

463
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,800
 That's amazing. They must have employed him because of his name. Listen,

464
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,320
 I don't know why would you know why employ your rival company to be saying they're

465
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,280
 Sam Sung Specialist within your shops? Well, because then Apple could sell a load of Samsung

466
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,000
 products but pretend that they're named after this guy. Yeah, yeah, because that drinking is in

467
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:26,480
 Peru, which is from the collar people and contains cocoa leaves and they call it Coca-Cola.

468
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:33,680
 Wasn't it in the year 1304 or something? There was a girl in Europe called Diet Coke.

469
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,680
 Yes. Yeah. Although she didn't capitalise on it like an idiot.

470
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,600
 The only group of people in the world who can go, yes, to someone saying, wasn't it in 1304?

471
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:53,680
 It was. Did Sam really capitalise on this? I mean, how much did he actually make for this

472
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,000
 business? He did. Okay. Well, no, I mean, he was an employee. He worked in an Apple store in Vancouver

473
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,080
 at a Pacific centre, which is on his card. And he worked there for a couple of years.

474
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:10,800
 And he quit or left for whatever reasons. He was thinking, because people always used to ask him,

475
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,640
 could I have a business card? And they always found it so funny. He just thought, you know,

476
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,080
 I want to raise some money for some children's charities. And what a good way to try and see

477
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,400
 if this generates anything. So what he did was he auctioned it as his final business card,

478
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:32,000
 but not only that, he framed his former Apple employee T-shirt, his lanyard and the card in

479
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,640
 there. And he put it up on eBay. He wasn't really expecting anything. And very quickly,

480
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,440
 the auction price went up to $80,000. Yeah, but like with those things, he sort of went,

481
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,320
 hang on, this can't be real. So he knocked them out and he went down to what he thought

482
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,200
 must be the only genuine one and which ended up being in the $2,000 region. So still a nice,

483
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,720
 yeah, a nice amount and just a nice little quirky. To be honest, it's the kind of thing I would buy

484
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,000
 on eBay. Yeah. Saying that's the kind of thing I would buy on eBay. That doesn't limit it to

485
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,320
 anything on eBay. It doesn't narrow it down one bit. But it does answer what was going to be my

486
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,760
 next question, which was, who on earth would buy something like that?

487
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,040
 It narrows it down from anything that has any possible use.

488
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,200
 Yeah, you're right. Something that'll keep its value. We know it's not going to be that.

489
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,560
 Wow. That's cool though. That's good.

490
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,480
 Yeah, you've got to love an imaginative attempt to raise money for charity. Did you guys read

491
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,360
 about Joe Cooper, who was the 24 year old builder who him and 10 friends actually agreed to get

492
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,240
 their hair waxed off for a local hospital charity and there were onlookers doing it.

493
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,120
 I think onlookers got to bid to be allowed to wax off a bit of hair and his mates had their chest

494
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:58,800
 hair waxed and then they pulled out and they said, "I've had enough." And he said, "I'm going to go

495
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,400
 for the testicles because it's for charity." And he had a radio hidden in there that they

496
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,080
 didn't realise. The CIA had snuck in there. Yeah. His testicles are actually made of dog poo.

497
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:20,320
 I think the phrase testicles made of dog poo is the worst thing we've said in 365 episodes.

498
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,600
 Well, you wait for the next bit. His friends paid various amounts to have a chance to rip off

499
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,920
 some of the hairs on his testicles. One of his friends pulled too enthusiastically

500
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,920
 and ripped off his six outer layers of skin, of seven, apparently. And he had to go to hospital

501
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,800
 and they told him that one more layer of skin and his testicle would have gone.

502
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,760
 Wow. That's useful to know that we all have seven layers of skin on our testicles.

503
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,000
 Well, he claimed this is what the hospital told him. It's quite specific.

504
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,000
 And he only raised three grand, which I think is not enough. We're almost losing it all.

505
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,520
 No. It doesn't even cover the costs of what it would have cost the hospital in money.

506
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,200
 Yeah, exactly. That's presumably the hospital he was raising money for.

507
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,800
 Shit. That's a really good point. Does that cover the NHS cost of sowing someone's skin

508
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,240
 back onto their ball? Well, that is a thing, isn't it? There was a study of parachute jumps in

509
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,840
 Scotland a few years ago. These are all charity parachute jumps. And they looked at how much

510
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,800
 you made compared to how much it cost the NHS when you landed badly and broke your ankles.

511
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,640
 And they turned out, I think it was for every pound that you got for the NHS.

512
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,320
 It cost the NHS £13.75 and returned to look after you. And that's on average.

513
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,760
 Wait, so is that including the parachute jumps that go right?

514
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,360
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no.

515
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,720
 So basically, you only get a few hours. This was what the people were saying. I'm sure some

516
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,640
 parachute jumps are different than this, but they were saying that they only got like six hours

517
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,640
 of training. And when they were kind of falling down, the earth is rushing up and you just forget

518
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,880
 everything that you've been taught and you just kind of panic. And loads of people were like

519
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,120
 getting broken ankles and stuff. And a couple of people went into surgery and surgery is very

520
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,080
 expensive. And I think people were on average only making about 30 or 40 quid for charity.

521
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:15,360
 Well, it's just like... A parachute jump.

522
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,960
 Yeah. But it's, you know, you do it because your friends are doing it, right? Your friends

523
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,560
 go, "Do you want to do a parachute jump?" You go, "Yeah, sure." And then it's hard to get people

524
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,600
 to give money. Yeah. So there's a thing called the Martyrdom Effect, which is where people are

525
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:33,360
 willing to donate more if a fundraising effort will require pain or exertion. And we are recording

526
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:40,080
 this obviously the day before we do 20 hours of podcasting in a row. And I think that world

527
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:45,040
 calls pain and exertion. But have you guys heard of Peter Tripp? I don't think we've mentioned him

528
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:52,000
 before. Peter Tripp. He was a DJ. And in 1959, he decided to broadcast his regular show from Times

529
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,640
 Square for 200 hours. He sat in a booth and it went really badly wrong for him. It was bad.

530
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,360
 Thanks for letting us know that. Literally under 24 hours before we do ours.

531
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,240
 He died.

532
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,680
 He was going 10 times longer than we're going.

533
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,720
 Yeah. So after 100 hours, which I don't think we're not going to run over and do 100 hours

534
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,200
 tomorrow accidentally, but after 100 hours, he was no longer able to do simple maths or recite

535
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,440
 the alphabet. After 120, he... Dan, have you been doing 19 hours before we started today?

536
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:37,280
 Sorry. I'd like to kick into it, you know, just to get warm enough.

537
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,560
 It was an open goal. I couldn't do anything. It just hit me a month in.

538
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:48,000
 So that was 100 hours. After 120, he walked into a nearby hotel to shower and change and he

539
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,400
 opened a chest of drawers and he saw flames shooting out of it. At which point, he did not

540
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,120
 think I'm hallucinating. He thought, ah, the scientists are trying to trick me. So he developed

541
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:03,920
 serious paranoid delusions. He was basically having dreams while awake and he started confessing to

542
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,920
 everyone around him. Thought, although everyone thought he was Peter Tripp, he was not actually

543
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,480
 Peter Tripp anymore. And he was drugged for the last 66 hours. I have no idea why someone didn't

544
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,280
 step in and say, we think this is not a bit far. And he did it. He made it through. But I think the

545
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,040
 effects were lasted a while, a lifetime. So did you say he was broadcasting?

546
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,000
 Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I don't know what the last 66 hours when he was drugged,

547
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,440
 but still awake and still broadcasting must have been like. They can't have been great.

548
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,480
 I was just looking at stupid charity attempts. And one is, well, it's actually a yearly

549
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,600
 charity fundraising event in Japan. It's called Stop AIDS. So stop exclamation mark and then AIDS,

550
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:49,360
 which is a really weird place to put the exclamation mark in that sentence. But it's

551
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:57,040
 so it's a Japanese charity that raises awareness by HIV and AIDS. And they hold an event and they've

552
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,200
 been doing it since the early 2000s, which the name loosely translates to boob aid. And it's but

553
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,280
 it's this event is run by an adult TV channel by porn channel. And what happens is they have their

554
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:20,560
 actresses stand and let people squeeze their, squeeze their breasts and pay money for them.

555
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,400
 Do they let you warm your feet up? I think you have to pay double for that.

556
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:34,480
 And so it's very controversial, obviously, because it's raising money. But it does involve

557
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:40,080
 basically lots of sleazy men going up and squeezing a porn star's boob in order to do so.

558
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,680
 Yeah, it doesn't, the optics are not good. Yeah, the optics are poor.

559
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,800
 I mean, presumably they, they have to be told that you're not allowed to squeeze more than once

560
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,760
 or whatever. I mean, they'd have, they'd have to be pulled off. You can squeeze multiple times,

561
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,840
 but you have to pay multiple times. Anna, you're responding to something that really...

562
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,760
 Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't believe you were doing that. So...

563
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,920
 And for the, for the listener, Andy did a little dance afterwards while Anna was trying to...

564
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,560
 He grabbed his own breasts. Very nicely.

565
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:16,080
 I will make a charitable donation to myself later on for doing it.

566
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,040
 That's disgusting. I honestly thought, I can't, I can't respond to that.

567
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,920
 Yes, they'd have to be pulled off. Thank you.

568
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:31,120
 There was a, there was a sheriff in America who I, I quite like. He's called Leon Lott,

569
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,080
 which is a good name. And he allowed himself to be tased to raise money for charity.

570
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,640
 So for every thousand dollars that was bid, he would let the tasing go on for an extra second.

571
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,800
 The winning bid was $2,000, which meant he was tased for two seconds, but I think that's probably...

572
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,720
 Yeah.

573
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,840
 I don't know how much longer he could have let the bidding go on for before he would have

574
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,680
 just been killed by the tasing.

575
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,200
 I think Ed Ball's got tased.

576
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,400
 Yeah, but not for charity. It was for his documentary about...

577
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,680
 Yeah.

578
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,320
 Something.

579
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,520
 Didn't even want to raise money.

580
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,800
 Interesting thing about Ed Ball's seven layers of skin.

581
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,280
 Interesting.

582
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:14,960
 One charity thing that I really like was from 1943.

583
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,080
 And this was a book that was published in aid of the Famine Relief Committee

584
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,960
 called Famous People's Pigs, Blindfold.

585
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,840
 And the way that this worked is they got a load of famous people to put on a blindfold

586
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,360
 and draw a picture of a pig and then they put it in the book.

587
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,000
 And they had Arthur Conan Dial did it.

588
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,760
 George Bernard Shaw did it.

589
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,440
 Jasper Maskeling did it.

590
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,640
 Hiram Maxim who invented the machine gun did it.

591
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:51,440
 They had some real big hitters who put on a blindfold and drew a picture of the pig.

592
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,000
 I just wanted to make sure Miss understood and drew pig mainly.

593
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,480
 Very good.

594
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,200
 But yeah.

595
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,400
 That's so funny.

596
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,320
 And the pictures are online.

597
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,040
 You can see them.

598
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:10,720
 The one that Hiram Maxim drew is one of the worst things I have ever seen in my entire

599
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,360
 really.

600
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,000
 It just looks like nothing.

601
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
 It's just loads of lines and you could kind of make out that it's supposed to be an animal,

602
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,720
 but the legs are in the middle of the body and the heads kind of off the body and stuff like that.

603
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,520
 And then they asked him about it afterwards.

604
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,600
 They said, what's going on with this pig?

605
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:33,200
 And he said, I have just a suspicion that the pigs that are so well drawn in your album are by

606
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,520
 people who had their eyes partly open.

607
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,160
 The trouble with my pig is that my eyes were too tightly closed.

608
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,120
 So he thought everyone else was cheating.

609
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,840
 He was so shit at drawing a pig.

610
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,440
 What an accusation to throw around.

611
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:47,920
 Wow.

612
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,200
 That looks like sour grapes to me.

613
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,800
 Sounds like it, doesn't it?

614
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,880
 Let's hope he didn't design his gun blindfolded.

615
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,320
 No.

616
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,040
 Bit disaster.

617
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,960
 James, when you said famous people's pigs blindfolded, my mind immediately went to there

618
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,440
 must have been enough celebrity pig owners in the UK who will be willing to put a blindfold

619
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,480
 on their own pig.

620
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,120
 And then I guess you would have to guess as the reader who whose pig is this.

621
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,080
 Who the pig it would belong to.

622
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,520
 Agatha Christie's pig wearing a blindfold, but yours is better.

623
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,400
 I can see that.

624
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,400
 That's suggesting though, Andy, we would recognize celebrities pigs based on their eyes, right?

625
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,680
 That's Agatha's, isn't it?

626
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,880
 Yeah, you're absolutely right.

627
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,080
 You've got to blindfold them.

628
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,800
 You could get Rebecca Loose's pig, of course.

629
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,000
 But then if you don't want to ruin the picture, she doesn't have to be pulled off.

630
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,040
 Oh, good.

631
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,000
 That's staying in, is it?

632
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,400
 Okay, that's it.

633
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,440
 That is all of our facts.

634
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,880
 Thank you so much for listening.

647
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,360
 We have all of our previous episodes up there.

648
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,480
 We also have our mammoth 20-hour long episode that we just made for Charity,

649
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,760
 an aid of comic relief.

650
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,680
 The Just Giving page is still open.

651
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,880
 If you could please donate to that, we would really appreciate it.

652
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,160
 But do check it out.

653
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,240
 It was, it's not happened yet.

654
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,200
 It's happening tomorrow, but I'm going to say it was great fun.

655
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,080
 I couldn't believe that last couple of hours when Andy,

656
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,600
 we put him on a load of drugs.

657
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,800
 Do you remember?

658
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,600
 Oh yeah.

659
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,080
 Yeah.

660
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:30,800
 I'm not Andy.

661
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,520
 I'm not Andy.

662
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,600
 Well done, whoever sent pie to his chest of drawers.

663
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,640
 That really freaks him out.

664
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,000
 Anyway, we will be back again with another episode.

665
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,040
 We'll see you then.

666
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,920
 Goodbye.
