00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,500
 Yeah.

3
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,400
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

4
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,660
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,240
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,080
 of Underwater Life.

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

8
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,620
 No such thing as a fish.

9
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

10
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:25,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,640
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,200
 to you from the QI Offices in Covenant Garden.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,240
 My name is Dan Treurer.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,400
 I'm sitting here with three other QI Elves, Andy Murray,

15
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,600
 Anichezinski, and on our fact-checking duty today,

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,760
 James Harkin.

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,600
 Once again, we're gathering around the microphone

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,960
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,000
 And joining us today is a special guest, a comedian from Belgium,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,560
 Leven Scheiren.

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,800
 Hi, hi.

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 How's it going?

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,200
 Well, very good, I'm here, so that's great.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,640
 Yeah, we're very excited to have you here.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,080
 Leven is basically the Stephen Fry Belgium.

26
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,480
 We have a show out there called Skyra in the Creation,

27
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,360
 which is a panel show in which you have sort of comedians,

28
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,080
 as well as interesting guests, from all sorts of categories,

29
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:05,920
 wine tasters.

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,840
 That's the one I saw.

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,320
 Yeah, yeah, it's a panel show.

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,280
 It's much like QI, you know.

33
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,440
 I think I secretly want to make QI in Belgium.

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,560
 And now I have to find a channel that wants to host it.

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,320
 Just remember, you got to headline the gig at CERN, right?

36
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
 Yes, that was last summer I was performing at CERN,

37
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,160
 which was absolutely amazing being a physicist

38
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,760
 standard comedian.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,200
 I could do all my geeky jokes.

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
 That's great.

41
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
 All right, should we kick into it?

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,840
 Should we get fact number one on the way?

43
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,320
 OK, fact number one.

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
 We're going to start with you, Leven.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,040
 Yes, my fact is that during the Second World War,

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 the Nazis employed two official Nazi comedians.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,240
 That's a starter, Shig.

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,360
 Yeah, they were called Trann und Heller.

49
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,960
 And they did funny sketches.

50
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,600
 And I think Trann was the fat stupid one.

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,640
 And then Heller would be the perfect man.

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,280
 There's a few still on YouTube.

53
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,160
 But I must warn you, they are utterly not funny.

54
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,680
 And so surprising, Nazis.

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,720
 And well, they all have this war propaganda scenarios.

56
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,400
 Like, I remember one where Trann was sitting in his living room

57
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,800
 and he was reading a biography of Churchill

58
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,360
 that was given to him by his Jewish neighbor.

59
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,520
 But luckily, Heller arrived and said, Trann, what are you doing?

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,720
 That's all lies.

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
 And that was about it.

62
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,360
 That's the punchline.

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,200
 That's the punchline.

64
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
 This is why central government shouldn't

65
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
 get involved in comedy writing.

66
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,960
 Yes, that's right.

67
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
 That works.

68
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,680
 But they stopped this shows before the end of the war

69
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,520
 because the German people watching this

70
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,680
 were all sympathizing with the stupid fat guy

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,920
 and not with this impossibly perfect Heller.

72
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,400
 And they were even the stupid comedian

73
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,680
 was banned from the Nazi party because of this, yeah.

74
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,040
 Yeah, they're really not funny, are they?

75
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,920
 I watch one of them, which sounds really similar,

76
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,600
 about where he's listening to the radio

77
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,520
 and he's being told by Heller to not listen to Western

78
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,920
 broadcasts and he, Trann, says, I think I can make up

79
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,120
 my own mind about what's the truth and what's not.

80
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,160
 And Heller goes, no, no, you can't, you don't understand.

81
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
 You wouldn't understand any of this.

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,960
 You have to be told by the state what's right and wrong.

83
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,200
 And when you're watching it, you're going,

84
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,480
 well, this tall guy who's saying you have to be told

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
 by the state what's right and wrong

86
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,120
 is obviously the bad guy here.

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,400
 And clearly, I like the short fat bloke who's going,

88
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,720
 can I just listen to whatever program I want, please?

89
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
 So it was bizarre that they didn't realize.

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
 That they didn't connoncer.

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,360
 Yeah, sometimes they tried to do a punchline.

92
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,080
 And well, it's always a bit pathetic when they're trying.

93
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
 Even more when there's no punchline.

94
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,160
 I remember one where Trann was using all his bread coupons

95
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,400
 even though he didn't need them.

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,720
 And he had all this old bread in his kitchen.

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,640
 And then Heller was coming, you can't do this.

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
 And then what do you do with it?

99
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,320
 Well, I give it to the chicken.

100
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,560
 You can't give it to the chicken.

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,840
 And the other Germans need this bread.

102
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,960
 And this war is hard on everybody.

103
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,600
 And then Heller says, what about the chicken?

104
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
 And that was it.

105
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,640
 Again, you totally sympathize with the chicken.

106
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,160
 When you listen to that, it's a really endearing perspective.

107
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,120
 War was hard on the poultry.

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,960
 It's interesting.

109
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,640
 War time, how comedy is used in propaganda.

110
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,440
 I was really shocked by the number of Walt Disney

111
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,280
 and Warner Brothers cartoons that were made featuring Hitler

112
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,000
 and Bugs Bunny in the same sketch.

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,840
 Yeah, yeah.

114
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,680
 There was scenes of Daffy Duck on the top of Hitler

115
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
 smacking his face and knocking his mustache off him and stuff.

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,600
 I found German anti-Nazi jokes from the war.

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,480
 I found them very interesting.

118
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,760
 So one joke in Berlin during the last months of the war

119
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,560
 was that in Berlin, the optimists are learning English

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,880
 and the pessimists are learning Russian.

121
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,640
 Or another one, two people conversing.

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,600
 One says, what are you going to do after the war ends?

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
 Well, I'm going to finally go on a holiday

124
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,760
 and I'll take a trip around greater Germany.

125
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,680
 Oh, yeah, what are you going to do in the afternoon?

126
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
 That kind of thing.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,600
 Some of them kind of still funny, I think,

128
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
 when the RAF is in the skies, the Germans take cover.

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,680
 When the Luftwaffe is in the sky, the Allies take cover.

130
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,920
 When the US Air Force is in the skies, everyone takes cover.

131
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,920
 Which, you know, kind of still applies.

132
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,680
 But the Nazis banned apes from making the Hitler salute

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 on pain of death for, I think, both ape

134
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,200
 and the person who trained the ape.

135
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,960
 During the early '30s, there were a lot of satirical comedians

136
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,080
 who made fun of the Hitler salute.

137
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,560
 And some animal trainers in circus,

138
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,880
 it was trained the apes to give a Hitler salute.

139
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,520
 Yeah, they'd dangle when the food wouldn't they?

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,080
 So they had to just reach their arm out at that position.

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
 And the Nazis unsurprisingly took quite a dim view of that

142
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,800
 and they made it punishable by death by death, yeah.

143
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,440
 Well, any apes ever executed, do you know?

144
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,280
 I don't know.

145
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,640
 I got it from a book about humor in Hitler's Germany.

146
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,680
 And I haven't found any concrete examples.

147
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,040
 Is that a lot of books?

148
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,920
 I think 10 years ago, a man was arrested in Germany

149
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,800
 for training his dog to do the Hitler salute.

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
 - Really? - Yeah.

151
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
 - That's quite impressive. - 10 years ago, I think.

152
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
 And he had trained him.

153
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,440
 And he was walking around the park

154
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,040
 and every time he would pass a foreigner,

155
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,000
 he would command his dog to do a Hitler salute.

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,240
 - Wow. - Yeah.

157
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,720
 Fair enough, arrest him.

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

159
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,880
 - Alright, did you know England in 2004

160
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,400
 had a state jester?

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
 - No. - Yeah, we had a state jester.

162
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,040
 It's a guy called Nigel Roder.

163
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,480
 And he won a competition

164
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,400
 to become the official state jester.

165
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,920
 But there was too many complaints.

166
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,360
 So he got his title removed.

167
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,400
 - What were they complaining about?

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,320
 - What the South grapes that they had been given?

169
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
 - Yeah, yeah.

170
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,160
 It basically said that the English heritage

171
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,320
 should not be allowed to use the title of state jester.

172
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,280
 A lot of people were just like,

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,040
 you can't be the state jester.

174
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,080
 We're all jesters.

175
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
 - Well, it's not, it's less funny

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,320
 when it's a state comedian as well.

177
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
 - Apparently, Eric Idol says

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,360
 that Prince Charles asked him to be the official court jester.

179
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
 And he said, no.

180
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,000
 The mayor of Reykjavik is a standup comedian.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,360
 - Really? - Yeah.

182
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,120
 They had, well, they had a very, very rough time

183
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,320
 during the financial crisis in Iceland.

184
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,560
 And then he started a mock party.

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,560
 He said, yeah, all these, all these old politicians,

186
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,680
 they've all failed.

187
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
 And he started a mock party.

188
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:01,680
 And I think he wanted an ice bear in the Iceland zoo,

189
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,800
 or the Iceland zoo at this point.

190
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,520
 Only has, I think, a cow and a rabbit.

191
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,520
 He wanted to legalize drugs,

192
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,920
 but only inside the parliament building.

193
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,240
 - Right. - Right.

194
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
 - But that was his program. - That's great.

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
 And he won.

196
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,760
 - And has he carried out any of his promises?

197
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,800
 - No, I don't think so.

198
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,320
 I don't think there's an ice bear there.

199
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,880
 He's like, all the others.

200
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,040
 - Yeah.

201
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
 - He surrounded himself with very good advices

202
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
 because he realized that, well, I can't do politics.

203
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,760
 I know nothing about it.

204
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,800
 And he's doing very well.

205
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,560
 People are very happy with how he rules the Reykjavik.

206
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
 - That's great. - Oh.

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,240
 - And the mayor of London is a comedian of sorts.

208
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,040
 - Yeah, I even know this well.

209
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,200
 Eddie is, I'd wants to run in 2020.

210
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
 So, you know, could be a running thing.

211
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,840
 - Could be.

212
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,200
 We should move on, James.

213
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,960
 Before we do, have you got any facts you want to chuck in?

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
 - You were talking about the Walt Disney and Warner Brothers

215
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,560
 propaganda.

216
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,480
 Donald Duck was in De Fuhrer's face,

217
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,040
 where he breaks down after experiencing a nightmare.

218
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,960
 He has to make do with eating ridiculous Nazi food rations,

219
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,120
 such as a smell of bacon and eggs,

220
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
 caught made with one bean and a slice of stale bread.

221
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 - Wow.

222
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,000
 - And in Commando Duck, Donald Duck by himself

223
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,680
 destroys an entire Japanese air base.

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
 That sounds amazing.

225
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
 Anything else?

226
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,080
 - Yeah, Liam was talking about the dog

227
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,960
 who was doing the Hitler salute.

228
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,600
 I found it on the Daily Mail website

229
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
 under the headline Howl Hitler.

230
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,120
 And they arrested this guy whose dog was doing the Hitler salute.

231
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,400
 And Spokesman, Eva Marie Connig said we are retraining him

232
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,720
 to stop him raising his leg too high.

233
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 He doesn't have anything that would make him interesting

234
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,520
 to write Wing extremists.

235
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
 However, we think he will quickly find a new owner

236
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,200
 because he is so famous.

237
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,520
 (laughing)

238
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,100
 (upbeat music)

239
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,680
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

240
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,760
 This one's my fact.

241
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,920
 So this fact is that the Philippines Basketball Association,

242
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,640
 which is the second oldest in the world after the NBA,

243
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
 have 10 teams in total.

244
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,600
 And their names include The Rain and Shine Elasto Painters,

245
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,520
 The San Miguel Beer Men,

246
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,440
 and Talk and Text, Troopang Textors.

247
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,880
 - So a lot of teams with no integrity at all,

248
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,600
 just selling out concept names.

249
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
 - What, it's done there?

250
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
 It's not selling out.

251
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,520
 It's just that's the way that they are.

252
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
 Like if you watch boxing matches these days,

253
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,440
 most boxers have adverts painted on their back.

254
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,400
 - There's a guy in America who's selling his last name now.

255
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,400
 So companies can bid, and the highest bidder will be the company name

256
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,800
 that will become his official last name.

257
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,720
 He did it last year for one company,

258
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 and now he's called, I don't know, James McDonald's or something.

259
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
 And now he's doing it again,

260
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,640
 because it was only for one year,

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
 and I think he gets some $50,000 out of it.

262
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,240
 - Wow, dude, I think the only benefit for these companies

263
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,400
 is in the newspaper coverage that a man is changing his name,

264
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,080
 because no one sees Kevin Budweiser

265
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,000
 and thinks I must go and have a beer.

266
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,960
 - We had a football team in Belgium,

267
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,200
 which was sponsored by Mick Quickis,

268
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,800
 is the Belgian McDonald's, like Burger King.

269
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,280
 And they had one player called McDonald's,

270
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,520
 and so I was running on the field with this quick logo on his back,

271
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,880
 and then McDonald, the moment.

272
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,920
 - When I was looking into the Filipino basketball stuff,

273
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,960
 because it's a huge sport there, they absolutely love it.

274
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,000
 But I suddenly remembered that Dennis Rodman

275
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 had been out there a few years back.

276
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,640
 Dennis Rodman was in the Chicago Bulls.

277
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,920
 He famously was married to Carmen Electra,

278
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
 and he's been most notable in the news recently

279
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,400
 because of his relationship with Kim Jong Un.

280
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,360
 But when he went out to the Philippines to play

281
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,520
 in sort of one of those Americans versus the Philippines,

282
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,440
 basketball matches, he met up with his estranged dad,

283
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,400
 who he hadn't seen for 40 years,

284
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,520
 who's been living in the Philippines for all these years.

285
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,400
 But he's had 29 children to 16 different wives.

286
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 And his name, this is his birth name, Philander,

287
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
 spelled exactly the same, just exactly the same.

288
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,040
 It's Philander Rodman, he lives out there,

289
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,240
 and he runs his own burger shop,

290
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,560
 which is called Rodman's Rainbow Obama Burger Restaurant,

291
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,240
 in which you can get different colored buns.

292
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
 And apparently they're really good burgers.

293
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,000
 - Quite a mouth.

294
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,080
 - They're all really good names all over the Philippines.

295
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,680
 I think the president and his sisters have nicknames,

296
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
 including Pinkie, Nunu, and Bulzi.

297
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
 - Well, there's the classic Cardinal Sin,

298
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,760
 who was the main Cardinal for years.

299
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
 I think he's passed away,

300
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,560
 - Yes, he died a few years ago.

301
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,920
 - Yeah, Jaime Sin.

302
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,080
 - They're amazing sports names all over the world, though.

303
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
 They're so fun.

304
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,520
 Remember, I think in 2005,

305
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
 there was a sudden rush on sales

306
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,560
 of the Peruvian football team,

307
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,400
 Deportivo Wankers, in Britain.

308
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
 And there's a quote from the club spokesman,

309
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,800
 who just came over and he was like,

310
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
 "It is very strange.

311
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,400
 "Everyone in Britain seems to think we have a funny name."

312
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,240
 The Wanker are just like Peruvian peoples.

313
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
 It's not a funny word.

314
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,240
 They decided to, when they were in danger of being relegated,

315
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,520
 they decided to change their football ground

316
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,560
 to the highest town in the world,

317
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,360
 which I think is called Serro de Pasco,

318
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,760
 and I probably haven't pronounced that right.

319
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,200
 But it is 4,400 meters above sea level

320
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
 and normal people can't really breathe there or do anything.

321
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,040
 And so obviously these guys are used to it.

322
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,800
 So, and they were accused of cheating,

323
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,480
 'cause whenever a football team came to play them,

324
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,040
 they all just kind of started collapsing.

325
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
 And I'm kind of like, "That's very cool."

326
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,080
 Well, it melts down.

327
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,160
 Yeah, they still got relegated, so it did not work.

328
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,120
 - Well, it's amazing.

329
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,560
 - My favorite basketball fact is somewhat the same.

330
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,240
 It's the Spanish basketball team

331
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,680
 had to return their gold medals

332
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
 of the Paralympics in 2010,

333
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,360
 because their IQs turned out to be too high.

334
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,040
 They had a basketball competition

335
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,280
 for the intellectually disabled world.

336
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

337
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,000
 - And so the Spanish completely cheated

338
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,200
 for having too high and IQ.

339
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,320
 - Too high and IQ.

340
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
 - That's amazing.

341
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,720
 - Which is not normally an accusation level

342
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,840
 that many sports people.

343
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,440
 - Well, that's the boy who was picked second-last,

344
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,360
 speaking consistently for 13 years of school.

345
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,920
 - Do you know the guy who invented basketball?

346
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,120
 John Naysmith, his middle name is A,

347
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,760
 and they don't know what his middle name means.

348
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,600
 And the family have said,

349
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
 we think he just put it there,

350
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
 like President...

351
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
 - Ulysses S.

352
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
 - S?

353
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,840
 - Possibly.

355
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
 - It's just an S, isn't it?

356
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,200
 - It's just an S, yeah.

357
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,280
 But one of the discoveries that they've made about this guy

358
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,520
 is the influences that they reckon

359
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,160
 that led to the creation of basketball,

360
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,720
 including a game called...

361
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
 Has anyone heard of this duck on a rock?

362
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,400
 Does anyone have duck on it?

363
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,640
 - I've seen that referenced as being one of the inspirations,

364
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,480
 but what is it?

365
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,440
 - So the idea was that you would have a bunch of kids playing it.

366
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,560
 You would have a rock, a big stone, on a tree stump,

367
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
 and that would be the duck.

368
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,640
 And you had to knock the duck off the rock.

369
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,720
 One person had to stand and protect the duck.

370
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,640
 Make sure it's not knocked off the stump.

371
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,520
 The way you knock the big stone off the stump

372
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,320
 is by throwing rocks at it.

373
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,120
 Big rocks.

374
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,480
 - So effectively as a kids game, where you were having stones

375
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,560
 chucked at you in order to protect another stone.

376
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,040
 So this is what James Naismith played as a kid

377
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,240
 that led to him partially inventing the basketball.

378
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,640
 - I think that sounds fun.

379
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,920
 - Oh, yeah.

380
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,760
 Stones?

381
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,040
 - I'd have a size limit on the stones you could throw.

382
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,120
 - They used to, so he used a peach basket at first,

383
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,760
 and they kept using, that was in 1891.

384
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,680
 They kept using peach baskets until 1906, I think.

385
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,040
 But they realized really early on

386
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,440
 to drill a hole in the peach basket,

387
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,960
 and then you'd poke a stick up through the hole

388
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
 so you could poke the ball out.

389
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,840
 - When you figure it out that you can make a hole,

390
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,880
 and then you'd be like, "Yeah, let's just make a small one."

391
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,200
 Just for a stick, that's big enough.

392
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,280
 - I think he might have been though.

393
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
 Apparently he had a really tense relationship

394
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,160
 with a school janitor because of all his peach basket.

395
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,560
 And he kept on having his peach baskets

396
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,480
 with holes in them.

397
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,560
 So I think maybe it was like to appease the janitor,

398
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,360
 he was like, "Okay, I'll just do a small one."

399
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,840
 - So a hole that's big enough for a stick,

400
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
 but not big enough for a peach.

401
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,520
 - Yeah.

402
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
 - Exactly.

403
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,680
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

404
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,240
 - In Japan, they like to turn games into unofficial sports.

405
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,400
 I only, I read it today that they have official rules

406
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,920
 for pillow fighting now.

407
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
 - Really?

408
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,320
 - So they have, and there's now an official pillow fight

409
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,080
 association of Japan.

410
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,800
 There's a referee, so there must be rules.

411
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,920
 And I think it was a Japanese guy who once tried

412
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,080
 to get hide and seek as an official Olympic game.

413
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,640
 (laughing)

414
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,680
 - That's great.

415
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,280
 - Other ones we had on the show were a toe wrestling.

416
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,360
 - Yeah, and then of course there's the very famous,

417
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,920
 I think it's even British, the very famous sports

418
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,760
 called Ferret in your pants.

419
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,400
 (laughing)

420
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
 - What is that?

421
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,560
 - Well, it's very simple.

422
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,880
 You have to close your trousers at your ankles,

423
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,200
 and then you have to put a ferret in your pants,

424
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,720
 and then you have to close the trousers around your waist.

425
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
 And, well, then you just wait.

426
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,960
 - Then you have to wait.

427
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
 - And just wait for the rest of your life.

428
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,960
 - And you have to set a world record.

429
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,700
 And Ferret's normally bite and they don't let go.

430
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,940
 So the best way to do this is to wait until it bites,

431
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,660
 and of course they like the soft bits more.

432
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,060
 They say don't pull them loose because they will bite again.

433
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,220
 Just, leave it.

434
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,140
 - Yeah, just cope with the pain.

435
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,620
 - It wasn't very easy to say that, isn't it?

436
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,900
 - Yeah, just leave it.

437
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,740
 It's fine.

438
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,580
 What are you complaining about?

439
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,820
 It'll get worse if you pick it.

440
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
 - Yeah.

441
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:02,460
 - And the world champion was very proud

442
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,300
 that after his world record, he had three more kids.

443
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,140
 - Oh, wow.

444
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,980
 - Yeah.

445
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,620
 - That's pretty impressive.

446
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,380
 All right, let's wrap up on this one.

447
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,460
 James, have you got anything to add?

448
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,020
 - The guy who sold his name that Leven was talking about

449
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,420
 is JasonSurfRap.com,

450
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,860
 formerly known as JasonHeadsets.com.

451
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,500
 I'm not sure what his name was before that.

452
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,820
 I was looking for the rules of pillow fighting.

453
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,540
 I found the pillow fight League of Toronto.

454
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,500
 They have a few rules.

455
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,220
 Their rule one is women fighters only.

456
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,580
 No exceptions.

457
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,380
 And their last rule is loading a pillow

458
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
 with a foreign object, such as a brick,

459
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,700
 is strictly forbidden.

460
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,380
 (laughing)

461
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,020
 And then just finally, I found the newspaper article

462
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,580
 from 1992 about ferrets.

463
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,780
 This was in the town of Newtown in Mid Wales.

464
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,580
 This is a group of vigilantes

465
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,300
 and they'd had a lot of crime in the area.

466
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,140
 And they said, our plan for keeping

467
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,860
 law and order is simple.

468
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,460
 Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime

469
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,460
 will frog march off to the hills

470
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,020
 where there's no one to hear the screams.

471
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,460
 We'll hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers.

472
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,700
 (laughing)

473
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:18,740
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three and Anna.

474
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,580
 That's your fact.

475
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,260
 Yeah, my fact is that if you get a zebrafish drunk

476
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,220
 and put him in a tank with other zebrafish,

477
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,940
 the sober ones will follow him around.

478
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,660
 But in a conger line.

479
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,140
 Yeah, it's doing better for dogs.

480
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,540
 Yeah.

481
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,580
 So yeah, they brought, so the way they,

482
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,980
 they've made zebrafish drunk before,

483
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,340
 they're quite useful fish to study

484
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,380
 'cause they're translucent.

485
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,620
 So you can see what's going on in their bodies

486
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,700
 without being to slit them open.

487
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,260
 But the way they do it is they put a drop alcohol

488
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,180
 into their tanks and then they take the zebrafish

489
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,420
 out of the alcoholic tank,

490
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,580
 drop it in with other zebrafish and another one.

491
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,820
 And yeah, turns out they all follow him around.

492
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,100
 And why are they following?

493
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,180
 They're not entirely sure.

494
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,420
 So if you get a zebrafish, it's just like humans really.

495
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:58,420
 They get more lively and they move faster

496
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,940
 and they seem not as afraid of threats and stuff.

497
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,580
 And so everyone just follows him about.

498
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,580
 So he seems like a cool guy.

499
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,620
 And follow that fish.

500
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,540
 Yeah, you can follow that fish with no fear.

501
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,980
 We've been following you for hours now.

502
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,660
 We're still here in the town.

503
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,180
 We're like, okay, that's cool.

504
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
 I read a story about a drunken moose.

505
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,260
 They found it in a, entangled in an apple tree.

506
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,700
 Yeah, I saw the pictures.

507
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,540
 Yeah, it's amazing.

508
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,460
 It's amazing, so so.

509
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,900
 Yeah, it's in Sweden, right?

510
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,060
 Yeah, it's an amazing father.

511
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,900
 You have to get drunk.

512
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,740
 It got drunk off eating apples.

513
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,820
 So the apples were fermented.

514
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,540
 But it happens a lot that animals get drunk

515
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,860
 from eating fermented fruit.

516
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,100
 There was one's a documentary where they were showing

517
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,380
 a drunk elephant.

518
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,780
 And then afterwards turned out that the documentary

519
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,580
 makers just made him drunk.

520
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,580
 Just gave him.

521
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,580
 Wow.

522
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,700
 There's a myth that elephant's drink that they get drunk

523
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,420
 from the Amarula fruit, which comes from the Marula tree.

524
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,340
 And I've found that it's probably not true.

525
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,860
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, either way.

526
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,260
 But they would have to eat so much of the fruit.

527
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,340
 And also, they eat it.

528
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,500
 I mean, every animal near a Marula tree loves the fruit.

529
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,100
 So they eat it as soon as it drops.

530
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,700
 Some elephants even push over the trees

531
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,180
 to get to the higher fruits.

532
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,540
 So it would be far too quick for it

533
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,060
 to ferment into enough alcohol.

534
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,020
 Is it a myth about koalas and eucalyptus?

535
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
 Do they get high?

536
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,460
 Dolphins get high by chewing puffin fish.

537
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:21,980
 Really?

538
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,580
 Yeah.

539
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,900
 A puffin fish has a poison that comes out.

540
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,860
 So when it's bitten, it blows up and it dejects a poison.

541
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,260
 And dolphins are big enough, so they just get high.

542
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,220
 And when they find a puffin fish, they hand it to each other,

543
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,420
 like students with a joint.

544
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,980
 Yeah, it's just--

545
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,020
 Yeah, they hand it to each other.

546
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,740
 And then they hang upside down in the water.

547
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,060
 And they're just tripping dolphins.

548
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,300
 Have you-- is that footage of that online?

549
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,820
 Yes.

550
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,900
 Oh, we must watch that.

551
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,060
 It was filmed by the BBC.

552
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,220
 And it was seen for the first time

553
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,060
 because they used cameras that looked like sea animals.

554
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,180
 So they built a camera that looked like a sea turtle

555
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,360
 and the dolphins were not disturbed.

556
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,980
 And this was not seen before because they

557
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,660
 don't do it when they're humans around.

558
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,160
 Yeah, probably.

559
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,300
 They're too paranoid, I guess.

560
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,740
 On drunk animals.

561
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,260
 Yeah.

562
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,700
 And drunk elephants, specifically.

563
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
 Elephants do get drunk quite often in India.

564
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,300
 Apparently, an elephant expert in Assam claims.

565
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,260
 Because of Indian rice wine.

566
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,540
 And I don't know why they keep relieving it out.

567
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,340
 But elephants love Indian rice wine.

568
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,300
 And so they've stampeded villages,

569
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,100
 and they've got their rice wine and stuff.

570
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,140
 And there was an occasion a few years ago,

571
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,340
 I think maybe in 2004, where they got really drunk on rice beer

572
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,100
 and they ended up knocking over an electricity pole.

573
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,180
 And four of them got electrocuted.

574
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,380
 So it's-- drinking is dangerous.

575
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,820
 Not just for humans.

576
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,540
 But it's not dangerous for another animal called

577
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,100
 the Pentails Tree Shrew, which lives in Malaysia.

578
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,180
 And it's frequently drunk as a much drunker than human

579
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,180
 skat, it's several times over the legal limit to drive,

580
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:02,220
 for example, even if it wasn't Tree Shrew.

581
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,180
 But the equivalent of about nine small glasses of wine

582
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,700
 is what scientists think based on Tree Shrew biology

583
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,980
 and also the effect of the nectar.

584
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,300
 But they don't get drunk in the same way that humans do.

585
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,300
 They don't show the same effect behaviorally.

586
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,620
 So some scientists think that we might be able to harness

587
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,420
 the power of the Tree Shrew to drink it down.

588
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,460
 So why would we want to harness something that allows us

589
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,500
 to drink and not get drunk?

590
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,100
 Because beyond me, I don't think that humanity's

591
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,180
 crying out for me.

592
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,180
 Good call.

593
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,060
 But yeah, that's really cool.

594
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,740
 I think they pollinate the plant by doing this.

595
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,780
 And so they'll go keep going back to the bar

596
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,300
 and getting another sip.

597
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,860
 And slow loruses do it as well.

598
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,780
 That's cool.

599
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,260
 I love slow loruses.

600
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,500
 Yeah, these slow loruses, I think,

601
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,740
 is the only mammal that is both venomous and poisonous.

602
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,220
 And it's the only primate that's venomous at all.

603
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,740
 They produce poison in their elbows.

604
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,660
 And then they lick it.

605
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,460
 And they have it in their teeth.

606
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,700
 And then they'll bite you with it.

607
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,540
 And they'll inject the poison into you.

608
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,060
 Wow.

609
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,100
 So it's not quite venomous.

610
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,500
 Because usually you're producing the venom

611
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,140
 in the same place where you're giving it to your victim.

612
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,660
 Yeah.

613
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
 Yeah, that's so cute.

614
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,700
 Got such a cute reputation.

615
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,220
 Yeah.

616
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,020
 Don't know that bite you.

617
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,820
 We had on our show, we had a venomous centipede

618
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,140
 that eats bats.

619
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,580
 Cool.

620
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,700
 Yeah, it's 30 centimeters long.

621
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,620
 And it hangs from the top of a cave.

622
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,260
 And when a bat flies by, it just catches them

623
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,460
 while they're flying.

624
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,140
 And then eats it complete in two hours, I think.

625
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,580
 And we had an on the show.

626
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,300
 And I threw in a piece of chicken.

627
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,220
 And it just ran for it and just grabbed it.

628
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,380
 I hate centipedes so much.

629
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,900
 I think my leaves favor that all.

630
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
 Yeah, I don't like them at all.

631
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,060
 What about millipedes?

632
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,180
 I don't like them.

633
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,820
 I've been reading about legs.

634
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,340
 And centipedes move very fast, because they're hunters.

635
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,380
 And millipedes move nice and slowly and gently,

636
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,460
 because they're scavengers.

637
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,180
 They're not interested in chasing down prey.

638
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,540
 So I think it's that centipede movement that I don't like.

639
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,340
 Mm-hmm.

640
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,660
 The one that Leven was talking about

641
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,740
 is called Skolopendra Gigantia.

642
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,700
 And it's been found in London, the batting one.

643
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,300
 Great.

644
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,580
 I bet it's been found in Southwest London, hasn't it?

645
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,260
 Unfortunately, no.

646
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,740
 It was found by Stuart Hain, who a guy who we've met

647
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,380
 from a natural history museum.

648
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,780
 It was reparded to him.

649
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,580
 And it was climbing up someone's living room wall.

650
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,220
 Oh, wow.

651
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,700
 A bite of this centipede has described

652
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,700
 as 30 bee stings in one place for a human.

653
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,140
 So it's not lethal for a human, but it's extremely painfully.

654
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,940
 James, if you tell me where the living room wall was,

655
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,180
 I will never go to that postcode in London.

656
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,940
 We couldn't vent the sport centipede and it depends.

657
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
 And so--

658
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,780
 [LAUGHTER]

659
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,940
 All right, shall we move on?

660
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,460
 So James, you've got any things you want to add?

661
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,260
 The misconception about koalas getting high on eucalyptus

662
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:56,020
 savethekoala.com, and they're very happy about that at all.

663
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,660
 They say the myth possibly arose as a way

664
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,060
 of explaining why koalas sleep for up to 22 hours a day.

665
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,860
 They need more sleep than most animals

666
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,660
 because eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, which kind of sounds

667
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
 like they are getting a bit high, but they're very adamant.

668
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,300
 They're not.

669
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,820
 OK.

670
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,340
 So sweet that they're trying to defend them

671
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:16,020
 for accusations of drug addiction, like our little koalas

672
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,780
 are not just taking drugs and getting high, OK?

673
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,620
 They're good boys.

674
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

675
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:28,420
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

676
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,220
 And Andy, it's you.

677
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,740
 OK.

678
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,580
 The youngest woolly mammoths are older than the oldest Egyptian

679
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,820
 ferros.

680
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,380
 Mammoths were walking the earth while there were ferros in Egypt.

681
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,620
 And after about 1,000 years of ferros as well.

682
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,420
 But yes, the last mammoths died out in about 1,500 BC.

683
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,220
 So they were around a lot longer than we think.

684
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,900
 I think that was actually when the pyramid's in a bit,

685
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,820
 but aren't they?

686
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,220
 Yeah, but it sounds like a great B-movie ferros in mammoths.

687
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,660
 Yes, we're going due to theaters near you.

688
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,660
 Yeah.

689
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,460
 But presumably, there weren't any woolly mammoths in Egypt.

690
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:01,980
 No.

691
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,300
 There's no ferros riding a woolly mammoth.

692
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,180
 No, the last ones were in the Arctic.

693
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,700
 In the Arctic.

694
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,420
 They were on a place called Wrangle Island,

695
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,260
 which is amazing today.

696
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,460
 It's now part of Russia.

697
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,620
 A few people believe they're still around, actually.

698
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,220
 Yes.

699
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,060
 Yeah, they were allegedly seen in Northern Russia.

700
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,340
 I think three years ago, it was a YouTube clip.

701
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,580
 But then it turned out to be false, of course.

702
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,660
 But you have this niche movement of crypto-biologists

703
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,140
 who think that there's many large animals

704
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,660
 that we haven't found yet, such as Bigfoot, of course.

705
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,860
 Yeah.

706
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,420
 But they also believe in the mammoth.

707
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,020
 Well, I mean, it's really interesting,

708
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,860
 because when you say, yeah, there might be woolly mammoths out there.

709
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,940
 Most of us just go, that's impossible.

710
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,580
 But they have found countless numbers of extinct animals

711
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,380
 that haven't been extinct.

712
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,940
 And we had a, in a future podcast coming out,

713
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,580
 we spoke to an explorer called John Blaschard-Snell,

714
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,780
 who went out to look for a mythical mammoth elephant

715
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,820
 and managed to find it.

716
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,580
 And it was thought to have been extinct and turned out it wasn't.

717
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,380
 And I can't remember.

718
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,500
 Is there anyone remember where he looked for that?

719
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
 I thought it was--

720
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,740
 Yeah, and a pull.

721
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,980
 That was a different kind of Asian elephant.

722
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,140
 Yes, to the one everyone thought.

723
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,580
 Yeah, you have this cartoon by XKCD, the internet,

724
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,180
 you have to list.

725
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,180
 And he has this timeline.

726
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,940
 And he says that now that everyone is carrying a photo camera

727
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,180
 or a video camera everywhere, the odds of finding Bigfoot

728
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,700
 are getting pretty slim.

729
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,740
 Because we had all these messy photos from a big distance.

730
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,540
 But everybody has a camera everywhere now.

731
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,900
 So if it exists, we should see it coming 10 years,

732
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,500
 or it just is important.

733
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,300
 Yeah, yeah.

734
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,220
 Oh, speaking of fakes, in 2003, a museum in Leon C,

735
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,660
 abandoned its plans to display 150,000-year-old,

736
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,260
 four-foot-long, woolly mammoth's tusk.

737
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,940
 After a second opinion from a geologist,

738
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,340
 identified it as a length of Victorian drainage pipe.

739
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,540
 [LAUGHTER]

740
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,340
 So it did not fit that.

741
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,060
 They were using tusks for pipes.

742
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,780
 That's fantastic.

743
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,540
 Amazing.

744
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,860
 I think at this point, the DNA that they've

745
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,580
 found in frozen mammoths is good enough to clone them.

746
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,060
 They found woolly mammoth blood and muscle tissue

747
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,780
 inside the bodies, which is a big step towards it.

748
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,180
 But just the so many difficulties of cloning

749
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,740
 beyond the thoracic park problem, finding a host,

750
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,340
 finding an organism similar enough.

751
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,900
 And they did clone the eyebecks, the perinean eyebecks.

752
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,220
 But that was an animal which had died out in the '90s.

753
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,580
 And they managed to clone one.

754
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,340
 It survived to seven minutes.

755
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,820
 The one that was born.

756
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,420
 Yeah, and then it had lung problems and died

757
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,380
 as a result of them.

758
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,980
 But they managed it.

759
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,220
 And what animal carried it?

760
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,300
 I don't know.

761
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,180
 Or maybe I suppose a similar eyebecks.

762
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,700
 We had a guy on Museum of Curiosity, the radio show

763
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,380
 that we do.

764
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,620
 He's a primatologist called Volkissummer.

765
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,700
 And he was saying one of the dangerous things

766
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,100
 that you're not allowed to say out loud,

767
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,940
 is that actually humans and great apes

768
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,060
 could actually still copulate and have a child.

769
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,380
 There is a story that in Belgian Congo,

770
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,580
 there was a mix of a bonnable and a human.

771
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,620
 Really, yes.

772
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:09,180
 But it's completely unject.

773
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,380
 One of the most famous biologists in Belgium

774
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,220
 is very fond of this myth and really wants to find it.

775
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,620
 Because I think technically, that would mean

776
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,940
 that we are the same species.

777
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,820
 No, that's only if the children can have children themselves.

778
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

779
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,900
 I am three and a half percent near the tall, by the way.

780
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,260
 You actually, you know that for certain?

781
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,100
 Yeah.

782
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,380
 I had my DNA tested.

783
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,980
 I am three and a half percent near the tall.

784
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,500
 Wow.

785
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,020
 Is that high above average?

786
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,580
 I think the average is two and a half, yeah.

787
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,180
 So I'm a bit more stupid than average.

788
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,180
 Cool.

789
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
 No, it's stronger, sorry.

790
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,420
 I mean, it's better at opening jars and--

791
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,860
 The place where you test it, when they send the results,

792
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
 they also have a suggestion of buying the t-shirts,

793
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,020
 three and a half percent near the tall.

794
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,860
 So for every percentage, they have a t-shirt.

795
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,500
 So they have maybe one or two--

796
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
 10 percent near the tall.

797
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,460
 How high does it go?

798
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,820
 I don't think it goes up to 10.

799
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,180
 I think maybe five or something.

800
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,100
 It is the highest and the lowest is maybe one and a half or something.

801
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,340
 The five is quite a lot.

802
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
 Yeah, five is a lot.

803
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,100
 Yeah, but I'm not sure.

804
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,620
 I'm not sure.

805
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,540
 Hey, did you know that with woolly mammoth tusks,

806
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:14,980
 that if you cut them open, like if you slice them between,

807
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,020
 you can tell how old the woolly mammoth was by the rings?

808
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
 Like a tree?

809
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
 Yeah.

810
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,820
 You can count the age of a woolly mammoth by its rings.

811
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,460
 The same thing is true for the earwax of whales.

812
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:26,820
 What?

813
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,340
 Wow.

814
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:27,860
 Yes.

815
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,700
 So a whale is a mammal.

816
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,260
 And of course, because of the high pressure,

817
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,940
 the water would get inside the ears.

818
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,340
 And evolutionary, they developed a plug of earwax inside the ears

819
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,780
 to keep the water out.

820
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,900
 And it grows every year.

821
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,820
 So when they find a dead whale, they just

822
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,380
 cut open the earwax plug.

823
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,700
 And they can count the ear rings in there.

824
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,020
 Wow.

825
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,140
 That lovely job.

826
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,460
 Brilliant, like a scam.

827
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,460
 Yeah.

828
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,540
 And they can even find chemicals in the rings,

829
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,980
 so they know in what year it was exposed to certain chemicals

830
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,980
 on that.

831
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,820
 Should we-- James, you want to add anything?

832
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,140
 The iBax was surrogated in a domestic goat.

833
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,380
 And that works OK.

834
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,940
 One quick more year-ing fact.

835
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,820
 Yes, you might have heard this.

836
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,660
 The oldest tree in the world, I think

837
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,020
 there's this wooden California where

838
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,260
 they have really old trees up to 4,000, 5,000 years old.

839
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,980
 And one guy was testing them.

840
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,420
 And he had a special drill.

841
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,540
 You had to drill into the tree and then take it out

842
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,860
 and you could count the year-ings.

843
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,700
 And it was a very expensive drill, was a new one.

844
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,460
 So he put it in a tree and then he couldn't get it out again.

845
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,220
 And then one of the guys there said, oh, let's just cut down

846
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,620
 the trees.

847
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,180
 There's lots of them here and then cut them down.

848
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,140
 And then he took this sample and he started counting

849
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,620
 and found out that this was the oldest tree ever seen

850
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,140
 in the world that he had just cut down.

851
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,980
 And the other oldest living tree is in another state.

852
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,340
 So they were very angry because now the other state

853
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,300
 had the oldest tree in the world.

854
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,820
 And he had to quit his job.

855
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,860
 And he moved to studying lakes.

856
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,860
 And I'm always wondering--

857
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,380
 You can't cut down a lake at least.

858
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,740
 Well, I'm always wondering if he ever studied the arral lake,

859
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,020
 which is slowly drying up.

860
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,140
 Oh, of course, yeah.

861
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,220
 Maybe his fault too.

862
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,220
 Yeah.

863
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:14,100
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

864
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,300
 OK, that's it.

865
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,300
 That's all of our facts.
