00:00:00,00:00:01,We run it on QI a few years ago.
00:00:01,00:00:02,Yeah.
00:00:02,00:00:04,"Which was, there's no such thing as a fish."
00:00:04,00:00:05,"You did a nice, such thing as a fish."
00:00:05,00:00:08,"No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary"
00:00:08,00:00:10,of Underwater Life.
00:00:10,00:00:11,"It says it right there, first paragraph."
00:00:11,00:00:12,No such thing as a fish.
00:00:12,00:00:15,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:00:15,00:00:25,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing"
00:00:25,00:00:27,"as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:27,00:00:30,to you from the QI Offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:30,00:00:31,My name is Dan Treurer.
00:00:31,00:00:34,"I'm sitting here with three other QI Elves, Andy Murray,"
00:00:34,00:00:37,"Anichezinski, and on our fact-checking duty today,"
00:00:37,00:00:38,James Harkin.
00:00:38,00:00:40,"Once again, we're gathering around the microphone"
00:00:40,00:00:42,to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:42,00:00:47,"And joining us today is a special guest, a comedian from Belgium,"
00:00:47,00:00:48,Leven Scheiren.
00:00:48,00:00:49,"Hi, hi."
00:00:49,00:00:50,How's it going?
00:00:50,00:00:53,"Well, very good, I'm here, so that's great."
00:00:53,00:00:54,"Yeah, we're very excited to have you here."
00:00:54,00:00:57,Leven is basically the Stephen Fry Belgium.
00:00:57,00:00:59,"We have a show out there called Skyra in the Creation,"
00:00:59,00:01:02,"which is a panel show in which you have sort of comedians,"
00:01:02,00:01:05,"as well as interesting guests, from all sorts of categories,"
00:01:05,00:01:05,wine tasters.
00:01:05,00:01:06,That's the one I saw.
00:01:06,00:01:08,"Yeah, yeah, it's a panel show."
00:01:08,00:01:10,"It's much like QI, you know."
00:01:10,00:01:13,I think I secretly want to make QI in Belgium.
00:01:13,00:01:15,And now I have to find a channel that wants to host it.
00:01:15,00:01:18,"Just remember, you got to headline the gig at CERN, right?"
00:01:18,00:01:21,"Yes, that was last summer I was performing at CERN,"
00:01:21,00:01:24,which was absolutely amazing being a physicist
00:01:24,00:01:25,standard comedian.
00:01:25,00:01:29,I could do all my geeky jokes.
00:01:29,00:01:30,That's great.
00:01:30,00:01:31,"All right, should we kick into it?"
00:01:31,00:01:32,Should we get fact number one on the way?
00:01:32,00:01:34,"OK, fact number one."
00:01:34,00:01:36,"We're going to start with you, Leven."
00:01:36,00:01:39,"Yes, my fact is that during the Second World War,"
00:01:39,00:01:43,the Nazis employed two official Nazi comedians.
00:01:43,00:01:44,"That's a starter, Shig."
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Yeah, they were called Trann und Heller."
00:01:46,00:01:47,And they did funny sketches.
00:01:47,00:01:50,And I think Trann was the fat stupid one.
00:01:50,00:01:53,And then Heller would be the perfect man.
00:01:53,00:01:55,There's a few still on YouTube.
00:01:55,00:01:59,"But I must warn you, they are utterly not funny."
00:01:59,00:02:01,"And so surprising, Nazis."
00:02:01,00:02:05,"And well, they all have this war propaganda scenarios."
00:02:05,00:02:09,"Like, I remember one where Trann was sitting in his living room"
00:02:09,00:02:11,and he was reading a biography of Churchill
00:02:11,00:02:14,that was given to him by his Jewish neighbor.
00:02:14,00:02:17,"But luckily, Heller arrived and said, Trann, what are you doing?"
00:02:17,00:02:18,That's all lies.
00:02:18,00:02:20,And that was about it.
00:02:20,00:02:21,That's the punchline.
00:02:21,00:02:22,That's the punchline.
00:02:22,00:02:23,This is why central government shouldn't
00:02:23,00:02:25,get involved in comedy writing.
00:02:25,00:02:25,"Yes, that's right."
00:02:25,00:02:26,That works.
00:02:26,00:02:30,But they stopped this shows before the end of the war
00:02:30,00:02:32,because the German people watching this
00:02:32,00:02:35,were all sympathizing with the stupid fat guy
00:02:35,00:02:38,and not with this impossibly perfect Heller.
00:02:38,00:02:41,And they were even the stupid comedian
00:02:41,00:02:44,"was banned from the Nazi party because of this, yeah."
00:02:44,00:02:46,"Yeah, they're really not funny, are they?"
00:02:46,00:02:47,"I watch one of them, which sounds really similar,"
00:02:47,00:02:49,about where he's listening to the radio
00:02:49,00:02:53,and he's being told by Heller to not listen to Western
00:02:53,00:02:55,"broadcasts and he, Trann, says, I think I can make up"
00:02:55,00:02:58,my own mind about what's the truth and what's not.
00:02:58,00:03:00,"And Heller goes, no, no, you can't, you don't understand."
00:03:00,00:03:01,You wouldn't understand any of this.
00:03:01,00:03:03,You have to be told by the state what's right and wrong.
00:03:03,00:03:05,"And when you're watching it, you're going,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,"well, this tall guy who's saying you have to be told"
00:03:07,00:03:08,by the state what's right and wrong
00:03:08,00:03:10,is obviously the bad guy here.
00:03:10,00:03:12,"And clearly, I like the short fat bloke who's going,"
00:03:12,00:03:14,"can I just listen to whatever program I want, please?"
00:03:14,00:03:16,So it was bizarre that they didn't realize.
00:03:16,00:03:17,That they didn't connoncer.
00:03:17,00:03:20,"Yeah, sometimes they tried to do a punchline."
00:03:20,00:03:24,"And well, it's always a bit pathetic when they're trying."
00:03:24,00:03:26,Even more when there's no punchline.
00:03:26,00:03:31,I remember one where Trann was using all his bread coupons
00:03:31,00:03:32,even though he didn't need them.
00:03:32,00:03:34,And he had all this old bread in his kitchen.
00:03:34,00:03:36,"And then Heller was coming, you can't do this."
00:03:36,00:03:37,And then what do you do with it?
00:03:37,00:03:39,"Well, I give it to the chicken."
00:03:39,00:03:40,You can't give it to the chicken.
00:03:40,00:03:42,And the other Germans need this bread.
00:03:42,00:03:44,And this war is hard on everybody.
00:03:44,00:03:47,"And then Heller says, what about the chicken?"
00:03:47,00:03:48,And that was it.
00:03:48,00:03:51,"Again, you totally sympathize with the chicken."
00:03:51,00:03:55,"When you listen to that, it's a really endearing perspective."
00:03:55,00:03:57,War was hard on the poultry.
00:03:57,00:03:57,It's interesting.
00:03:57,00:04:01,"War time, how comedy is used in propaganda."
00:04:01,00:04:04,I was really shocked by the number of Walt Disney
00:04:04,00:04:08,and Warner Brothers cartoons that were made featuring Hitler
00:04:08,00:04:10,and Bugs Bunny in the same sketch.
00:04:10,00:04:10,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:10,00:04:13,There was scenes of Daffy Duck on the top of Hitler
00:04:13,00:04:16,smacking his face and knocking his mustache off him and stuff.
00:04:16,00:04:21,I found German anti-Nazi jokes from the war.
00:04:21,00:04:23,I found them very interesting.
00:04:23,00:04:25,So one joke in Berlin during the last months of the war
00:04:25,00:04:28,"was that in Berlin, the optimists are learning English"
00:04:28,00:04:31,and the pessimists are learning Russian.
00:04:31,00:04:34,"Or another one, two people conversing."
00:04:34,00:04:37,"One says, what are you going to do after the war ends?"
00:04:37,00:04:39,"Well, I'm going to finally go on a holiday"
00:04:39,00:04:41,and I'll take a trip around greater Germany.
00:04:41,00:04:43,"Oh, yeah, what are you going to do in the afternoon?"
00:04:43,00:04:45,That kind of thing.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"Some of them kind of still funny, I think,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,"when the RAF is in the skies, the Germans take cover."
00:04:51,00:04:53,"When the Luftwaffe is in the sky, the Allies take cover."
00:04:53,00:04:56,"When the US Air Force is in the skies, everyone takes cover."
00:04:56,00:04:59,"Which, you know, kind of still applies."
00:04:59,00:05:03,But the Nazis banned apes from making the Hitler salute
00:05:03,00:05:05,"on pain of death for, I think, both ape"
00:05:05,00:05:07,and the person who trained the ape.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"During the early '30s, there were a lot of satirical comedians"
00:05:10,00:05:13,who made fun of the Hitler salute.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"And some animal trainers in circus,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,it was trained the apes to give a Hitler salute.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"Yeah, they'd dangle when the food wouldn't they?"
00:05:19,00:05:22,So they had to just reach their arm out at that position.
00:05:22,00:05:24,And the Nazis unsurprisingly took quite a dim view of that
00:05:24,00:05:27,"and they made it punishable by death by death, yeah."
00:05:27,00:05:30,"Well, any apes ever executed, do you know?"
00:05:30,00:05:31,I don't know.
00:05:31,00:05:33,I got it from a book about humor in Hitler's Germany.
00:05:33,00:05:35,And I haven't found any concrete examples.
00:05:35,00:05:37,Is that a lot of books?
00:05:37,00:05:41,"I think 10 years ago, a man was arrested in Germany"
00:05:41,00:05:44,for training his dog to do the Hitler salute.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- Really? - Yeah.
00:05:45,00:05:47,"- That's quite impressive. - 10 years ago, I think."
00:05:47,00:05:48,And he had trained him.
00:05:48,00:05:50,And he was walking around the park
00:05:50,00:05:53,"and every time he would pass a foreigner,"
00:05:53,00:05:56,he would command his dog to do a Hitler salute.
00:05:56,00:05:57,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:05:57,00:05:58,"Fair enough, arrest him."
00:05:58,00:05:59,"- Yeah, yeah, absolutely."
00:05:59,00:06:02,"- Alright, did you know England in 2004"
00:06:02,00:06:04,had a state jester?
00:06:04,00:06:06,"- No. - Yeah, we had a state jester."
00:06:06,00:06:09,It's a guy called Nigel Roder.
00:06:09,00:06:10,And he won a competition
00:06:10,00:06:13,to become the official state jester.
00:06:13,00:06:14,But there was too many complaints.
00:06:14,00:06:17,So he got his title removed.
00:06:17,00:06:18,- What were they complaining about?
00:06:18,00:06:21,- What the South grapes that they had been given?
00:06:21,00:06:22,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:06:22,00:06:24,It basically said that the English heritage
00:06:24,00:06:26,should not be allowed to use the title of state jester.
00:06:26,00:06:27,"A lot of people were just like,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,you can't be the state jester.
00:06:29,00:06:30,We're all jesters.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- Well, it's not, it's less funny"
00:06:31,00:06:34,when it's a state comedian as well.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"- Apparently, Eric Idol says"
00:06:35,00:06:38,that Prince Charles asked him to be the official court jester.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"And he said, no."
00:06:39,00:06:42,The mayor of Reykjavik is a standup comedian.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Really? - Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"They had, well, they had a very, very rough time"
00:06:46,00:06:48,during the financial crisis in Iceland.
00:06:48,00:06:50,And then he started a mock party.
00:06:50,00:06:53,"He said, yeah, all these, all these old politicians,"
00:06:53,00:06:54,they've all failed.
00:06:54,00:06:56,And he started a mock party.
00:06:56,00:07:01,"And I think he wanted an ice bear in the Iceland zoo,"
00:07:01,00:07:02,or the Iceland zoo at this point.
00:07:02,00:07:05,"Only has, I think, a cow and a rabbit."
00:07:05,00:07:08,"He wanted to legalize drugs,"
00:07:08,00:07:10,but only inside the parliament building.
00:07:10,00:07:12,- Right. - Right.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- But that was his program. - That's great.
00:07:14,00:07:15,And he won.
00:07:15,00:07:17,- And has he carried out any of his promises?
00:07:17,00:07:18,"- No, I don't think so."
00:07:18,00:07:20,I don't think there's an ice bear there.
00:07:20,00:07:21,"He's like, all the others."
00:07:21,00:07:23,- Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:25,- He surrounded himself with very good advices
00:07:25,00:07:28,"because he realized that, well, I can't do politics."
00:07:28,00:07:29,I know nothing about it.
00:07:29,00:07:30,And he's doing very well.
00:07:30,00:07:33,People are very happy with how he rules the Reykjavik.
00:07:33,00:07:34,- That's great. - Oh.
00:07:34,00:07:37,- And the mayor of London is a comedian of sorts.
00:07:37,00:07:39,"- Yeah, I even know this well."
00:07:39,00:07:41,"Eddie is, I'd wants to run in 2020."
00:07:41,00:07:43,"So, you know, could be a running thing."
00:07:43,00:07:44,- Could be.
00:07:44,00:07:46,"We should move on, James."
00:07:46,00:07:48,"Before we do, have you got any facts you want to chuck in?"
00:07:48,00:07:52,- You were talking about the Walt Disney and Warner Brothers
00:07:52,00:07:53,propaganda.
00:07:53,00:07:56,"Donald Duck was in De Fuhrer's face,"
00:07:56,00:07:59,where he breaks down after experiencing a nightmare.
00:07:59,00:08:02,"He has to make do with eating ridiculous Nazi food rations,"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"such as a smell of bacon and eggs,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,caught made with one bean and a slice of stale bread.
00:08:08,00:08:09,- Wow.
00:08:09,00:08:13,"- And in Commando Duck, Donald Duck by himself"
00:08:13,00:08:15,destroys an entire Japanese air base.
00:08:15,00:08:17,That sounds amazing.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Anything else?
00:08:18,00:08:20,"- Yeah, Liam was talking about the dog"
00:08:20,00:08:21,who was doing the Hitler salute.
00:08:21,00:08:24,I found it on the Daily Mail website
00:08:24,00:08:26,under the headline Howl Hitler.
00:08:26,00:08:32,And they arrested this guy whose dog was doing the Hitler salute.
00:08:32,00:08:36,"And Spokesman, Eva Marie Connig said we are retraining him"
00:08:36,00:08:38,to stop him raising his leg too high.
00:08:38,00:08:40,He doesn't have anything that would make him interesting
00:08:40,00:08:42,to write Wing extremists.
00:08:42,00:08:44,"However, we think he will quickly find a new owner"
00:08:44,00:08:46,because he is so famous.
00:08:46,00:08:47,(laughing)
00:08:47,00:08:50,(upbeat music)
00:08:50,00:08:53,"- Okay, time for fact number two."
00:08:53,00:08:55,This one's my fact.
00:08:55,00:08:58,"So this fact is that the Philippines Basketball Association,"
00:08:58,00:09:01,"which is the second oldest in the world after the NBA,"
00:09:01,00:09:03,have 10 teams in total.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"And their names include The Rain and Shine Elasto Painters,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,"The San Miguel Beer Men,"
00:09:09,00:09:12,"and Talk and Text, Troopang Textors."
00:09:12,00:09:14,"- So a lot of teams with no integrity at all,"
00:09:14,00:09:16,just selling out concept names.
00:09:16,00:09:17,"- What, it's done there?"
00:09:17,00:09:18,It's not selling out.
00:09:18,00:09:20,It's just that's the way that they are.
00:09:20,00:09:22,"Like if you watch boxing matches these days,"
00:09:22,00:09:25,most boxers have adverts painted on their back.
00:09:25,00:09:28,- There's a guy in America who's selling his last name now.
00:09:28,00:09:33,"So companies can bid, and the highest bidder will be the company name"
00:09:33,00:09:35,that will become his official last name.
00:09:35,00:09:37,"He did it last year for one company,"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"and now he's called, I don't know, James McDonald's or something."
00:09:41,00:09:43,"And now he's doing it again,"
00:09:43,00:09:44,"because it was only for one year,"
00:09:44,00:09:47,"and I think he gets some $50,000 out of it."
00:09:47,00:09:51,"- Wow, dude, I think the only benefit for these companies"
00:09:51,00:09:54,"is in the newspaper coverage that a man is changing his name,"
00:09:54,00:09:57,because no one sees Kevin Budweiser
00:09:57,00:09:59,and thinks I must go and have a beer.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- We had a football team in Belgium,"
00:10:01,00:10:04,"which was sponsored by Mick Quickis,"
00:10:04,00:10:07,"is the Belgian McDonald's, like Burger King."
00:10:07,00:10:10,"And they had one player called McDonald's,"
00:10:10,00:10:14,"and so I was running on the field with this quick logo on his back,"
00:10:14,00:10:15,"and then McDonald, the moment."
00:10:15,00:10:19,"- When I was looking into the Filipino basketball stuff,"
00:10:19,00:10:22,"because it's a huge sport there, they absolutely love it."
00:10:22,00:10:25,But I suddenly remembered that Dennis Rodman
00:10:25,00:10:26,had been out there a few years back.
00:10:26,00:10:29,Dennis Rodman was in the Chicago Bulls.
00:10:29,00:10:31,"He famously was married to Carmen Electra,"
00:10:31,00:10:33,and he's been most notable in the news recently
00:10:33,00:10:36,because of his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
00:10:36,00:10:40,But when he went out to the Philippines to play
00:10:40,00:10:43,"in sort of one of those Americans versus the Philippines,"
00:10:43,00:10:46,"basketball matches, he met up with his estranged dad,"
00:10:46,00:10:48,"who he hadn't seen for 40 years,"
00:10:48,00:10:50,who's been living in the Philippines for all these years.
00:10:50,00:10:54,But he's had 29 children to 16 different wives.
00:10:54,00:10:57,"And his name, this is his birth name, Philander,"
00:10:57,00:11:00,"spelled exactly the same, just exactly the same."
00:11:00,00:11:02,"It's Philander Rodman, he lives out there,"
00:11:02,00:11:04,"and he runs his own burger shop,"
00:11:04,00:11:07,"which is called Rodman's Rainbow Obama Burger Restaurant,"
00:11:07,00:11:10,in which you can get different colored buns.
00:11:10,00:11:12,And apparently they're really good burgers.
00:11:12,00:11:13,- Quite a mouth.
00:11:13,00:11:15,- They're all really good names all over the Philippines.
00:11:15,00:11:17,"I think the president and his sisters have nicknames,"
00:11:17,00:11:20,"including Pinkie, Nunu, and Bulzi."
00:11:20,00:11:21,"- Well, there's the classic Cardinal Sin,"
00:11:21,00:11:24,who was the main Cardinal for years.
00:11:24,00:11:26,"I think he's passed away,"
00:11:26,00:11:27,"- Yes, he died a few years ago."
00:11:27,00:11:28,"- Yeah, Jaime Sin."
00:11:28,00:11:31,"- They're amazing sports names all over the world, though."
00:11:31,00:11:31,They're so fun.
00:11:31,00:11:33,"Remember, I think in 2005,"
00:11:33,00:11:35,there was a sudden rush on sales
00:11:35,00:11:37,"of the Peruvian football team,"
00:11:37,00:11:41,"Deportivo Wankers, in Britain."
00:11:41,00:11:43,"And there's a quote from the club spokesman,"
00:11:43,00:11:44,"who just came over and he was like,"
00:11:44,00:11:45,"""It is very strange."
00:11:45,00:11:48,"""Everyone in Britain seems to think we have a funny name."""
00:11:50,00:11:52,The Wanker are just like Peruvian peoples.
00:11:52,00:11:53,It's not a funny word.
00:11:53,00:11:56,"They decided to, when they were in danger of being relegated,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,they decided to change their football ground
00:11:58,00:12:00,"to the highest town in the world,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,"which I think is called Serro de Pasco,"
00:12:02,00:12:03,and I probably haven't pronounced that right.
00:12:03,00:12:06,"But it is 4,400 meters above sea level"
00:12:06,00:12:08,and normal people can't really breathe there or do anything.
00:12:08,00:12:10,And so obviously these guys are used to it.
00:12:10,00:12:11,"So, and they were accused of cheating,"
00:12:11,00:12:13,"'cause whenever a football team came to play them,"
00:12:13,00:12:15,they all just kind of started collapsing.
00:12:15,00:12:16,"And I'm kind of like, ""That's very cool."""
00:12:16,00:12:17,"Well, it melts down."
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, they still got relegated, so it did not work."
00:12:19,00:12:20,"- Well, it's amazing."
00:12:20,00:12:22,- My favorite basketball fact is somewhat the same.
00:12:22,00:12:25,It's the Spanish basketball team
00:12:25,00:12:27,had to return their gold medals
00:12:27,00:12:30,"of the Paralympics in 2010,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,because their IQs turned out to be too high.
00:12:32,00:12:34,They had a basketball competition
00:12:34,00:12:37,for the intellectually disabled world.
00:12:37,00:12:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:38,00:12:41,- And so the Spanish completely cheated
00:12:41,00:12:43,for having too high and IQ.
00:12:43,00:12:44,- Too high and IQ.
00:12:44,00:12:45,- That's amazing.
00:12:45,00:12:46,- Which is not normally an accusation level
00:12:46,00:12:47,that many sports people.
00:12:47,00:12:51,"- Well, that's the boy who was picked second-last,"
00:12:51,00:12:54,speaking consistently for 13 years of school.
00:12:54,00:12:57,- Do you know the guy who invented basketball?
00:12:57,00:13:00,"John Naysmith, his middle name is A,"
00:13:00,00:13:01,and they don't know what his middle name means.
00:13:01,00:13:02,"And the family have said,"
00:13:02,00:13:03,"we think he just put it there,"
00:13:03,00:13:05,like President...
00:13:05,00:13:06,- Ulysses S.
00:13:06,00:13:07,- S?
00:13:07,00:13:08,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:13:08,00:13:08,- Possibly.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"- It's just an S, isn't it?"
00:13:09,00:13:11,"- It's just an S, yeah."
00:13:11,00:13:13,But one of the discoveries that they've made about this guy
00:13:13,00:13:15,is the influences that they reckon
00:13:15,00:13:17,"that led to the creation of basketball,"
00:13:17,00:13:18,including a game called...
00:13:18,00:13:20,Has anyone heard of this duck on a rock?
00:13:20,00:13:21,Does anyone have duck on it?
00:13:21,00:13:23,"- I've seen that referenced as being one of the inspirations,"
00:13:23,00:13:24,but what is it?
00:13:24,00:13:26,- So the idea was that you would have a bunch of kids playing it.
00:13:26,00:13:29,"You would have a rock, a big stone, on a tree stump,"
00:13:29,00:13:30,and that would be the duck.
00:13:30,00:13:33,And you had to knock the duck off the rock.
00:13:33,00:13:37,One person had to stand and protect the duck.
00:13:37,00:13:39,Make sure it's not knocked off the stump.
00:13:39,00:13:42,The way you knock the big stone off the stump
00:13:42,00:13:44,is by throwing rocks at it.
00:13:44,00:13:45,Big rocks.
00:13:45,00:13:48,"- So effectively as a kids game, where you were having stones"
00:13:48,00:13:51,chucked at you in order to protect another stone.
00:13:51,00:13:55,So this is what James Naismith played as a kid
00:13:55,00:13:57,that led to him partially inventing the basketball.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- I think that sounds fun.
00:13:58,00:13:59,"- Oh, yeah."
00:13:59,00:14:00,Stones?
00:14:00,00:14:03,- I'd have a size limit on the stones you could throw.
00:14:03,00:14:05,"- They used to, so he used a peach basket at first,"
00:14:05,00:14:06,"and they kept using, that was in 1891."
00:14:06,00:14:09,"They kept using peach baskets until 1906, I think."
00:14:09,00:14:11,But they realized really early on
00:14:11,00:14:12,"to drill a hole in the peach basket,"
00:14:12,00:14:13,and then you'd poke a stick up through the hole
00:14:13,00:14:15,so you could poke the ball out.
00:14:15,00:14:17,"- When you figure it out that you can make a hole,"
00:14:17,00:14:20,"and then you'd be like, ""Yeah, let's just make a small one."""
00:14:20,00:14:22,"Just for a stick, that's big enough."
00:14:22,00:14:23,- I think he might have been though.
00:14:23,00:14:25,Apparently he had a really tense relationship
00:14:25,00:14:28,with a school janitor because of all his peach basket.
00:14:28,00:14:29,And he kept on having his peach baskets
00:14:29,00:14:30,with holes in them.
00:14:30,00:14:32,"So I think maybe it was like to appease the janitor,"
00:14:32,00:14:34,"he was like, ""Okay, I'll just do a small one."""
00:14:34,00:14:35,"- So a hole that's big enough for a stick,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,but not big enough for a peach.
00:14:37,00:14:38,- Yeah.
00:14:38,00:14:39,- Exactly.
00:14:39,00:14:42,"- Yeah, that makes sense."
00:14:42,00:14:46,"- In Japan, they like to turn games into unofficial sports."
00:14:46,00:14:49,"I only, I read it today that they have official rules"
00:14:49,00:14:50,for pillow fighting now.
00:14:50,00:14:51,- Really?
00:14:51,00:14:55,"- So they have, and there's now an official pillow fight"
00:14:55,00:14:57,association of Japan.
00:14:57,00:14:59,"There's a referee, so there must be rules."
00:14:59,00:15:01,And I think it was a Japanese guy who once tried
00:15:01,00:15:05,to get hide and seek as an official Olympic game.
00:15:05,00:15:06,(laughing)
00:15:06,00:15:07,- That's great.
00:15:07,00:15:10,- Other ones we had on the show were a toe wrestling.
00:15:10,00:15:12,"- Yeah, and then of course there's the very famous,"
00:15:12,00:15:14,"I think it's even British, the very famous sports"
00:15:14,00:15:16,called Ferret in your pants.
00:15:16,00:15:18,(laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:19,- What is that?
00:15:19,00:15:20,"- Well, it's very simple."
00:15:20,00:15:24,"You have to close your trousers at your ankles,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,"and then you have to put a ferret in your pants,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,and then you have to close the trousers around your waist.
00:15:30,00:15:33,"And, well, then you just wait."
00:15:33,00:15:33,- Then you have to wait.
00:15:33,00:15:34,- And just wait for the rest of your life.
00:15:34,00:15:36,- And you have to set a world record.
00:15:36,00:15:41,And Ferret's normally bite and they don't let go.
00:15:41,00:15:45,"So the best way to do this is to wait until it bites,"
00:15:45,00:15:48,and of course they like the soft bits more.
00:15:48,00:15:51,They say don't pull them loose because they will bite again.
00:15:51,00:15:52,"Just, leave it."
00:15:52,00:15:54,"- Yeah, just cope with the pain."
00:15:54,00:15:55,"- It wasn't very easy to say that, isn't it?"
00:15:55,00:15:56,"- Yeah, just leave it."
00:15:56,00:15:57,It's fine.
00:15:57,00:15:58,What are you complaining about?
00:15:58,00:15:59,It'll get worse if you pick it.
00:15:59,00:16:00,- Yeah.
00:16:00,00:16:02,- And the world champion was very proud
00:16:02,00:16:06,"that after his world record, he had three more kids."
00:16:06,00:16:07,"- Oh, wow."
00:16:07,00:16:07,- Yeah.
00:16:07,00:16:09,- That's pretty impressive.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"All right, let's wrap up on this one."
00:16:11,00:16:13,"James, have you got anything to add?"
00:16:13,00:16:16,- The guy who sold his name that Leven was talking about
00:16:16,00:16:19,"is JasonSurfRap.com,"
00:16:19,00:16:22,formerly known as JasonHeadsets.com.
00:16:22,00:16:24,I'm not sure what his name was before that.
00:16:24,00:16:26,I was looking for the rules of pillow fighting.
00:16:26,00:16:29,I found the pillow fight League of Toronto.
00:16:29,00:16:30,They have a few rules.
00:16:30,00:16:33,Their rule one is women fighters only.
00:16:33,00:16:34,No exceptions.
00:16:34,00:16:38,And their last rule is loading a pillow
00:16:38,00:16:40,"with a foreign object, such as a brick,"
00:16:40,00:16:41,is strictly forbidden.
00:16:41,00:16:43,(laughing)
00:16:43,00:16:46,"And then just finally, I found the newspaper article"
00:16:46,00:16:48,from 1992 about ferrets.
00:16:48,00:16:50,This was in the town of Newtown in Mid Wales.
00:16:50,00:16:52,This is a group of vigilantes
00:16:52,00:16:54,and they'd had a lot of crime in the area.
00:16:54,00:16:56,"And they said, our plan for keeping"
00:16:56,00:16:57,law and order is simple.
00:16:57,00:17:00,Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime
00:17:00,00:17:02,will frog march off to the hills
00:17:02,00:17:05,where there's no one to hear the screams.
00:17:05,00:17:08,We'll hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers.
00:17:08,00:17:10,(laughing)
00:17:10,00:17:18,"Okay, let's move on to fact number three and Anna."
00:17:18,00:17:19,That's your fact.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Yeah, my fact is that if you get a zebrafish drunk"
00:17:22,00:17:24,"and put him in a tank with other zebrafish,"
00:17:24,00:17:25,the sober ones will follow him around.
00:17:25,00:17:27,But in a conger line.
00:17:27,00:17:30,"Yeah, it's doing better for dogs."
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"So yeah, they brought, so the way they,"
00:17:33,00:17:34,"they've made zebrafish drunk before,"
00:17:34,00:17:36,they're quite useful fish to study
00:17:36,00:17:37,'cause they're translucent.
00:17:37,00:17:38,So you can see what's going on in their bodies
00:17:38,00:17:40,without being to slit them open.
00:17:40,00:17:43,But the way they do it is they put a drop alcohol
00:17:43,00:17:45,into their tanks and then they take the zebrafish
00:17:45,00:17:46,"out of the alcoholic tank,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,drop it in with other zebrafish and another one.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"And yeah, turns out they all follow him around."
00:17:50,00:17:52,And why are they following?
00:17:52,00:17:53,They're not entirely sure.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"So if you get a zebrafish, it's just like humans really."
00:17:55,00:17:58,They get more lively and they move faster
00:17:58,00:18:00,and they seem not as afraid of threats and stuff.
00:18:00,00:18:02,And so everyone just follows him about.
00:18:02,00:18:03,So he seems like a cool guy.
00:18:03,00:18:04,And follow that fish.
00:18:04,00:18:06,"Yeah, you can follow that fish with no fear."
00:18:06,00:18:07,We've been following you for hours now.
00:18:07,00:18:09,We're still here in the town.
00:18:09,00:18:11,"We're like, okay, that's cool."
00:18:11,00:18:13,I read a story about a drunken moose.
00:18:13,00:18:17,"They found it in a, entangled in an apple tree."
00:18:17,00:18:18,"Yeah, I saw the pictures."
00:18:18,00:18:19,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:18:19,00:18:20,"It's amazing, so so."
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Yeah, it's in Sweden, right?"
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Yeah, it's an amazing father."
00:18:23,00:18:23,You have to get drunk.
00:18:23,00:18:25,It got drunk off eating apples.
00:18:25,00:18:27,So the apples were fermented.
00:18:27,00:18:29,But it happens a lot that animals get drunk
00:18:29,00:18:30,from eating fermented fruit.
00:18:30,00:18:34,There was one's a documentary where they were showing
00:18:34,00:18:35,a drunk elephant.
00:18:35,00:18:37,And then afterwards turned out that the documentary
00:18:37,00:18:39,makers just made him drunk.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Just gave him.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Wow.
00:18:41,00:18:46,There's a myth that elephant's drink that they get drunk
00:18:46,00:18:51,"from the Amarula fruit, which comes from the Marula tree."
00:18:51,00:18:54,And I've found that it's probably not true.
00:18:54,00:18:56,"Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, either way."
00:18:56,00:19:00,But they would have to eat so much of the fruit.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"And also, they eat it."
00:19:01,00:19:04,"I mean, every animal near a Marula tree loves the fruit."
00:19:04,00:19:06,So they eat it as soon as it drops.
00:19:06,00:19:07,Some elephants even push over the trees
00:19:07,00:19:09,to get to the higher fruits.
00:19:09,00:19:11,So it would be far too quick for it
00:19:11,00:19:13,to ferment into enough alcohol.
00:19:13,00:19:16,Is it a myth about koalas and eucalyptus?
00:19:16,00:19:17,Do they get high?
00:19:17,00:19:21,Dolphins get high by chewing puffin fish.
00:19:21,00:19:21,Really?
00:19:21,00:19:22,Yeah.
00:19:22,00:19:24,A puffin fish has a poison that comes out.
00:19:24,00:19:29,"So when it's bitten, it blows up and it dejects a poison."
00:19:29,00:19:33,"And dolphins are big enough, so they just get high."
00:19:33,00:19:37,"And when they find a puffin fish, they hand it to each other,"
00:19:37,00:19:39,like students with a joint.
00:19:39,00:19:40,"Yeah, it's just--"
00:19:40,00:19:43,"Yeah, they hand it to each other."
00:19:43,00:19:44,And then they hang upside down in the water.
00:19:44,00:19:48,And they're just tripping dolphins.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Have you-- is that footage of that online?
00:19:49,00:19:49,Yes.
00:19:49,00:19:50,"Oh, we must watch that."
00:19:50,00:19:53,It was filmed by the BBC.
00:19:53,00:19:55,And it was seen for the first time
00:19:55,00:19:59,because they used cameras that looked like sea animals.
00:19:59,00:20:02,So they built a camera that looked like a sea turtle
00:20:02,00:20:04,and the dolphins were not disturbed.
00:20:04,00:20:05,And this was not seen before because they
00:20:05,00:20:07,don't do it when they're humans around.
00:20:07,00:20:08,"Yeah, probably."
00:20:08,00:20:10,"They're too paranoid, I guess."
00:20:10,00:20:11,On drunk animals.
00:20:11,00:20:12,Yeah.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"And drunk elephants, specifically."
00:20:13,00:20:15,Elephants do get drunk quite often in India.
00:20:15,00:20:19,"Apparently, an elephant expert in Assam claims."
00:20:19,00:20:21,Because of Indian rice wine.
00:20:21,00:20:22,And I don't know why they keep relieving it out.
00:20:22,00:20:24,But elephants love Indian rice wine.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"And so they've stampeded villages,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,and they've got their rice wine and stuff.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"And there was an occasion a few years ago,"
00:20:30,00:20:34,"I think maybe in 2004, where they got really drunk on rice beer"
00:20:34,00:20:38,and they ended up knocking over an electricity pole.
00:20:38,00:20:40,And four of them got electrocuted.
00:20:40,00:20:42,So it's-- drinking is dangerous.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Not just for humans.
00:20:43,00:20:47,But it's not dangerous for another animal called
00:20:47,00:20:51,"the Pentails Tree Shrew, which lives in Malaysia."
00:20:51,00:20:54,And it's frequently drunk as a much drunker than human
00:20:54,00:20:58,"skat, it's several times over the legal limit to drive,"
00:20:58,00:21:02,"for example, even if it wasn't Tree Shrew."
00:21:02,00:21:06,But the equivalent of about nine small glasses of wine
00:21:06,00:21:09,is what scientists think based on Tree Shrew biology
00:21:09,00:21:11,and also the effect of the nectar.
00:21:11,00:21:16,But they don't get drunk in the same way that humans do.
00:21:16,00:21:19,They don't show the same effect behaviorally.
00:21:19,00:21:22,So some scientists think that we might be able to harness
00:21:22,00:21:24,the power of the Tree Shrew to drink it down.
00:21:24,00:21:26,So why would we want to harness something that allows us
00:21:26,00:21:27,to drink and not get drunk?
00:21:27,00:21:29,"Because beyond me, I don't think that humanity's"
00:21:29,00:21:30,crying out for me.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Good call.
00:21:31,00:21:32,"But yeah, that's really cool."
00:21:32,00:21:34,I think they pollinate the plant by doing this.
00:21:34,00:21:36,And so they'll go keep going back to the bar
00:21:36,00:21:38,and getting another sip.
00:21:38,00:21:39,And slow loruses do it as well.
00:21:39,00:21:40,That's cool.
00:21:40,00:21:42,I love slow loruses.
00:21:42,00:21:43,"Yeah, these slow loruses, I think,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,is the only mammal that is both venomous and poisonous.
00:21:46,00:21:49,And it's the only primate that's venomous at all.
00:21:49,00:21:52,They produce poison in their elbows.
00:21:52,00:21:54,And then they lick it.
00:21:54,00:21:56,And they have it in their teeth.
00:21:56,00:21:57,And then they'll bite you with it.
00:21:57,00:21:59,And they'll inject the poison into you.
00:21:59,00:22:00,Wow.
00:22:00,00:22:02,So it's not quite venomous.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Because usually you're producing the venom
00:22:03,00:22:07,in the same place where you're giving it to your victim.
00:22:07,00:22:07,Yeah.
00:22:07,00:22:08,"Yeah, that's so cute."
00:22:08,00:22:09,Got such a cute reputation.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Yeah.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Don't know that bite you.
00:22:11,00:22:15,"We had on our show, we had a venomous centipede"
00:22:15,00:22:18,that eats bats.
00:22:18,00:22:19,Cool.
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Yeah, it's 30 centimeters long."
00:22:21,00:22:24,And it hangs from the top of a cave.
00:22:24,00:22:27,"And when a bat flies by, it just catches them"
00:22:27,00:22:28,while they're flying.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"And then eats it complete in two hours, I think."
00:22:31,00:22:32,And we had an on the show.
00:22:32,00:22:34,And I threw in a piece of chicken.
00:22:34,00:22:37,And it just ran for it and just grabbed it.
00:22:37,00:22:38,I hate centipedes so much.
00:22:38,00:22:39,I think my leaves favor that all.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Yeah, I don't like them at all."
00:22:41,00:22:43,What about millipedes?
00:22:43,00:22:44,I don't like them.
00:22:44,00:22:45,I've been reading about legs.
00:22:45,00:22:50,"And centipedes move very fast, because they're hunters."
00:22:50,00:22:52,"And millipedes move nice and slowly and gently,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,because they're scavengers.
00:22:53,00:22:56,They're not interested in chasing down prey.
00:22:56,00:22:58,So I think it's that centipede movement that I don't like.
00:22:58,00:22:59,Mm-hmm.
00:22:59,00:23:00,The one that Leven was talking about
00:23:00,00:23:03,is called Skolopendra Gigantia.
00:23:03,00:23:06,"And it's been found in London, the batting one."
00:23:06,00:23:07,Great.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"I bet it's been found in Southwest London, hasn't it?"
00:23:10,00:23:11,"Unfortunately, no."
00:23:11,00:23:13,"It was found by Stuart Hain, who a guy who we've met"
00:23:13,00:23:15,from a natural history museum.
00:23:15,00:23:16,It was reparded to him.
00:23:16,00:23:19,And it was climbing up someone's living room wall.
00:23:19,00:23:21,"Oh, wow."
00:23:21,00:23:25,A bite of this centipede has described
00:23:25,00:23:29,as 30 bee stings in one place for a human.
00:23:29,00:23:33,"So it's not lethal for a human, but it's extremely painfully."
00:23:33,00:23:34,"James, if you tell me where the living room wall was,"
00:23:34,00:23:38,I will never go to that postcode in London.
00:23:38,00:23:40,We couldn't vent the sport centipede and it depends.
00:23:40,00:23:41,And so--
00:23:41,00:23:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:43,00:23:44,"All right, shall we move on?"
00:23:44,00:23:47,"So James, you've got any things you want to add?"
00:23:47,00:23:52,The misconception about koalas getting high on eucalyptus
00:23:52,00:23:56,"savethekoala.com, and they're very happy about that at all."
00:23:56,00:23:58,They say the myth possibly arose as a way
00:23:58,00:24:02,of explaining why koalas sleep for up to 22 hours a day.
00:24:02,00:24:03,They need more sleep than most animals
00:24:03,00:24:07,"because eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, which kind of sounds"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"like they are getting a bit high, but they're very adamant."
00:24:09,00:24:10,They're not.
00:24:10,00:24:10,OK.
00:24:10,00:24:12,So sweet that they're trying to defend them
00:24:12,00:24:16,"for accusations of drug addiction, like our little koalas"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"are not just taking drugs and getting high, OK?"
00:24:18,00:24:19,They're good boys.
00:24:19,00:24:22,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:24:22,00:24:28,"OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show."
00:24:28,00:24:30,"And Andy, it's you."
00:24:30,00:24:30,OK.
00:24:30,00:24:34,The youngest woolly mammoths are older than the oldest Egyptian
00:24:34,00:24:35,ferros.
00:24:35,00:24:39,Mammoths were walking the earth while there were ferros in Egypt.
00:24:39,00:24:41,"And after about 1,000 years of ferros as well."
00:24:41,00:24:46,"But yes, the last mammoths died out in about 1,500 BC."
00:24:46,00:24:49,So they were around a lot longer than we think.
00:24:49,00:24:50,"I think that was actually when the pyramid's in a bit,"
00:24:50,00:24:51,but aren't they?
00:24:51,00:24:55,"Yeah, but it sounds like a great B-movie ferros in mammoths."
00:24:55,00:24:57,"Yes, we're going due to theaters near you."
00:24:57,00:24:58,Yeah.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"But presumably, there weren't any woolly mammoths in Egypt."
00:25:01,00:25:01,No.
00:25:01,00:25:04,There's no ferros riding a woolly mammoth.
00:25:04,00:25:06,"No, the last ones were in the Arctic."
00:25:06,00:25:06,In the Arctic.
00:25:06,00:25:08,"They were on a place called Wrangle Island,"
00:25:08,00:25:09,which is amazing today.
00:25:09,00:25:10,It's now part of Russia.
00:25:10,00:25:12,"A few people believe they're still around, actually."
00:25:12,00:25:13,Yes.
00:25:13,00:25:17,"Yeah, they were allegedly seen in Northern Russia."
00:25:17,00:25:20,"I think three years ago, it was a YouTube clip."
00:25:20,00:25:22,"But then it turned out to be false, of course."
00:25:22,00:25:27,But you have this niche movement of crypto-biologists
00:25:27,00:25:30,who think that there's many large animals
00:25:30,00:25:32,"that we haven't found yet, such as Bigfoot, of course."
00:25:32,00:25:32,Yeah.
00:25:32,00:25:34,But they also believe in the mammoth.
00:25:34,00:25:36,"Well, I mean, it's really interesting,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"because when you say, yeah, there might be woolly mammoths out there."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"Most of us just go, that's impossible."
00:25:40,00:25:43,But they have found countless numbers of extinct animals
00:25:43,00:25:45,that haven't been extinct.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"And we had a, in a future podcast coming out,"
00:25:47,00:25:51,"we spoke to an explorer called John Blaschard-Snell,"
00:25:51,00:25:55,who went out to look for a mythical mammoth elephant
00:25:55,00:25:56,and managed to find it.
00:25:56,00:25:59,And it was thought to have been extinct and turned out it wasn't.
00:25:59,00:26:00,And I can't remember.
00:26:00,00:26:02,Is there anyone remember where he looked for that?
00:26:02,00:26:03,I thought it was--
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Yeah, and a pull."
00:26:04,00:26:06,That was a different kind of Asian elephant.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"Yes, to the one everyone thought."
00:26:08,00:26:12,"Yeah, you have this cartoon by XKCD, the internet,"
00:26:12,00:26:13,you have to list.
00:26:13,00:26:16,And he has this timeline.
00:26:16,00:26:19,And he says that now that everyone is carrying a photo camera
00:26:19,00:26:23,"or a video camera everywhere, the odds of finding Bigfoot"
00:26:23,00:26:24,are getting pretty slim.
00:26:24,00:26:28,Because we had all these messy photos from a big distance.
00:26:28,00:26:30,But everybody has a camera everywhere now.
00:26:30,00:26:33,"So if it exists, we should see it coming 10 years,"
00:26:33,00:26:35,or it just is important.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:36,00:26:41,"Oh, speaking of fakes, in 2003, a museum in Leon C,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"abandoned its plans to display 150,000-year-old,"
00:26:44,00:26:47,"four-foot-long, woolly mammoth's tusk."
00:26:47,00:26:48,"After a second opinion from a geologist,"
00:26:48,00:26:51,identified it as a length of Victorian drainage pipe.
00:26:51,00:26:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:53,00:26:54,So it did not fit that.
00:26:54,00:26:57,They were using tusks for pipes.
00:26:57,00:26:57,That's fantastic.
00:26:57,00:26:58,Amazing.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"I think at this point, the DNA that they've"
00:27:01,00:27:05,found in frozen mammoths is good enough to clone them.
00:27:05,00:27:09,They found woolly mammoth blood and muscle tissue
00:27:09,00:27:11,"inside the bodies, which is a big step towards it."
00:27:11,00:27:14,But just the so many difficulties of cloning
00:27:14,00:27:17,"beyond the thoracic park problem, finding a host,"
00:27:17,00:27:20,finding an organism similar enough.
00:27:20,00:27:23,"And they did clone the eyebecks, the perinean eyebecks."
00:27:23,00:27:27,But that was an animal which had died out in the '90s.
00:27:27,00:27:28,And they managed to clone one.
00:27:28,00:27:30,It survived to seven minutes.
00:27:30,00:27:31,The one that was born.
00:27:31,00:27:34,"Yeah, and then it had lung problems and died"
00:27:34,00:27:35,as a result of them.
00:27:35,00:27:36,But they managed it.
00:27:36,00:27:38,And what animal carried it?
00:27:38,00:27:39,I don't know.
00:27:39,00:27:42,Or maybe I suppose a similar eyebecks.
00:27:42,00:27:45,"We had a guy on Museum of Curiosity, the radio show"
00:27:45,00:27:46,that we do.
00:27:46,00:27:48,He's a primatologist called Volkissummer.
00:27:48,00:27:50,And he was saying one of the dangerous things
00:27:50,00:27:52,"that you're not allowed to say out loud,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,is that actually humans and great apes
00:27:54,00:27:58,could actually still copulate and have a child.
00:27:58,00:28:01,"There is a story that in Belgian Congo,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,there was a mix of a bonnable and a human.
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Really, yes."
00:28:05,00:28:09,But it's completely unject.
00:28:09,00:28:13,One of the most famous biologists in Belgium
00:28:13,00:28:17,is very fond of this myth and really wants to find it.
00:28:17,00:28:20,"Because I think technically, that would mean"
00:28:20,00:28:22,that we are the same species.
00:28:22,00:28:26,"No, that's only if the children can have children themselves."
00:28:26,00:28:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:28:28,00:28:31,"I am three and a half percent near the tall, by the way."
00:28:31,00:28:33,"You actually, you know that for certain?"
00:28:33,00:28:34,Yeah.
00:28:34,00:28:35,I had my DNA tested.
00:28:35,00:28:36,I am three and a half percent near the tall.
00:28:36,00:28:37,Wow.
00:28:37,00:28:39,Is that high above average?
00:28:39,00:28:40,"I think the average is two and a half, yeah."
00:28:40,00:28:43,So I'm a bit more stupid than average.
00:28:43,00:28:44,Cool.
00:28:44,00:28:45,"No, it's stronger, sorry."
00:28:45,00:28:47,"I mean, it's better at opening jars and--"
00:28:47,00:28:49,"The place where you test it, when they send the results,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,"they also have a suggestion of buying the t-shirts,"
00:28:51,00:28:54,three and a half percent near the tall.
00:28:54,00:28:55,"So for every percentage, they have a t-shirt."
00:28:55,00:28:57,So they have maybe one or two--
00:28:57,00:28:58,10 percent near the tall.
00:28:58,00:28:59,How high does it go?
00:28:59,00:29:00,I don't think it goes up to 10.
00:29:00,00:29:03,I think maybe five or something.
00:29:03,00:29:06,It is the highest and the lowest is maybe one and a half or something.
00:29:06,00:29:07,The five is quite a lot.
00:29:07,00:29:08,"Yeah, five is a lot."
00:29:08,00:29:09,"Yeah, but I'm not sure."
00:29:09,00:29:09,I'm not sure.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"Hey, did you know that with woolly mammoth tusks,"
00:29:11,00:29:14,"that if you cut them open, like if you slice them between,"
00:29:14,00:29:18,you can tell how old the woolly mammoth was by the rings?
00:29:18,00:29:19,Like a tree?
00:29:19,00:29:20,Yeah.
00:29:20,00:29:21,You can count the age of a woolly mammoth by its rings.
00:29:21,00:29:26,The same thing is true for the earwax of whales.
00:29:26,00:29:26,What?
00:29:26,00:29:27,Wow.
00:29:27,00:29:27,Yes.
00:29:27,00:29:30,So a whale is a mammal.
00:29:30,00:29:32,"And of course, because of the high pressure,"
00:29:32,00:29:33,the water would get inside the ears.
00:29:33,00:29:39,"And evolutionary, they developed a plug of earwax inside the ears"
00:29:39,00:29:40,to keep the water out.
00:29:40,00:29:41,And it grows every year.
00:29:41,00:29:45,"So when they find a dead whale, they just"
00:29:45,00:29:47,cut open the earwax plug.
00:29:47,00:29:49,And they can count the ear rings in there.
00:29:49,00:29:51,Wow.
00:29:51,00:29:52,That lovely job.
00:29:52,00:29:53,"Brilliant, like a scam."
00:29:53,00:29:54,Yeah.
00:29:54,00:29:57,"And they can even find chemicals in the rings,"
00:29:57,00:30:00,so they know in what year it was exposed to certain chemicals
00:30:00,00:30:01,on that.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"Should we-- James, you want to add anything?"
00:30:03,00:30:09,The iBax was surrogated in a domestic goat.
00:30:09,00:30:10,And that works OK.
00:30:10,00:30:11,One quick more year-ing fact.
00:30:11,00:30:14,"Yes, you might have heard this."
00:30:14,00:30:18,"The oldest tree in the world, I think"
00:30:18,00:30:20,there's this wooden California where
00:30:20,00:30:24,"they have really old trees up to 4,000, 5,000 years old."
00:30:24,00:30:25,And one guy was testing them.
00:30:25,00:30:27,And he had a special drill.
00:30:27,00:30:29,You had to drill into the tree and then take it out
00:30:29,00:30:30,and you could count the year-ings.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"And it was a very expensive drill, was a new one."
00:30:32,00:30:35,So he put it in a tree and then he couldn't get it out again.
00:30:35,00:30:38,"And then one of the guys there said, oh, let's just cut down"
00:30:38,00:30:38,the trees.
00:30:38,00:30:40,There's lots of them here and then cut them down.
00:30:40,00:30:42,And then he took this sample and he started counting
00:30:42,00:30:45,and found out that this was the oldest tree ever seen
00:30:45,00:30:49,in the world that he had just cut down.
00:30:49,00:30:52,And the other oldest living tree is in another state.
00:30:52,00:30:55,So they were very angry because now the other state
00:30:55,00:30:57,had the oldest tree in the world.
00:30:57,00:30:58,And he had to quit his job.
00:30:58,00:31:01,And he moved to studying lakes.
00:31:01,00:31:02,And I'm always wondering--
00:31:02,00:31:04,You can't cut down a lake at least.
00:31:04,00:31:06,"Well, I'm always wondering if he ever studied the arral lake,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,which is slowly drying up.
00:31:08,00:31:09,"Oh, of course, yeah."
00:31:09,00:31:10,Maybe his fault too.
00:31:10,00:31:11,Yeah.
00:31:11,00:31:14,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:31:14,00:31:16,"OK, that's it."
