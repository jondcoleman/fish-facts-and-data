WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660
 We run it on QI a few years ago.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.500
 Yeah.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.400
 Which was, there's no such thing as a fish.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.660
 You did a nice, such thing as a fish.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.240
 No, seriously, it's in the Oxford Dictionary

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 of Underwater Life.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.520
 It says it right there, first paragraph.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.620
 No such thing as a fish.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.300
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:25.720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.200
 to you from the QI Offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.240
 My name is Dan Treurer.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.400
 I'm sitting here with three other QI Elves, Andy Murray,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.600
 Anichezinski, and on our fact-checking duty today,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.760
 James Harkin.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.600
 Once again, we're gathering around the microphone

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.960
 to share our favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.000
 And joining us today is a special guest, a comedian from Belgium,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.560
 Leven Scheiren.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.800
 Hi, hi.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 How's it going?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.200
 Well, very good, I'm here, so that's great.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.640
 Yeah, we're very excited to have you here.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.080
 Leven is basically the Stephen Fry Belgium.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.480
 We have a show out there called Skyra in the Creation,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.360
 which is a panel show in which you have sort of comedians,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.080
 as well as interesting guests, from all sorts of categories,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.920
 wine tasters.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.840
 That's the one I saw.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.320
 Yeah, yeah, it's a panel show.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.280
 It's much like QI, you know.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.440
 I think I secretly want to make QI in Belgium.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.560
 And now I have to find a channel that wants to host it.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.320
 Just remember, you got to headline the gig at CERN, right?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.360
 Yes, that was last summer I was performing at CERN,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.160
 which was absolutely amazing being a physicist

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.760
 standard comedian.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.200
 I could do all my geeky jokes.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 That's great.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.120
 All right, should we kick into it?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.840
 Should we get fact number one on the way?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 OK, fact number one.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.040
 We're going to start with you, Leven.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040
 Yes, my fact is that during the Second World War,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.040
 the Nazis employed two official Nazi comedians.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.240
 That's a starter, Shig.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.360
 Yeah, they were called Trann und Heller.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.960
 And they did funny sketches.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.600
 And I think Trann was the fat stupid one.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.640
 And then Heller would be the perfect man.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.280
 There's a few still on YouTube.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.160
 But I must warn you, they are utterly not funny.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.680
 And so surprising, Nazis.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.720
 And well, they all have this war propaganda scenarios.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.400
 Like, I remember one where Trann was sitting in his living room

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.800
 and he was reading a biography of Churchill

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.360
 that was given to him by his Jewish neighbor.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 But luckily, Heller arrived and said, Trann, what are you doing?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 That's all lies.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.320
 And that was about it.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.360
 That's the punchline.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 That's the punchline.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.720
 This is why central government shouldn't

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.240
 get involved in comedy writing.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.960
 Yes, that's right.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.960
 That works.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.680
 But they stopped this shows before the end of the war

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 because the German people watching this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.680
 were all sympathizing with the stupid fat guy

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.920
 and not with this impossibly perfect Heller.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.400
 And they were even the stupid comedian

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.680
 was banned from the Nazi party because of this, yeah.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 Yeah, they're really not funny, are they?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.920
 I watch one of them, which sounds really similar,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.600
 about where he's listening to the radio

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.520
 and he's being told by Heller to not listen to Western

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.920
 broadcasts and he, Trann, says, I think I can make up

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.120
 my own mind about what's the truth and what's not.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.160
 And Heller goes, no, no, you can't, you don't understand.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.680
 You wouldn't understand any of this.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.960
 You have to be told by the state what's right and wrong.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.200
 And when you're watching it, you're going,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.480
 well, this tall guy who's saying you have to be told

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 by the state what's right and wrong

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.120
 is obviously the bad guy here.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.400
 And clearly, I like the short fat bloke who's going,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.720
 can I just listen to whatever program I want, please?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.560
 So it was bizarre that they didn't realize.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.840
 That they didn't connoncer.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.360
 Yeah, sometimes they tried to do a punchline.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.080
 And well, it's always a bit pathetic when they're trying.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 Even more when there's no punchline.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.160
 I remember one where Trann was using all his bread coupons

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.400
 even though he didn't need them.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.720
 And he had all this old bread in his kitchen.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.640
 And then Heller was coming, you can't do this.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.640
 And then what do you do with it?

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.320
 Well, I give it to the chicken.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.560
 You can't give it to the chicken.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.840
 And the other Germans need this bread.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.960
 And this war is hard on everybody.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.600
 And then Heller says, what about the chicken?

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.800
 And that was it.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.640
 Again, you totally sympathize with the chicken.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.160
 When you listen to that, it's a really endearing perspective.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.120
 War was hard on the poultry.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.960
 It's interesting.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.640
 War time, how comedy is used in propaganda.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.440
 I was really shocked by the number of Walt Disney

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.280
 and Warner Brothers cartoons that were made featuring Hitler

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.000
 and Bugs Bunny in the same sketch.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.680
 There was scenes of Daffy Duck on the top of Hitler

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.880
 smacking his face and knocking his mustache off him and stuff.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.600
 I found German anti-Nazi jokes from the war.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.480
 I found them very interesting.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.760
 So one joke in Berlin during the last months of the war

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.560
 was that in Berlin, the optimists are learning English

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.880
 and the pessimists are learning Russian.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.640
 Or another one, two people conversing.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.600
 One says, what are you going to do after the war ends?

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.440
 Well, I'm going to finally go on a holiday

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.760
 and I'll take a trip around greater Germany.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.680
 Oh, yeah, what are you going to do in the afternoon?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.000
 That kind of thing.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.600
 Some of them kind of still funny, I think,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.000
 when the RAF is in the skies, the Germans take cover.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.680
 When the Luftwaffe is in the sky, the Allies take cover.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.920
 When the US Air Force is in the skies, everyone takes cover.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.920
 Which, you know, kind of still applies.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.680
 But the Nazis banned apes from making the Hitler salute

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 on pain of death for, I think, both ape

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.200
 and the person who trained the ape.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.960
 During the early '30s, there were a lot of satirical comedians

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.080
 who made fun of the Hitler salute.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.560
 And some animal trainers in circus,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.880
 it was trained the apes to give a Hitler salute.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.520
 Yeah, they'd dangle when the food wouldn't they?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.080
 So they had to just reach their arm out at that position.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.880
 And the Nazis unsurprisingly took quite a dim view of that

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.800
 and they made it punishable by death by death, yeah.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.440
 Well, any apes ever executed, do you know?

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.280
 I don't know.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.640
 I got it from a book about humor in Hitler's Germany.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.680
 And I haven't found any concrete examples.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.040
 Is that a lot of books?

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.920
 I think 10 years ago, a man was arrested in Germany

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.800
 for training his dog to do the Hitler salute.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.640
 - That's quite impressive. - 10 years ago, I think.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.720
 And he had trained him.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.440
 And he was walking around the park

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.040
 and every time he would pass a foreigner,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.000
 he would command his dog to do a Hitler salute.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.240
 - Wow. - Yeah.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.720
 Fair enough, arrest him.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.720
 - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.880
 - Alright, did you know England in 2004

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.400
 had a state jester?

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.800
 - No. - Yeah, we had a state jester.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.040
 It's a guy called Nigel Roder.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.480
 And he won a competition

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.400
 to become the official state jester.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.920
 But there was too many complaints.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.360
 So he got his title removed.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.400
 - What were they complaining about?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.320
 - What the South grapes that they had been given?

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.520
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.160
 It basically said that the English heritage

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.320
 should not be allowed to use the title of state jester.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.280
 A lot of people were just like,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.040
 you can't be the state jester.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.080
 We're all jesters.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.600
 - Well, it's not, it's less funny

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.320
 when it's a state comedian as well.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.520
 - Apparently, Eric Idol says

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.360
 that Prince Charles asked him to be the official court jester.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.200
 And he said, no.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.000
 The mayor of Reykjavik is a standup comedian.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.360
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.120
 They had, well, they had a very, very rough time

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.320
 during the financial crisis in Iceland.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.560
 And then he started a mock party.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.560
 He said, yeah, all these, all these old politicians,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.680
 they've all failed.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.680
 And he started a mock party.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.680
 And I think he wanted an ice bear in the Iceland zoo,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.800
 or the Iceland zoo at this point.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.520
 Only has, I think, a cow and a rabbit.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.520
 He wanted to legalize drugs,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.920
 but only inside the parliament building.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.240
 - Right. - Right.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.240
 - But that was his program. - That's great.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.280
 And he won.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.760
 - And has he carried out any of his promises?

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:18.800
 - No, I don't think so.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.320
 I don't think there's an ice bear there.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.880
 He's like, all the others.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.040
 - Yeah.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.840
 - He surrounded himself with very good advices

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.840
 because he realized that, well, I can't do politics.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.760
 I know nothing about it.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.800
 And he's doing very well.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.560
 People are very happy with how he rules the Reykjavik.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.800
 - That's great. - Oh.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.240
 - And the mayor of London is a comedian of sorts.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.040
 - Yeah, I even know this well.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.200
 Eddie is, I'd wants to run in 2020.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.680
 So, you know, could be a running thing.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.840
 - Could be.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.200
 We should move on, James.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.960
 Before we do, have you got any facts you want to chuck in?

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.080
 - You were talking about the Walt Disney and Warner Brothers

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.560
 propaganda.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.480
 Donald Duck was in De Fuhrer's face,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.040
 where he breaks down after experiencing a nightmare.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.960
 He has to make do with eating ridiculous Nazi food rations,

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.120
 such as a smell of bacon and eggs,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.960
 caught made with one bean and a slice of stale bread.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 - Wow.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.000
 - And in Commando Duck, Donald Duck by himself

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.680
 destroys an entire Japanese air base.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.480
 That sounds amazing.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.320
 Anything else?

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.080
 - Yeah, Liam was talking about the dog

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.960
 who was doing the Hitler salute.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.600
 I found it on the Daily Mail website

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.600
 under the headline Howl Hitler.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:32.120
 And they arrested this guy whose dog was doing the Hitler salute.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.400
 And Spokesman, Eva Marie Connig said we are retraining him

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.720
 to stop him raising his leg too high.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.720
 He doesn't have anything that would make him interesting

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.520
 to write Wing extremists.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.520
 However, we think he will quickly find a new owner

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.200
 because he is so famous.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.520
 (laughing)

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.100
 (upbeat music)

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.680
 - Okay, time for fact number two.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.760
 This one's my fact.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.920
 So this fact is that the Philippines Basketball Association,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.640
 which is the second oldest in the world after the NBA,

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.320
 have 10 teams in total.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.600
 And their names include The Rain and Shine Elasto Painters,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.520
 The San Miguel Beer Men,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.440
 and Talk and Text, Troopang Textors.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.880
 - So a lot of teams with no integrity at all,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.600
 just selling out concept names.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.440
 - What, it's done there?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.280
 It's not selling out.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.520
 It's just that's the way that they are.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.520
 Like if you watch boxing matches these days,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.440
 most boxers have adverts painted on their back.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.400
 - There's a guy in America who's selling his last name now.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.400
 So companies can bid, and the highest bidder will be the company name

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.800
 that will become his official last name.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.720
 He did it last year for one company,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.720
 and now he's called, I don't know, James McDonald's or something.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.160
 And now he's doing it again,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.640
 because it was only for one year,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:47.760
 and I think he gets some $50,000 out of it.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.240
 - Wow, dude, I think the only benefit for these companies

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.400
 is in the newspaper coverage that a man is changing his name,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.080
 because no one sees Kevin Budweiser

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.000
 and thinks I must go and have a beer.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.960
 - We had a football team in Belgium,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.200
 which was sponsored by Mick Quickis,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.800
 is the Belgian McDonald's, like Burger King.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.280
 And they had one player called McDonald's,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.520
 and so I was running on the field with this quick logo on his back,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.880
 and then McDonald, the moment.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.920
 - When I was looking into the Filipino basketball stuff,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.960
 because it's a huge sport there, they absolutely love it.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.000
 But I suddenly remembered that Dennis Rodman

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.840
 had been out there a few years back.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.640
 Dennis Rodman was in the Chicago Bulls.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.920
 He famously was married to Carmen Electra,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.920
 and he's been most notable in the news recently

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.400
 because of his relationship with Kim Jong Un.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.360
 But when he went out to the Philippines to play

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.520
 in sort of one of those Americans versus the Philippines,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.440
 basketball matches, he met up with his estranged dad,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.400
 who he hadn't seen for 40 years,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.520
 who's been living in the Philippines for all these years.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.400
 But he's had 29 children to 16 different wives.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.400
 And his name, this is his birth name, Philander,

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.000
 spelled exactly the same, just exactly the same.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.040
 It's Philander Rodman, he lives out there,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.240
 and he runs his own burger shop,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.560
 which is called Rodman's Rainbow Obama Burger Restaurant,

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.240
 in which you can get different colored buns.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.240
 And apparently they're really good burgers.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.000
 - Quite a mouth.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.080
 - They're all really good names all over the Philippines.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.680
 I think the president and his sisters have nicknames,

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.160
 including Pinkie, Nunu, and Bulzi.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.960
 - Well, there's the classic Cardinal Sin,

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.760
 who was the main Cardinal for years.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.360
 I think he's passed away,

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.560
 - Yes, he died a few years ago.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.920
 - Yeah, Jaime Sin.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.080
 - They're amazing sports names all over the world, though.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:31.920
 They're so fun.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.520
 Remember, I think in 2005,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.520
 there was a sudden rush on sales

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.560
 of the Peruvian football team,

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.400
 Deportivo Wankers, in Britain.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400
 And there's a quote from the club spokesman,

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.800
 who just came over and he was like,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.920
 "It is very strange.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.400
 "Everyone in Britain seems to think we have a funny name."

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.240
 The Wanker are just like Peruvian peoples.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.080
 It's not a funny word.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.240
 They decided to, when they were in danger of being relegated,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.520
 they decided to change their football ground

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.560
 to the highest town in the world,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.360
 which I think is called Serro de Pasco,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.760
 and I probably haven't pronounced that right.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
 But it is 4,400 meters above sea level

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.400
 and normal people can't really breathe there or do anything.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.040
 And so obviously these guys are used to it.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.800
 So, and they were accused of cheating,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.480
 'cause whenever a football team came to play them,

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.040
 they all just kind of started collapsing.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.240
 And I'm kind of like, "That's very cool."

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.080
 Well, it melts down.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.160
 Yeah, they still got relegated, so it did not work.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.120
 - Well, it's amazing.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:22.560
 - My favorite basketball fact is somewhat the same.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.240
 It's the Spanish basketball team

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.680
 had to return their gold medals

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.320
 of the Paralympics in 2010,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.360
 because their IQs turned out to be too high.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.040
 They had a basketball competition

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.280
 for the intellectually disabled world.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.600
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.000
 - And so the Spanish completely cheated

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.200
 for having too high and IQ.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.320
 - Too high and IQ.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.160
 - That's amazing.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.720
 - Which is not normally an accusation level

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.840
 that many sports people.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:51.440
 - Well, that's the boy who was picked second-last,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.360
 speaking consistently for 13 years of school.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.920
 - Do you know the guy who invented basketball?

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.120
 John Naysmith, his middle name is A,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.760
 and they don't know what his middle name means.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.600
 And the family have said,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.960
 we think he just put it there,

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.200
 like President...

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.320
 - Ulysses S.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.160
 - S?

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.000
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.840
 - Possibly.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.680
 - It's just an S, isn't it?

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.200
 - It's just an S, yeah.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.280
 But one of the discoveries that they've made about this guy

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.520
 is the influences that they reckon

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.160
 that led to the creation of basketball,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.720
 including a game called...

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.560
 Has anyone heard of this duck on a rock?

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.400
 Does anyone have duck on it?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.640
 - I've seen that referenced as being one of the inspirations,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.480
 but what is it?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.440
 - So the idea was that you would have a bunch of kids playing it.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.560
 You would have a rock, a big stone, on a tree stump,

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.840
 and that would be the duck.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.640
 And you had to knock the duck off the rock.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.720
 One person had to stand and protect the duck.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.640
 Make sure it's not knocked off the stump.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.520
 The way you knock the big stone off the stump

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.320
 is by throwing rocks at it.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.120
 Big rocks.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.480
 - So effectively as a kids game, where you were having stones

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.560
 chucked at you in order to protect another stone.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.040
 So this is what James Naismith played as a kid

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:57.240
 that led to him partially inventing the basketball.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.640
 - I think that sounds fun.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.920
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.760
 Stones?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.040
 - I'd have a size limit on the stones you could throw.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.120
 - They used to, so he used a peach basket at first,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.760
 and they kept using, that was in 1891.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.680
 They kept using peach baskets until 1906, I think.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.040
 But they realized really early on

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.440
 to drill a hole in the peach basket,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.960
 and then you'd poke a stick up through the hole

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.160
 so you could poke the ball out.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.840
 - When you figure it out that you can make a hole,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.880
 and then you'd be like, "Yeah, let's just make a small one."

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.200
 Just for a stick, that's big enough.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.280
 - I think he might have been though.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.280
 Apparently he had a really tense relationship

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.160
 with a school janitor because of all his peach basket.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.560
 And he kept on having his peach baskets

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.480
 with holes in them.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.560
 So I think maybe it was like to appease the janitor,

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.360
 he was like, "Okay, I'll just do a small one."

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.840
 - So a hole that's big enough for a stick,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.680
 but not big enough for a peach.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.520
 - Yeah.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.600
 - Exactly.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.680
 - Yeah, that makes sense.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.240
 - In Japan, they like to turn games into unofficial sports.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.400
 I only, I read it today that they have official rules

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.920
 for pillow fighting now.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.760
 - Really?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.320
 - So they have, and there's now an official pillow fight

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.080
 association of Japan.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.800
 There's a referee, so there must be rules.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.920
 And I think it was a Japanese guy who once tried

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.080
 to get hide and seek as an official Olympic game.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.640
 (laughing)

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.680
 - That's great.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.280
 - Other ones we had on the show were a toe wrestling.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.360
 - Yeah, and then of course there's the very famous,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.920
 I think it's even British, the very famous sports

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.760
 called Ferret in your pants.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.400
 (laughing)

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400
 - What is that?

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.560
 - Well, it's very simple.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.880
 You have to close your trousers at your ankles,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.200
 and then you have to put a ferret in your pants,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.720
 and then you have to close the trousers around your waist.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.120
 And, well, then you just wait.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.960
 - Then you have to wait.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960
 - And just wait for the rest of your life.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.960
 - And you have to set a world record.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.700
 And Ferret's normally bite and they don't let go.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.940
 So the best way to do this is to wait until it bites,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.660
 and of course they like the soft bits more.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.060
 They say don't pull them loose because they will bite again.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.220
 Just, leave it.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.140
 - Yeah, just cope with the pain.

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.620
 - It wasn't very easy to say that, isn't it?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.900
 - Yeah, just leave it.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.740
 It's fine.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.580
 What are you complaining about?

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.820
 It'll get worse if you pick it.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.820
 - Yeah.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.460
 - And the world champion was very proud

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:06.300
 that after his world record, he had three more kids.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.140
 - Oh, wow.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:07.980
 - Yeah.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.620
 - That's pretty impressive.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.380
 All right, let's wrap up on this one.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.460
 James, have you got anything to add?

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.020
 - The guy who sold his name that Leven was talking about

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.420
 is JasonSurfRap.com,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.860
 formerly known as JasonHeadsets.com.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.500
 I'm not sure what his name was before that.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.820
 I was looking for the rules of pillow fighting.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.540
 I found the pillow fight League of Toronto.

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.500
 They have a few rules.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.220
 Their rule one is women fighters only.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.580
 No exceptions.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.380
 And their last rule is loading a pillow

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.380
 with a foreign object, such as a brick,

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.700
 is strictly forbidden.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.380
 (laughing)

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.020
 And then just finally, I found the newspaper article

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.580
 from 1992 about ferrets.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.780
 This was in the town of Newtown in Mid Wales.

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.580
 This is a group of vigilantes

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.300
 and they'd had a lot of crime in the area.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.140
 And they said, our plan for keeping

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.860
 law and order is simple.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.460
 Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.460
 will frog march off to the hills

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.020
 where there's no one to hear the screams.

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.460
 We'll hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.700
 (laughing)

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:18.740
 Okay, let's move on to fact number three and Anna.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.580
 That's your fact.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.260
 Yeah, my fact is that if you get a zebrafish drunk

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.220
 and put him in a tank with other zebrafish,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.940
 the sober ones will follow him around.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.660
 But in a conger line.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.140
 Yeah, it's doing better for dogs.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.540
 Yeah.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.580
 So yeah, they brought, so the way they,

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.980
 they've made zebrafish drunk before,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.340
 they're quite useful fish to study

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.380
 'cause they're translucent.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:38.620
 So you can see what's going on in their bodies

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.700
 without being to slit them open.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.260
 But the way they do it is they put a drop alcohol

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.180
 into their tanks and then they take the zebrafish

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.420
 out of the alcoholic tank,

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.580
 drop it in with other zebrafish and another one.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:50.820
 And yeah, turns out they all follow him around.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.100
 And why are they following?

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.180
 They're not entirely sure.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.420
 So if you get a zebrafish, it's just like humans really.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.420
 They get more lively and they move faster

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.940
 and they seem not as afraid of threats and stuff.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:02.580
 And so everyone just follows him about.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.580
 So he seems like a cool guy.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.620
 And follow that fish.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.540
 Yeah, you can follow that fish with no fear.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.980
 We've been following you for hours now.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.660
 We're still here in the town.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:11.180
 We're like, okay, that's cool.

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.180
 I read a story about a drunken moose.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:17.260
 They found it in a, entangled in an apple tree.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.700
 Yeah, I saw the pictures.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.540
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:20.460
 It's amazing, so so.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.900
 Yeah, it's in Sweden, right?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.060
 Yeah, it's an amazing father.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.900
 You have to get drunk.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.740
 It got drunk off eating apples.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.820
 So the apples were fermented.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.540
 But it happens a lot that animals get drunk

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.860
 from eating fermented fruit.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.100
 There was one's a documentary where they were showing

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.380
 a drunk elephant.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.780
 And then afterwards turned out that the documentary

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.580
 makers just made him drunk.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.580
 Just gave him.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.580
 Wow.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.700
 There's a myth that elephant's drink that they get drunk

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:51.420
 from the Amarula fruit, which comes from the Marula tree.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.340
 And I've found that it's probably not true.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.860
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, either way.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.260
 But they would have to eat so much of the fruit.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.340
 And also, they eat it.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.500
 I mean, every animal near a Marula tree loves the fruit.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.100
 So they eat it as soon as it drops.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.700
 Some elephants even push over the trees

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.180
 to get to the higher fruits.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.540
 So it would be far too quick for it

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:13.060
 to ferment into enough alcohol.

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.020
 Is it a myth about koalas and eucalyptus?

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.020
 Do they get high?

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.460
 Dolphins get high by chewing puffin fish.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.980
 Really?

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.580
 Yeah.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.900
 A puffin fish has a poison that comes out.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.860
 So when it's bitten, it blows up and it dejects a poison.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:33.260
 And dolphins are big enough, so they just get high.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:37.220
 And when they find a puffin fish, they hand it to each other,

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.420
 like students with a joint.

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:40.980
 Yeah, it's just--

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.020
 Yeah, they hand it to each other.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.740
 And then they hang upside down in the water.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.060
 And they're just tripping dolphins.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.300
 Have you-- is that footage of that online?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.820
 Yes.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.900
 Oh, we must watch that.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.060
 It was filmed by the BBC.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.220
 And it was seen for the first time

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.060
 because they used cameras that looked like sea animals.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.180
 So they built a camera that looked like a sea turtle

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.360
 and the dolphins were not disturbed.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.980
 And this was not seen before because they

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.660
 don't do it when they're humans around.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.160
 Yeah, probably.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.300
 They're too paranoid, I guess.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.740
 On drunk animals.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.260
 Yeah.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.700
 And drunk elephants, specifically.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.700
 Elephants do get drunk quite often in India.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.300
 Apparently, an elephant expert in Assam claims.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.260
 Because of Indian rice wine.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.540
 And I don't know why they keep relieving it out.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.340
 But elephants love Indian rice wine.

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:26.300
 And so they've stampeded villages,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.100
 and they've got their rice wine and stuff.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.140
 And there was an occasion a few years ago,

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.340
 I think maybe in 2004, where they got really drunk on rice beer

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.100
 and they ended up knocking over an electricity pole.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.180
 And four of them got electrocuted.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.380
 So it's-- drinking is dangerous.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.820
 Not just for humans.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.540
 But it's not dangerous for another animal called

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.100
 the Pentails Tree Shrew, which lives in Malaysia.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.180
 And it's frequently drunk as a much drunker than human

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.180
 skat, it's several times over the legal limit to drive,

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.220
 for example, even if it wasn't Tree Shrew.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.180
 But the equivalent of about nine small glasses of wine

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:09.700
 is what scientists think based on Tree Shrew biology

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.980
 and also the effect of the nectar.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.300
 But they don't get drunk in the same way that humans do.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.300
 They don't show the same effect behaviorally.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.620
 So some scientists think that we might be able to harness

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.420
 the power of the Tree Shrew to drink it down.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:26.460
 So why would we want to harness something that allows us

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.500
 to drink and not get drunk?

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.100
 Because beyond me, I don't think that humanity's

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.180
 crying out for me.

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.180
 Good call.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.060
 But yeah, that's really cool.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.740
 I think they pollinate the plant by doing this.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.780
 And so they'll go keep going back to the bar

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.300
 and getting another sip.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.860
 And slow loruses do it as well.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.780
 That's cool.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.260
 I love slow loruses.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.500
 Yeah, these slow loruses, I think,

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.740
 is the only mammal that is both venomous and poisonous.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.220
 And it's the only primate that's venomous at all.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.740
 They produce poison in their elbows.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.660
 And then they lick it.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.460
 And they have it in their teeth.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.700
 And then they'll bite you with it.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.540
 And they'll inject the poison into you.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.060
 Wow.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.100
 So it's not quite venomous.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.500
 Because usually you're producing the venom

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.140
 in the same place where you're giving it to your victim.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.660
 Yeah.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.660
 Yeah, that's so cute.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.700
 Got such a cute reputation.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.220
 Yeah.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.020
 Don't know that bite you.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.820
 We had on our show, we had a venomous centipede

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.140
 that eats bats.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.580
 Cool.

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.700
 Yeah, it's 30 centimeters long.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.620
 And it hangs from the top of a cave.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:27.260
 And when a bat flies by, it just catches them

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.460
 while they're flying.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.140
 And then eats it complete in two hours, I think.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.580
 And we had an on the show.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.300
 And I threw in a piece of chicken.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.220
 And it just ran for it and just grabbed it.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.380
 I hate centipedes so much.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.900
 I think my leaves favor that all.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.900
 Yeah, I don't like them at all.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.060
 What about millipedes?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.180
 I don't like them.

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.820
 I've been reading about legs.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:50.340
 And centipedes move very fast, because they're hunters.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.380
 And millipedes move nice and slowly and gently,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.460
 because they're scavengers.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.180
 They're not interested in chasing down prey.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.540
 So I think it's that centipede movement that I don't like.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:59.340
 Mm-hmm.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:00.660
 The one that Leven was talking about

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.740
 is called Skolopendra Gigantia.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.700
 And it's been found in London, the batting one.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.300
 Great.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.580
 I bet it's been found in Southwest London, hasn't it?

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.260
 Unfortunately, no.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.740
 It was found by Stuart Hain, who a guy who we've met

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.380
 from a natural history museum.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.780
 It was reparded to him.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.580
 And it was climbing up someone's living room wall.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.220
 Oh, wow.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.700
 A bite of this centipede has described

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.700
 as 30 bee stings in one place for a human.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.140
 So it's not lethal for a human, but it's extremely painfully.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.940
 James, if you tell me where the living room wall was,

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:38.180
 I will never go to that postcode in London.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.940
 We couldn't vent the sport centipede and it depends.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:41.940
 And so--

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.780
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:44.940
 All right, shall we move on?

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.460
 So James, you've got any things you want to add?

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:52.260
 The misconception about koalas getting high on eucalyptus

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.020
 savethekoala.com, and they're very happy about that at all.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.660
 They say the myth possibly arose as a way

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.060
 of explaining why koalas sleep for up to 22 hours a day.

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.860
 They need more sleep than most animals

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.660
 because eucalyptus leaves contain toxins, which kind of sounds

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:09.660
 like they are getting a bit high, but they're very adamant.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.300
 They're not.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:10.820
 OK.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.340
 So sweet that they're trying to defend them

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:16.020
 for accusations of drug addiction, like our little koalas

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.780
 are not just taking drugs and getting high, OK?

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.620
 They're good boys.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.540
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:28.420
 OK, let's move on to our final fact of the show.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.220
 And Andy, it's you.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:30.740
 OK.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.580
 The youngest woolly mammoths are older than the oldest Egyptian

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.820
 ferros.

00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:39.380
 Mammoths were walking the earth while there were ferros in Egypt.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:41.620
 And after about 1,000 years of ferros as well.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:46.420
 But yes, the last mammoths died out in about 1,500 BC.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.220
 So they were around a lot longer than we think.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:50.900
 I think that was actually when the pyramid's in a bit,

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.820
 but aren't they?

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.220
 Yeah, but it sounds like a great B-movie ferros in mammoths.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:57.660
 Yes, we're going due to theaters near you.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.660
 Yeah.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.460
 But presumably, there weren't any woolly mammoths in Egypt.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:01.980
 No.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.300
 There's no ferros riding a woolly mammoth.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.180
 No, the last ones were in the Arctic.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.700
 In the Arctic.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.420
 They were on a place called Wrangle Island,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.260
 which is amazing today.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.460
 It's now part of Russia.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.620
 A few people believe they're still around, actually.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.220
 Yes.

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.060
 Yeah, they were allegedly seen in Northern Russia.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.340
 I think three years ago, it was a YouTube clip.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.580
 But then it turned out to be false, of course.

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.660
 But you have this niche movement of crypto-biologists

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.140
 who think that there's many large animals

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.660
 that we haven't found yet, such as Bigfoot, of course.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:32.860
 Yeah.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.420
 But they also believe in the mammoth.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.020
 Well, I mean, it's really interesting,

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.860
 because when you say, yeah, there might be woolly mammoths out there.

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:40.940
 Most of us just go, that's impossible.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.580
 But they have found countless numbers of extinct animals

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.380
 that haven't been extinct.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.940
 And we had a, in a future podcast coming out,

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:51.580
 we spoke to an explorer called John Blaschard-Snell,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.780
 who went out to look for a mythical mammoth elephant

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.820
 and managed to find it.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.580
 And it was thought to have been extinct and turned out it wasn't.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.380
 And I can't remember.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.500
 Is there anyone remember where he looked for that?

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.500
 I thought it was--

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:04.740
 Yeah, and a pull.

00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:06.980
 That was a different kind of Asian elephant.

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:08.140
 Yes, to the one everyone thought.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.580
 Yeah, you have this cartoon by XKCD, the internet,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.180
 you have to list.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.180
 And he has this timeline.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.940
 And he says that now that everyone is carrying a photo camera

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.180
 or a video camera everywhere, the odds of finding Bigfoot

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.700
 are getting pretty slim.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.740
 Because we had all these messy photos from a big distance.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.540
 But everybody has a camera everywhere now.

00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.900
 So if it exists, we should see it coming 10 years,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.500
 or it just is important.

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.300
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.220
 Oh, speaking of fakes, in 2003, a museum in Leon C,

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:44.660
 abandoned its plans to display 150,000-year-old,

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.260
 four-foot-long, woolly mammoth's tusk.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:48.940
 After a second opinion from a geologist,

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.340
 identified it as a length of Victorian drainage pipe.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:53.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.340
 So it did not fit that.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:57.060
 They were using tusks for pipes.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.780
 That's fantastic.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.540
 Amazing.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.860
 I think at this point, the DNA that they've

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.580
 found in frozen mammoths is good enough to clone them.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.060
 They found woolly mammoth blood and muscle tissue

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.780
 inside the bodies, which is a big step towards it.

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:14.180
 But just the so many difficulties of cloning

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.740
 beyond the thoracic park problem, finding a host,

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.340
 finding an organism similar enough.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.900
 And they did clone the eyebecks, the perinean eyebecks.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.220
 But that was an animal which had died out in the '90s.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.580
 And they managed to clone one.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.340
 It survived to seven minutes.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.820
 The one that was born.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.420
 Yeah, and then it had lung problems and died

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.380
 as a result of them.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:36.980
 But they managed it.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.220
 And what animal carried it?

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.300
 I don't know.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.180
 Or maybe I suppose a similar eyebecks.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.700
 We had a guy on Museum of Curiosity, the radio show

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.380
 that we do.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.620
 He's a primatologist called Volkissummer.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.700
 And he was saying one of the dangerous things

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.100
 that you're not allowed to say out loud,

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.940
 is that actually humans and great apes

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.060
 could actually still copulate and have a child.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.380
 There is a story that in Belgian Congo,

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.580
 there was a mix of a bonnable and a human.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.620
 Really, yes.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:09.180
 But it's completely unject.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:13.380
 One of the most famous biologists in Belgium

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.220
 is very fond of this myth and really wants to find it.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:20.620
 Because I think technically, that would mean

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.940
 that we are the same species.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.820
 No, that's only if the children can have children themselves.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.900
 I am three and a half percent near the tall, by the way.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.260
 You actually, you know that for certain?

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.100
 Yeah.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.380
 I had my DNA tested.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.980
 I am three and a half percent near the tall.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.500
 Wow.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.020
 Is that high above average?

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.580
 I think the average is two and a half, yeah.

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.180
 So I'm a bit more stupid than average.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.180
 Cool.

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.180
 No, it's stronger, sorry.

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.420
 I mean, it's better at opening jars and--

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.860
 The place where you test it, when they send the results,

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.860
 they also have a suggestion of buying the t-shirts,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.020
 three and a half percent near the tall.

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.860
 So for every percentage, they have a t-shirt.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:57.500
 So they have maybe one or two--

00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:58.500
 10 percent near the tall.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.460
 How high does it go?

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.820
 I don't think it goes up to 10.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.180
 I think maybe five or something.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.100
 It is the highest and the lowest is maybe one and a half or something.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.340
 The five is quite a lot.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.180
 Yeah, five is a lot.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:09.100
 Yeah, but I'm not sure.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.620
 I'm not sure.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.540
 Hey, did you know that with woolly mammoth tusks,

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.980
 that if you cut them open, like if you slice them between,

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.020
 you can tell how old the woolly mammoth was by the rings?

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.020
 Like a tree?

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020
 Yeah.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.820
 You can count the age of a woolly mammoth by its rings.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.460
 The same thing is true for the earwax of whales.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:26.820
 What?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.340
 Wow.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.860
 Yes.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.700
 So a whale is a mammal.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.260
 And of course, because of the high pressure,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.940
 the water would get inside the ears.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:39.340
 And evolutionary, they developed a plug of earwax inside the ears

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:40.780
 to keep the water out.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.900
 And it grows every year.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.820
 So when they find a dead whale, they just

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.380
 cut open the earwax plug.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.700
 And they can count the ear rings in there.

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.020
 Wow.

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.140
 That lovely job.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.460
 Brilliant, like a scam.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.460
 Yeah.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.540
 And they can even find chemicals in the rings,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.980
 so they know in what year it was exposed to certain chemicals

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:01.980
 on that.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.820
 Should we-- James, you want to add anything?

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:09.140
 The iBax was surrogated in a domestic goat.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.380
 And that works OK.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.940
 One quick more year-ing fact.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.820
 Yes, you might have heard this.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.660
 The oldest tree in the world, I think

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.020
 there's this wooden California where

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.260
 they have really old trees up to 4,000, 5,000 years old.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:25.980
 And one guy was testing them.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.420
 And he had a special drill.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.540
 You had to drill into the tree and then take it out

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.860
 and you could count the year-ings.

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.700
 And it was a very expensive drill, was a new one.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.460
 So he put it in a tree and then he couldn't get it out again.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.220
 And then one of the guys there said, oh, let's just cut down

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:38.620
 the trees.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:40.180
 There's lots of them here and then cut them down.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.140
 And then he took this sample and he started counting

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.620
 and found out that this was the oldest tree ever seen

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.140
 in the world that he had just cut down.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:52.980
 And the other oldest living tree is in another state.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.340
 So they were very angry because now the other state

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.300
 had the oldest tree in the world.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.820
 And he had to quit his job.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:01.860
 And he moved to studying lakes.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.860
 And I'm always wondering--

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.380
 You can't cut down a lake at least.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:06.740
 Well, I'm always wondering if he ever studied the arral lake,

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.020
 which is slowly drying up.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.140
 Oh, of course, yeah.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.220
 Maybe his fault too.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.220
 Yeah.

00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.460
 Still not there.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.300
 I've got an email address, though.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:33.140
 OK, what's your email address?

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.740
