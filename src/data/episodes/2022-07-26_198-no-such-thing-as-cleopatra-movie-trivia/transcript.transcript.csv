00:00:19,00:00:24,"this week coming to you live from up the creek in Greenwich London!"""
00:00:24,00:00:35,"""My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anne Chazinski, Andrew Hunter"
00:00:35,00:00:38,Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with
00:00:38,00:00:43,"our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go!"
00:00:43,00:00:45,"Starting with you, Andy."""
00:00:45,00:00:50,"""My fact is that archaeologists have just dug up in the middle of the desert an enormous"
00:00:50,00:00:57,"thinks statue. It is believed to be anywhere up to 95 years old."""
00:00:57,00:01:05,"""I think you're going to have to explain with me."""
00:01:05,00:01:11,So there are now archaeologists looking at old film sets from the early days of Hollywood
00:01:11,00:01:15,and they're doing proper excavations on movie sets that were abandoned to the desert.
00:01:15,00:01:20,This is a real thing. And there was a very famous film in the 20s called The Ten Commandments.
00:01:20,00:01:24,"It was this massive biblical epic and at the end of it, they didn't take the sets down."
00:01:24,00:01:27,There's a theory it would have been too expensive or...
00:01:27,00:01:31,"""There's another theory that he didn't want anyone else to use the set because the director"
00:01:31,00:01:36,was Cecil B. DeMille and he was a bit of a megalomaniac wasn't he? And he thought he didn't
00:01:36,00:01:39,want anyone else to use this so I'm going to bury it in the middle of the desert and
00:01:39,00:01:40,"now he found it."""
00:01:40,00:01:43,"""And they buried it. And yeah, there's this filmmaker who's been searching for it for years."
00:01:43,00:01:49,He's called Peter Brosnan and there's now a film about the finding of the original film.
00:01:49,00:01:55,It's called Cecil B. DeMille's Lost City or something very similar to that. And it was this
00:01:55,00:02:02,"enormous set. So it was 12 stories high, 800 feet wide. There were 21 synxes. The Pharaohs"
00:02:02,00:02:07,statues weighed four tons each and they built an extra synch so that actors playing slaves
00:02:07,00:02:12,"could drag it around. The effort they went to with this film is enormous."""
00:02:12,00:02:17,"""That's awesome. I read a thing that the idea that we have for that slaves built the pyramids"
00:02:17,00:02:23,and so on is down largely to this movie because that's not the case. It wasn't as people working
00:02:23,00:02:28,but they just as a representation use slaves in the movie. That's where we get that common
00:02:28,00:02:29,"myth."""
00:02:29,00:02:33,"""They were kind of freelancers as far as I understand it."""
00:02:33,00:02:37,"""They were farmers outside the farming season weren't they? They did the pyramids. Yeah,"
00:02:37,00:02:43,"I think so. But this movie, when DeMille put it in the middle of the desert, he said,"
00:02:43,00:02:48,"""If 1,000 years from now archaeologists happen to dig beneath the sands, I hope they will"
00:02:48,00:02:53,not rush into print with the amazing news that Egyptian civilization extended all the
00:02:53,00:02:59,"way to the Pacific coast of North America."" So he actually saw the idea that people would"
00:02:59,00:03:01,be digging this up in the future and might think that it was real.
00:03:01,00:03:06,"""We've totally fucked up his plan. That's so sad. We knew as well but that's what he wanted."""
00:03:06,00:03:10,"""No, he didn't want that. That's what he said. He specifically didn't want."""
00:03:10,00:03:15,"""I think he was saying that he was sitting with a bit of a wing cluzzy. He was like, 'Oh,"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"I really hope they don't do that.' Yeah, that's how I interpreted it. But I'm making that up."
00:03:20,00:03:23,"I actually thought that's what he had said."""
00:03:23,00:03:24,"""Did he?"""
00:03:24,00:03:30,"""Some people who did do that is the website 9Gug. Everyone knows the website 9Gug. Yeah, we all"
00:03:30,00:03:31,"know that."""
00:03:31,00:03:35,"""It sounds rude. I know people love, but it's not a rude site, is it?"""
00:03:35,00:03:40,"""No, it's just like memes and stuff like that. And what they did was they buried a huge"
00:03:40,00:03:45,"pillar card with internet memes deliberately to fuck with the archaeologists of the future."""
00:03:45,00:03:52,So everyone had to vote for their favourite memes and the ones that went in were such memes
00:03:52,00:03:59,"as Dick Butt. Doge, who you probably all know, shit just got real. And hardest name in Africa."
00:03:59,00:04:04,I don't know what that one was. But they buried this in there and they're hoping that in thousands
00:04:04,00:04:07,of years people will see it and think that it was some kind of religion or something.
00:04:07,00:04:13,"""Oh, hi. Which I guess it is in a way, right?"" ""Yeah, yeah. Iron Age. Bronze Age. Banta Rage."""
00:04:13,00:04:21,"I was reading in the movie Cleopatra itself because it was a huge, a huge operation to get"
00:04:21,00:04:25,"this movie made. It was, it was so ambitious, they made all these incredible sets."
00:04:25,00:04:28,"""Wait, are you talking about the Ten Commandments or Cleopatra?"""
00:04:28,00:04:31,"""Sorry, sorry, it's the Ten Commandments we're meant to be talking about. I've researched"
00:04:31,00:04:41,"Cleopatra and let's move on."" Cleopatra, it was, they had a big set too. It was, you know,"
00:04:41,00:04:48,"very expensive film. There's your segue. ""Yeah, thanks guys. No, no, no, no. I'll just comment"
00:04:48,00:04:52,"on what you guys have to say for the rest of the evening. Okay, sorry."""
00:04:52,00:04:57,"""Is anyone got any Cleopatra material that we can help him out with?"""
00:04:57,00:05:01,"""I do have a, a fact related to Cleopatra, which is, yeah, it's about the film The Ten Commandments."""
00:05:01,00:05:12,"Okay, so it was, basically, in 1922, Cecil B. Demel, he was already pretty famous but he ran"
00:05:12,00:05:17,"a competition for what his next film would be about. So you, everyone submitted subjects and the"
00:05:17,00:05:22,best subject won a thousand dollars and he would make the film. And it went to a man who was called
00:05:22,00:05:29,"F. C. Nelson. He was a lubricating oil manufacturer and he just wrote on a bit of paper, ""Make the Ten Commandments."""
00:05:29,00:05:33,"If only he'd written ""Make Cleopatra."""
00:05:33,00:05:41,"But then beneath it, he had a little PS at the bottom of the page, he then wrote, ""You cannot break"
00:05:41,00:05:46,"the Ten Commandments or they will break you."" But he won, he won the competition."
00:05:46,00:05:50,"But it was, it was a bit disastrous, right? The Ten Commandments, in a sense, because Cecil"
00:05:50,00:05:56,"B. Demel was so determined to get it working and it went so way of a budget, he didn't accept any"
00:05:56,00:06:03,"profits from it. His producers called him and were like, ""Come back now, give up. This is a complete"
00:06:03,00:06:08,"disaster."" And he refused to. And he did things like, he refused to use painted backgrounds at all."
00:06:08,00:06:13,So he refused to use normal scenery so that meant he just had to literally build everything.
00:06:13,00:06:18,"So I think there was a wall that was miles and miles along that he had built, wasn't there?"
00:06:18,00:06:22,"And then at the end, did he dynamite the whole thing? I'm just thinking if Donald Trump digs"
00:06:22,00:06:29,"around and finds that wall. Yeah. I don't think he did dynamite it. No, that's a rumour, by the end of the"
00:06:29,00:06:37,"rumour. Yeah. Cecil Demel, sorry, just quickly. Great director, do you guys have any stuff on Joseph"
00:06:37,00:06:51,"Manquets? What did he do, right then? I'm just quickly on Cecil B. Demel. So for the shooting of it,"
00:06:51,00:06:56,"and this is just the incredible budgets of the day, he built a city which had 3,500 actors,"
00:06:56,00:07:03,technicians and extras. They were divided into 14 units of man and seven of women in a 24 square
00:07:03,00:07:11,mile city and there were very strict rules about alcohol and gambling and stuff. He hired 225
00:07:11,00:07:20,"orthodox Jews to look like their ancestors, the Israelites. And apparently during the filming,"
00:07:20,00:07:24,they kept missing their cues because they were so overwhelmed by the emotion of being in this thing.
00:07:24,00:07:30,"And then he wrote to everyone on set, he said, your skin will be cooked raw. You will miss the"
00:07:30,00:07:35,comforts of home. You will be asked to endure perhaps the most unpleasant location in cinema history.
00:07:35,00:07:41,"I expect of you your supreme efforts. It was so tough to say. He was a nass, wasn't he?"
00:07:41,00:07:49,"I like him. Do you? Okay, I do. This is someone who you could have, I think. I'm not saying that you're"
00:07:49,00:07:56,"a prima donor Andy, but he had a chair boy who always walked three steps behind him carrying a chair."
00:07:57,00:08:03,"He was never allowed to look his master in the eye and whenever DeMille stood still for more than a minute,"
00:08:03,00:08:07,the chair boy had to put the chair behind him and then bang the back of his knees so that he sat
00:08:07,00:08:12,"down on the chair, which was there. Whoa. Can you imagine having one of those? Yes, I can."
00:08:12,00:08:17,"And I'm frankly angry, I had to sit down tonight."
00:08:17,00:08:24,Was this what we DeMille had pop it? It sounds like he was one of those collapsing puppets.
00:08:24,00:08:29,"He made loads of biblical films. He made another biblical epic called ""The King of Kings"" and he"
00:08:29,00:08:34,"made, but he was mostly known for slightly saucy movies. They always involved a naked woman"
00:08:34,00:08:39,"in a bathtub at some point and then he made the tank of armaments, which is a big switcheroo."
00:08:39,00:08:44,"Cleopatra used to spend a lot of time in bathtub stitching. James, I don't have anything on it."
00:08:44,00:08:51,"Actually, I got a different thing, which is just picking up on what James said earlier about him"
00:08:51,00:08:55,"wanting to bury DeMille, wanting to bury the set so no one else would use it."
00:08:55,00:09:00,There's a bit of logic behind that because people back in the day of early Hollywood did use
00:09:00,00:09:05,to do that. So there's a very famous version of Dracula that was made with Bella Logosi.
00:09:05,00:09:11,"And the idea was you would pay for all these movies huge budgets for their sets to be made,"
00:09:11,00:09:16,"but because of workers unions and clocking off at the right time, it meant that you'd film in the"
00:09:16,00:09:21,"day and in the evening the set was just sitting there. So they thought, ""What if we filmed the foreign"
00:09:21,00:09:26,language version of the movie that we're now making in Spanish and Italian in the night time
00:09:26,00:09:30,"when they've abandoned the set?"" And that's what they did. And there's a very famous"
00:09:30,00:09:35,version of Dracula from 1931 where they made in the daytime the English version with Bella Logosi
00:09:35,00:09:41,and in the evening time they made the Spanish version and the Spanish version because they were
00:09:41,00:09:45,able to sit at the end of the day of filming of the American one. They would watch the
00:09:45,00:09:50,"Dailies and so the rushes that they filmed that day and they would go, ""Oh, that angle's no use."
00:09:50,00:09:55,"Why don't we film from this direction?"" And so they would re-angle everything. They learned to make"
00:09:55,00:10:00,"the movie by watching a different movie being made on the same set. Yeah. And as a result, it took"
00:10:00,00:10:06,"something like seven weeks or something. Sorry, a few months for them to make the American version,"
00:10:06,00:10:10,but the Spanish version just got done it really quickly and they made it way before the Americans
00:10:10,00:10:16,finished and released it before the Americans released it. And so people saw the Spanish version
00:10:16,00:10:21,"and the reviews were, ""Well, if the American version is as good as this and it's probably better,"
00:10:21,00:10:25,"it's going to be an amazing movie."" Because it was awesome, but the problem was it was shit,"
00:10:25,00:10:30,the American version. But one reason I think it would be shit is doesn't Dracula die in the daytime.
00:10:30,00:10:39,"Yeah. Yes. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the guy the director was so bad he didn't"
00:10:39,00:10:44,capture Dracula's death on camera. He failed to put the camera in the right position. So it's just
00:10:44,00:10:49,"Bella Legoski going, ""Oh, off screen. You don't even see."" Yeah, but you can't, I mean, presumably"
00:10:49,00:10:55,"Bella Legoski didn't actually die, so you can't just retake that. And have him in front of the camera."
00:10:55,00:10:59,"Yeah, I know, but they didn't. They just didn't. I guess back then they were just like, ""Oh,"
00:10:59,00:11:05,"it's six o'clock. The Spanish are coming in. All right, let's go to go. Bella's done."" But yeah,"
00:11:05,00:11:09,so they did use to double up on the sets. And so that version of Dracula was more famous for the
00:11:09,00:11:14,Spanish version that was copying the American than the American version. So you can understand
00:11:14,00:11:20,why he wanted to bury sets. It was probably a crew of Spaniards around the corner. He was only out there
00:11:20,00:11:27,"avoiding Thomas Edison, wasn't he? Who? Cecil B. Demel. What? Yeah. That's why he was out West."
00:11:27,00:11:32,That's why they went out West is because there were loads of Edison thugs who would beat you up for
00:11:32,00:11:37,"using... Was it film technology? Yeah, and that's basically why Hollywood is where it is today and"
00:11:37,00:11:42,why they made all the movies out there because Edison was on the East Coast. And if they went to the
00:11:42,00:11:45,"other side of America, they couldn't get them with all the patents and all things like that."
00:11:45,00:11:50,Yeah. And so Cecil B. Demel owned 80 guns to protect himself.
00:11:50,00:11:58,80 guns and a wolf. He had a wolf as well. I'm serious. I know it sounds like I just out of that
00:11:58,00:12:02,"spur of the moment. Wow. You're the Blues Brothers. You know, when they film The Blues Brothers,"
00:12:02,00:12:08,"again, went quite over budget. The most impressive set of thing they did was they dropped a car"
00:12:08,00:12:12,from a helicopter. I think there's a scene in it where they fly a helicopter like 1500 feet in the
00:12:12,00:12:17,"air and then they drop a car down on Chicago. They got permission from the government, the state"
00:12:17,00:12:23,government to do that. They dropped a Pinto car down into like presumably an abandoned area of
00:12:23,00:12:30,"Chicago. It's presumably. And the car, when it landed, it was 45 centimetres tall"
00:12:31,00:12:36,"because of the, that was the extent of the force. Yeah. That's pretty good. And they also had a cocaine"
00:12:36,00:12:39,"budget. They always used to say that about the Blues Brothers, didn't they? That film had"
00:12:39,00:12:45,"its own cocaine budget. There's a film with Dennis Hopper, Easy Rider. It was called. And this is"
00:12:45,00:12:52,"a, yeah, awesome film. But he was part of the creative team and he was doing drugs every single day."
00:12:52,00:12:55,"And he was doing all different kinds of drugs. And it got to the point where they were like, we"
00:12:55,00:13:00,just have to give up and accept that he's on ecstasy in the morning cocaine in the afternoon
00:13:00,00:13:04,"and heroin in the evening, whatever he was doing pot in the evening. It got to the point that when"
00:13:04,00:13:09,"he got the scripts for the next day for the film, they wrote on it the drug that he was on in the"
00:13:09,00:13:14,"previous scene so he could match the energy that he was bringing to it. So they're like, we're going"
00:13:14,00:13:19,to film the second half of the scene we did three days ago and you were on cocaine then. So if you
00:13:19,00:13:25,"could do three lines before we start shooting, we'll get the same vibe as what you were. I'd love to see"
00:13:25,00:13:33,the movie where they mix them up. He's doing heroin and suddenly he's doing cocaine. We need to move on
00:13:33,00:13:38,shortly to our second fact. Do you guys have anything before we go? Apocalypse now. Yeah sure.
00:13:38,00:13:43,"They're filming Apocalypse now. One of the things that Francis Ford, a cobbler, demanded was that"
00:13:43,00:13:47,he was allowed to burn down a lot of jungle in Vietnam and because he was a big deal at that point
00:13:47,00:13:52,they allowed him to. So many acres of jungle were just burned down for it. But also he used real
00:13:52,00:13:58,military helicopters but apparently he used to get really annoyed on set because they kept on having
00:13:58,00:14:05,to fly off to fight in actual wars. No. So he used to get really pissed off. Wow. Yeah. I got one
00:14:05,00:14:10,last thing. It was a movie set problem. It's a movie back in the day called Cleopatra where
00:14:10,00:14:18,"what happened was is that Cleopatra's entrance scene was a huge, you know, even listening. Okay,"
00:14:18,00:14:27,"it is time for a fact number two and that is me. It's my fact. Okay, my fact this week is that when"
00:14:27,00:14:35,British author William Hazlitt died his landlady was so keen to re-let his room that she hid his body
00:14:35,00:14:42,under the bed while she showed new tenants around. This is extraordinary. What a viewing. That must have
00:14:42,00:14:50,"happened to me. Will he be here? So Hazlitt, he's not that famous now is he? No, but if we made the show"
00:14:50,00:14:57,"back in the 1800s you guys would be like, ""Whaah!"" Hazlitt was huge. He was a massive British author."
00:14:57,00:15:02,"Not only an author, he was a literary critic, he was a painter, a social commentator, a philosopher,"
00:15:02,00:15:10,he was a big deal. He died in 1830. He was living in Soho and in fact there is a hotel now there
00:15:10,00:15:16,"which is called the Hazlitt House, I believe, and that is the location where he died. And he's still"
00:15:16,00:15:23,"there onto that bed, isn't he? He's still there, yeah. But he was a big deal and people used to go"
00:15:23,00:15:28,"just to the Hazlitt hotel just because that's where he lived. Sheamus Heaney used to go there,"
00:15:28,00:15:32,obsessed with him and they would have meetups there just to be able to be in the sort of presence
00:15:32,00:15:37,of the location of this great person who everyone seems to have forgotten except it turns out
00:15:37,00:15:42,"you an interesting person. I mean people know what him has it is, but I did happen to take a book"
00:15:42,00:15:49,of his essays on my gap here which I know is I just told these guys. One of those guys was going to
00:15:49,00:15:52,mention it so I could get in there. Which drug were you taking when you were reading it?
00:15:52,00:15:56,"The essays themselves were my drugs, James."
00:15:56,00:16:03,What am I on? I'm on chapter three.
00:16:03,00:16:15,"I mean, they didn't come in chapters, but whatever. But he was, he was unappreciated by his death,"
00:16:15,00:16:19,"wasn't he? Like when he died, he died in poverty. It was on Frist Street and he'd been basically"
00:16:19,00:16:24,dist by all of the people he'd been mates with. So he was really good friends with Code Ridge and
00:16:24,00:16:32,"study and words worth, but he kind of also hated everyone. Yeah, he kind of started it. He did start it."
00:16:32,00:16:38,So they embodied these revolutionary ideals that he loved and he thought that they didn't see them
00:16:38,00:16:42,"through properly. He thought they'd all sold out. So he kind of loved Code Ridge, but he wrote all"
00:16:42,00:16:46,"these essays saying, I hate that you haven't lived up to your potential. So eventually they just"
00:16:46,00:16:51,ruined his reputation and he died in poverty. And it all started actually when he
00:16:51,00:16:57,"grope somebody. Did you read this story? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Yeah, boo, exactly."
00:16:57,00:17:09,"Well, don't say it was a different time on it. It was a different time. They were staying in the"
00:17:09,00:17:12,lake district. It was him and Code Ridge and words worth all staying in the lake district and writing
00:17:12,00:17:18,"together. And he went away, Haslet went to the pub one night and a woman was flirting with him"
00:17:18,00:17:22,and sort of teasing him and he thought that she wanted to get off with him. So he sort of leaned in
00:17:22,00:17:28,"or something or, you know, came onto her and then she laughed at him and said, no, don't be such a,"
00:17:28,00:17:31,"you know, CAD. And so he lifted up a petticoats and slapped her on the bottom."
00:17:31,00:17:41,"I'm with the lady on the second row here. I'm not saying it's good behaviour, but he'd been"
00:17:41,00:17:46,"embarrassed and then he got chased by this mob who wanted to duck him, which apparently is a"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"common thing. They wanted to duck him and duck him. That's an autoferec thing, I think."
00:17:49,00:18:05,"But yeah, and he ran back to Kohler Ridge and said, please hide me and they smothered him away"
00:18:05,00:18:12,"over the mountain. That's extreme. He saved him, but then they spread all these rumours that he"
00:18:12,00:18:18,"was a horrible, lascivious, sleazy man. And then he hadn't affair with someone half his age."
00:18:18,00:18:23,"Yeah. And then he sort of had a, so it was his landlady's daughter, not the landlady, I believe,"
00:18:23,00:18:32,"who later got vengeance by hiding him out of the bed. He, yeah, she was half his age and he just"
00:18:32,00:18:36,fell completely in love with that. And then he wrote this whole book saying that he had fallen in
00:18:36,00:18:45,love with her and declaring it in public. And he sent his friend to test her by making advances
00:18:45,00:18:50,"and flirting with her and seeing how she reacted. And she flirted back with his friend,"
00:18:50,00:18:54,although she drew the line at any serious stuff. And then he asked his friend whether he could set
00:18:54,00:19:01,"Sarah this girl up as the friend's mistress and he would pay for it. And the friend said,"
00:19:01,00:19:10,"""No, I would pro-woman who can read and talk."" It was a complete disaster. Anyway, it was a great"
00:19:10,00:19:18,literary figure. Here's my favourite William Hazlick complete disaster story. And that is his first
00:19:18,00:19:24,"lecture at the Russell institution where he turned up and they told him it had to be one hour long,"
00:19:24,00:19:29,"but he prepared enough material for three hours. And so instead of editing it, he just did the three"
00:19:29,00:19:37,hour talk in one hour. And just put his head down and just read it as quickly as he could. Wow.
00:19:37,00:19:41,"That's really funny James, because it reminds me of another story about Hazlick which I've"
00:19:41,00:19:46,"brought along and I've so glad you mentioned it. I read actually, relatively, something recently"
00:19:46,00:19:51,"about Gordon Brown, which was, this is in the week, I think. And it was a story that goes around"
00:19:51,00:19:55,"Westminster, which is that he was asked to give a talk sort of a penchant dinner quite early on in"
00:19:55,00:20:02,his MP DUM. It was about pensions. It was a talk about pensions to a bunch of pensioners and other
00:20:02,00:20:07,"people. And he was asked to speak for 45 minutes, so he got up and he gave, and he really works really"
00:20:07,00:20:11,"hard, you know, he's never working hard on stuff. So he thought really hard, he delivered this 45-minute"
00:20:11,00:20:17,"speech. And at the end, the person who was comparing the event came on and apologised for the fact"
00:20:17,00:20:27,that he got on so long and they'd actually asked him to do a four to five minutes speech.
00:20:27,00:20:30,At what stage do you think I'm going to have to stop him here?
00:20:30,00:20:34,He can imagine on pensions.
00:20:34,00:20:43,"Hazlick in the event, well, he coined a word that we all use today, gusto."
00:20:44,00:20:47,"Yeah, yeah, it's got gusto, that's Hazlick."
00:20:47,00:20:53,"It existed before, didn't it? But he sort of wrote an essay on it, sort of properly defining it."
00:20:53,00:20:53,Yep.
00:20:53,00:20:58,"I thought he'd invented it, I would say."
00:20:58,00:21:07,"No, it didn't exist before, to mean like life. And he said it as something to do with arts, didn't he?"
00:21:07,00:21:09,Yes. He was the first person to use it to describe art.
00:21:09,00:21:10,Yes.
00:21:10,00:21:14,"Well, anyone can use a word to mean a different thing to think we've all agreed it means."
00:21:14,00:21:21,"Well, he also, according to the OED, coined the word's newsmongering, modernising, and aconing."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"Acalling, apparently, means collecting acons."
00:21:24,00:21:28,And he was the first person to use that.
00:21:28,00:21:30,"Yeah, unbelievable."
00:21:30,00:21:33,What a great contribution to the English language and people don't appreciate it.
00:21:33,00:21:36,"I can see why it took a massive break of his essays on your gap, yeah."
00:21:39,00:21:41,You'll see your customs. Anything to declare?
00:21:41,00:21:41,No.
00:21:41,00:21:44,"What's that in your back, Madam?"
00:21:44,00:21:48,"For converses and a bunch of acons, the problem?"
00:21:48,00:21:54,Some stuff on dead bodies or estate agents.
00:21:54,00:21:55,"Dead bodies, please."
00:21:55,00:21:58,"Dead bodies, and if we can, Cleopatra would be."
00:21:58,00:22:02,So here's the thing about the dead.
00:22:02,00:22:07,"No, so a contemporary of Hazlick's was Shelley."
00:22:07,00:22:13,And there's an often repeated story about Shelley's heart being plucked from the funeral pie he was
00:22:13,00:22:20,"being burned on. So he drowned and he was at sea for several days, dead and bobbing around,"
00:22:20,00:22:22,and then he was retrieved and he was burned on the beach.
00:22:22,00:22:27,"There's now a theory that it wasn't his heart which refused to burn, because it's a very nice"
00:22:27,00:22:33,"romantic image that his heart refused to burn. They now think it was his liver, which refused to"
00:22:33,00:22:38,"burn, because it would just soak in seawater for days and days, and it was the biggest organ, so it"
00:22:38,00:22:43,would have been less likely to burn. And it was taken out and a friend of his took it and then
00:22:43,00:22:48,bequeathed it to another friend of his who then gave it to Mary Shelley who put it in the back.
00:22:48,00:22:51,"It's really, it's re-gifting, isn't it, when you don't."
00:22:51,00:22:58,"But actually speaking of livers, I'm back on Hazlick, he didn't drink, but do you know why he didn't"
00:22:58,00:22:59,drink at the end of his life?
00:23:00,00:23:04,"No, we're going to guess then. Broke, he was broke."
00:23:04,00:23:09,"He was broke, but that's not why, so it said that he died of tannic acid poisoning from excessive tea"
00:23:09,00:23:14,"drinking, because he was obsessed with drinking tea, and he used to fill half a tea pot with tea."
00:23:14,00:23:16,"That can't be possible to die of too much tea, huh?"
00:23:16,00:23:19,"I don't think so, but the upper burden would be dead."
00:23:19,00:23:25,"He wasn't obsessed with it, though. Apparently he used to get up at one or two in the afternoon,"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"never before that, and he would get up and pull himself a tea half full of tea, like the tea leaves,"
00:23:30,00:23:35,"and then half of water, and then he would sit there for four to five hours, staring at it."
00:23:35,00:23:47,"That was beautiful, like the last time I..."
00:23:47,00:23:51,"God, when we put this podcast out, that's going to come in stereo with people's ears."
00:23:51,00:23:54,That's going to be the best hard-hitting punchline anyone's ever heard.
00:23:56,00:24:01,"Anyway, no, sorry, four to five hours, motionless, staring into the distance."
00:24:01,00:24:07,"So he loved tea, but he didn't drink, because the last time he drunk was when he went on a huge binge,"
00:24:07,00:24:12,"following the Battle of Waterloo, so he was a massive Napoleon fan, and he loved Napoleon,"
00:24:12,00:24:16,and he was devastated that Napoleon had been defeated. He thought he epitomised the great revolutionary
00:24:16,00:24:21,"cause, and so he went on this huge drinking binge, and he spent weeks and weeks wandering London,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,"completely unwashed in a drunken haze, and after that he thought alcohol wasn't for him."
00:24:25,00:24:31,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James."
00:24:31,00:24:37,"Okay, my fact this week is that UNICEF has a nutrition ambassador called Pupi."
00:24:37,00:24:48,"So, this is just a thing, this is just true. She is called Jose Heli Hunter Ramahavi Lisoa,"
00:24:48,00:24:55,"and she is a singer from Madagascar, and she goes by the stage named Pupi, and lonely planet has"
00:24:55,00:25:02,"declared Pupi a national treasure, and she's been active in educating young mothers about breastfeeding"
00:25:02,00:25:09,"their infants as a nutrition ambassador for UNICEF, and that's basically her entire English language"
00:25:09,00:25:14,"Wikipedia that I've just read out. And there is nothing else on her on the internet really,"
00:25:14,00:25:20,"there's an English anyway, but she joins other UNICEF ambassadors such as Katie Perry, Serena Williams,"
00:25:20,00:25:27,"Liam Neeson, The Wiggles, Dustin the Turkey, and The Vanuatu Women's Beach Volleyball team."
00:25:27,00:25:31,"Oh, cool. Got that embassy must be a riot, mustn't it?"
00:25:31,00:25:38,"And yeah, so she's just, she's a nutrition ambassador, and she's got a funny name."
00:25:38,00:25:40,"But we don't know why she's got, I mean, it's her stage name, right?"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"It's just her stage name, yeah. We don't know why she got that name."
00:25:43,00:25:47,"Okay. I imagine it must mean something different in Malagasy, I guess."
00:25:47,00:25:50,"Yeah, you would hope. I looked up a little bit on stage names."
00:25:50,00:25:54,"Okay. So, Stevie Wonder, he has a stage name."
00:25:54,00:25:59,"Really? Yes, because his real name, what do you think his full first name is?"
00:25:59,00:26:03,"Stephen Wonder. Yeah, his first name is Steve Land."
00:26:06,00:26:13,"No, genuinely. That is a theme park I want to go to. And that's a Dave Land."
00:26:13,00:26:17,"No way. What? He was christened Steve Land. Yeah, what?"
00:26:17,00:26:22,"S-T-E-V-L-A-M-D. Steve Land. Steve Land. Yeah, that's amazing."
00:26:22,00:26:26,"I know. Yeah, that's really cool. What's his surname?"
00:26:26,00:26:32,"I didn't write it down. Okay. But it's not Wonder. No, it's not Wonder. Wonder, Wonder, Wonder was because he was it."
00:26:32,00:26:39,"No, he was he was a boy Wonder, which is why he got the nickname Wonder."
00:26:39,00:26:44,"Oh, okay. Yeah. And Michael Keaton, the actor, his real name is Michael Douglas."
00:26:44,00:26:50,What's Michael Douglas' real name? Steve Land Wonder.
00:26:50,00:26:56,"I don't know, Michael Douglas' real name. Do you know what Wacken Phoenix's real name is?"
00:26:56,00:27:00,"Oh, Bohm. No. But his surname was Bottom. That's right."
00:27:00,00:27:06,Yeah. Yeah. Wacken Bottom. Wacken Bottom. He's William Hitler.
00:27:06,00:27:11,There's a different time. But his brother was Riverbottom.
00:27:11,00:27:16,So he was Riverbottom. He was Riverbottom. So he had a weirdes upbringing.
00:27:16,00:27:19,"They were members of the, was it the children of God cult?"
00:27:19,00:27:22,"The really famous cult. Yeah. Yeah, they were brought up in that."
00:27:22,00:27:24,And then they escaped that and said it wasn't a good idea.
00:27:24,00:27:27,And the whole family decided to change their name to Phoenix.
00:27:27,00:27:29,Which does make sense. They were all called Mr. and Mrs. Bottom.
00:27:29,00:27:31,And they went with Phoenix instead.
00:27:31,00:27:35,Yeah. I found out today what Michael J. Fox's middle name is.
00:27:35,00:27:37,Go on. Andrew.
00:27:37,00:27:41,Yeah. With a silent J.
00:27:41,00:27:43,"Yeah, no. Yeah."
00:27:43,00:27:48,"Andrew, he basically, when he went sign up for the actors,"
00:27:48,00:27:52,you have to officially register yourself as an actor in America.
00:27:52,00:27:54,And there was already a Michael Andrew Fox.
00:27:54,00:27:57,So he just had to pick J as a random initial.
00:27:57,00:27:59,But that's what the J stands for. Andrew.
00:27:59,00:28:03,It sort of stands for it.
00:28:03,00:28:09,I found a list of the 150 worst rapper names in the world.
00:28:09,00:28:10,Cool. Amazing.
00:28:10,00:28:12,On the internet. So just a few of those.
00:28:12,00:28:14,The tea bag boys.
00:28:14,00:28:20,Yuck balls. These are all proper rappers apparently.
00:28:20,00:28:21,Cecil Otter.
00:28:21,00:28:25,And Bus Driver.
00:28:27,00:28:28,Really?
00:28:28,00:28:29,That's so good.
00:28:29,00:28:32,"Actually, on musicians, do you guys know the band in excess?"
00:28:32,00:28:33,Yeah.
00:28:33,00:28:37,Yeah. So the bass guitarist for in excess is Gary Beers.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And his middle name is Gary.
00:28:39,00:28:41,But with a different number of ours.
00:28:41,00:28:44,Get out of here.
00:28:44,00:28:46,Gary. His name is Gary.
00:28:46,00:28:53,Maybe that's exactly the way that's what it is.
00:28:53,00:28:56,It used to be William and he changed it to Gary.
00:28:56,00:28:59,Gary Beers. He changed it.
00:28:59,00:29:01,Yeah. Wow.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Can't get enough carries.
00:29:02,00:29:04,"So yeah, the double ours in the middle name."
00:29:04,00:29:05,Wow. If you're interested.
00:29:05,00:29:07,"John Crawford, the actress."
00:29:07,00:29:09,She was named by the public.
00:29:09,00:29:11,What's that?
00:29:11,00:29:13,Tony McJone faces.
00:29:13,00:29:20,Her original name was Lucille.
00:29:20,00:29:22,This is a French surname.
00:29:22,00:29:26,Lucille S-L-E-S-U-E-U-R.
00:29:26,00:29:30,But people thought studio bosses thought that sounds like Lucille the sewer.
00:29:30,00:29:33,So they held a public competition to change her name.
00:29:33,00:29:35,And John Crawford was the entry which one.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"She didn't like it at first, but she had to be called that."
00:29:38,00:29:39,Wow.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"It grew on her, apparently."
00:29:40,00:29:41,Okay.
00:29:41,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:43,So cool.
00:29:43,00:29:45,"It's not that cool in name, really."
00:29:45,00:29:48,Or is it like just the time that makes it feel like that?
00:29:48,00:29:48,When was it?
00:29:48,00:29:50,When John Crawford doesn't feel like a...
00:29:50,00:29:51,When was it?
00:29:51,00:29:52,20th century.
00:29:52,00:29:54,Anyone?
00:29:54,00:29:56,47.
00:29:56,00:29:58,What a specific answer.
00:29:58,00:30:04,Any advance on 247? Do I have 48?
00:30:04,00:30:08,June 47 was one of the names that we're put up.
00:30:08,00:30:13,I've got a thing on ambassadors.
00:30:13,00:30:14,Okay.
00:30:14,00:30:18,"So the fact at the top, if you remember, Unicef has a nutrition ambassador,"
00:30:18,00:30:19,and that's called poopy.
00:30:20,00:30:24,So a lot of celebrities get asked to be ambassadors in certain things.
00:30:24,00:30:28,"And very recently, Helen Mirren has been an ambassador for L'Oreal,"
00:30:28,00:30:31,so she'll do panels and so on for their moisturizer.
00:30:31,00:30:33,"So, like, it's so annoying about the ambassador."
00:30:33,00:30:35,"It's the brand ambassador, that's why..."
00:30:35,00:30:38,"No, but it's not the same as Unicef, though, is it?"
00:30:38,00:30:41,"Like, you don't set up an immersive building in the Middle East"
00:30:41,00:30:43,"and say, ""I am the L'Oreal ambassador."""
00:30:43,00:30:45,How can I...
00:30:45,00:30:47,"Oh, where the fuck am I, Ferraro Rache?"
00:30:47,00:30:51,[ Laughter ]
00:30:51,00:30:52,Where is the L'Oreal Embassy?
00:30:52,00:30:54,[ Laughter ]
00:30:54,00:30:55,"You're right, yeah."
00:30:55,00:30:56,Um...
00:30:56,00:30:57,"No, she's a L'Oreal ambassador."
00:30:57,00:30:58,It's a real thing.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"Yeah, she's a brand ambassador, and she's not a very good one,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,because she did a talk...
00:31:03,00:31:05,"If you did a panel talk in the South of France,"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"and they asked her about moisturizer and what it does,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"and she said, ""Probably fuck all."""
00:31:10,00:31:12,[ Laughter ]
00:31:12,00:31:13,That was her answer.
00:31:13,00:31:15,[ Laughter ]
00:31:15,00:31:16,No.
00:31:16,00:31:18,"I was looking at, because at Poupi,"
00:31:18,00:31:20,"the ambassador is a nutritionist, right?"
00:31:20,00:31:20,Yeah.
00:31:20,00:31:22,And it's from Madagascar.
00:31:22,00:31:26,"So I was looking at some Madagasy nutrition stuff,"
00:31:26,00:31:29,and so there are some groups in Madagascar
00:31:29,00:31:32,"that will circumcision is a thing in some tribes,"
00:31:32,00:31:34,and some of them eat the foreskin.
00:31:34,00:31:36,Ooh.
00:31:36,00:31:37,"But also, I was reading a..."
00:31:37,00:31:40,"Oh, sorry, I didn't..."
00:31:40,00:31:42,I got that three seconds after everyone else in the room.
00:31:42,00:31:43,[ Laughter ]
00:31:43,00:31:45,Is that weird? I don't think that's weird.
00:31:45,00:31:46,You don't think that's weird.
00:31:46,00:31:47,[ Laughter ]
00:31:47,00:31:50,"In Madagascar, this is a thing."
00:31:50,00:31:53,[ Laughter ]
00:31:53,00:31:56,And there was a journalist went to Madagascar
00:31:56,00:31:58,"and traveled around it a few years ago,"
00:31:58,00:32:00,"and it's specifically in certain regions,"
00:32:00,00:32:03,"so it's in the Antamba Huaca region,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,and where they eat the foreskin.
00:32:05,00:32:07,"And traditionally, you get circumcised,"
00:32:07,00:32:10,and then it's given to the grandfather
00:32:10,00:32:11,"who then can either eat it,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,or offer it to a very honored guest.
00:32:14,00:32:16,I'm sorry.
00:32:16,00:32:18,It's a journalist.
00:32:18,00:32:20,Who the whoop?
00:32:20,00:32:22,[ Laughter ]
00:32:22,00:32:24,"They've got a little bit soft in the bag, but..."
00:32:24,00:32:27,[ Laughter ]
00:32:27,00:32:29,"Anyway, it's pretty awkward if you're a guest"
00:32:29,00:32:33,"in specific Madagascar, areas of Madagascar,"
00:32:33,00:32:35,then just look out for being offered foreskin.
00:32:35,00:32:37,And it is polite to accept it.
00:32:37,00:32:39,[ Laughter ]
00:32:39,00:32:40,Wow.
00:32:40,00:32:42,Hmm.
00:32:42,00:32:44,There was another person who was interviewed
00:32:44,00:32:46,from a different tribe.
00:32:46,00:32:48,"Who said, ""We actually think that's weird."""
00:32:48,00:32:50,This is someone from the...
00:32:50,00:32:52,[ Laughter ]
00:32:52,00:32:54,This is someone from the Sakhalava tribe.
00:32:54,00:32:56,"This is a different anthropologist who went there,"
00:32:56,00:32:58,"and he said, ""We think that's weird."""
00:32:58,00:33:00,It's only the guys in the mountains in the middle who do that.
00:33:00,00:33:02,"No, we put the foreskin into a firework"
00:33:02,00:33:04,and send it into the sky.
00:33:04,00:33:08,[ Laughter ]
00:33:08,00:33:10,"All right, should we move on to our final fact?"
00:33:10,00:33:12,"Yes, please."
00:33:12,00:33:14,[ Laughter ]
00:33:14,00:33:16,"It's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:33:16,00:33:18,and that is Chazinsky.
00:33:18,00:33:22,"Yes, my fact this week is that the first ever sports bra"
00:33:22,00:33:24,was two jock straps.
00:33:24,00:33:26,[ Laughter ]
00:33:26,00:33:29,"Yeah, this is... I actually heard this on another podcast."
00:33:29,00:33:33,"I don't know if you're allowed to just like trans migrate a fact from one,"
00:33:33,00:33:36,"but I had heard it on 99% invisible, which I assume a lot of you listen to"
00:33:36,00:33:37,"and if you don't, you should."
00:33:37,00:33:43,"But this is... It was invented by someone called Lisa Lindahl in 1970s, 1977."
00:33:43,00:33:47,"And she... It was when jogging became a really fashionable thing to do,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,and specifically for women to do.
00:33:49,00:33:52,And there was an issue because sports bras didn't exist.
00:33:52,00:33:54,And there were various issues.
00:33:54,00:33:56,"And she was in her sitting room one day,"
00:33:56,00:33:58,"and she was saying, ""What are we going to do about the fact"
00:33:58,00:34:02,"that every time we go running, there's all this rubbing, and it hurts,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,"and it just doesn't work for us."""
00:34:04,00:34:09,"And her husband started parading around their sitting room with his jock strap on his chest,"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"saying, ""You should try one of these guys. They work really well."""
00:34:11,00:34:14,"And she actually thought, ""Yeah, what a great plan."""
00:34:14,00:34:17,"And she got our friend to sew together two jock straps,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,"which if... I had to remind myself what a jock strap was,"
00:34:20,00:34:24,"but it's like... It's like tight wire fronts for men who are playing sports, right?"
00:34:24,00:34:26,Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
00:34:26,00:34:28,And she said...
00:34:28,00:34:31,"She said a very spotty puddle, I'm just be saying."
00:34:31,00:34:36,"We need to wrap up soon, actually, because we've got to hit the gym."
00:34:36,00:34:40,"Hey, don't laugh so hard on that face."
00:34:40,00:34:45,"But so these ladies, Lisa Lindhal and also Polly Smith, who did her designing,"
00:34:45,00:34:48,"they get all the credit, but surely the credit should go to her husband,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,who was prancing around his front room with jock strap.
00:34:51,00:34:55,"Good point, James, behind every great woman is a great owner."
00:34:55,00:35:00,Because of the unbelievably childish man dancing around his front room.
00:35:00,00:35:03,"I didn't mean that, by the way. That was..."
00:35:03,00:35:05,"As a joke, they called it the jock bra."
00:35:05,00:35:08,"And then that got changed into the jock bra,"
00:35:08,00:35:12,which got changed into the sports bra.
00:35:12,00:35:15,And who knows what that will become next?
00:35:15,00:35:18,But you know someone else who was responsible for inventing it.
00:35:18,00:35:21,"So what she did, Lisa, was she sewed these two..."
00:35:21,00:35:24,"Oh, she got her assistant Polly to sew these two jock straps together"
00:35:24,00:35:26,and she ran around with it and it worked.
00:35:26,00:35:30,But the person who helped with the sewing was someone called Hinder Schreiber.
00:35:30,00:35:32,"Yeah, your surname."
00:35:32,00:35:35,So a distant relation of yours helped invent the sports bra.
00:35:35,00:35:38,"Not that distant though, because it's unbelievably recent, right?"
00:35:38,00:35:41,People are always surprised that the person who invented it's still alive
00:35:41,00:35:43,and still doing interviews are still alive.
00:35:43,00:35:46,"You're right, it's so weird that it was literally 40 years ago."
00:35:46,00:35:49,She has a whole section on her website about I invented the sports bra.
00:35:49,00:35:52,"Well, I would have thought that would be the main bit now."
00:35:52,00:35:56,"No, no, she does loads of other stuff, because she's not one trick pony."
00:35:56,00:35:58,She does loads of other stuff.
00:35:58,00:35:59,Like?
00:35:59,00:36:01,"Well, I didn't know."
00:36:01,00:36:06,There's only so much reading time in the day.
00:36:06,00:36:08,I didn't read the whole thing.
00:36:08,00:36:10,"As she's an artist, I think, as well."
00:36:10,00:36:12,Does motivational speaking possibly...
00:36:12,00:36:15,"I would think so, yeah."
00:36:15,00:36:21,I heard that there was possibly a slightly earlier one called the free swing tennis bra.
00:36:21,00:36:22,Yes.
00:36:22,00:36:24,That was a rival and that was a couple of years early.
00:36:24,00:36:26,It was specifically for tennis and it was not...
00:36:26,00:36:28,It wasn't really a sports bra.
00:36:28,00:36:30,It was just a bra.
00:36:30,00:36:33,I was just saying you can play sports in this if you want.
00:36:33,00:36:36,"This was a specific kind of holding you in kind of thing, right?"
00:36:36,00:36:40,"I held you in, strapped you down and also had thick straps because of the rubbing."
00:36:40,00:36:42,But there were a few patents much earlier on.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"This is the first commercial one, but actually in 1909,"
00:36:45,00:36:49,a breast supporter was patented by someone called Madeline Gabbo.
00:36:49,00:36:53,"And that was actually the first thing that separated the breast,"
00:36:53,00:36:56,because breast was all of us one entity.
00:36:56,00:36:58,I remember a receptionist for QI once.
00:36:58,00:37:00,The bosom was what the word you would use to refer to your best.
00:37:00,00:37:01,"Yeah, it was a singular."
00:37:01,00:37:02,And those were singular.
00:37:02,00:37:05,They were just one rectangular thing.
00:37:05,00:37:08,It was a rectangular.
00:37:08,00:37:10,Yeah.
00:37:10,00:37:12,They were a different shape then.
00:37:12,00:37:18,"That was popular until very late, the mono boob, basically."
00:37:18,00:37:19,Yeah.
00:37:19,00:37:21,There was no lift and separate.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Absolutely.
00:37:22,00:37:23,There was just the shelf.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Yeah.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"The mono boob until the 20th century, basically,"
00:37:26,00:37:27,was the way to go.
00:37:27,00:37:31,And that's why the French phrase for a woman having a large bosom
00:37:31,00:37:32,is Ilya Monde du Belcault.
00:37:32,00:37:34,There is a crowd on the balcony.
00:37:34,00:37:41,Is it still low?
00:37:41,00:37:42,"No, I don't think it's very convenient now."
00:37:42,00:37:43,Is there any French people in?
00:37:43,00:37:45,"That's not in use now, is it?"
00:37:45,00:37:46,"No, we know what it is."
00:37:46,00:37:47,"No, sorry."
00:37:47,00:37:48,"I mean, you should use it."
00:37:48,00:37:49,It's a lovely metaphor.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Yeah.
00:37:50,00:37:53,"It applies also to a royal wedding, for example."
00:37:53,00:37:54,Yeah.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Yeah.
00:37:55,00:37:59,There's a lot of amazing bras out there now.
00:37:59,00:38:03,"Like in Japan, they have a few which are sort of very technologically advanced."
00:38:03,00:38:05,There's one called the uplifting bra.
00:38:05,00:38:11,And the uplifting bra basically plays you sort of motivational conversation.
00:38:11,00:38:14,So it will monitor your heart rate.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"And if it feels your heart rate going up, it might sense that you're scared."
00:38:17,00:38:19,"And your bra will be like, you got this."
00:38:19,00:38:22,You don't need to freak out.
00:38:22,00:38:24,You are going to own this.
00:38:24,00:38:29,And it's just messages that come out from someone's t-shirt.
00:38:29,00:38:32,Do they have this for punts as well?
00:38:32,00:38:34,I don't know.
00:38:34,00:38:37,Just asking for a friend.
00:38:37,00:38:38,Yeah.
00:38:38,00:38:40,Just calm down.
00:38:40,00:38:50,You've got all the time in the world.
00:38:50,00:39:00,"Oh, that's a shave."
00:39:00,00:39:04,There's another Japanese bra that's also quite exciting which measures your heart rate.
00:39:04,00:39:06,But this is the true love bra.
00:39:06,00:39:12,And this will only spring open if you are truly in love with the person.
00:39:12,00:39:13,Just trying to take it off.
00:39:13,00:39:18,And by truly in love they mean if your heart rate does the stuff that they've made sure the heart rate does.
00:39:18,00:39:20,But what if you're jogging?
00:39:20,00:39:24,"Well, that does feel like one of the major flaws of this bra."
00:39:24,00:39:29,"Yeah, loads of things make your heart rate feel like if you're on a roller coaster."
00:39:29,00:39:35,Or if you're really anxious about the fact that your bra might pop up every second.
00:39:35,00:39:37,I'm with you.
00:39:37,00:39:39,Some kinks need ironing out.
00:39:39,00:39:40,But that is a thing.
00:39:40,00:39:41,It measures your heart rate.
00:39:41,00:39:46,It sends it to an iPhone which analyzes your heart rate and tells if you're in love with someone based on how fast your heart's beating.
00:39:46,00:39:49,Which is not a super foolproof method.
00:39:49,00:39:50,"Well, and then spring's open."
00:39:50,00:39:54,There's another bra in Japan which is in its translation called marriage hunt.
00:39:54,00:40:01,And the bra comes down with a countdown clock on your bra which is set by the wearer of the bra.
00:40:01,00:40:02,So they go.
00:40:02,00:40:04,What do you mean by count that?
00:40:04,00:40:05,I want to be married.
00:40:05,00:40:07,The game show count.
00:40:07,00:40:11,"No, it's so, you go, I want to be married exactly a year from now."
00:40:11,00:40:13,I want to meet the right person.
00:40:13,00:40:15,I want to be married a year from now.
00:40:15,00:40:16,So you set on your bra.
00:40:16,00:40:19,But doesn't that look like you're wearing a bomb?
00:40:19,00:40:21,I know.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"Again, like Anna said about the previous one."
00:40:24,00:40:26,There's a few kinks to sort out.
00:40:26,00:40:30,"If this woman doesn't get married in 20 minutes, she's got to explode."
00:40:30,00:40:33,Have you heard of Mary Phelps Jacobs?
00:40:33,00:40:35,She is supposedly invented.
00:40:35,00:40:39,"Well, she patented an early version of it exactly in 1914."
00:40:39,00:40:41,And there were versions of it before then.
00:40:41,00:40:43,But she was a young woman.
00:40:43,00:40:44,She was quite a wealthy young woman.
00:40:44,00:40:48,"She was going to a dance and she didn't want to wear a corset because it's very,"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"it's hard to move, it's hard to dance."
00:40:50,00:40:53,But she had the most incredible life.
00:40:53,00:40:55,So we featured her on the podcast a few weeks ago.
00:40:55,00:41:01,An audience member won a fact by saying that the woman who invented the bra had a whip it called clitoris.
00:41:01,00:41:04,"And she did, but she was the most incredible woman."
00:41:04,00:41:07,So she changed her name to caress Crosby.
00:41:07,00:41:09,And she nearly named herself Clitoris Crosby.
00:41:09,00:41:12,"But then she said, no, that's for the dog."
00:41:12,00:41:15,And then she sold her patent for not very much money.
00:41:15,00:41:18,But then she moved to Paris and became a publisher.
00:41:18,00:41:22,She and her husband Harry had this incredible publishing life.
00:41:22,00:41:26,"They published everyone, D.H. Lawrence and Charles Bukowski and Lewis Carroll."
00:41:26,00:41:34,"But they also had these raucous sex and drug-fueled parties in an abandoned mill, which they owned."
00:41:34,00:41:41,"And they had a, they bought their own tombstones and then they kept them on the roof of their block of flats and sun-based naked on them."
00:41:41,00:41:43,They just had this incredible life.
00:41:43,00:41:44,That's weird.
00:41:44,00:41:45,Yeah.
00:41:45,00:41:48,"But the thing is about them, she sold the patent, like you say, for not much money."
00:41:48,00:41:50,It was a husband's idea.
00:41:50,00:41:53,"He got fed up with the whole thing and say, oh, you should just sell the patent."
00:41:53,00:41:54,And she did sell it.
00:41:54,00:41:56,"She sold it for $1,500."
00:41:56,00:42:00,"And she did this in around 1915, 1916."
00:42:00,00:42:04,And then America joined the war in 1917.
00:42:04,00:42:07,And corsets were banned because they had so much wire in them.
00:42:07,00:42:09,"And suddenly, bras became massive."
00:42:09,00:42:11,"No, well, we didn't..."
00:42:11,00:42:16,"But bras became really, really, really popular."
00:42:16,00:42:19,And so she missed out by only a couple of years on making billions from them.
00:42:19,00:42:23,"Wait, and pretty much why they needed wire, they needed the metal for the war effort."
00:42:23,00:42:24,Yes.
00:42:24,00:42:27,I remember that they got two battleships out of the steel they saved.
00:42:27,00:42:28,"Yeah, they did."
00:42:28,00:42:29,With enough to build two battleships.
00:42:29,00:42:30,"Oh, wow."
00:42:30,00:42:33,And the fact about rubber pants at the first world war.
00:42:33,00:42:34,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:34,00:42:36,People used to have a rubber diet.
00:42:36,00:42:38,And the rubber diet was not an actual food diet.
00:42:38,00:42:42,"It was just to wear rubber knickers and rubber corsets, which would rub against you and make you sweat."
00:42:42,00:42:43,And then you would lose weight.
00:42:43,00:42:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:42:44,00:42:46,It didn't work and it just flayed your flesh.
00:42:46,00:42:47,But...
00:42:47,00:42:51,"And that's like, now people would put like cling film around them, aren't they?"
00:42:51,00:42:53,"Yeah, but the cling film diet, we've all done it."
00:42:53,00:42:54,We've all done it.
00:42:54,00:42:57,"But don't, I think boxes do that, don't they?"
00:42:57,00:43:01,"They wrap themselves in cling film and then they exercise, they lose more weight through water."
00:43:01,00:43:02,"Jockey's, too, don't they?"
00:43:02,00:43:03,"Yeah, yeah."
00:43:03,00:43:04,"Yeah, you're right."
00:43:04,00:43:05,But they didn't work.
00:43:05,00:43:06,And also...
00:43:06,00:43:10,"It doesn't work because all you lose is water and then as soon as you drink some water, it goes back into you."
00:43:10,00:43:11,So it's very short term.
00:43:11,00:43:13,But then the first world war broke out.
00:43:13,00:43:16,And all the rubber was needed for the war.
00:43:16,00:43:17,Yeah.
00:43:17,00:43:18,So...
00:43:18,00:43:19,Out-see-bout-see-what?
00:43:19,00:43:23,LAUGHTER
00:43:23,00:43:25,What do you think you drop a fire in the lot?
00:43:25,00:43:27,"Lots of stuff, you know."
00:43:27,00:43:29,"Wheels, wheels, I guess."
00:43:29,00:43:32,That's why they call it the bouncy war.
00:43:32,00:43:37,"Hey, I'm just speaking of boxers and fighting."
00:43:37,00:43:41,There's been an innovation off the back of someone watching an MMA fight.
00:43:41,00:43:45,That's sort of Conor McGregor style fighting that goes on.
00:43:45,00:43:48,And someone lost a match after being kicked in the testicles.
00:43:48,00:43:52,"And he thought, ""Ah, I wonder why that jockstrap didn't protect him more."""
00:43:52,00:43:57,"So he's invented now a bulletproof jockstrap, which is on the market."
00:43:57,00:43:59,It's called nut shells.
00:43:59,00:44:05,And nut shells can withstand a bullet being fired at your groin.
00:44:05,00:44:07,"I mean, who does those tests?"
00:44:07,00:44:12,"I'm pretty sure that the inventor, who's called Robert, did do that."
00:44:12,00:44:16,And so the idea is it can be used for sports because if you're playing baseball
00:44:16,00:44:22,and a fastball comes or a tennis serve comes or someone's frying a bullet at you at a...
00:44:22,00:44:24,"I mean, an incredibly well-aimed bullet."
00:44:24,00:44:25,Yes.
00:44:25,00:44:26,Yeah.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"But I mean, it's now..."
00:44:27,00:44:28,It's been picked up by the military.
00:44:28,00:44:30,The middle level of the size joke.
00:44:30,00:44:31,It's just a...
00:44:31,00:44:33,LAUGHTER
00:44:33,00:44:39,I need to be a pretty sharp shooter to hit you.
00:44:39,00:44:42,LAUGHTER
00:44:42,00:44:44,Why does the military need that technology?
00:44:44,00:44:46,It doesn't... it has bulletproof technology.
00:44:46,00:44:47,Yeah.
00:44:47,00:44:49,It doesn't need a different kind of bulletproof for your penis.
00:44:49,00:44:51,It's just the same kind of bulletproof.
00:44:51,00:44:52,You're right.
00:44:52,00:44:56,Surrounding the penis with 30 or 40 layers of toughened glass.
00:44:56,00:44:59,"I think Imelda Marcos had a bulletproof bra, didn't she?"
00:44:59,00:45:00,Did she?
00:45:00,00:45:01,Did she?
00:45:01,00:45:02,"Yeah, made out of Kevlar."
00:45:02,00:45:03,Right.
00:45:03,00:45:04,She did.
00:45:04,00:45:05,Wow.
00:45:05,00:45:09,"The jockstrap is, as you mentioned, it is from..."
00:45:09,00:45:13,"It's from Jockey, but it was invented for Bicycle Jockeys."
00:45:13,00:45:16,So this was in the 1880s?
00:45:16,00:45:20,"I would have thought like American Jocs, like just a..."
00:45:20,00:45:22,"No, the word Joc comes from Jocstrap."
00:45:22,00:45:29,So it was invented for cyclists in Boston in the 1880s because they were called jockeys
00:45:29,00:45:32,and they delivered stuff and they were cobbled streets.
00:45:32,00:45:34,And so it was quite painful to cycle over the cobbled streets.
00:45:34,00:45:36,And so the jockstrap was invented for that.
00:45:36,00:45:38,And that's where the Joc comes from.
00:45:38,00:45:40,It's a sporty thing now.
00:45:40,00:45:43,But at the start it was invented to stop your balls bumping over cobbles.
00:45:43,00:45:44,Right.
00:45:44,00:45:45,Wow.
00:45:45,00:45:48,"Guys, we need to wrap up very shortly."
00:45:48,00:45:49,"Oh, yeah."
00:45:49,00:45:53,So the thing with bras is everyone thought they were invented about 100 years ago.
00:45:53,00:45:56,But they found some really old ones from the Middle Ages.
00:45:56,00:46:02,And they were found in a castle in Austria by a scientist
00:46:02,00:46:06,or an archaeologist called Beatrix Nuts from the University of Innsbruck.
00:46:06,00:46:09,And she's found out basically the what happened was the bra came first
00:46:09,00:46:12,and then the cost it took over and then the bra came back again.
00:46:12,00:46:13,Right.
00:46:13,00:46:15,Which no one believed until 2012 when she found this.
00:46:15,00:46:16,Wow.
00:46:16,00:46:20,And at the same time they found what looks like a pair of panties
00:46:20,00:46:24,is kind of like a gusset and just some kind of string going round.
00:46:24,00:46:28,But they turn out to be men's underwear because women didn't wear underwear at that time.
00:46:28,00:46:34,"And according to Beatrix, underpants were considered a symbol of male dominance and power."
00:46:34,00:46:35,"Oh, really?"
00:46:35,00:46:41,"Well, because even when women started wearing underpants in Victorian times they were crotchless."
00:46:41,00:46:46,And I read one historian said they were crotchless in order to distinguish them from men's underpants.
00:46:46,00:46:48,There must be another way.
00:46:48,00:46:50,In the short.
00:46:50,00:46:53,"Oh, it's a man's underwear."
00:46:53,00:46:55,Name labels are the way.
00:46:55,00:46:56,Yeah.
00:46:56,00:46:59,"Or, you know, the men's ones are the ones which constantly matter things like,"
00:46:59,00:47:01,"""You're doing fine, really."""
00:47:01,00:47:08,"Okay, that's it."
