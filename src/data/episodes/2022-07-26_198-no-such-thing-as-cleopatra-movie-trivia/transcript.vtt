00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.360
 "Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.480
 this week coming to you live from up the creek in Greenwich London!"

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:35.020
 "My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with Anne Chazinski, Andrew Hunter

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.360
 Murray and James Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.480
 our four favourite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here we go!

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720
 Starting with you, Andy."

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.360
 "My fact is that archaeologists have just dug up in the middle of the desert an enormous

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 thinks statue. It is believed to be anywhere up to 95 years old."

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.720
 "I think you're going to have to explain with me."

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.320
 So there are now archaeologists looking at old film sets from the early days of Hollywood

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.520
 and they're doing proper excavations on movie sets that were abandoned to the desert.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.120
 This is a real thing. And there was a very famous film in the 20s called The Ten Commandments.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.920
 It was this massive biblical epic and at the end of it, they didn't take the sets down.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.360
 There's a theory it would have been too expensive or...

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.040
 "There's another theory that he didn't want anyone else to use the set because the director

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 was Cecil B. DeMille and he was a bit of a megalomaniac wasn't he? And he thought he didn't

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.760
 want anyone else to use this so I'm going to bury it in the middle of the desert and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.760
 now he found it."

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.960
 "And they buried it. And yeah, there's this filmmaker who's been searching for it for years.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.680
 He's called Peter Brosnan and there's now a film about the finding of the original film.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.040
 It's called Cecil B. DeMille's Lost City or something very similar to that. And it was this

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.080
 enormous set. So it was 12 stories high, 800 feet wide. There were 21 synxes. The Pharaohs

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.360
 statues weighed four tons each and they built an extra synch so that actors playing slaves

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.120
 could drag it around. The effort they went to with this film is enormous."

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.840
 "That's awesome. I read a thing that the idea that we have for that slaves built the pyramids

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.360
 and so on is down largely to this movie because that's not the case. It wasn't as people working

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 but they just as a representation use slaves in the movie. That's where we get that common

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 myth."

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.160
 "They were kind of freelancers as far as I understand it."

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.300
 "They were farmers outside the farming season weren't they? They did the pyramids. Yeah,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.440
 I think so. But this movie, when DeMille put it in the middle of the desert, he said,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.520
 "If 1,000 years from now archaeologists happen to dig beneath the sands, I hope they will

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.760
 not rush into print with the amazing news that Egyptian civilization extended all the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.240
 way to the Pacific coast of North America." So he actually saw the idea that people would

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.880
 be digging this up in the future and might think that it was real.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.720
 "We've totally fucked up his plan. That's so sad. We knew as well but that's what he wanted."

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 "No, he didn't want that. That's what he said. He specifically didn't want."

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.160
 "I think he was saying that he was sitting with a bit of a wing cluzzy. He was like, 'Oh,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.640
 I really hope they don't do that.' Yeah, that's how I interpreted it. But I'm making that up.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.960
 I actually thought that's what he had said."

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960
 "Did he?"

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.520
 "Some people who did do that is the website 9Gug. Everyone knows the website 9Gug. Yeah, we all

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520
 know that."

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.520
 "It sounds rude. I know people love, but it's not a rude site, is it?"

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.680
 "No, it's just like memes and stuff like that. And what they did was they buried a huge

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.520
 pillar card with internet memes deliberately to fuck with the archaeologists of the future."

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.080
 So everyone had to vote for their favourite memes and the ones that went in were such memes

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.960
 as Dick Butt. Doge, who you probably all know, shit just got real. And hardest name in Africa.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.640
 I don't know what that one was. But they buried this in there and they're hoping that in thousands

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.760
 of years people will see it and think that it was some kind of religion or something.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 "Oh, hi. Which I guess it is in a way, right?" "Yeah, yeah. Iron Age. Bronze Age. Banta Rage."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.600
 I was reading in the movie Cleopatra itself because it was a huge, a huge operation to get

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.880
 this movie made. It was, it was so ambitious, they made all these incredible sets.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.080
 "Wait, are you talking about the Ten Commandments or Cleopatra?"

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.460
 "Sorry, sorry, it's the Ten Commandments we're meant to be talking about. I've researched

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:41.400
 Cleopatra and let's move on." Cleopatra, it was, they had a big set too. It was, you know,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:48.660
 very expensive film. There's your segue. "Yeah, thanks guys. No, no, no, no. I'll just comment

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.820
 on what you guys have to say for the rest of the evening. Okay, sorry."

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.420
 "Is anyone got any Cleopatra material that we can help him out with?"

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.900
 "I do have a, a fact related to Cleopatra, which is, yeah, it's about the film The Ten Commandments."

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:12.220
 Okay, so it was, basically, in 1922, Cecil B. Demel, he was already pretty famous but he ran

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.500
 a competition for what his next film would be about. So you, everyone submitted subjects and the

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.700
 best subject won a thousand dollars and he would make the film. And it went to a man who was called

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.820
 F. C. Nelson. He was a lubricating oil manufacturer and he just wrote on a bit of paper, "Make the Ten Commandments."

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.100
 If only he'd written "Make Cleopatra."

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:41.180
 But then beneath it, he had a little PS at the bottom of the page, he then wrote, "You cannot break

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.220
 the Ten Commandments or they will break you." But he won, he won the competition.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.220
 But it was, it was a bit disastrous, right? The Ten Commandments, in a sense, because Cecil

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.460
 B. Demel was so determined to get it working and it went so way of a budget, he didn't accept any

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.340
 profits from it. His producers called him and were like, "Come back now, give up. This is a complete

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.700
 disaster." And he refused to. And he did things like, he refused to use painted backgrounds at all.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.740
 So he refused to use normal scenery so that meant he just had to literally build everything.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.140
 So I think there was a wall that was miles and miles along that he had built, wasn't there?

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.300
 And then at the end, did he dynamite the whole thing? I'm just thinking if Donald Trump digs

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:29.500
 around and finds that wall. Yeah. I don't think he did dynamite it. No, that's a rumour, by the end of the

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:37.020
 rumour. Yeah. Cecil Demel, sorry, just quickly. Great director, do you guys have any stuff on Joseph

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:51.260
 Manquets? What did he do, right then? I'm just quickly on Cecil B. Demel. So for the shooting of it,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.940
 and this is just the incredible budgets of the day, he built a city which had 3,500 actors,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.900
 technicians and extras. They were divided into 14 units of man and seven of women in a 24 square

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:11.260
 mile city and there were very strict rules about alcohol and gambling and stuff. He hired 225

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:20.060
 orthodox Jews to look like their ancestors, the Israelites. And apparently during the filming,

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.140
 they kept missing their cues because they were so overwhelmed by the emotion of being in this thing.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:30.700
 And then he wrote to everyone on set, he said, your skin will be cooked raw. You will miss the

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.980
 comforts of home. You will be asked to endure perhaps the most unpleasant location in cinema history.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.660
 I expect of you your supreme efforts. It was so tough to say. He was a nass, wasn't he?

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:49.420
 I like him. Do you? Okay, I do. This is someone who you could have, I think. I'm not saying that you're

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:56.220
 a prima donor Andy, but he had a chair boy who always walked three steps behind him carrying a chair.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:03.260
 He was never allowed to look his master in the eye and whenever DeMille stood still for more than a minute,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.980
 the chair boy had to put the chair behind him and then bang the back of his knees so that he sat

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.300
 down on the chair, which was there. Whoa. Can you imagine having one of those? Yes, I can.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.500
 And I'm frankly angry, I had to sit down tonight.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:24.140
 Was this what we DeMille had pop it? It sounds like he was one of those collapsing puppets.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.580
 He made loads of biblical films. He made another biblical epic called "The King of Kings" and he

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.940
 made, but he was mostly known for slightly saucy movies. They always involved a naked woman

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:39.740
 in a bathtub at some point and then he made the tank of armaments, which is a big switcheroo.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.460
 Cleopatra used to spend a lot of time in bathtub stitching. James, I don't have anything on it.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:51.500
 Actually, I got a different thing, which is just picking up on what James said earlier about him

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.340
 wanting to bury DeMille, wanting to bury the set so no one else would use it.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.140
 There's a bit of logic behind that because people back in the day of early Hollywood did use

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.820
 to do that. So there's a very famous version of Dracula that was made with Bella Logosi.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.100
 And the idea was you would pay for all these movies huge budgets for their sets to be made,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.620
 but because of workers unions and clocking off at the right time, it meant that you'd film in the

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.420
 day and in the evening the set was just sitting there. So they thought, "What if we filmed the foreign

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.860
 language version of the movie that we're now making in Spanish and Italian in the night time

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.060
 when they've abandoned the set?" And that's what they did. And there's a very famous

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:35.980
 version of Dracula from 1931 where they made in the daytime the English version with Bella Logosi

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:41.500
 and in the evening time they made the Spanish version and the Spanish version because they were

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:45.980
 able to sit at the end of the day of filming of the American one. They would watch the

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.940
 Dailies and so the rushes that they filmed that day and they would go, "Oh, that angle's no use.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.420
 Why don't we film from this direction?" And so they would re-angle everything. They learned to make

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.380
 the movie by watching a different movie being made on the same set. Yeah. And as a result, it took

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:06.220
 something like seven weeks or something. Sorry, a few months for them to make the American version,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.700
 but the Spanish version just got done it really quickly and they made it way before the Americans

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.460
 finished and released it before the Americans released it. And so people saw the Spanish version

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:21.340
 and the reviews were, "Well, if the American version is as good as this and it's probably better,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:25.660
 it's going to be an amazing movie." Because it was awesome, but the problem was it was shit,

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.940
 the American version. But one reason I think it would be shit is doesn't Dracula die in the daytime.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:39.820
 Yeah. Yes. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the guy the director was so bad he didn't

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.540
 capture Dracula's death on camera. He failed to put the camera in the right position. So it's just

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.980
 Bella Legoski going, "Oh, off screen. You don't even see." Yeah, but you can't, I mean, presumably

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:55.980
 Bella Legoski didn't actually die, so you can't just retake that. And have him in front of the camera.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.420
 Yeah, I know, but they didn't. They just didn't. I guess back then they were just like, "Oh,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:05.100
 it's six o'clock. The Spanish are coming in. All right, let's go to go. Bella's done." But yeah,

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.980
 so they did use to double up on the sets. And so that version of Dracula was more famous for the

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.620
 Spanish version that was copying the American than the American version. So you can understand

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:20.860
 why he wanted to bury sets. It was probably a crew of Spaniards around the corner. He was only out there

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:27.740
 avoiding Thomas Edison, wasn't he? Who? Cecil B. Demel. What? Yeah. That's why he was out West.

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.860
 That's why they went out West is because there were loads of Edison thugs who would beat you up for

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.340
 using... Was it film technology? Yeah, and that's basically why Hollywood is where it is today and

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.620
 why they made all the movies out there because Edison was on the East Coast. And if they went to the

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.820
 other side of America, they couldn't get them with all the patents and all things like that.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.300
 Yeah. And so Cecil B. Demel owned 80 guns to protect himself.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:58.300
 80 guns and a wolf. He had a wolf as well. I'm serious. I know it sounds like I just out of that

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.620
 spur of the moment. Wow. You're the Blues Brothers. You know, when they film The Blues Brothers,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:08.060
 again, went quite over budget. The most impressive set of thing they did was they dropped a car

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.940
 from a helicopter. I think there's a scene in it where they fly a helicopter like 1500 feet in the

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.580
 air and then they drop a car down on Chicago. They got permission from the government, the state

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.100
 government to do that. They dropped a Pinto car down into like presumably an abandoned area of

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:30.300
 Chicago. It's presumably. And the car, when it landed, it was 45 centimetres tall

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.860
 because of the, that was the extent of the force. Yeah. That's pretty good. And they also had a cocaine

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.980
 budget. They always used to say that about the Blues Brothers, didn't they? That film had

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.740
 its own cocaine budget. There's a film with Dennis Hopper, Easy Rider. It was called. And this is

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:52.380
 a, yeah, awesome film. But he was part of the creative team and he was doing drugs every single day.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.500
 And he was doing all different kinds of drugs. And it got to the point where they were like, we

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.380
 just have to give up and accept that he's on ecstasy in the morning cocaine in the afternoon

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.380
 and heroin in the evening, whatever he was doing pot in the evening. It got to the point that when

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:09.900
 he got the scripts for the next day for the film, they wrote on it the drug that he was on in the

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.860
 previous scene so he could match the energy that he was bringing to it. So they're like, we're going

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.500
 to film the second half of the scene we did three days ago and you were on cocaine then. So if you

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:25.100
 could do three lines before we start shooting, we'll get the same vibe as what you were. I'd love to see

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:33.260
 the movie where they mix them up. He's doing heroin and suddenly he's doing cocaine. We need to move on

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.460
 shortly to our second fact. Do you guys have anything before we go? Apocalypse now. Yeah sure.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.420
 They're filming Apocalypse now. One of the things that Francis Ford, a cobbler, demanded was that

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:47.900
 he was allowed to burn down a lot of jungle in Vietnam and because he was a big deal at that point

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.300
 they allowed him to. So many acres of jungle were just burned down for it. But also he used real

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:58.380
 military helicopters but apparently he used to get really annoyed on set because they kept on having

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:05.340
 to fly off to fight in actual wars. No. So he used to get really pissed off. Wow. Yeah. I got one

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:10.860
 last thing. It was a movie set problem. It's a movie back in the day called Cleopatra where

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:18.620
 what happened was is that Cleopatra's entrance scene was a huge, you know, even listening. Okay,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:27.340
 it is time for a fact number two and that is me. It's my fact. Okay, my fact this week is that when

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:35.180
 British author William Hazlitt died his landlady was so keen to re-let his room that she hid his body

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:42.540
 under the bed while she showed new tenants around. This is extraordinary. What a viewing. That must have

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:50.780
 happened to me. Will he be here? So Hazlitt, he's not that famous now is he? No, but if we made the show

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.340
 back in the 1800s you guys would be like, "Whaah!" Hazlitt was huge. He was a massive British author.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:02.220
 Not only an author, he was a literary critic, he was a painter, a social commentator, a philosopher,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:10.860
 he was a big deal. He died in 1830. He was living in Soho and in fact there is a hotel now there

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:16.460
 which is called the Hazlitt House, I believe, and that is the location where he died. And he's still

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:23.020
 there onto that bed, isn't he? He's still there, yeah. But he was a big deal and people used to go

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.060
 just to the Hazlitt hotel just because that's where he lived. Sheamus Heaney used to go there,

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:32.700
 obsessed with him and they would have meetups there just to be able to be in the sort of presence

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.260
 of the location of this great person who everyone seems to have forgotten except it turns out

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:42.540
 you an interesting person. I mean people know what him has it is, but I did happen to take a book

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:49.020
 of his essays on my gap here which I know is I just told these guys. One of those guys was going to

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.460
 mention it so I could get in there. Which drug were you taking when you were reading it?

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.780
 The essays themselves were my drugs, James.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:03.660
 What am I on? I'm on chapter three.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:15.180
 I mean, they didn't come in chapters, but whatever. But he was, he was unappreciated by his death,

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.980
 wasn't he? Like when he died, he died in poverty. It was on Frist Street and he'd been basically

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.780
 dist by all of the people he'd been mates with. So he was really good friends with Code Ridge and

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:32.460
 study and words worth, but he kind of also hated everyone. Yeah, he kind of started it. He did start it.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:38.860
 So they embodied these revolutionary ideals that he loved and he thought that they didn't see them

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.940
 through properly. He thought they'd all sold out. So he kind of loved Code Ridge, but he wrote all

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.940
 these essays saying, I hate that you haven't lived up to your potential. So eventually they just

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.100
 ruined his reputation and he died in poverty. And it all started actually when he

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:57.260
 grope somebody. Did you read this story? Yeah. Yeah, it was. Yeah, boo, exactly.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:09.100
 Well, don't say it was a different time on it. It was a different time. They were staying in the

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.860
 lake district. It was him and Code Ridge and words worth all staying in the lake district and writing

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:18.460
 together. And he went away, Haslet went to the pub one night and a woman was flirting with him

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:22.300
 and sort of teasing him and he thought that she wanted to get off with him. So he sort of leaned in

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:28.140
 or something or, you know, came onto her and then she laughed at him and said, no, don't be such a,

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.900
 you know, CAD. And so he lifted up a petticoats and slapped her on the bottom.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:41.260
 I'm with the lady on the second row here. I'm not saying it's good behaviour, but he'd been

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.620
 embarrassed and then he got chased by this mob who wanted to duck him, which apparently is a

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.500
 common thing. They wanted to duck him and duck him. That's an autoferec thing, I think.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:18:05.180
 But yeah, and he ran back to Kohler Ridge and said, please hide me and they smothered him away

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:12.060
 over the mountain. That's extreme. He saved him, but then they spread all these rumours that he

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:18.060
 was a horrible, lascivious, sleazy man. And then he hadn't affair with someone half his age.

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.660
 Yeah. And then he sort of had a, so it was his landlady's daughter, not the landlady, I believe,

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:32.940
 who later got vengeance by hiding him out of the bed. He, yeah, she was half his age and he just

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:36.780
 fell completely in love with that. And then he wrote this whole book saying that he had fallen in

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:45.980
 love with her and declaring it in public. And he sent his friend to test her by making advances

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.140
 and flirting with her and seeing how she reacted. And she flirted back with his friend,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:54.460
 although she drew the line at any serious stuff. And then he asked his friend whether he could set

00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:01.020
 Sarah this girl up as the friend's mistress and he would pay for it. And the friend said,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:10.380
 "No, I would pro-woman who can read and talk." It was a complete disaster. Anyway, it was a great

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:18.460
 literary figure. Here's my favourite William Hazlick complete disaster story. And that is his first

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:24.140
 lecture at the Russell institution where he turned up and they told him it had to be one hour long,

00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:29.420
 but he prepared enough material for three hours. And so instead of editing it, he just did the three

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:37.340
 hour talk in one hour. And just put his head down and just read it as quickly as he could. Wow.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.980
 That's really funny James, because it reminds me of another story about Hazlick which I've

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.460
 brought along and I've so glad you mentioned it. I read actually, relatively, something recently

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:51.420
 about Gordon Brown, which was, this is in the week, I think. And it was a story that goes around

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:55.580
 Westminster, which is that he was asked to give a talk sort of a penchant dinner quite early on in

00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:02.540
 his MP DUM. It was about pensions. It was a talk about pensions to a bunch of pensioners and other

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:07.660
 people. And he was asked to speak for 45 minutes, so he got up and he gave, and he really works really

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.900
 hard, you know, he's never working hard on stuff. So he thought really hard, he delivered this 45-minute

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.020
 speech. And at the end, the person who was comparing the event came on and apologised for the fact

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:27.340
 that he got on so long and they'd actually asked him to do a four to five minutes speech.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.540
 At what stage do you think I'm going to have to stop him here?

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:34.380
 He can imagine on pensions.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:43.020
 Hazlick in the event, well, he coined a word that we all use today, gusto.

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:47.980
 Yeah, yeah, it's got gusto, that's Hazlick.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.340
 It existed before, didn't it? But he sort of wrote an essay on it, sort of properly defining it.

00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:53.580
 Yep.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.540
 I thought he'd invented it, I would say.

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:07.420
 No, it didn't exist before, to mean like life. And he said it as something to do with arts, didn't he?

00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.580
 Yes. He was the first person to use it to describe art.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.220
 Yes.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.620
 Well, anyone can use a word to mean a different thing to think we've all agreed it means.

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:21.020
 Well, he also, according to the OED, coined the word's newsmongering, modernising, and aconing.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.860
 Acalling, apparently, means collecting acons.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:28.220
 And he was the first person to use that.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.060
 Yeah, unbelievable.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:33.980
 What a great contribution to the English language and people don't appreciate it.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.460
 I can see why it took a massive break of his essays on your gap, yeah.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.660
 You'll see your customs. Anything to declare?

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:41.980
 No.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.620
 What's that in your back, Madam?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.860
 For converses and a bunch of acons, the problem?

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.140
 Some stuff on dead bodies or estate agents.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.260
 Dead bodies, please.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.620
 Dead bodies, and if we can, Cleopatra would be.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.140
 So here's the thing about the dead.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.740
 No, so a contemporary of Hazlick's was Shelley.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.900
 And there's an often repeated story about Shelley's heart being plucked from the funeral pie he was

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:20.540
 being burned on. So he drowned and he was at sea for several days, dead and bobbing around,

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.860
 and then he was retrieved and he was burned on the beach.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.660
 There's now a theory that it wasn't his heart which refused to burn, because it's a very nice

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:33.980
 romantic image that his heart refused to burn. They now think it was his liver, which refused to

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:38.460
 burn, because it would just soak in seawater for days and days, and it was the biggest organ, so it

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.580
 would have been less likely to burn. And it was taken out and a friend of his took it and then

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.700
 bequeathed it to another friend of his who then gave it to Mary Shelley who put it in the back.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.260
 It's really, it's re-gifting, isn't it, when you don't.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:58.220
 But actually speaking of livers, I'm back on Hazlick, he didn't drink, but do you know why he didn't

00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.580
 drink at the end of his life?

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.620
 No, we're going to guess then. Broke, he was broke.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.820
 He was broke, but that's not why, so it said that he died of tannic acid poisoning from excessive tea

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.140
 drinking, because he was obsessed with drinking tea, and he used to fill half a tea pot with tea.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.860
 That can't be possible to die of too much tea, huh?

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.100
 I don't think so, but the upper burden would be dead.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:25.180
 He wasn't obsessed with it, though. Apparently he used to get up at one or two in the afternoon,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:30.300
 never before that, and he would get up and pull himself a tea half full of tea, like the tea leaves,

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:35.180
 and then half of water, and then he would sit there for four to five hours, staring at it.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:47.020
 That was beautiful, like the last time I...

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.340
 God, when we put this podcast out, that's going to come in stereo with people's ears.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:54.620
 That's going to be the best hard-hitting punchline anyone's ever heard.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.180
 Anyway, no, sorry, four to five hours, motionless, staring into the distance.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:07.020
 So he loved tea, but he didn't drink, because the last time he drunk was when he went on a huge binge,

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:12.460
 following the Battle of Waterloo, so he was a massive Napoleon fan, and he loved Napoleon,

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.700
 and he was devastated that Napoleon had been defeated. He thought he epitomised the great revolutionary

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.580
 cause, and so he went on this huge drinking binge, and he spent weeks and weeks wandering London,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.980
 completely unwashed in a drunken haze, and after that he thought alcohol wasn't for him.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.580
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is James.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:37.020
 Okay, my fact this week is that UNICEF has a nutrition ambassador called Pupi.

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:48.620
 So, this is just a thing, this is just true. She is called Jose Heli Hunter Ramahavi Lisoa,

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:55.900
 and she is a singer from Madagascar, and she goes by the stage named Pupi, and lonely planet has

00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:02.620
 declared Pupi a national treasure, and she's been active in educating young mothers about breastfeeding

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:09.100
 their infants as a nutrition ambassador for UNICEF, and that's basically her entire English language

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:14.220
 Wikipedia that I've just read out. And there is nothing else on her on the internet really,

00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:20.780
 there's an English anyway, but she joins other UNICEF ambassadors such as Katie Perry, Serena Williams,

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:27.020
 Liam Neeson, The Wiggles, Dustin the Turkey, and The Vanuatu Women's Beach Volleyball team.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.500
 Oh, cool. Got that embassy must be a riot, mustn't it?

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:38.140
 And yeah, so she's just, she's a nutrition ambassador, and she's got a funny name.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.460
 But we don't know why she's got, I mean, it's her stage name, right?

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.340
 It's just her stage name, yeah. We don't know why she got that name.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.100
 Okay. I imagine it must mean something different in Malagasy, I guess.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:50.380
 Yeah, you would hope. I looked up a little bit on stage names.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.620
 Okay. So, Stevie Wonder, he has a stage name.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:59.340
 Really? Yes, because his real name, what do you think his full first name is?

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:03.900
 Stephen Wonder. Yeah, his first name is Steve Land.

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:13.420
 No, genuinely. That is a theme park I want to go to. And that's a Dave Land.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.340
 No way. What? He was christened Steve Land. Yeah, what?

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.940
 S-T-E-V-L-A-M-D. Steve Land. Steve Land. Yeah, that's amazing.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.060
 I know. Yeah, that's really cool. What's his surname?

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:32.940
 I didn't write it down. Okay. But it's not Wonder. No, it's not Wonder. Wonder, Wonder, Wonder was because he was it.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:39.660
 No, he was he was a boy Wonder, which is why he got the nickname Wonder.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.140
 Oh, okay. Yeah. And Michael Keaton, the actor, his real name is Michael Douglas.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:50.380
 What's Michael Douglas' real name? Steve Land Wonder.

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:56.300
 I don't know, Michael Douglas' real name. Do you know what Wacken Phoenix's real name is?

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.220
 Oh, Bohm. No. But his surname was Bottom. That's right.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:06.140
 Yeah. Yeah. Wacken Bottom. Wacken Bottom. He's William Hitler.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.660
 There's a different time. But his brother was Riverbottom.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:16.620
 So he was Riverbottom. He was Riverbottom. So he had a weirdes upbringing.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.500
 They were members of the, was it the children of God cult?

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.220
 The really famous cult. Yeah. Yeah, they were brought up in that.

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.700
 And then they escaped that and said it wasn't a good idea.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.420
 And the whole family decided to change their name to Phoenix.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.980
 Which does make sense. They were all called Mr. and Mrs. Bottom.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.660
 And they went with Phoenix instead.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.820
 Yeah. I found out today what Michael J. Fox's middle name is.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.980
 Go on. Andrew.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.900
 Yeah. With a silent J.

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.980
 Yeah, no. Yeah.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.780
 Andrew, he basically, when he went sign up for the actors,

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.060
 you have to officially register yourself as an actor in America.

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.700
 And there was already a Michael Andrew Fox.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:57.740
 So he just had to pick J as a random initial.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.740
 But that's what the J stands for. Andrew.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.900
 It sort of stands for it.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:09.260
 I found a list of the 150 worst rapper names in the world.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.220
 Cool. Amazing.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.620
 On the internet. So just a few of those.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:14.380
 The tea bag boys.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:20.940
 Yuck balls. These are all proper rappers apparently.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.820
 Cecil Otter.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.660
 And Bus Driver.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.220
 Really?

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.260
 That's so good.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.780
 Actually, on musicians, do you guys know the band in excess?

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.420
 Yeah.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:37.500
 Yeah. So the bass guitarist for in excess is Gary Beers.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.660
 And his middle name is Gary.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.500
 But with a different number of ours.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.140
 Get out of here.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.140
 Gary. His name is Gary.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:53.020
 Maybe that's exactly the way that's what it is.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.140
 It used to be William and he changed it to Gary.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.580
 Gary Beers. He changed it.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.260
 Yeah. Wow.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.300
 Can't get enough carries.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.460
 So yeah, the double ours in the middle name.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.740
 Wow. If you're interested.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.420
 John Crawford, the actress.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.980
 She was named by the public.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.820
 What's that?

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.340
 Tony McJone faces.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:20.620
 Her original name was Lucille.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.140
 This is a French surname.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.460
 Lucille S-L-E-S-U-E-U-R.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.700
 But people thought studio bosses thought that sounds like Lucille the sewer.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.660
 So they held a public competition to change her name.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.500
 And John Crawford was the entry which one.

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.060
 She didn't like it at first, but she had to be called that.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:39.500
 Wow.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.780
 It grew on her, apparently.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.660
 Okay.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:41.980
 Yeah.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.980
 So cool.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.500
 It's not that cool in name, really.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.220
 Or is it like just the time that makes it feel like that?

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:48.860
 When was it?

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:50.540
 When John Crawford doesn't feel like a...

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.500
 When was it?

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.380
 20th century.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.540
 Anyone?

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.620
 47.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.380
 What a specific answer.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:04.220
 Any advance on 247? Do I have 48?

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.380
 June 47 was one of the names that we're put up.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.900
 I've got a thing on ambassadors.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.700
 Okay.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.940
 So the fact at the top, if you remember, Unicef has a nutrition ambassador,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.980
 and that's called poopy.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.140
 So a lot of celebrities get asked to be ambassadors in certain things.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.060
 And very recently, Helen Mirren has been an ambassador for L'Oreal,

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.020
 so she'll do panels and so on for their moisturizer.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.500
 So, like, it's so annoying about the ambassador.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.820
 It's the brand ambassador, that's why...

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.540
 No, but it's not the same as Unicef, though, is it?

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.180
 Like, you don't set up an immersive building in the Middle East

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.100
 and say, "I am the L'Oreal ambassador."

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.580
 How can I...

00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:47.340
 Oh, where the fuck am I, Ferraro Rache?

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:51.340
 [ Laughter ]

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.780
 Where is the L'Oreal Embassy?

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.380
 [ Laughter ]

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.420
 You're right, yeah.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:56.380
 Um...

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.660
 No, she's a L'Oreal ambassador.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.380
 It's a real thing.

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.580
 Yeah, she's a brand ambassador, and she's not a very good one,

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.580
 because she did a talk...

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.420
 If you did a panel talk in the South of France,

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.300
 and they asked her about moisturizer and what it does,

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.140
 and she said, "Probably fuck all."

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.940
 [ Laughter ]

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.980
 That was her answer.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.100
 [ Laughter ]

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.300
 No.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.140
 I was looking at, because at Poupi,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.140
 the ambassador is a nutritionist, right?

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:20.940
 Yeah.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.780
 And it's from Madagascar.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.380
 So I was looking at some Madagasy nutrition stuff,

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.340
 and so there are some groups in Madagascar

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.780
 that will circumcision is a thing in some tribes,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780
 and some of them eat the foreskin.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.140
 Ooh.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:37.980
 But also, I was reading a...

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.140
 Oh, sorry, I didn't...

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.620
 I got that three seconds after everyone else in the room.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:43.660
 [ Laughter ]

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.100
 Is that weird? I don't think that's weird.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.060
 You don't think that's weird.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.260
 [ Laughter ]

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.140
 In Madagascar, this is a thing.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.340
 [ Laughter ]

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.140
 And there was a journalist went to Madagascar

00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:58.460
 and traveled around it a few years ago,

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:00.540
 and it's specifically in certain regions,

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.820
 so it's in the Antamba Huaca region,

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.420
 and where they eat the foreskin.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.900
 And traditionally, you get circumcised,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.140
 and then it's given to the grandfather

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:11.900
 who then can either eat it,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.460
 or offer it to a very honored guest.

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.460
 I'm sorry.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.460
 It's a journalist.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.460
 Who the whoop?

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:24.460
 They've got a little bit soft in the bag, but...

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.660
 Anyway, it's pretty awkward if you're a guest

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:33.100
 in specific Madagascar, areas of Madagascar,

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.100
 then just look out for being offered foreskin.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.100
 And it is polite to accept it.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.100
 [ Laughter ]

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.620
 Wow.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.460
 Hmm.

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.460
 There was another person who was interviewed

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.460
 from a different tribe.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.460
 Who said, "We actually think that's weird."

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.460
 This is someone from the...

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.460
 This is someone from the Sakhalava tribe.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.460
 This is a different anthropologist who went there,

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.460
 and he said, "We think that's weird."

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.460
 It's only the guys in the mountains in the middle who do that.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.460
 No, we put the foreskin into a firework

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.460
 and send it into the sky.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.460
 All right, should we move on to our final fact?

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.460
 Yes, please.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.460
 It's time for our final fact of the show,

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.460
 and that is Chazinsky.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.460
 Yes, my fact this week is that the first ever sports bra

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.460
 was two jock straps.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.460
 [ Laughter ]

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.460
 Yeah, this is... I actually heard this on another podcast.

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:33.460
 I don't know if you're allowed to just like trans migrate a fact from one,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.460
 but I had heard it on 99% invisible, which I assume a lot of you listen to

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.460
 and if you don't, you should.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:43.460
 But this is... It was invented by someone called Lisa Lindahl in 1970s, 1977.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:47.460
 And she... It was when jogging became a really fashionable thing to do,

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:49.460
 and specifically for women to do.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.460
 And there was an issue because sports bras didn't exist.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.460
 And there were various issues.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.460
 And she was in her sitting room one day,

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.460
 and she was saying, "What are we going to do about the fact

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.460
 that every time we go running, there's all this rubbing, and it hurts,

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:04.460
 and it just doesn't work for us."

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:09.460
 And her husband started parading around their sitting room with his jock strap on his chest,

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.460
 saying, "You should try one of these guys. They work really well."

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.460
 And she actually thought, "Yeah, what a great plan."

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.460
 And she got our friend to sew together two jock straps,

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:20.460
 which if... I had to remind myself what a jock strap was,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.460
 but it's like... It's like tight wire fronts for men who are playing sports, right?

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.460
 Yeah. Yeah. Cool.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.460
 And she said...

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.460
 She said a very spotty puddle, I'm just be saying.

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.460
 We need to wrap up soon, actually, because we've got to hit the gym.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.460
 Hey, don't laugh so hard on that face.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.460
 But so these ladies, Lisa Lindhal and also Polly Smith, who did her designing,

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.460
 they get all the credit, but surely the credit should go to her husband,

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.460
 who was prancing around his front room with jock strap.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.460
 Good point, James, behind every great woman is a great owner.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.460
 Because of the unbelievably childish man dancing around his front room.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.460
 I didn't mean that, by the way. That was...

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:05.460
 As a joke, they called it the jock bra.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.460
 And then that got changed into the jock bra,

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.460
 which got changed into the sports bra.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.460
 And who knows what that will become next?

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.460
 But you know someone else who was responsible for inventing it.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:21.460
 So what she did, Lisa, was she sewed these two...

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.460
 Oh, she got her assistant Polly to sew these two jock straps together

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.460
 and she ran around with it and it worked.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.460
 But the person who helped with the sewing was someone called Hinder Schreiber.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.460
 Yeah, your surname.

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.460
 So a distant relation of yours helped invent the sports bra.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.460
 Not that distant though, because it's unbelievably recent, right?

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.460
 People are always surprised that the person who invented it's still alive

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.460
 and still doing interviews are still alive.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.460
 You're right, it's so weird that it was literally 40 years ago.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.460
 She has a whole section on her website about I invented the sports bra.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:52.460
 Well, I would have thought that would be the main bit now.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:56.460
 No, no, she does loads of other stuff, because she's not one trick pony.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.460
 She does loads of other stuff.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.460
 Like?

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.460
 Well, I didn't know.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:06.460
 There's only so much reading time in the day.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.460
 I didn't read the whole thing.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.460
 As she's an artist, I think, as well.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.460
 Does motivational speaking possibly...

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:15.460
 I would think so, yeah.

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:21.460
 I heard that there was possibly a slightly earlier one called the free swing tennis bra.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.460
 Yes.

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.460
 That was a rival and that was a couple of years early.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:26.460
 It was specifically for tennis and it was not...

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.460
 It wasn't really a sports bra.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.460
 It was just a bra.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.460
 I was just saying you can play sports in this if you want.

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:36.460
 This was a specific kind of holding you in kind of thing, right?

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.460
 I held you in, strapped you down and also had thick straps because of the rubbing.

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.460
 But there were a few patents much earlier on.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.460
 This is the first commercial one, but actually in 1909,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.460
 a breast supporter was patented by someone called Madeline Gabbo.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.460
 And that was actually the first thing that separated the breast,

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.460
 because breast was all of us one entity.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.460
 I remember a receptionist for QI once.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.460
 The bosom was what the word you would use to refer to your best.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.460
 Yeah, it was a singular.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.460
 And those were singular.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.460
 They were just one rectangular thing.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.460
 It was a rectangular.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.460
 Yeah.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.460
 They were a different shape then.

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:18.460
 That was popular until very late, the mono boob, basically.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.460
 Yeah.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.460
 There was no lift and separate.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.460
 Absolutely.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.460
 There was just the shelf.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.460
 Yeah.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.460
 The mono boob until the 20th century, basically,

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:27.460
 was the way to go.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:31.460
 And that's why the French phrase for a woman having a large bosom

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:32.460
 is Ilya Monde du Belcault.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.460
 There is a crowd on the balcony.

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:41.460
 Is it still low?

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.460
 No, I don't think it's very convenient now.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.460
 Is there any French people in?

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:45.460
 That's not in use now, is it?

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:46.460
 No, we know what it is.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.460
 No, sorry.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.460
 I mean, you should use it.

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.460
 It's a lovely metaphor.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:50.460
 Yeah.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:53.460
 It applies also to a royal wedding, for example.

00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.460
 Yeah.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.460
 Yeah.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.460
 There's a lot of amazing bras out there now.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.460
 Like in Japan, they have a few which are sort of very technologically advanced.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.460
 There's one called the uplifting bra.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:11.460
 And the uplifting bra basically plays you sort of motivational conversation.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.460
 So it will monitor your heart rate.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.460
 And if it feels your heart rate going up, it might sense that you're scared.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.460
 And your bra will be like, you got this.

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:22.460
 You don't need to freak out.

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.460
 You are going to own this.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:29.460
 And it's just messages that come out from someone's t-shirt.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.460
 Do they have this for punts as well?

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:34.460
 I don't know.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.460
 Just asking for a friend.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:38.460
 Yeah.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.460
 Just calm down.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:50.460
 You've got all the time in the world.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:39:00.460
 Oh, that's a shave.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:04.460
 There's another Japanese bra that's also quite exciting which measures your heart rate.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.460
 But this is the true love bra.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:12.460
 And this will only spring open if you are truly in love with the person.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.460
 Just trying to take it off.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:18.460
 And by truly in love they mean if your heart rate does the stuff that they've made sure the heart rate does.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.460
 But what if you're jogging?

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:24.460
 Well, that does feel like one of the major flaws of this bra.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.460
 Yeah, loads of things make your heart rate feel like if you're on a roller coaster.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.460
 Or if you're really anxious about the fact that your bra might pop up every second.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.460
 I'm with you.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.460
 Some kinks need ironing out.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.460
 But that is a thing.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.460
 It measures your heart rate.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:46.460
 It sends it to an iPhone which analyzes your heart rate and tells if you're in love with someone based on how fast your heart's beating.

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.460
 Which is not a super foolproof method.

00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.460
 Well, and then spring's open.

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.460
 There's another bra in Japan which is in its translation called marriage hunt.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:40:01.460
 And the bra comes down with a countdown clock on your bra which is set by the wearer of the bra.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:02.460
 So they go.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.460
 What do you mean by count that?

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.460
 I want to be married.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.460
 The game show count.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.460
 No, it's so, you go, I want to be married exactly a year from now.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.460
 I want to meet the right person.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.460
 I want to be married a year from now.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.460
 So you set on your bra.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.460
 But doesn't that look like you're wearing a bomb?

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:21.460
 I know.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.460
 Again, like Anna said about the previous one.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.460
 There's a few kinks to sort out.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:30.460
 If this woman doesn't get married in 20 minutes, she's got to explode.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.460
 Have you heard of Mary Phelps Jacobs?

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.460
 She is supposedly invented.

00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:39.460
 Well, she patented an early version of it exactly in 1914.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.460
 And there were versions of it before then.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.460
 But she was a young woman.

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:44.460
 She was quite a wealthy young woman.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:48.460
 She was going to a dance and she didn't want to wear a corset because it's very,

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.460
 it's hard to move, it's hard to dance.

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.460
 But she had the most incredible life.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.460
 So we featured her on the podcast a few weeks ago.

00:40:55.460 --> 00:41:01.460
 An audience member won a fact by saying that the woman who invented the bra had a whip it called clitoris.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.460
 And she did, but she was the most incredible woman.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.460
 So she changed her name to caress Crosby.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.460
 And she nearly named herself Clitoris Crosby.

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.460
 But then she said, no, that's for the dog.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.460
 And then she sold her patent for not very much money.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.460
 But then she moved to Paris and became a publisher.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.460
 She and her husband Harry had this incredible publishing life.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:26.460
 They published everyone, D.H. Lawrence and Charles Bukowski and Lewis Carroll.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:34.460
 But they also had these raucous sex and drug-fueled parties in an abandoned mill, which they owned.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:41.460
 And they had a, they bought their own tombstones and then they kept them on the roof of their block of flats and sun-based naked on them.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.460
 They just had this incredible life.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.460
 That's weird.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.460
 Yeah.

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.460
 But the thing is about them, she sold the patent, like you say, for not much money.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.460
 It was a husband's idea.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:53.460
 He got fed up with the whole thing and say, oh, you should just sell the patent.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.460
 And she did sell it.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.460
 She sold it for $1,500.

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.460
 And she did this in around 1915, 1916.

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:04.460
 And then America joined the war in 1917.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:07.460
 And corsets were banned because they had so much wire in them.

00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:09.460
 And suddenly, bras became massive.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:11.460
 No, well, we didn't...

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:16.460
 But bras became really, really, really popular.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.460
 And so she missed out by only a couple of years on making billions from them.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.460
 Wait, and pretty much why they needed wire, they needed the metal for the war effort.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.460
 Yes.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.460
 I remember that they got two battleships out of the steel they saved.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.460
 Yeah, they did.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:29.460
 With enough to build two battleships.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.460
 Oh, wow.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.460
 And the fact about rubber pants at the first world war.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.460
 People used to have a rubber diet.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:38.460
 And the rubber diet was not an actual food diet.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.460
 It was just to wear rubber knickers and rubber corsets, which would rub against you and make you sweat.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.460
 And then you would lose weight.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.460
 It didn't work and it just flayed your flesh.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.460
 But...

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.460
 And that's like, now people would put like cling film around them, aren't they?

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.460
 Yeah, but the cling film diet, we've all done it.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:54.460
 We've all done it.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.460
 But don't, I think boxes do that, don't they?

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:01.460
 They wrap themselves in cling film and then they exercise, they lose more weight through water.

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.460
 Jockey's, too, don't they?

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.460
 Yeah, yeah.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.460
 Yeah, you're right.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.460
 But they didn't work.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.460
 And also...

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.460
 It doesn't work because all you lose is water and then as soon as you drink some water, it goes back into you.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.460
 So it's very short term.

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:13.460
 But then the first world war broke out.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.460
 And all the rubber was needed for the war.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460
 Yeah.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:18.460
 So...

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.460
 Out-see-bout-see-what?

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.460
 LAUGHTER

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.460
 What do you think you drop a fire in the lot?

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.460
 Lots of stuff, you know.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.460
 Wheels, wheels, I guess.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.460
 That's why they call it the bouncy war.

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:37.460
 Hey, I'm just speaking of boxers and fighting.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.460
 There's been an innovation off the back of someone watching an MMA fight.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.460
 That's sort of Conor McGregor style fighting that goes on.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.460
 And someone lost a match after being kicked in the testicles.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.460
 And he thought, "Ah, I wonder why that jockstrap didn't protect him more."

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.460
 So he's invented now a bulletproof jockstrap, which is on the market.

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.460
 It's called nut shells.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:05.460
 And nut shells can withstand a bullet being fired at your groin.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.460
 I mean, who does those tests?

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:12.460
 I'm pretty sure that the inventor, who's called Robert, did do that.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.460
 And so the idea is it can be used for sports because if you're playing baseball

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:22.460
 and a fastball comes or a tennis serve comes or someone's frying a bullet at you at a...

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.460
 I mean, an incredibly well-aimed bullet.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.460
 Yes.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.460
 Yeah.

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.460
 But I mean, it's now...

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.460
 It's been picked up by the military.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.460
 The middle level of the size joke.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:31.460
 It's just a...

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.460
 LAUGHTER

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:39.460
 I need to be a pretty sharp shooter to hit you.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.460
 LAUGHTER

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.460
 Why does the military need that technology?

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.460
 It doesn't... it has bulletproof technology.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:47.460
 Yeah.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:49.460
 It doesn't need a different kind of bulletproof for your penis.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.460
 It's just the same kind of bulletproof.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.460
 You're right.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:56.460
 Surrounding the penis with 30 or 40 layers of toughened glass.

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.460
 I think Imelda Marcos had a bulletproof bra, didn't she?

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:00.460
 Did she?

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:01.460
 Did she?

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.460
 Yeah, made out of Kevlar.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:03.460
 Right.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:04.460
 She did.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.460
 Wow.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:09.460
 The jockstrap is, as you mentioned, it is from...

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.460
 It's from Jockey, but it was invented for Bicycle Jockeys.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.460
 So this was in the 1880s?

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.460
 I would have thought like American Jocs, like just a...

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:22.460
 No, the word Joc comes from Jocstrap.

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:29.460
 So it was invented for cyclists in Boston in the 1880s because they were called jockeys

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.460
 and they delivered stuff and they were cobbled streets.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.460
 And so it was quite painful to cycle over the cobbled streets.

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.460
 And so the jockstrap was invented for that.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.460
 And that's where the Joc comes from.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.460
 It's a sporty thing now.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.460
 But at the start it was invented to stop your balls bumping over cobbles.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.460
 Right.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.460
 Wow.

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.460
 Guys, we need to wrap up very shortly.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:49.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:53.460
 So the thing with bras is everyone thought they were invented about 100 years ago.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.460
 But they found some really old ones from the Middle Ages.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:02.460
 And they were found in a castle in Austria by a scientist

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.460
 or an archaeologist called Beatrix Nuts from the University of Innsbruck.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.460
 And she's found out basically the what happened was the bra came first

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.460
 and then the cost it took over and then the bra came back again.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.460
 Right.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:15.460
 Which no one believed until 2012 when she found this.

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.460
 Wow.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:20.460
 And at the same time they found what looks like a pair of panties

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.460
 is kind of like a gusset and just some kind of string going round.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:28.460
 But they turn out to be men's underwear because women didn't wear underwear at that time.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:34.460
 And according to Beatrix, underpants were considered a symbol of male dominance and power.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.460
 Oh, really?

00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:41.460
 Well, because even when women started wearing underpants in Victorian times they were crotchless.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.460
 And I read one historian said they were crotchless in order to distinguish them from men's underpants.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.460
 There must be another way.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.460
 In the short.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.460
 Oh, it's a man's underwear.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.460
 Name labels are the way.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.460
 Yeah.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.460
 Or, you know, the men's ones are the ones which constantly matter things like,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.460
 "You're doing fine, really."

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:08.460
 Okay, that's it.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.460
 That is all of our facts.

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:10.460
