00:00:17,00:00:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:20,00:00:22,to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:27,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:27,00:00:31,"and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:00:31,00:00:36,"four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting"
00:00:36,00:00:37,with you.
00:00:37,00:00:38,Andy.
00:00:38,00:00:44,"My fact is that sometimes racing ferrets fall asleep halfway along the course, so it's"
00:00:44,00:00:50,"a bit like the tortoise and the hare story, so that the hare is a ferret."
00:00:50,00:00:55,"The tortoise is another ferret that doesn't roll asleep, all the animals are ferrets."
00:00:55,00:00:56,"Yeah, and sometimes they fall asleep."
00:00:56,00:00:58,I've confused things too much by introducing them.
00:00:58,00:01:02,It's a bit like sleeping beauty on the years of sleeping ferret.
00:01:02,00:01:04,Was she halfway through a ride?
00:01:04,00:01:07,I miss that bit of the story.
00:01:07,00:01:08,Just the sleeping bit really.
00:01:08,00:01:09,Right.
00:01:09,00:01:12,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then a handsome prince turns up and kisses the ferret."
00:01:12,00:01:15,He's a ferret too.
00:01:15,00:01:17,This is an article from the Derby Telegraph who did a report.
00:01:17,00:01:22,"They've had a ferret race up in Derby recently, at a place called Long Eaton, and there's"
00:01:22,00:01:27,"no track what there is, is a tube, and every ferret has its own tube."
00:01:27,00:01:31,"Oh, I was going to say, not just one tube, but otherwise the person who goes in first will"
00:01:31,00:01:33,be the winner every time.
00:01:33,00:01:37,"And also, you could just fall asleep, and that's it, yeah."
00:01:37,00:01:41,That would be like having Bob sledding with just one of those courses and you'll go
00:01:41,00:01:42,at one.
00:01:42,00:01:43,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:01:43,00:01:46,That is not the case in this race.
00:01:46,00:01:47,No.
00:01:47,00:01:52,"Every ferret gets his or her own tube, and you race along it, and the coach has to encourage"
00:01:52,00:01:54,the ferret along to the other end.
00:01:54,00:01:58,"But sometimes a ferret can be winning, according to his spokesman, and then decide to lie down"
00:01:58,00:01:59,for a nap.
00:01:59,00:02:01,"So a race can take two minutes, or it can take ten minutes."
00:02:01,00:02:06,"This place in Long Eaton last year, they had a thing called ferret roulette."
00:02:06,00:02:08,Is it like Russian roulette?
00:02:08,00:02:09,Yeah.
00:02:09,00:02:10,The ferret's got a gun.
00:02:10,00:02:11,"Yeah, maybe."
00:02:11,00:02:12,"No, no, no."
00:02:12,00:02:16,You shoot a ferret into the side of your head.
00:02:16,00:02:17,"It's not like that, no?"
00:02:17,00:02:18,Okay.
00:02:18,00:02:22,Where you had to bet on which tube a ferret would go down.
00:02:22,00:02:27,"You could put on loads of different pairs of trousers, and one of them's got a ferret"
00:02:27,00:02:28,on it.
00:02:28,00:02:28,"Ah, that is ferret roulette."
00:02:28,00:02:29,Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:30,That's really good.
00:02:30,00:02:34,"I read, I think it was the same one, tickets were £12 each."
00:02:34,00:02:35,Is this the same one?
00:02:35,00:02:36,I didn't check it.
00:02:36,00:02:40,"I didn't check the ticket prices, but how many ferret racing events can there have been"
00:02:40,00:02:41,in Long Eaton recently?
00:02:41,00:02:45,"Yeah, probably a few."
00:02:45,00:02:49,"The tickets were £12 each, and they included a fish and chips supper."
00:02:49,00:02:50,"Oh, okay."
00:02:50,00:02:51,And it's very good.
00:02:51,00:02:52,And it's very good.
00:02:52,00:02:53,"I know, it's my local fish and chips shop."
00:02:53,00:02:59,"Fish chips and mushy peas is £9.80 on its own, so you're paying £2.20 for the ferrets,"
00:02:59,00:03:00,really?
00:03:00,00:03:01,That's very reasonably priced.
00:03:01,00:03:02,"Good, isn't it?"
00:03:02,00:03:03,"Yes, very good."
00:03:03,00:03:05,"They should really make the tube see through, I've just realised, because I was thinking"
00:03:05,00:03:08,"what you're really paying for was nothing, because you don't get to see any of it until"
00:03:08,00:03:09,the ferret pops out.
00:03:09,00:03:11,"Of course, the tube is see through."
00:03:11,00:03:12,"No, no, no, no."
00:03:12,00:03:13,"Yeah, no, Dan, it's not."
00:03:13,00:03:14,"Well, the one I watched."
00:03:14,00:03:19,"It's a solid, you've been watching the luxury ferret racing."
00:03:19,00:03:21,You've clearly paid a bit more than your 12 quid.
00:03:21,00:03:25,"No, there are sections of wire in the tube, so occasionally you see a ferret passing by."
00:03:25,00:03:26,Yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:28,That's more like a way marker than a...
00:03:28,00:03:29,"That, my one's way better."
00:03:29,00:03:31,You get to watch all the workings of the race.
00:03:31,00:03:32,Like a race.
00:03:32,00:03:37,Imagine if there was like a pool cover on the top of an Olympics movie pool.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"You're like, well, let's see who pops out of the head."
00:03:40,00:03:46,"Oh, they all drowned, shouldn't have put that cover on them."
00:03:46,00:03:50,"So if you guys heard about ferret legging, yeah, Scott, it's exciting."
00:03:50,00:03:51,The best thing in the world.
00:03:51,00:03:52,Yeah.
00:03:52,00:03:55,So that's why you put a ferret down your trousers and you see how long you can keep it.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"You tie up the end of your trousers, put a ferret down there."
00:03:58,00:04:02,"It's nice for the ferret, because it reminds it of hunting rabbits, I presume."
00:04:02,00:04:03,Yes.
00:04:03,00:04:04,"Well, what's it hunting in that case?"
00:04:04,00:04:09,What is it in your trousers that reminds the ferret of a banner?
00:04:09,00:04:17,"Oh, it's supposed to, you're not allowed to wear underwear in ferret legging."
00:04:17,00:04:18,Oh.
00:04:18,00:04:21,"You have to have your genitals exposed, I think, in some of it."
00:04:21,00:04:22,That's the expose.
00:04:22,00:04:23,That's the expose.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"To the ferret, to the ferret."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"To the ferret, yeah."
00:04:25,00:04:28,It's really definitely would have got that memo wrong and could arrive.
00:04:28,00:04:29,Balls out.
00:04:29,00:04:33,"But that's the only occasion where, actually, you can claim you're exposing yourself"
00:04:33,00:04:37,"for a very good reason, which is to protect your genitals from the ferret."
00:04:37,00:04:38,That's true.
00:04:38,00:04:39,"I'm repeating, though."
00:04:39,00:04:40,Officer.
00:04:40,00:04:44,"I think that this might have been enlist, first, actually, that one of the biggest names"
00:04:44,00:04:47,in ferret legging is Regimella.
00:04:47,00:04:51,And he introduced the concept of wearing white trousers to better display the blood spilled
00:04:51,00:04:52,from the bites.
00:04:52,00:04:53,Oh.
00:04:53,00:04:56,"In 1972, the ferret legging records stood at 40 seconds, right?"
00:04:56,00:05:01,"A few years later, it rose to over one minute and eventually to 90 minutes, which is quite"
00:05:01,00:05:02,a leap.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"Yeah, that's."
00:05:03,00:05:07,"And then, in 1977, Edward Simpkins, from the Isle of Whites, set the new world record"
00:05:07,00:05:11,"of 5,000-10 minutes, although he only had one ferret in his trousers during the first four"
00:05:11,00:05:14,hours and two for the last 70 minutes.
00:05:14,00:05:18,"Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued to play"
00:05:18,00:05:20,a game of darts undeterred.
00:05:20,00:05:21,Wow.
00:05:21,00:05:22,What a hero.
00:05:22,00:05:23,How did he do in the darts?
00:05:23,00:05:24,Did he do it?
00:05:24,00:05:25,It doesn't relate.
00:05:25,00:05:34,He actually won the BDO World Championships that year.
00:05:34,00:05:39,"Now, Pete Jockey Wilson in the final."
00:05:39,00:05:43,But that's only because he trained the ferret to carry the dart over to the dart board.
00:05:43,00:05:50,"Apparently, what you're meant to do when you do ferret legging is to feed your ferret"
00:05:50,00:05:55,"a lot, so you don't put a hungry ferret down your trousers, which is what leads to a lot"
00:05:55,00:05:59,"of the bites, is because four hours in, they might get a bit hungry and start nibbling"
00:05:59,00:06:00,on you.
00:06:00,00:06:05,"You really feed your ferret, you should survive a bite, yeah."
00:06:05,00:06:06,It's interesting because ferret is.
00:06:06,00:06:10,"I had a look in a slang dictionary, the partridge dictionary of slang, ferret is slang"
00:06:10,00:06:18,"for penis, and it's also an RS slang term, which is rhyming slang for beret."
00:06:18,00:06:19,It's not very good rhyming slang.
00:06:19,00:06:25,"It says in the dictionary, ""Brecker's deliberately bad""."
00:06:25,00:06:28,"I think you can tell by the turn of voice in which someone says, ""I've got a ferret"
00:06:28,00:06:31,"in my trousers, what kind of ferret they're talking about."""
00:06:31,00:06:32,You think so?
00:06:32,00:06:34,"I think it was always like, ""I've got a ferret in my trousers!"""
00:06:34,00:06:38,That's a penis.
00:06:38,00:06:42,"Their band is Pat's, aren't they, in certain places, so New York, New York."
00:06:42,00:06:43,Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:45,I wasn't allowed to bring money in.
00:06:45,00:06:50,Do you know which area of Britain owns the most ferrets?
00:06:50,00:06:51,London.
00:06:51,00:06:52,"Pretty much, yeah."
00:06:52,00:06:54,London and the Southeast.
00:06:54,00:07:01,"It's traditionally thought to be a Northern or especially a Yorkshire thing, but 27% of"
00:07:01,00:07:05,the ferrets in the UK live in London and the Southeast.
00:07:05,00:07:08,Yorkshire only has 7% of the ferrets.
00:07:08,00:07:09,No.
00:07:09,00:07:12,Are they domesticated or do we have wild ferret?
00:07:12,00:07:13,"This is I was Pat's, I think."
00:07:13,00:07:14,"Yeah, these are his pets."
00:07:14,00:07:15,Right.
00:07:15,00:07:18,I have seen someone near where I live walking around a ferret on a leash.
00:07:18,00:07:19,I was so excited.
00:07:19,00:07:20,I've seen that before.
00:07:20,00:07:21,Yeah.
00:07:21,00:07:22,You can get little harnesses for them.
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Pat ferret.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Did he?
00:07:25,00:07:27,John Mitchinson of QI.
00:07:27,00:07:28,"Wow, that's cool."
00:07:28,00:07:29,I met him.
00:07:29,00:07:31,We've had four men shot on a ferret.
00:07:31,00:07:34,They're the meetings with him for years.
00:07:34,00:07:36,He had big paws and whiskers.
00:07:36,00:07:37,"Yeah, that's good."
00:07:37,00:07:38,Yeah.
00:07:38,00:07:39,Pretty much.
00:07:39,00:07:40,That's him.
00:07:40,00:07:42,"Cosden, you're trying to get into your trousers."
00:07:42,00:07:43,Good old Mitch.
00:07:43,00:07:47,"So they're, they've really vicious, right?"
00:07:47,00:07:51,Animals in this kind of group like weasels and stokes and ferrets are.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Stella die.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"Yeah, a mastella die."
00:07:54,00:07:57,They're so voracious and such good hunters.
00:07:57,00:08:01,So there was that David Atmerclip of a stoke that caught a rabbit that was 10 times its size
00:08:01,00:08:05,and the way they do it is they wrap their bodies around the animal they're trying to catch
00:08:05,00:08:08,so they're like a little snake and then they bite it always exactly between the skull
00:08:08,00:08:09,and the spine.
00:08:09,00:08:11,So it cuts that off.
00:08:11,00:08:14,"But yeah, they're really good hunters and one of the ways they hunt is by doing the,"
00:08:14,00:08:18,I think it's called the Weasel war dance and it's where they just flip their body around
00:08:18,00:08:20,in insane kind of configuration.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"They can hypnotise a chicken, can't they?"
00:08:23,00:08:29,The idea is that they transfix their prey and their prey so distracted that they get slightly
00:08:29,00:08:31,different to hypnotising a chicken.
00:08:31,00:08:36,"Is it if they've just, you know, this is what the All Blacks rugby team do before every"
00:08:36,00:08:37,game.
00:08:37,00:08:38,Hypnotised chicken.
00:08:38,00:08:43,That's their war dance is they hypnotise the England team into being completely hypnotising
00:08:43,00:08:45,a rugby.
00:08:45,00:08:49,"Have you heard of the vigilante group, the 12 just men?"
00:08:49,00:08:50,No.
00:08:50,00:08:52,They were in a Welsh market town called Newtown.
00:08:52,00:08:57,"There was a report about them in the independent in 1992 and what they did, they thought that"
00:08:57,00:09:01,"the local punishments dished out to criminals, you know, like for vandalising and burglary"
00:09:01,00:09:04,and things like that were really pathetic and weak and that the police weren't doing
00:09:04,00:09:05,anything.
00:09:05,00:09:10,So they formed this vigilante group and they would find out about crimes and then they
00:09:10,00:09:15,"would, their spokesman said, ""Our plan for keeping law and order is simple."
00:09:15,00:09:19,Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime will frog march off to the hills where
00:09:19,00:09:24,"there's nobody to hear the screams, will hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers."""
00:09:24,00:09:26,They had a ferret called Fred.
00:09:26,00:09:30,What do you mean by ferret?
00:09:30,00:09:33,"It will be painful and terrifying, but it will teach him a lesson he won't forget in"
00:09:33,00:09:34,a hurry.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"Do you know, was a weasel's make their own fridges?"
00:09:38,00:09:39,Basically have their own fridge set up.
00:09:39,00:09:40,They do.
00:09:40,00:09:41,They do.
00:09:41,00:09:42,They do.
00:09:42,00:09:47,"They marzen electricity and they've made, no, they store food underground and they dig underground"
00:09:47,00:09:49,compartments near their den entrances.
00:09:49,00:09:50,I don't see any.
00:09:50,00:09:51,"No, I see any."
00:09:51,00:09:54,They have they've mastered the art of fridges.
00:09:54,00:10:00,"I would say they are somewhere along with the art of fridges, but mastery is a way off."
00:10:00,00:10:01,And let me finish.
00:10:01,00:10:05,They plug it into the main.
00:10:05,00:10:06,"No, fine."
00:10:06,00:10:10,They dig holes underground because they'll sometimes go on a big killing spree and then
00:10:10,00:10:14,"very, most of their prey underground where it's nice and cold so it gets preserved."
00:10:14,00:10:16,But they can store huge numbers of things in there.
00:10:16,00:10:21,So scientists once found a stash in Greenland that was stuffed with the carcasses of 150
00:10:21,00:10:23,lemmings.
00:10:23,00:10:24,Lemmings.
00:10:24,00:10:25,"Yeah, lemmings."
00:10:25,00:10:28,It's a weasel serial killer who needs to be brought to justice immediately.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Hang on.
00:10:29,00:10:32,"Am I thinking, lemmings like the size of a sheep, right?"
00:10:32,00:10:33,No.
00:10:33,00:10:34,"No, no, no."
00:10:34,00:10:35,"No, no, no."
00:10:35,00:10:36,"No, no, no."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"No, no, no."
00:10:37,00:10:38,"No, no, no."
00:10:38,00:10:39,Like a giddy pig.
00:10:39,00:10:40,What are you thinking of?
00:10:40,00:10:42,"I thought it was just this cave of dead sheep, 150 of them."
00:10:42,00:10:43,What are you thinking of?
00:10:43,00:10:44,Lemmings.
00:10:44,00:10:47,"You can't run off the cliff that Disney, no."
00:10:47,00:10:49,"But that's the myth, right?"
00:10:49,00:10:50,"Yeah, exactly the truth."
00:10:50,00:10:53,"What, so the trope is like a hundred giddy pig size things ran off a cliff."
00:10:53,00:10:54,That's cool.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"I mean, yeah."
00:10:55,00:10:56,That was big.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"In my head, they were sheep size."
00:10:57,00:10:58,Yeah.
00:10:58,00:10:59,"Okay, I mean, we're all learning."
00:10:59,00:11:00,So this is great.
00:11:00,00:11:01,You've learned about ferret fridges.
00:11:01,00:11:05,I've learned about the size of an animal that everyone knows.
00:11:05,00:11:08,Can I just tell you one thing about a different kind of animal racing?
00:11:08,00:11:09,Yeah.
00:11:09,00:11:14,So I think the equivalent of ferret racing in the US is frog jumping contest.
00:11:14,00:11:17,And this is based on a Mark Twain story.
00:11:17,00:11:19,I think it was the story of the first story that made Mark Twain famous that he wrote in
00:11:19,00:11:25,"the 1860s, about a fictional frog jumping contest in a counting California, which now happens"
00:11:25,00:11:26,every year.
00:11:26,00:11:30,"And they attract up to 10,000 people, I think."
00:11:30,00:11:35,"Lots of people go and attend, and you can do stuff like blow on the frog's nether regions."
00:11:35,00:11:38,And that kind of makes the job a bit harder.
00:11:38,00:11:41,Or is that included in the 12-12-year issue?
00:11:41,00:11:42,It's included in the NPV.
00:11:42,00:11:46,"So as fish and ships, do you want to blow up the anus of the frog?"
00:11:46,00:11:49,"It's included, so."
00:11:49,00:11:54,"When it's a frog jumping competition, is it height, distance, speed, or what?"
00:11:54,00:11:57,"I'm pretty sure it's distance, and I think they do three."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"They're allowed to do three jumps, and then they measure how far they've gone in three jumps."
00:12:01,00:12:03,It's like the hot pop and the hot pop.
00:12:03,00:12:05,"Oh, exactly."
00:12:05,00:12:07,But they have to be played soothing music.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"So in the rules of this play, they don't, they like it."
00:12:10,00:12:11,They like it.
00:12:11,00:12:12,They prefer it.
00:12:12,00:12:16,They like it if it is soothing music when you're blowing on a channel.
00:12:16,00:12:17,It's a romantic scene.
00:12:17,00:12:21,"If you think about it, no, there are actually rules, say, when the frogs aren't working,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,they have to be kept on the ground.
00:12:23,00:12:27,They have to be kept in a fridge.
00:12:27,00:12:30,With a massive lemon.
00:12:30,00:12:36,"They have to be kept in the dark, in the cool, and be played soothing music to calm their nerves."
00:12:36,00:12:37,Yeah.
00:12:37,00:12:39,It sounds like the frogs get a pretty good deal out of this.
00:12:39,00:12:40,Yeah.
00:12:40,00:12:41,You get to go to a nice competition.
00:12:41,00:12:47,"You get your own green room, and then you get someone blowing on your genitals."
00:12:47,00:12:51,I know what your ride is going to be on the next floor.
00:12:51,00:12:57,"God, hair dryer is in the dressing room, Mr. Murray."
00:12:57,00:13:00,"Can I, I really want to ask people something that I have to have a mystery."
00:13:00,00:13:03,"This is basically the reason I brought frogs, right, it was because I went to the countryside"
00:13:03,00:13:07,this weekend and I went on a walk and noticed a dead frog on the path I was on.
00:13:07,00:13:08,Okay.
00:13:08,00:13:11,"And then another one, and then I was with this other person,"
00:13:11,00:13:16,"and we counted the dead frogs, and in a space of about half a kilometer, we counted 59 dead frogs."
00:13:16,00:13:17,Okay.
00:13:17,00:13:18,And not all of them squash.
00:13:18,00:13:19,They were all black.
00:13:19,00:13:23,"They looked like they'd just been frozen in time, kind of black frogs."
00:13:23,00:13:24,And I don't know why.
00:13:24,00:13:27,And I've tried looking up why there would suddenly be 59 dead frogs in the countryside of
00:13:27,00:13:28,Oxfordshire.
00:13:28,00:13:29,Yeah.
00:13:29,00:13:30,And if anyone has any idea.
00:13:30,00:13:33,What about if it was one of those supposedly things when it rains frogs?
00:13:33,00:13:36,So if anyone has a better suggestion?
00:13:36,00:13:41,"Okay, so there is this idea that sometimes it rains frogs, right?"
00:13:41,00:13:46,And the idea is that a water spout is created by like a mini tornado and it sucks it up into
00:13:46,00:13:49,"the air, and then they rain down."
00:13:49,00:13:55,"Now a lot of people think that they're not real, but what happens instead is it's been raining,"
00:13:55,00:13:56,pond kind of overflows.
00:13:56,00:14:00,"All of the frogs kind of go into the overflow bit of the pond, and then it dries up because"
00:14:00,00:14:05,"it gets evaporated, and then they all have no water, so they all die."
00:14:05,00:14:06,Okay.
00:14:06,00:14:07,Can I get that one?
00:14:07,00:14:08,Yeah.
00:14:08,00:14:09,Was it near water?
00:14:09,00:14:10,We looked for water.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"We think it must have been near water, because the dog disappeared and it came back wet."
00:14:12,00:14:13,Yes.
00:14:13,00:14:14,So it was wet.
00:14:14,00:14:15,We've been in a garage.
00:14:15,00:14:17,It's the sixtieth frog in its house.
00:14:17,00:14:18,I love that.
00:14:18,00:14:25,That's your method of divining for water is the dog wet.
00:14:25,00:14:33,And we must keep moving then.
00:14:33,00:14:38,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:38,00:14:44,"Okay, my fat this week is that according to Venezuelan law, 90% of wheat must be made"
00:14:44,00:14:47,into loaves of bread rather than cakes or pastries.
00:14:47,00:14:48,Mm-hmm.
00:14:48,00:14:49,It's very harsh.
00:14:49,00:14:50,Why?
00:14:50,00:14:54,"Well, this is what they're calling the bread war in Venezuelan at the moment, and they're"
00:14:54,00:14:57,obviously having a lot of financial problems.
00:14:57,00:15:03,And what the government don't want bakers to do is to waste flour on cakes and things
00:15:03,00:15:04,like that.
00:15:04,00:15:07,They want to make sure that they have enough bread for all of the people.
00:15:07,00:15:09,"And they're probably arresting people, aren't they?"
00:15:09,00:15:10,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:10,00:15:13,"Like for making brownies and stuff like that as well, it's not just, yeah."
00:15:13,00:15:14,Really?
00:15:14,00:15:15,Yeah.
00:15:15,00:15:19,"But this is like the history really of how important bakers have been, you know, all"
00:15:19,00:15:25,"the way through history, bakers have been one of the most important people in society."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"If they do anything wrong, they'll get punished a lot more than normal people."
00:15:29,00:15:33,It seemed like such a high-risk job looking into history and sort of recorded statements
00:15:33,00:15:38,"about if you mess with the weight of your bread, if you mess sell your bread, you will be"
00:15:38,00:15:39,killed.
00:15:39,00:15:40,Like that.
00:15:40,00:15:43,It was as harsh as you'll be killed or you'll be paraded through the towns.
00:15:43,00:15:44,Get this.
00:15:44,00:15:48,"There was a thing where it's so in France, if you were found guilty of swindling customers,"
00:15:48,00:15:53,"you would be imprisoned immediately and your shop would be walled up for two years,"
00:15:53,00:15:54,which is pretty serious.
00:15:54,00:15:59,Or sometimes they would have all your crimes printed on a massive sheet of paper and they
00:15:59,00:16:02,would make you wear a sandwich board through the streets.
00:16:02,00:16:03,"Oh, really?"
00:16:03,00:16:04,"Yeah, it's quite cool."
00:16:04,00:16:05,So sandwich board.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"Exactly, yeah."
00:16:06,00:16:08,I don't think I'd call it a sandwich board at the time.
00:16:08,00:16:11,And sometimes this is from a book about the history of it.
00:16:11,00:16:15,"The police just looked the other way and let angry customers, often women, beat the"
00:16:15,00:16:16,bakers up.
00:16:16,00:16:17,Oh.
00:16:17,00:16:18,Yeah.
00:16:18,00:16:19,No way.
00:16:19,00:16:24,There was a law in Britain until 2008 that you couldn't sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.
00:16:24,00:16:25,Right.
00:16:25,00:16:31,"The law was that you had to sell it in 400 grams or 800 grams or 1,200 grams, it had to be"
00:16:31,00:16:32,a multiple of 400.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Really?
00:16:33,00:16:37,That was a law that was from the size of bread and ale in 1266.
00:16:37,00:16:38,Wow.
00:16:38,00:16:44,And it was still going into 2008 when they made it legal to sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.
00:16:44,00:16:46,"But I think most loaves are still 400 or 800 grams, aren't they?"
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:48,Yeah.
00:16:48,00:16:49,So even now it's still happening.
00:16:49,00:16:52,"Well, yeah, that's just a leftover from the olden days."
00:16:52,00:16:53,Yeah.
00:16:53,00:16:55,And the myth that this is where bakers doesn't come from.
00:16:55,00:16:59,So it's the idea is that because bakers were so afraid of being punished for underselling
00:16:59,00:17:04,"to customers, they would always give them a little bit more than they'd ordered, wasn't"
00:17:04,00:17:05,it?
00:17:05,00:17:06,I don't know.
00:17:06,00:17:07,"Yeah, stopped."
00:17:07,00:17:09,"And I think that's, I think it's been written in various places that that's where bakers"
00:17:09,00:17:10,doesn't come from.
00:17:10,00:17:13,I've never seen anyone asserting that it was a myth.
00:17:13,00:17:14,OK.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"And it's the kind of thing that I would have seen, I think."
00:17:16,00:17:17,So I think it maybe is true.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Yeah.
00:17:18,00:17:19,I don't know.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Right.
00:17:20,00:17:23,"So that, then, keep it to yourself."
00:17:23,00:17:30,"There was a paranoia in the 18th century that bakers would steal human bones and ashes, and"
00:17:30,00:17:32,they would use the bone ash to increase the weight of their flour.
00:17:32,00:17:33,This is not true.
00:17:33,00:17:37,"There's no evidence it ever happened, but people really hated bakers."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"And as a result, well, not as a result, but just in general, bakers had to carve their"
00:17:40,00:17:44,initials into the underside of every loaf of bread they made.
00:17:44,00:17:45,Really?
00:17:45,00:17:46,Yeah.
00:17:46,00:17:48,To sort of show this was made by Fred the Baker and it's the--
00:17:48,00:17:49,F2B.
00:17:49,00:17:50,F2B.
00:17:50,00:17:51,Yeah.
00:17:51,00:17:52,It's the appropriate weight.
00:17:52,00:17:58,"So in 2009, Venezuela banned video games where you shoot people."
00:17:58,00:17:59,Did they?
00:17:59,00:18:03,"Yeah, because there was so much shooting going on that they thought that this is just not"
00:18:03,00:18:04,a good influence.
00:18:04,00:18:07,So they actually took a stand and completely banned it.
00:18:07,00:18:10,"But anyway, one other thing that they almost banned quite recently, it's because they went"
00:18:10,00:18:13,through an energy crisis.
00:18:13,00:18:18,The president did come out and say he urged all women to stop using hair dryers because
00:18:18,00:18:20,that was using up too much energy.
00:18:20,00:18:24,He thought hair dryers specifically were causing huge shortages.
00:18:24,00:18:30,What people using them to blow on the genitals of frogs and jumping competitions?
00:18:30,00:18:34,"He said, I think a woman-- this was his justification for why they should stop."
00:18:34,00:18:39,I think a woman looks better when she runs her fingers through her hair and lets it dry naturally.
00:18:39,00:18:42,"But yeah, they tried to stop hair dryers in Venezuela as well."
00:18:42,00:18:44,Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Does it really?
00:18:45,00:18:46,Yeah.
00:18:46,00:18:47,"Oh, wow."
00:18:47,00:18:49,South of Arabia in 2010.
00:18:49,00:18:51,That's amazing.
00:18:51,00:18:58,The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel
00:18:58,00:19:02,of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Wow.
00:19:03,00:19:04,There's oil stuff.
00:19:04,00:19:05,It's great.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Can you send another million barrels?
00:19:06,00:19:07,"No, please."
00:19:07,00:19:12,Our gouts got really bad.
00:19:12,00:19:18,The first bread maker was horse-powered that I could find.
00:19:18,00:19:21,The baker was horse-powered?
00:19:21,00:19:22,No.
00:19:22,00:19:23,It's a dough mixer.
00:19:23,00:19:27,It's a mechanical dough mixer that was referenced in 150 BC.
00:19:27,00:19:32,It was invented actually by a freed slave and it was this massive basin and it had wooden
00:19:32,00:19:36,paddles in it that would mix the dough around and horses were attached to them so they'd
00:19:36,00:19:38,just go round and round and mix up the dough.
00:19:38,00:19:39,Wow.
00:19:39,00:19:40,Quite cool.
00:19:40,00:19:41,First bread was horse-drawn.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Yeah.
00:19:42,00:19:43,Just one more thing about Venezuela.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Yeah.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Do you know what it means?
00:19:45,00:19:46,"The name, Venezuela."
00:19:46,00:19:47,Oh.
00:19:47,00:19:48,It means little Venice.
00:19:48,00:19:49,"Oh, I did know that."
00:19:49,00:19:52,It's quite of the fact that this is almost completely unlike the North London area known as
00:19:52,00:19:53,little Venice.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"It's not even like Venice either, really."
00:19:56,00:20:01,"No, but they will have named it when they arrived at the Gulf of Marrakayba or whatever it's"
00:20:01,00:20:02,called.
00:20:02,00:20:03,Yeah.
00:20:03,00:20:04,Exactly.
00:20:04,00:20:05,"Lake Marrakayba, yeah."
00:20:05,00:20:06,It wasn't just thought there's water here.
00:20:06,00:20:07,There's water in Venice.
00:20:07,00:20:08,It's the dog's wet.
00:20:08,00:20:12,That's exactly what I know.
00:20:12,00:20:16,"It was a Marigo Vespucci, who is a American named after him or do we think it's not?"
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Well, QI thinks it's not."
00:20:18,00:20:19,I think it is.
00:20:19,00:20:20,I think it is as well.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Okay.
00:20:21,00:20:24,"But when he got there, whatever the rights and wrongs of that particular story, he saw"
00:20:24,00:20:29,indigenous stilt houses which were designed to avoid floods and a guy in a gondola.
00:20:29,00:20:30,Yeah.
00:20:30,00:20:31,And a cornetto.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Is that what they have?
00:20:32,00:20:33,Yeah.
00:20:33,00:20:35,So he said this is just like Venice.
00:20:35,00:20:46,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski."
00:20:46,00:20:51,My fact this week is that GCHQ has an internal ghost hunting club.
00:20:51,00:20:52,So cool.
00:20:52,00:20:55,This is internal ghost hunting.
00:20:55,00:20:57,It's not looking for internal ghosts.
00:20:57,00:20:58,Find your inner ghost.
00:20:58,00:21:02,"Wait, is it that they're the first group of spooks to be found looking for ghosts?"
00:21:02,00:21:03,Oh.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"No, it's not that neat."
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Right, got it."
00:21:07,00:21:08,Cool.
00:21:08,00:21:10,So this came out a couple of years ago.
00:21:10,00:21:11,It's come out in 2013 actually.
00:21:11,00:21:17,"It was the WikiLeaks leak of lots of GCHQ correspondence, a lot of which was very important."
00:21:17,00:21:21,"And then there was this, which was just an exchange of emails that confirmed it's got a ghost"
00:21:21,00:21:25,hunting group and it arranges trips to kind of haunted houses.
00:21:25,00:21:30,It's advertised to staff and partners whether they're skeptics or believers.
00:21:30,00:21:35,"And yes, for visits to reputedly haunted properties, how they spend this bird time."
00:21:35,00:21:41,"Yeah, so that was a part of a Edward Snowden leak, that was the big Edward Snowden leak."
00:21:41,00:21:46,"And it was that, it was one bit of it, wasn't it, where it kind of showed the inside social"
00:21:46,00:21:52,"life of the people who work at GCHQ, because it goes beyond just having a ghost hunting club."
00:21:52,00:21:56,It would be weird if that was the only social life I've ever had.
00:21:56,00:22:03,"Look at the noticeboards, there's only one that is covered in exoplanes."
00:22:03,00:22:11,"But yeah, apparently they have their own in sort of internal social media platform, which"
00:22:11,00:22:14,"is called a pun on my space, spy space."
00:22:14,00:22:19,"It's good that you clarified what that was a pun, otherwise we wouldn't have got it."
00:22:19,00:22:27,"They should call it Facebook, what's that parody pun?"
00:22:27,00:22:33,So they have a good social secretary in GCHQ and it sounds like they have a really fun time.
00:22:33,00:22:37,So there was another bit of correspondence that was leaked about the football tournament.
00:22:37,00:22:41,They have a sports day every year and the main event is a football tournament in which
00:22:41,00:22:45,every team has to have one lady player at all times.
00:22:45,00:22:49,So I thought saying lady player sounds like a weirdly old fashioned term.
00:22:49,00:22:52,It also sounds like a bloke who sleeps around.
00:22:52,00:22:55,I guess I'm a bit of a lady player.
00:22:55,00:22:58,"Yeah, maybe that's what it was asking for."
00:22:58,00:23:04,"It was amazing though, the football tournament they had in which that rule was issued came"
00:23:04,00:23:06,with a six-page rule book.
00:23:06,00:23:11,It said the wearing of shimpads is caps lock on compulsory caps lock off.
00:23:11,00:23:14,There were a lot of capsules in the correspondence and it made me think they're a bit trumpy in
00:23:14,00:23:16,the way they communicate in GCHQ.
00:23:16,00:23:17,They need to chill out a little bit.
00:23:17,00:23:22,Do you think maybe GCHQ learned the art of shouting in capitals from Trump when they were
00:23:22,00:23:23,whitesapping him?
00:23:23,00:23:25,"Oh yeah, good boy."
00:23:25,00:23:30,"And if you're listening, guys, and we know you are naughty, you can't believe you're whitesapping"
00:23:30,00:23:31,Trump.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"I think it's been from there from the beginning because if you look at it, you'll notice"
00:23:33,00:23:38,GCHQ is written completely in capitals for every single time.
00:23:38,00:23:41,So they sometimes do think little things to engage with the public.
00:23:41,00:23:45,"Obviously, they're very, very secretive, but they had this Christmas card puzzle last year,"
00:23:45,00:23:46,which you may remember.
00:23:46,00:23:47,Yes.
00:23:47,00:23:52,"So 600,000 people tried at least the opening stage, which is amazing, that's 1% of everyone"
00:23:52,00:23:53,in the country.
00:23:53,00:23:56,Nobody got it in the time allocated.
00:23:56,00:24:00,Three people got close and they each won a paperweight.
00:24:00,00:24:01,Right.
00:24:01,00:24:03,What was the actual prize if you got it all?
00:24:03,00:24:04,I don't know.
00:24:04,00:24:05,You became a spy.
00:24:05,00:24:06,"I believe so, yeah."
00:24:06,00:24:09,Do you reckon they tell us if the person got it and was become a spy?
00:24:09,00:24:10,That's a good point.
00:24:10,00:24:12,There's a picture on the front cover of a newspaper.
00:24:12,00:24:13,Maybe hundreds of people got it.
00:24:13,00:24:14,They all become spies.
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Yeah, you're right."
00:24:15,00:24:22,"That is, I just can't believe that if you're in the top three of 600,000 people, they're just"
00:24:22,00:24:24,giving you one paperweight.
00:24:24,00:24:25,That must be a code for something.
00:24:25,00:24:26,"Yeah, exactly."
00:24:26,00:24:29,It must be an extra bit of puzzle.
00:24:29,00:24:31,"On the bottom of the paperweight, it says Midnight Tower Bridge."
00:24:31,00:24:32,Yes.
00:24:32,00:24:35,Leave your family behind.
00:24:35,00:24:38,We're going ghost hunting.
00:24:38,00:24:42,I went on the GCHQ website and they have some FAQs there.
00:24:42,00:24:43,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:43,00:24:45,FAQ.
00:24:45,00:24:49,Does GCHQ have rabbits running around the garden in the middle of the building?
00:24:49,00:24:50,What?
00:24:50,00:24:52,"Answer, sadly no."
00:24:52,00:24:53,We don't have rabbits in our garden.
00:24:53,00:24:58,"The only wildlife we have here are ladybirds, burrows and pigeons."
00:24:58,00:24:59,Why would they...
00:24:59,00:25:04,I think they're ducking the big questions about their role in working with the NSA.
00:25:04,00:25:07,You might be right about that or I might have deliberately chosen the most reasonable
00:25:07,00:25:08,of all the questions.
00:25:08,00:25:11,"Oh, maybe it's a bit of both."
00:25:11,00:25:13,Do they have any moles?
00:25:13,00:25:14,Very good.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Yes, very good."
00:25:15,00:25:16,Very good.
00:25:16,00:25:17,"Well, there is a question."
00:25:17,00:25:22,Do you have a network of underground tunnels beneath Cheltenham so staff can move around
00:25:22,00:25:24,the town without getting stuck in traffic?
00:25:24,00:25:25,Yes.
00:25:25,00:25:30,And have all their ferret racing tournaments in privacy.
00:25:30,00:25:35,"It sounds like Midnight was a ferret asking about the rabbits, actually."
00:25:35,00:25:41,Maybe FAQs is ferret asking questions.
00:25:41,00:25:42,What is the...
00:25:42,00:25:49,So I know that GCHQ is involved in code cracking and deciphering and stuff.
00:25:49,00:25:52,Are they the sort of digital security for the UK?
00:25:52,00:25:54,"It's eavesdropping, basically."
00:25:54,00:25:56,I think it's essentially our eavesdropping agency.
00:25:56,00:26:00,"So it's tapping into people's phones, it's hacking into people's computers, that kind of thing."
00:26:00,00:26:04,"But predominantly office-based, as opposed to in the field."
00:26:04,00:26:08,"Yes, so I actually read an interview with a woman called Annie MacMahon."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce her name, but she worked at MI5."
00:26:11,00:26:15,"And she was describing the difference between MI5, MI6 and GCHQ staff."
00:26:15,00:26:19,"And she said, GCHQ staff tend to be the boffins, the types that are technically brilliant"
00:26:19,00:26:23,"at things like coding and encryption, but perhaps not brilliant at a party."
00:26:23,00:26:24,Okay.
00:26:24,00:26:25,That's their vibe.
00:26:25,00:26:33,"Another Edward Snowden leak was, it was a list of GCHQ techniques and their code names."
00:26:33,00:26:34,Yeah.
00:26:34,00:26:37,"And then if you saw that, some quite good names."
00:26:37,00:26:43,"The ones which the newspaper article picked up on were concrete donkey, angry pirate and"
00:26:43,00:26:45,swamp donkey.
00:26:45,00:26:53,"And then a few others that I found, not allergy, country file, dirty devil, clumsy beekeeper and"
00:26:53,00:26:54,pistrix.
00:26:54,00:26:55,Wow.
00:26:55,00:26:59,Is that the Donald Trump related?
00:26:59,00:27:02,Hacking wiretapping operation.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"They were all so technical, I couldn't really understand what they meant."
00:27:05,00:27:06,Okay.
00:27:06,00:27:10,"I met a, years ago, I made a UFO documentary, remember that?"
00:27:10,00:27:15,"I can 2014 and I went around meeting a lot of people who both believe in UFOs, but I met"
00:27:15,00:27:22,"one guy as well called Mark Pilkington, who made a documentary about the idea that governments"
00:27:22,00:27:28,are seeding disinformation into the field of ufology and things generally.
00:27:28,00:27:32,So they're kind of creating distractions.
00:27:32,00:27:38,And part of the leaks from the Snowden leak was a PowerPoint that showed members who
00:27:38,00:27:42,worked with GCHQ how to spread disinformation.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"It was a whole thing, really interesting."
00:27:44,00:27:49,So do we think this whole ghost-tunting malarkey is just a bit of a red herring to throw
00:27:49,00:27:52,us off the center of the fact that they're hacking into all of our secret information?
00:27:52,00:27:56,"Maybe they're going, oh, I believe that the Russian Embassy is haunted."
00:27:56,00:27:59,That's good to see if we can find some ghosts.
00:27:59,00:28:04,"Oh, I think your laptop is haunted, isn't it, even though?"
00:28:04,00:28:09,"Look, the mouse is moving all by itself."
00:28:09,00:28:14,"So outside the front of GCHQ, there were these things called the listening stones."
00:28:14,00:28:15,Have you guys heard of this?
00:28:15,00:28:16,An artist created them.
00:28:16,00:28:20,"There's these giant, there's nine of these stones and they're carved with codes and some"
00:28:20,00:28:23,of them have just odd headlines.
00:28:23,00:28:30,"So the theory is that the stones are using a very old theory about what ghosts were, which"
00:28:30,00:28:32,is have you heard of the Stone Tape theory?
00:28:32,00:28:33,No.
00:28:33,00:28:40,"Stone Tape theory, this was put out in the 1960s, I believe."
00:28:40,00:28:45,"The idea is that this person thought that when you exude energy, energy can latch onto"
00:28:45,00:28:46,things in life.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"And so the idea is that ghosts are merely a sort of audio recording, as it were, not the"
00:28:51,00:28:56,"spirit of someone that's hanging around as dead, but it's sort of left over energy."
00:28:56,00:29:00,"If you're getting murdered, you exude a lot of energy and it traps it there."
00:29:00,00:29:06,And so the idea is that the listening stones are there to trap human conversations that
00:29:06,00:29:07,they can later listen to.
00:29:07,00:29:14,If GCHQ is spending all of our taxpayers money just eavesdropping on these stones outside
00:29:14,00:29:17,"the building, you'd be very disappointed, is that what they're doing?"
00:29:17,00:29:21,They think that dead people have trapped their voices inside these stones and that's
00:29:21,00:29:23,how they're trying to voice it out.
00:29:23,00:29:28,"The blog society ex believes so, as you go back to doing their proper job, tapping Donald"
00:29:28,00:29:32,Trump's emails for Barack Obama.
00:29:32,00:29:41,"OK, it's time for a final fact of the show."
00:29:41,00:29:42,And that is my fact.
00:29:42,00:29:48,My fact this week is that there are now washing machines in India that have a button specifically
00:29:48,00:29:49,for curry stains.
00:29:49,00:29:52,Is it really a button just says curry?
00:29:52,00:29:53,Yeah.
00:29:53,00:29:56,"Well, I saw a picture on the BBC website and I don't know if they mocked it up as a sort"
00:29:56,00:30:01,"of joke picture, but there's one extra button which is a setting."
00:30:01,00:30:02,"Obviously, this is a panasonic."
00:30:02,00:30:06,"It's a digital interface kind of thing, but it says curry."
00:30:06,00:30:08,And then it says oil as well.
00:30:08,00:30:09,There is one.
00:30:09,00:30:11,It's an extra setting for hair oil.
00:30:11,00:30:12,Yes.
00:30:12,00:30:13,Yeah.
00:30:13,00:30:16,"So basically, what they've, what they've realised is obviously the main staple of food"
00:30:16,00:30:22,in India is curry and the way that it breaks down in a washing machine isn't that good.
00:30:22,00:30:25,"Predominantly, that's the main stain that you're getting as well."
00:30:25,00:30:26,So they wanted to deal with that.
00:30:26,00:30:31,So panasonic have spent two years analysing the ingredients of curry.
00:30:31,00:30:33,They've been studying water temperatures and so on.
00:30:33,00:30:36,And they've now worked out a way that removes the stains properly.
00:30:36,00:30:39,But not many people have washing machines in India.
00:30:39,00:30:41,It's only about 10% of the population.
00:30:41,00:30:48,So it's a sort of just an innovation that I guess 10% of a billion still are lost.
00:30:48,00:30:52,"I just quite like the niche sort of, the dealing of niche stains."
00:30:52,00:30:53,It's very exciting.
00:30:53,00:30:59,"They've worked out sort of the optimal current strength of the water and the optimum, you"
00:30:59,00:31:00,"know, the washing time."
00:31:00,00:31:03,It just sounds like a very intense washing cycle.
00:31:03,00:31:07,"You know, when you go to different settings on your washing machine, it claims this is"
00:31:07,00:31:10,"for cotton, this is for special weave, this is for, and actually, isn't it just that"
00:31:10,00:31:12,the time goes up and up and up?
00:31:12,00:31:13,Temperature.
00:31:13,00:31:16,"And yeah, time and temperature go up and up and up."
00:31:16,00:31:19,"And maybe it's a spin, I think it might be the spin speed, too."
00:31:19,00:31:20,Possibly.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"But they're not, they're adding in any special ingredient, do we think?"
00:31:22,00:31:26,They suddenly inject in some kind of acid as soon as you click curry.
00:31:26,00:31:32,"If you get a red curry on your clothes, you have to wash it out with white curry immediately."
00:31:32,00:31:33,It's very cool.
00:31:33,00:31:35,"Will we get, are they going to do a British one for what?"
00:31:35,00:31:44,"Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what they would do for us, I mean, it would, it would also"
00:31:44,00:31:49,"be curry, that's true."
00:31:49,00:31:50,"They have, though, panasonic."
00:31:50,00:31:56,It's not the only sort of laundry product that they've been looking into.
00:31:56,00:32:02,"They've funded 10% of this new product, which some people have dubbed a lawn droid."
00:32:02,00:32:05,Because it is a machine that folds your clothes for you.
00:32:05,00:32:11,So the company that have sort of talked about this and invented this say that they've worked
00:32:11,00:32:15,"out that the average person spends 9,000 hours of their life folding clothes."
00:32:15,00:32:18,"Well, I bring that average really, really far down."
00:32:18,00:32:19,"Yeah, me too."
00:32:19,00:32:21,I don't fold any of my clothes.
00:32:21,00:32:26,"I do bring it quite far up again, because I fold my clothes very neatly."
00:32:26,00:32:32,"So Andy, as someone who does it a lot, you are wasting, according to them, 375 days of"
00:32:32,00:32:33,your life.
00:32:33,00:32:34,I don't think of it as wasting then.
00:32:34,00:32:38,"I think I have a better life as a result, and I think with those, I wouldn't know what to"
00:32:38,00:32:42,"do with that extra time, frankly, what am I going to do, something to beach somewhere?"
00:32:42,00:32:43,"No, thanks."
00:32:43,00:32:44,I'll be folding.
00:32:44,00:32:45,I'll be in the folding room.
00:32:45,00:32:49,Is that a beach with unfolded clothes?
00:32:49,00:32:53,"So this machine, it's been launched, and you can see a video, it's ridiculous, and you"
00:32:53,00:32:57,"have to put in one shirt at a time, so far as I could see, you put it in."
00:32:57,00:33:03,"It closes its doors like an oven, and then, after 10 minutes, it's folded your shirt."
00:33:03,00:33:08,"10 minutes, I don't like to boast."
00:33:08,00:33:14,But I've managed to get it down to something a little more like 7.
00:33:14,00:33:17,"So what was the company, the Panasonic?"
00:33:17,00:33:18,"Panasonic did this, yeah."
00:33:18,00:33:24,"So I think we should give a little bit of balance, Samsung, have got some good innovations"
00:33:24,00:33:26,in washing machines at the moment.
00:33:26,00:33:30,"Some of the more recent innovations, I'm not quite sure what all these are, but the latest"
00:33:30,00:33:38,"models have got EcoBubble, whatever that is, wobble technology, what that is, and a magic"
00:33:38,00:33:39,dispenser.
00:33:39,00:33:43,"It is another nickname for the penis, actually."
00:33:43,00:33:48,"Yeah, I don't want that magic dispenser setting anywhere near my clothes, but it's good"
00:33:48,00:33:50,to come out and wash.
00:33:50,00:33:55,"Magic dispenser, and that's a lot of models in Samsung have got magic dispensers at the"
00:33:55,00:33:56,moment.
00:33:56,00:33:59,"Samsung have an explosion setting at the moment, don't they?"
00:33:59,00:34:03,"It was Samsung washing machines, it was exploding last year as well."
00:34:03,00:34:08,"I don't think it was an actual setting on it, but yeah, they like their phones, they were"
00:34:08,00:34:11,"exploding, and so they had to recall a lot of washing machines."
00:34:11,00:34:13,I think it's one of the largest ever product recalls in history.
00:34:13,00:34:17,"I think it was something like 2.8 million washing machines, and that is a lot."
00:34:17,00:34:18,That's a lot.
00:34:18,00:34:21,"If you're wondering at home, that is a lot of washing machines."
00:34:21,00:34:22,How many was it?
00:34:22,00:34:23,"2.8 million, I think."
00:34:23,00:34:24,"Oh, that's a lot."
00:34:24,00:34:29,"And they're still, actually, I read a news report about that this morning, they're still hunting"
00:34:29,00:34:31,"for 5,000 in Western Australia."
00:34:31,00:34:35,They should do one of the helicopters.
00:34:35,00:34:36,They out in the wild?
00:34:36,00:34:37,They are.
00:34:37,00:34:38,They roam in herds of 20 to 30.
00:34:38,00:34:41,"Yep, my washing machine escapes the other day."
00:34:41,00:34:47,"And genuinely, it sits behind a cupboard door, so you know, you put it over the cupboard"
00:34:47,00:34:50,"door and the washing machine's behind it, and I put a wash on, and I came out and I"
00:34:50,00:34:54,"had thrust the door open, and I was poking about four inches out of it."
00:34:54,00:34:55,Good job.
00:34:55,00:34:56,You got there in time.
00:34:56,00:34:57,Yeah.
00:34:57,00:34:58,It's a wrangle it back.
00:34:58,00:35:01,"It could have been rampaging across London, as we speak."
00:35:01,00:35:07,"I tried to find a scientific report on, you know, it's that trope you see that women sit"
00:35:07,00:35:09,"on washing machines, because it leads to orgasms."
00:35:09,00:35:11,Because they've heard about the magic dispenser.
00:35:11,00:35:12,"Yes, exactly."
00:35:12,00:35:13,Yeah.
00:35:13,00:35:19,"But, no, I couldn't find anything except a lot of videos of women doing it, which I didn't"
00:35:19,00:35:20,watch.
00:35:20,00:35:21,I was folding at that time.
00:35:21,00:35:22,"I know, that's what the video was."
00:35:22,00:35:26,Because I had to watch a few to make sure that the line was correct.
00:35:26,00:35:30,"Well, other naughty things you can do with washing machines."
00:35:30,00:35:31,Yeah.
00:35:31,00:35:32,Keep cocaine in them.
00:35:32,00:35:33,Okay.
00:35:33,00:35:36,"So, a policeman in Yorkshire has just been found guilty of a range of drug offences, but"
00:35:36,00:35:40,one of the things was he was taking drugs that the police had seized and then selling it
00:35:40,00:35:41,back onto the streets.
00:35:41,00:35:42,"Oh, yeah."
00:35:42,00:35:45,"He found out about this, so he's just been found guilty, hasn't been sentenced yet."
00:35:45,00:35:49,And he was found to be keeping 11 kilos of cocaine in his washing machine.
00:35:49,00:35:54,"Was he like, because it's a white powder, and then you've got white powder going into"
00:35:54,00:35:56,"your washing machine, so was he pretending it was personal?"
00:35:56,00:36:01,"Well, all the detergents come out of the plastic bags, the detergent comes in again."
00:36:01,00:36:06,"Well, the prosecution lawyer opened the case by asking the jury, what do you keep in your"
00:36:06,00:36:08,washing machine?
00:36:08,00:36:11,Keith Boots had over 11 kilograms of cocaine worth hundreds of thousands of pounds
00:36:11,00:36:13,on the street in his.
00:36:13,00:36:18,"I found my cocoa pops in my washing machine the other day, and Phanella put them in there"
00:36:18,00:36:22,"because at our house we were selling our flat at the moment, she thought they'd go through"
00:36:22,00:36:28,"the cupboards and they would be put off by seeing a box of cocoa pops out, and she put it"
00:36:28,00:36:30,"in the washing machine, but she didn't tell me."
00:36:30,00:36:33,"So when I went to put the washing in the washing machine, my box of cocoa pops are sitting"
00:36:33,00:36:34,inside.
00:36:34,00:36:37,Was it that she thought they'd be put off by particularly dirty cocoa pops and they needed
00:36:37,00:36:38,to go to a cycle?
00:36:38,00:36:39,"No, just they just saw."
00:36:39,00:36:43,"I always ask, my first question actually, on viewing any property, is are there any"
00:36:43,00:36:45,cocoa pops on the premises?
00:36:45,00:36:49,I think it was partially that we didn't have space in the cupboard for it and she didn't
00:36:49,00:36:50,want it out in display.
00:36:50,00:36:55,I think your wife is in Paris that you eat cocoa pops in the washing machine.
00:36:55,00:36:58,Do you keep finding the cocoa pops in the washing machine?
00:36:58,00:36:59,Yeah.
00:36:59,00:37:03,I should put my crunchy nut in the dishwasher once.
00:37:03,00:37:04,Yeah.
00:37:04,00:37:09,"It's like a funny treasure hunt in my house, but breakfast in the mornings."
00:37:09,00:37:11,Have you guys heard of Ricky Maisel?
00:37:11,00:37:12,Yeah.
00:37:12,00:37:13,Ricky Maisel.
00:37:13,00:37:14,Ricky Maisel.
00:37:14,00:37:15,"No, who is that?"
00:37:15,00:37:16,"No, who's he?"
00:37:16,00:37:20,"Ricky Maisel says he's the world leader in escaping washing machines, right?"
00:37:20,00:37:22,So he climbs into a washing machine.
00:37:22,00:37:25,Or Dan's wife throws him into the washing machine because there's someone coming round.
00:37:25,00:37:29,"Well, he's got something to eat in there, don't he?"
00:37:29,00:37:30,That's what it is.
00:37:30,00:37:32,"Is this where you have to go after you've had an argument, do you have to sleep in the"
00:37:32,00:37:33,washing machine?
00:37:33,00:37:35,I'll be in the machine.
00:37:35,00:37:43,"So Ricky gets into these machines, or Phinella puts him in there, and as long as they're"
00:37:43,00:37:47,"in the machine with at least a 14 inch door on a 27 inch drum, apparently."
00:37:47,00:37:52,And he boasts that I have successfully escaped from 40 brands of washing machines in 42
00:37:52,00:37:53,countries.
00:37:53,00:37:54,Wow.
00:37:54,00:37:55,Watch a video.
00:37:55,00:37:56,I've watched three.
00:37:56,00:38:00,"That's why you and Dan were both sitting there watching washing machine videos, Dan of"
00:38:00,00:38:01,women sitting on them.
00:38:01,00:38:04,And you have this bloke climbing out of them.
00:38:04,00:38:05,He climbs in.
00:38:05,00:38:08,"And the way it happens is it gets to you climbs in, and it's very small, it's impressive,"
00:38:08,00:38:10,and it gets turned on and you start spinning around.
00:38:10,00:38:11,It's turned on.
00:38:11,00:38:12,"Yeah, it gets turned on."
00:38:12,00:38:13,That's pouring.
00:38:13,00:38:19,"It starts spinning up and then after a certain amount of time, he starts banging really, really"
00:38:19,00:38:25,"hard on the window, and the assistant has to stop it and let him out."
00:38:25,00:38:26,What is that?
00:38:26,00:38:28,And that happens in all three videos.
00:38:28,00:38:30,I think that technically isn't as scary as it is.
00:38:30,00:38:31,Yeah.
00:38:31,00:38:36,It's like when Houdini's wife just lets him out of the hang.
00:38:36,00:38:39,"So I think very much, don't try this at home."
00:38:39,00:38:40,Yes.
00:38:40,00:38:42,I'm starting to question Ricky.
00:38:42,00:38:43,I don't know.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"Well, yeah, I thought the claim to be a washing machine escapist was a strong one given that"
00:38:46,00:38:52,what you do is scream out for help and the person nearest has to open the machine.
00:38:52,00:38:58,"I read a website saying that the first modern washing machine was invented in 1899, and I"
00:38:58,00:38:59,don't think it's true.
00:38:59,00:39:00,Ooh.
00:39:00,00:39:04,"But when I was searching to see if it was true, I found a movie from 1899 called Scrubbums"
00:39:04,00:39:08,"washing machine, and I can't find the video of it."
00:39:08,00:39:11,"So I'm not sure if it even exists, because it's so old."
00:39:11,00:39:16,"But there is a review from 1902, and it was two girls in a hotel laundry are experimenting"
00:39:16,00:39:17,with a new washing machine.
00:39:17,00:39:19,I've seen that video.
00:39:19,00:39:24,"They turned the handle the wrong way, and the machine explodes, drenching them with"
00:39:24,00:39:26,suds and wrecking the place generally.
00:39:26,00:39:28,The scene is very humorous and exciting.
00:39:28,00:39:29,Mm.
00:39:29,00:39:30,Sounds great.
00:39:30,00:39:31,Sounds great.
00:39:31,00:39:37,"So then I went onto IMDB and search for washing machine, and it's really weird."
00:39:37,00:39:42,"There's hardly any movies called The Washing Machine, some most of cinematic history."
00:39:42,00:39:45,And then there was one in the '90s or something.
00:39:45,00:39:48,"And then in 2010, there was a movie called The Washing Machine."
00:39:48,00:39:53,"In 2012, there was a movie called The Washing Machine, and in 2014, there was also a movie"
00:39:53,00:39:56,"called The Washing Machine, and there were all different movies."
00:39:56,00:39:57,Wow.
00:39:57,00:39:58,So not reboots?
00:39:58,00:40:02,"Not reboots, completely different snopsies are completely different."
00:40:02,00:40:03,Wow.
00:40:03,00:40:07,"And also, there is an actor called George Washing Machine."
00:40:07,00:40:08,No.
00:40:08,00:40:14,He's known for a country practice in 1981 and a place to call home from 2030.
00:40:14,00:40:15,What is it one night's way?
00:40:15,00:40:19,I would say he is not known for those.
00:40:19,00:40:24,"In a very nice way, I think he is more known for being called George Washing Machine."
00:40:24,00:40:26,"Is that double barrel, so a name or one?"
00:40:26,00:40:27,"No, one word."
00:40:27,00:40:31,"It could, I mean, unless it's some kind of auto-correcting IMDB or something, and it's"
00:40:31,00:40:34,"supposed to be George Washington, but maybe he was called George Washington."
00:40:34,00:40:38,"Oh, who was famously known for his cameo roles and whatever."
00:40:38,00:40:39,What is the call home?
00:40:39,00:40:40,What is the call home?
00:40:40,00:40:41,Auto-correct is bad.
00:40:41,00:40:42,I don't think it's that bad.
00:40:42,00:40:46,"The name corrects Washington, a word and a name."
00:40:46,00:40:50,"So my other thought is maybe he's called George Washington, and there's another one,"
00:40:50,00:40:54,"a famous one, so he had to change his name, and this was the first thing he thought"
00:40:54,00:40:55,out.
00:40:55,00:40:56,I don't know.
00:40:56,00:41:02,"Standing in the utility room, looking around on the phone, Washington's taken."
00:41:02,00:41:05,George Coco Pops.
00:41:05,00:41:12,"I always reading that in Australia, researchers are on the brink of making a new innovation,"
00:41:12,00:41:15,which is clothes that wash themselves.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:16,00:41:17,Wow.
00:41:17,00:41:18,So it's quite interesting.
00:41:18,00:41:24,"It's all about the fabric that they're using, and what they're harnessing is sunlight."
00:41:24,00:41:31,"The idea that as soon as sun touches the fabric, it burns off whatever organic matter is"
00:41:31,00:41:33,on top of the fabric itself.
00:41:33,00:41:38,"So it says to grow special nanostructures, which can degrade organic matter when exposed"
00:41:38,00:41:39,to light.
00:41:39,00:41:40,Hang on.
00:41:40,00:41:45,"When I'm on the beach in the sun in my stained clothes, and they're when they're Andy who's"
00:41:45,00:41:53,"folding in the hotel, the stains don't disappear as I expose myself to the sunshine."
00:41:53,00:41:55,"Yeah, because you're not wearing the new technology."
00:41:55,00:41:57,You don't have the nanostructures.
00:41:57,00:41:58,"Oh, so you need that."
00:41:58,00:42:00,So they're harnessing sunlight in a specific way.
00:42:00,00:42:01,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:01,00:42:03,It's like you can flash sunlight on something and it brings it.
00:42:03,00:42:05,"Yeah, they're inventing this thing."
00:42:05,00:42:06,Right.
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:08,Right.
00:42:08,00:42:10,"I was reading a paper about the history of the washing machine, and it's written by a"
00:42:10,00:42:15,"really angry man, who opened his paper by saying the entire history of washing machines"
00:42:15,00:42:19,is one of the most ignored and most misrepresented segments of the history of technology.
00:42:19,00:42:23,And the whole thing is a diatribe against all other washing machine historians who keep
00:42:23,00:42:27,on misquoting these first washing machine patents.
00:42:27,00:42:28,He's really upset.
00:42:28,00:42:32,"But I did find in the course of that, the patent for the travel washing machine, have you"
00:42:32,00:42:33,guys seen this?
00:42:33,00:42:34,"Oh, no."
00:42:34,00:42:36,"This is in 1952, and they actually trialed this."
00:42:36,00:42:40,And the idea was that people were getting into going out in camper vans and they wanted to
00:42:40,00:42:42,be able to wash their clothes on the road.
00:42:42,00:42:46,"And it was a washing machine where you affix the drum to the wheel of your car, to the back"
00:42:46,00:42:47,wheel.
00:42:47,00:42:48,That's smart.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"And as you drove, it spun around."
00:42:50,00:42:51,Very good.
00:42:51,00:42:52,Yeah.
00:42:52,00:42:59,And he's always killed after cutting into wrong washing machine.
00:42:59,00:43:03,"Okay, that's it."
00:43:03,00:43:04,That's all of our facts.
00:43:04,00:43:05,Thank you so much for listening.
