 [romantic bass music]

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.840
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.160
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.000
 and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.560
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.560
 with you.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 Andy.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 My fact is that sometimes racing ferrets fall asleep halfway along the course, so it's

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.760
 a bit like the tortoise and the hare story, so that the hare is a ferret.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.200
 The tortoise is another ferret that doesn't roll asleep, all the animals are ferrets.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.800
 Yeah, and sometimes they fall asleep.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.360
 I've confused things too much by introducing them.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.000
 It's a bit like sleeping beauty on the years of sleeping ferret.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.520
 Was she halfway through a ride?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.280
 I miss that bit of the story.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.480
 Just the sleeping bit really.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 Right.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then a handsome prince turns up and kisses the ferret.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.160
 He's a ferret too.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.360
 This is an article from the Derby Telegraph who did a report.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.960
 They've had a ferret race up in Derby recently, at a place called Long Eaton, and there's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.800
 no track what there is, is a tube, and every ferret has its own tube.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.240
 Oh, I was going to say, not just one tube, but otherwise the person who goes in first will

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 be the winner every time.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
 And also, you could just fall asleep, and that's it, yeah.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.200
 That would be like having Bob sledding with just one of those courses and you'll go

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
 at one.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.200
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.400
 That is not the case in this race.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 No.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.160
 Every ferret gets his or her own tube, and you race along it, and the coach has to encourage

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.200
 the ferret along to the other end.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.520
 But sometimes a ferret can be winning, according to his spokesman, and then decide to lie down

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520
 for a nap.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
 So a race can take two minutes, or it can take ten minutes.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 This place in Long Eaton last year, they had a thing called ferret roulette.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.640
 Is it like Russian roulette?

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 Yeah.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 The ferret's got a gun.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.640
 Yeah, maybe.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.640
 No, no, no.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.920
 You shoot a ferret into the side of your head.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920
 It's not like that, no?

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
 Okay.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.720
 Where you had to bet on which tube a ferret would go down.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.000
 You could put on loads of different pairs of trousers, and one of them's got a ferret

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 on it.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.960
 Ah, that is ferret roulette.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.960
 Yeah.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.960
 That's really good.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.800
 I read, I think it was the same one, tickets were £12 each.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
 Is this the same one?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 I didn't check it.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.200
 I didn't check the ticket prices, but how many ferret racing events can there have been

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 in Long Eaton recently?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.000
 Yeah, probably a few.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.160
 The tickets were £12 each, and they included a fish and chips supper.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
 Oh, okay.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160
 And it's very good.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160
 And it's very good.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
 I know, it's my local fish and chips shop.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.000
 Fish chips and mushy peas is £9.80 on its own, so you're paying £2.20 for the ferrets,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 really?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 That's very reasonably priced.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
 Good, isn't it?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
 Yes, very good.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 They should really make the tube see through, I've just realised, because I was thinking

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.920
 what you're really paying for was nothing, because you don't get to see any of it until

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920
 the ferret pops out.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.440
 Of course, the tube is see through.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440
 No, no, no, no.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 Yeah, no, Dan, it's not.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440
 Well, the one I watched.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.400
 It's a solid, you've been watching the luxury ferret racing.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.200
 You've clearly paid a bit more than your 12 quid.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.640
 No, there are sections of wire in the tube, so occasionally you see a ferret passing by.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 Yeah.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.160
 That's more like a way marker than a...

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.360
 That, my one's way better.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.720
 You get to watch all the workings of the race.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 Like a race.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.200
 Imagine if there was like a pool cover on the top of an Olympics movie pool.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.840
 You're like, well, let's see who pops out of the head.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.600
 Oh, they all drowned, shouldn't have put that cover on them.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.120
 So if you guys heard about ferret legging, yeah, Scott, it's exciting.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.120
 The best thing in the world.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 Yeah.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.640
 So that's why you put a ferret down your trousers and you see how long you can keep it.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.520
 You tie up the end of your trousers, put a ferret down there.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.080
 It's nice for the ferret, because it reminds it of hunting rabbits, I presume.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080
 Yes.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.680
 Well, what's it hunting in that case?

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.680
 What is it in your trousers that reminds the ferret of a banner?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.720
 Oh, it's supposed to, you're not allowed to wear underwear in ferret legging.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720
 Oh.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.720
 You have to have your genitals exposed, I think, in some of it.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.720
 That's the expose.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.720
 That's the expose.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720
 To the ferret, to the ferret.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720
 To the ferret, yeah.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.720
 It's really definitely would have got that memo wrong and could arrive.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720
 Balls out.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.800
 But that's the only occasion where, actually, you can claim you're exposing yourself

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.720
 for a very good reason, which is to protect your genitals from the ferret.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.720
 That's true.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.720
 I'm repeating, though.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.720
 Officer.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680
 I think that this might have been enlist, first, actually, that one of the biggest names

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.560
 in ferret legging is Regimella.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.880
 And he introduced the concept of wearing white trousers to better display the blood spilled

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880
 from the bites.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.880
 Oh.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.760
 In 1972, the ferret legging records stood at 40 seconds, right?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 A few years later, it rose to over one minute and eventually to 90 minutes, which is quite

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.720
 a leap.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.720
 Yeah, that's.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.120
 And then, in 1977, Edward Simpkins, from the Isle of Whites, set the new world record

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.640
 of 5,000-10 minutes, although he only had one ferret in his trousers during the first four

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.840
 hours and two for the last 70 minutes.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.680
 Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued to play

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.280
 a game of darts undeterred.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280
 Wow.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280
 What a hero.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 How did he do in the darts?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280
 Did he do it?

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 It doesn't relate.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:34.840
 He actually won the BDO World Championships that year.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.080
 Now, Pete Jockey Wilson in the final.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.680
 But that's only because he trained the ferret to carry the dart over to the dart board.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.040
 Apparently, what you're meant to do when you do ferret legging is to feed your ferret

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:55.240
 a lot, so you don't put a hungry ferret down your trousers, which is what leads to a lot

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.600
 of the bites, is because four hours in, they might get a bit hungry and start nibbling

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600
 on you.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.320
 You really feed your ferret, you should survive a bite, yeah.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.560
 It's interesting because ferret is.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.880
 I had a look in a slang dictionary, the partridge dictionary of slang, ferret is slang

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:18.440
 for penis, and it's also an RS slang term, which is rhyming slang for beret.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.960
 It's not very good rhyming slang.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.360
 It says in the dictionary, "Brecker's deliberately bad".

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.440
 I think you can tell by the turn of voice in which someone says, "I've got a ferret

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.280
 in my trousers, what kind of ferret they're talking about."

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280
 You think so?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.520
 I think it was always like, "I've got a ferret in my trousers!"

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.760
 That's a penis.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.760
 Their band is Pat's, aren't they, in certain places, so New York, New York.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760
 Yeah.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.760
 I wasn't allowed to bring money in.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.200
 Do you know which area of Britain owns the most ferrets?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.200
 London.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.760
 London and the Southeast.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:01.760
 It's traditionally thought to be a Northern or especially a Yorkshire thing, but 27% of

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.880
 the ferrets in the UK live in London and the Southeast.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.280
 Yorkshire only has 7% of the ferrets.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280
 No.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.280
 Are they domesticated or do we have wild ferret?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.800
 This is I was Pat's, I think.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.800
 Yeah, these are his pets.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 Right.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.920
 I have seen someone near where I live walking around a ferret on a leash.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920
 I was so excited.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:20.920
 I've seen that before.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920
 Yeah.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920
 You can get little harnesses for them.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920
 Yeah.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920
 Pat ferret.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.920
 Did he?

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.760
 John Mitchinson of QI.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.760
 Wow, that's cool.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.760
 I met him.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.760
 We've had four men shot on a ferret.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.760
 They're the meetings with him for years.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760
 He had big paws and whiskers.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.760
 Yeah, that's good.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.760
 Yeah.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760
 Pretty much.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760
 That's him.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.760
 Cosden, you're trying to get into your trousers.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 Good old Mitch.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.240
 So they're, they've really vicious, right?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.240
 Animals in this kind of group like weasels and stokes and ferrets are.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.240
 Stella die.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.240
 Yeah, a mastella die.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.480
 They're so voracious and such good hunters.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.120
 So there was that David Atmerclip of a stoke that caught a rabbit that was 10 times its size

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.240
 and the way they do it is they wrap their bodies around the animal they're trying to catch

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.960
 so they're like a little snake and then they bite it always exactly between the skull

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
 and the spine.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.480
 So it cuts that off.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.560
 But yeah, they're really good hunters and one of the ways they hunt is by doing the,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.480
 I think it's called the Weasel war dance and it's where they just flip their body around

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.960
 in insane kind of configuration.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.080
 They can hypnotise a chicken, can't they?

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:29.800
 The idea is that they transfix their prey and their prey so distracted that they get slightly

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.600
 different to hypnotising a chicken.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.320
 Is it if they've just, you know, this is what the All Blacks rugby team do before every

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.320
 game.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320
 Hypnotised chicken.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:43.280
 That's their war dance is they hypnotise the England team into being completely hypnotising

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.160
 a rugby.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.200
 Have you heard of the vigilante group, the 12 just men?

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200
 No.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.240
 They were in a Welsh market town called Newtown.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:57.480
 There was a report about them in the independent in 1992 and what they did, they thought that

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.440
 the local punishments dished out to criminals, you know, like for vandalising and burglary

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.200
 and things like that were really pathetic and weak and that the police weren't doing

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200
 anything.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.320
 So they formed this vigilante group and they would find out about crimes and then they

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.640
 would, their spokesman said, "Our plan for keeping law and order is simple.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:19.440
 Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime will frog march off to the hills where

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.400
 there's nobody to hear the screams, will hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers."

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.640
 They had a ferret called Fred.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.680
 What do you mean by ferret?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.760
 It will be painful and terrifying, but it will teach him a lesson he won't forget in

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:34.760
 a hurry.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.080
 Do you know, was a weasel's make their own fridges?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.800
 Basically have their own fridge set up.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800
 They do.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 They do.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800
 They do.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.760
 They marzen electricity and they've made, no, they store food underground and they dig underground

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.720
 compartments near their den entrances.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720
 I don't see any.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720
 No, I see any.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.280
 They have they've mastered the art of fridges.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:00.640
 I would say they are somewhere along with the art of fridges, but mastery is a way off.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.800
 And let me finish.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.600
 They plug it into the main.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.600
 No, fine.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.200
 They dig holes underground because they'll sometimes go on a big killing spree and then

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.200
 very, most of their prey underground where it's nice and cold so it gets preserved.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.320
 But they can store huge numbers of things in there.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:21.960
 So scientists once found a stash in Greenland that was stuffed with the carcasses of 150

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.280
 lemmings.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
 Lemmings.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280
 Yeah, lemmings.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.520
 It's a weasel serial killer who needs to be brought to justice immediately.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.520
 Hang on.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.120
 Am I thinking, lemmings like the size of a sheep, right?

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.120
 No.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 No, no, no.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.120
 No, no, no.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.120
 No, no, no.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.120
 No, no, no.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.120
 No, no, no.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.120
 Like a giddy pig.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.120
 What are you thinking of?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.440
 I thought it was just this cave of dead sheep, 150 of them.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
 What are you thinking of?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.440
 Lemmings.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.680
 You can't run off the cliff that Disney, no.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.240
 But that's the myth, right?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240
 Yeah, exactly the truth.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.280
 What, so the trope is like a hundred giddy pig size things ran off a cliff.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.280
 That's cool.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.280
 I mean, yeah.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280
 That was big.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280
 In my head, they were sheep size.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280
 Yeah.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280
 Okay, I mean, we're all learning.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280
 So this is great.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.280
 You've learned about ferret fridges.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.520
 I've learned about the size of an animal that everyone knows.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.720
 Can I just tell you one thing about a different kind of animal racing?

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.720
 Yeah.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.160
 So I think the equivalent of ferret racing in the US is frog jumping contest.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.080
 And this is based on a Mark Twain story.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.600
 I think it was the story of the first story that made Mark Twain famous that he wrote in

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:25.240
 the 1860s, about a fictional frog jumping contest in a counting California, which now happens

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240
 every year.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:30.400
 And they attract up to 10,000 people, I think.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:35.080
 Lots of people go and attend, and you can do stuff like blow on the frog's nether regions.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.680
 And that kind of makes the job a bit harder.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.480
 Or is that included in the 12-12-year issue?

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.960
 It's included in the NPV.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.880
 So as fish and ships, do you want to blow up the anus of the frog?

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.960
 It's included, so.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:54.760
 When it's a frog jumping competition, is it height, distance, speed, or what?

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.760
 I'm pretty sure it's distance, and I think they do three.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.000
 They're allowed to do three jumps, and then they measure how far they've gone in three jumps.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.200
 It's like the hot pop and the hot pop.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.760
 Oh, exactly.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.960
 But they have to be played soothing music.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.760
 So in the rules of this play, they don't, they like it.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.280
 They like it.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.360
 They prefer it.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.320
 They like it if it is soothing music when you're blowing on a channel.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.840
 It's a romantic scene.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.880
 If you think about it, no, there are actually rules, say, when the frogs aren't working,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.520
 they have to be kept on the ground.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.040
 They have to be kept in a fridge.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.800
 With a massive lemon.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.320
 They have to be kept in the dark, in the cool, and be played soothing music to calm their nerves.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.320
 Yeah.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.440
 It sounds like the frogs get a pretty good deal out of this.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440
 Yeah.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 You get to go to a nice competition.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:47.480
 You get your own green room, and then you get someone blowing on your genitals.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.200
 I know what your ride is going to be on the next floor.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:57.160
 God, hair dryer is in the dressing room, Mr. Murray.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.920
 Can I, I really want to ask people something that I have to have a mystery.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.560
 This is basically the reason I brought frogs, right, it was because I went to the countryside

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.520
 this weekend and I went on a walk and noticed a dead frog on the path I was on.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.520
 Okay.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.040
 And then another one, and then I was with this other person,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:16.360
 and we counted the dead frogs, and in a space of about half a kilometer, we counted 59 dead frogs.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.360
 Okay.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.360
 And not all of them squash.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.360
 They were all black.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.200
 They looked like they'd just been frozen in time, kind of black frogs.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.200
 And I don't know why.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.640
 And I've tried looking up why there would suddenly be 59 dead frogs in the countryside of

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640
 Oxfordshire.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.640
 Yeah.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640
 And if anyone has any idea.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.960
 What about if it was one of those supposedly things when it rains frogs?

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:36.280
 So if anyone has a better suggestion?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.680
 Okay, so there is this idea that sometimes it rains frogs, right?

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:46.680
 And the idea is that a water spout is created by like a mini tornado and it sucks it up into

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.240
 the air, and then they rain down.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.040
 Now a lot of people think that they're not real, but what happens instead is it's been raining,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.720
 pond kind of overflows.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.560
 All of the frogs kind of go into the overflow bit of the pond, and then it dries up because

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:05.080
 it gets evaporated, and then they all have no water, so they all die.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080
 Okay.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080
 Can I get that one?

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080
 Yeah.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.080
 Was it near water?

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
 We looked for water.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.680
 We think it must have been near water, because the dog disappeared and it came back wet.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680
 Yes.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680
 So it was wet.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.680
 We've been in a garage.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.280
 It's the sixtieth frog in its house.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.280
 I love that.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:25.280
 That's your method of divining for water is the dog wet.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:33.880
 And we must keep moving then.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.280
 Okay, my fat this week is that according to Venezuelan law, 90% of wheat must be made

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.480
 into loaves of bread rather than cakes or pastries.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480
 Mm-hmm.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480
 It's very harsh.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 Why?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.680
 Well, this is what they're calling the bread war in Venezuelan at the moment, and they're

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.880
 obviously having a lot of financial problems.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.400
 And what the government don't want bakers to do is to waste flour on cakes and things

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.400
 like that.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.400
 They want to make sure that they have enough bread for all of the people.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.400
 And they're probably arresting people, aren't they?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.600
 Like for making brownies and stuff like that as well, it's not just, yeah.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600
 Really?

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.600
 Yeah.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.400
 But this is like the history really of how important bakers have been, you know, all

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.080
 the way through history, bakers have been one of the most important people in society.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.000
 If they do anything wrong, they'll get punished a lot more than normal people.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.680
 It seemed like such a high-risk job looking into history and sort of recorded statements

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.000
 about if you mess with the weight of your bread, if you mess sell your bread, you will be

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 killed.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
 Like that.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.200
 It was as harsh as you'll be killed or you'll be paraded through the towns.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.200
 Get this.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.200
 There was a thing where it's so in France, if you were found guilty of swindling customers,

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.400
 you would be imprisoned immediately and your shop would be walled up for two years,

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400
 which is pretty serious.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:59.600
 Or sometimes they would have all your crimes printed on a massive sheet of paper and they

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.400
 would make you wear a sandwich board through the streets.

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400
 Oh, really?

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400
 Yeah, it's quite cool.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400
 So sandwich board.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.400
 Exactly, yeah.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.400
 I don't think I'd call it a sandwich board at the time.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.400
 And sometimes this is from a book about the history of it.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.160
 The police just looked the other way and let angry customers, often women, beat the

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.160
 bakers up.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 Oh.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160
 Yeah.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160
 No way.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.160
 There was a law in Britain until 2008 that you couldn't sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.160
 Right.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:31.560
 The law was that you had to sell it in 400 grams or 800 grams or 1,200 grams, it had to be

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.960
 a multiple of 400.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.960
 Really?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.760
 That was a law that was from the size of bread and ale in 1266.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.760
 Wow.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:44.160
 And it was still going into 2008 when they made it legal to sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.760
 But I think most loaves are still 400 or 800 grams, aren't they?

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.760
 Yeah.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
 Yeah.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 So even now it's still happening.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.160
 Well, yeah, that's just a leftover from the olden days.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160
 Yeah.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.300
 And the myth that this is where bakers doesn't come from.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.820
 So it's the idea is that because bakers were so afraid of being punished for underselling

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:04.800
 to customers, they would always give them a little bit more than they'd ordered, wasn't

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800
 it?

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800
 I don't know.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800
 Yeah, stopped.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.600
 And I think that's, I think it's been written in various places that that's where bakers

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.600
 doesn't come from.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.320
 I've never seen anyone asserting that it was a myth.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.320
 OK.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.320
 And it's the kind of thing that I would have seen, I think.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.320
 So I think it maybe is true.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320
 Yeah.

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320
 I don't know.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320
 Right.

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.440
 So that, then, keep it to yourself.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.080
 There was a paranoia in the 18th century that bakers would steal human bones and ashes, and

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.600
 they would use the bone ash to increase the weight of their flour.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600
 This is not true.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.400
 There's no evidence it ever happened, but people really hated bakers.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.680
 And as a result, well, not as a result, but just in general, bakers had to carve their

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.360
 initials into the underside of every loaf of bread they made.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.360
 Really?

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.360
 Yeah.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.360
 To sort of show this was made by Fred the Baker and it's the--

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360
 F2B.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.360
 F2B.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.360
 Yeah.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.720
 It's the appropriate weight.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.640
 So in 2009, Venezuela banned video games where you shoot people.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.640
 Did they?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.520
 Yeah, because there was so much shooting going on that they thought that this is just not

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.520
 a good influence.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.240
 So they actually took a stand and completely banned it.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.960
 But anyway, one other thing that they almost banned quite recently, it's because they went

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:13.120
 through an energy crisis.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.560
 The president did come out and say he urged all women to stop using hair dryers because

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.400
 that was using up too much energy.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.160
 He thought hair dryers specifically were causing huge shortages.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:30.640
 What people using them to blow on the genitals of frogs and jumping competitions?

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.560
 He said, I think a woman-- this was his justification for why they should stop.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.400
 I think a woman looks better when she runs her fingers through her hair and lets it dry naturally.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.240
 But yeah, they tried to stop hair dryers in Venezuela as well.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.680
 Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680
 Does it really?

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680
 Yeah.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.680
 Oh, wow.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.840
 South of Arabia in 2010.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.840
 That's amazing.

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:58.040
 The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.920
 of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920
 Wow.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920
 There's oil stuff.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920
 It's great.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920
 Can you send another million barrels?

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920
 No, please.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.000
 Our gouts got really bad.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
 The first bread maker was horse-powered that I could find.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
 The baker was horse-powered?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 No.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 It's a dough mixer.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.320
 It's a mechanical dough mixer that was referenced in 150 BC.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.400
 It was invented actually by a freed slave and it was this massive basin and it had wooden

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:36.080
 paddles in it that would mix the dough around and horses were attached to them so they'd

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.480
 just go round and round and mix up the dough.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.480
 Wow.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.480
 Quite cool.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.480
 First bread was horse-drawn.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480
 Yeah.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.480
 Just one more thing about Venezuela.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480
 Yeah.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480
 Do you know what it means?

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.480
 The name, Venezuela.

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480
 Oh.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480
 It means little Venice.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480
 Oh, I did know that.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.160
 It's quite of the fact that this is almost completely unlike the North London area known as

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160
 little Venice.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.000
 It's not even like Venice either, really.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.960
 No, but they will have named it when they arrived at the Gulf of Marrakayba or whatever it's

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.960
 called.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.960
 Yeah.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960
 Exactly.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960
 Lake Marrakayba, yeah.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960
 It wasn't just thought there's water here.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.960
 There's water in Venice.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960
 It's the dog's wet.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.440
 That's exactly what I know.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.480
 It was a Marigo Vespucci, who is a American named after him or do we think it's not?

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.160
 Well, QI thinks it's not.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 I think it is.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160
 I think it is as well.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160
 Okay.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.560
 But when he got there, whatever the rights and wrongs of that particular story, he saw

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.640
 indigenous stilt houses which were designed to avoid floods and a guy in a gondola.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.640
 Yeah.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640
 And a cornetto.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.640
 Is that what they have?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.640
 Yeah.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.240
 So he said this is just like Venice.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:46.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.600
 My fact this week is that GCHQ has an internal ghost hunting club.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600
 So cool.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.160
 This is internal ghost hunting.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.080
 It's not looking for internal ghosts.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.440
 Find your inner ghost.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:02.720
 Wait, is it that they're the first group of spooks to be found looking for ghosts?

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.720
 Oh.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.200
 No, it's not that neat.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.200
 Right, got it.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200
 Cool.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.040
 So this came out a couple of years ago.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.560
 It's come out in 2013 actually.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:17.440
 It was the WikiLeaks leak of lots of GCHQ correspondence, a lot of which was very important.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.480
 And then there was this, which was just an exchange of emails that confirmed it's got a ghost

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.240
 hunting group and it arranges trips to kind of haunted houses.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:30.280
 It's advertised to staff and partners whether they're skeptics or believers.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.360
 And yes, for visits to reputedly haunted properties, how they spend this bird time.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:41.240
 Yeah, so that was a part of a Edward Snowden leak, that was the big Edward Snowden leak.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.320
 And it was that, it was one bit of it, wasn't it, where it kind of showed the inside social

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.800
 life of the people who work at GCHQ, because it goes beyond just having a ghost hunting club.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.560
 It would be weird if that was the only social life I've ever had.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.680
 Look at the noticeboards, there's only one that is covered in exoplanes.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:11.200
 But yeah, apparently they have their own in sort of internal social media platform, which

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.960
 is called a pun on my space, spy space.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.760
 It's good that you clarified what that was a pun, otherwise we wouldn't have got it.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.880
 They should call it Facebook, what's that parody pun?

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.640
 So they have a good social secretary in GCHQ and it sounds like they have a really fun time.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.920
 So there was another bit of correspondence that was leaked about the football tournament.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.640
 They have a sports day every year and the main event is a football tournament in which

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.240
 every team has to have one lady player at all times.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.760
 So I thought saying lady player sounds like a weirdly old fashioned term.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.360
 It also sounds like a bloke who sleeps around.

00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.520
 I guess I'm a bit of a lady player.

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.440
 Yeah, maybe that's what it was asking for.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.120
 It was amazing though, the football tournament they had in which that rule was issued came

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.320
 with a six-page rule book.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.040
 It said the wearing of shimpads is caps lock on compulsory caps lock off.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.360
 There were a lot of capsules in the correspondence and it made me think they're a bit trumpy in

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.000
 the way they communicate in GCHQ.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.680
 They need to chill out a little bit.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.960
 Do you think maybe GCHQ learned the art of shouting in capitals from Trump when they were

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.960
 whitesapping him?

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.440
 Oh yeah, good boy.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.440
 And if you're listening, guys, and we know you are naughty, you can't believe you're whitesapping

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.440
 Trump.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.920
 I think it's been from there from the beginning because if you look at it, you'll notice

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.640
 GCHQ is written completely in capitals for every single time.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.120
 So they sometimes do think little things to engage with the public.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.240
 Obviously, they're very, very secretive, but they had this Christmas card puzzle last year,

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.240
 which you may remember.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240
 Yes.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.120
 So 600,000 people tried at least the opening stage, which is amazing, that's 1% of everyone

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.920
 in the country.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.520
 Nobody got it in the time allocated.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.200
 Three people got close and they each won a paperweight.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.200
 Right.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200
 What was the actual prize if you got it all?

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.200
 I don't know.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.200
 You became a spy.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.200
 I believe so, yeah.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.200
 Do you reckon they tell us if the person got it and was become a spy?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200
 That's a good point.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.280
 There's a picture on the front cover of a newspaper.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:13.280
 Maybe hundreds of people got it.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280
 They all become spies.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.280
 Yeah, you're right.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:22.120
 That is, I just can't believe that if you're in the top three of 600,000 people, they're just

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.080
 giving you one paperweight.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.800
 That must be a code for something.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.800
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.040
 It must be an extra bit of puzzle.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.800
 On the bottom of the paperweight, it says Midnight Tower Bridge.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.800
 Yes.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.640
 Leave your family behind.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.600
 We're going ghost hunting.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.840
 I went on the GCHQ website and they have some FAQs there.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:43.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.840
 FAQ.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.840
 Does GCHQ have rabbits running around the garden in the middle of the building?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840
 What?

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.280
 Answer, sadly no.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.840
 We don't have rabbits in our garden.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.440
 The only wildlife we have here are ladybirds, burrows and pigeons.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.440
 Why would they...

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.200
 I think they're ducking the big questions about their role in working with the NSA.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.680
 You might be right about that or I might have deliberately chosen the most reasonable

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680
 of all the questions.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.960
 Oh, maybe it's a bit of both.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.640
 Do they have any moles?

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.640
 Very good.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640
 Yes, very good.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640
 Very good.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640
 Well, there is a question.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:22.080
 Do you have a network of underground tunnels beneath Cheltenham so staff can move around

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.120
 the town without getting stuck in traffic?

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.120
 Yes.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:30.040
 And have all their ferret racing tournaments in privacy.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.720
 It sounds like Midnight was a ferret asking about the rabbits, actually.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:41.160
 Maybe FAQs is ferret asking questions.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.880
 What is the...

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.040
 So I know that GCHQ is involved in code cracking and deciphering and stuff.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.760
 Are they the sort of digital security for the UK?

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.280
 It's eavesdropping, basically.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.680
 I think it's essentially our eavesdropping agency.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.960
 So it's tapping into people's phones, it's hacking into people's computers, that kind of thing.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.560
 But predominantly office-based, as opposed to in the field.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:08.520
 Yes, so I actually read an interview with a woman called Annie MacMahon.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.800
 I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce her name, but she worked at MI5.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.560
 And she was describing the difference between MI5, MI6 and GCHQ staff.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.600
 And she said, GCHQ staff tend to be the boffins, the types that are technically brilliant

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.600
 at things like coding and encryption, but perhaps not brilliant at a party.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.600
 Okay.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600
 That's their vibe.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:33.400
 Another Edward Snowden leak was, it was a list of GCHQ techniques and their code names.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400
 Yeah.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.600
 And then if you saw that, some quite good names.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.120
 The ones which the newspaper article picked up on were concrete donkey, angry pirate and

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.000
 swamp donkey.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.440
 And then a few others that I found, not allergy, country file, dirty devil, clumsy beekeeper and

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.440
 pistrix.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440
 Wow.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.520
 Is that the Donald Trump related?

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.720
 Hacking wiretapping operation.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.560
 They were all so technical, I couldn't really understand what they meant.

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560
 Okay.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.320
 I met a, years ago, I made a UFO documentary, remember that?

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:15.080
 I can 2014 and I went around meeting a lot of people who both believe in UFOs, but I met

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:22.000
 one guy as well called Mark Pilkington, who made a documentary about the idea that governments

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.440
 are seeding disinformation into the field of ufology and things generally.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.720
 So they're kind of creating distractions.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.760
 And part of the leaks from the Snowden leak was a PowerPoint that showed members who

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.200
 worked with GCHQ how to spread disinformation.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.920
 It was a whole thing, really interesting.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.960
 So do we think this whole ghost-tunting malarkey is just a bit of a red herring to throw

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.840
 us off the center of the fact that they're hacking into all of our secret information?

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.160
 Maybe they're going, oh, I believe that the Russian Embassy is haunted.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.560
 That's good to see if we can find some ghosts.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.160
 Oh, I think your laptop is haunted, isn't it, even though?

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.160
 Look, the mouse is moving all by itself.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.120
 So outside the front of GCHQ, there were these things called the listening stones.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.560
 Have you guys heard of this?

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.560
 An artist created them.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.960
 There's these giant, there's nine of these stones and they're carved with codes and some

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.160
 of them have just odd headlines.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:30.400
 So the theory is that the stones are using a very old theory about what ghosts were, which

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.760
 is have you heard of the Stone Tape theory?

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760
 No.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:40.120
 Stone Tape theory, this was put out in the 1960s, I believe.

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.080
 The idea is that this person thought that when you exude energy, energy can latch onto

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.920
 things in life.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.680
 And so the idea is that ghosts are merely a sort of audio recording, as it were, not the

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.800
 spirit of someone that's hanging around as dead, but it's sort of left over energy.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.280
 If you're getting murdered, you exude a lot of energy and it traps it there.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:06.920
 And so the idea is that the listening stones are there to trap human conversations that

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.920
 they can later listen to.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:14.000
 If GCHQ is spending all of our taxpayers money just eavesdropping on these stones outside

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.440
 the building, you'd be very disappointed, is that what they're doing?

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.120
 They think that dead people have trapped their voices inside these stones and that's

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.040
 how they're trying to voice it out.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.440
 The blog society ex believes so, as you go back to doing their proper job, tapping Donald

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.720
 Trump's emails for Barack Obama.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:41.320
 OK, it's time for a final fact of the show.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.520
 And that is my fact.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:48.320
 My fact this week is that there are now washing machines in India that have a button specifically

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.800
 for curry stains.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.560
 Is it really a button just says curry?

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.560
 Yeah.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.600
 Well, I saw a picture on the BBC website and I don't know if they mocked it up as a sort

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.040
 of joke picture, but there's one extra button which is a setting.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.680
 Obviously, this is a panasonic.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.240
 It's a digital interface kind of thing, but it says curry.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.760
 And then it says oil as well.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.760
 There is one.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.120
 It's an extra setting for hair oil.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.120
 Yes.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120
 Yeah.

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.800
 So basically, what they've, what they've realised is obviously the main staple of food

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.840
 in India is curry and the way that it breaks down in a washing machine isn't that good.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.080
 Predominantly, that's the main stain that you're getting as well.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:26.640
 So they wanted to deal with that.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.120
 So panasonic have spent two years analysing the ingredients of curry.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.400
 They've been studying water temperatures and so on.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.960
 And they've now worked out a way that removes the stains properly.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.080
 But not many people have washing machines in India.

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.400
 It's only about 10% of the population.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:48.280
 So it's a sort of just an innovation that I guess 10% of a billion still are lost.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:52.720
 I just quite like the niche sort of, the dealing of niche stains.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720
 It's very exciting.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.120
 They've worked out sort of the optimal current strength of the water and the optimum, you

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.440
 know, the washing time.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.600
 It just sounds like a very intense washing cycle.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.120
 You know, when you go to different settings on your washing machine, it claims this is

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.800
 for cotton, this is for special weave, this is for, and actually, isn't it just that

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.800
 the time goes up and up and up?

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.800
 Temperature.

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.240
 And yeah, time and temperature go up and up and up.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.440
 And maybe it's a spin, I think it might be the spin speed, too.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.440
 Possibly.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.960
 But they're not, they're adding in any special ingredient, do we think?

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.240
 They suddenly inject in some kind of acid as soon as you click curry.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:32.520
 If you get a red curry on your clothes, you have to wash it out with white curry immediately.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.520
 It's very cool.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.720
 Will we get, are they going to do a British one for what?

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:44.220
 Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what they would do for us, I mean, it would, it would also

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:49.240
 be curry, that's true.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.960
 They have, though, panasonic.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:56.080
 It's not the only sort of laundry product that they've been looking into.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.360
 They've funded 10% of this new product, which some people have dubbed a lawn droid.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.920
 Because it is a machine that folds your clothes for you.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:11.280
 So the company that have sort of talked about this and invented this say that they've worked

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.720
 out that the average person spends 9,000 hours of their life folding clothes.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.800
 Well, I bring that average really, really far down.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.800
 Yeah, me too.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.280
 I don't fold any of my clothes.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.920
 I do bring it quite far up again, because I fold my clothes very neatly.

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.220
 So Andy, as someone who does it a lot, you are wasting, according to them, 375 days of

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.220
 your life.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.220
 I don't think of it as wasting then.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.940
 I think I have a better life as a result, and I think with those, I wouldn't know what to

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:42.280
 do with that extra time, frankly, what am I going to do, something to beach somewhere?

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.280
 No, thanks.

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280
 I'll be folding.

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
 I'll be in the folding room.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.840
 Is that a beach with unfolded clothes?

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.300
 So this machine, it's been launched, and you can see a video, it's ridiculous, and you

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.140
 have to put in one shirt at a time, so far as I could see, you put it in.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:03.380
 It closes its doors like an oven, and then, after 10 minutes, it's folded your shirt.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.880
 10 minutes, I don't like to boast.

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.380
 But I've managed to get it down to something a little more like 7.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.140
 So what was the company, the Panasonic?

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.380
 Panasonic did this, yeah.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:24.340
 So I think we should give a little bit of balance, Samsung, have got some good innovations

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.540
 in washing machines at the moment.

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.860
 Some of the more recent innovations, I'm not quite sure what all these are, but the latest

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:38.780
 models have got EcoBubble, whatever that is, wobble technology, what that is, and a magic

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:39.780
 dispenser.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.780
 It is another nickname for the penis, actually.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:48.760
 Yeah, I don't want that magic dispenser setting anywhere near my clothes, but it's good

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.740
 to come out and wash.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:55.260
 Magic dispenser, and that's a lot of models in Samsung have got magic dispensers at the

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.260
 moment.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.740
 Samsung have an explosion setting at the moment, don't they?

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.260
 It was Samsung washing machines, it was exploding last year as well.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:08.380
 I don't think it was an actual setting on it, but yeah, they like their phones, they were

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.100
 exploding, and so they had to recall a lot of washing machines.

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.380
 I think it's one of the largest ever product recalls in history.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.860
 I think it was something like 2.8 million washing machines, and that is a lot.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.860
 That's a lot.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.380
 If you're wondering at home, that is a lot of washing machines.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.380
 How many was it?

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.380
 2.8 million, I think.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380
 Oh, that's a lot.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:29.460
 And they're still, actually, I read a news report about that this morning, they're still hunting

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.980
 for 5,000 in Western Australia.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:35.100
 They should do one of the helicopters.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.100
 They out in the wild?

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:37.100
 They are.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.940
 They roam in herds of 20 to 30.

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:41.940
 Yep, my washing machine escapes the other day.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:47.660
 And genuinely, it sits behind a cupboard door, so you know, you put it over the cupboard

00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.740
 door and the washing machine's behind it, and I put a wash on, and I came out and I

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:54.100
 had thrust the door open, and I was poking about four inches out of it.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.100
 Good job.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:56.100
 You got there in time.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.100
 Yeah.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:58.100
 It's a wrangle it back.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:01.620
 It could have been rampaging across London, as we speak.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:07.300
 I tried to find a scientific report on, you know, it's that trope you see that women sit

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.940
 on washing machines, because it leads to orgasms.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:11.820
 Because they've heard about the magic dispenser.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.820
 Yes, exactly.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.820
 Yeah.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:19.340
 But, no, I couldn't find anything except a lot of videos of women doing it, which I didn't

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340
 watch.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:21.340
 I was folding at that time.

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:22.340
 I know, that's what the video was.

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.660
 Because I had to watch a few to make sure that the line was correct.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.060
 Well, other naughty things you can do with washing machines.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:31.060
 Yeah.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.060
 Keep cocaine in them.

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:33.060
 Okay.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:36.940
 So, a policeman in Yorkshire has just been found guilty of a range of drug offences, but

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.660
 one of the things was he was taking drugs that the police had seized and then selling it

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.660
 back onto the streets.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.660
 Oh, yeah.

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:45.860
 He found out about this, so he's just been found guilty, hasn't been sentenced yet.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.820
 And he was found to be keeping 11 kilos of cocaine in his washing machine.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.220
 Was he like, because it's a white powder, and then you've got white powder going into

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.980
 your washing machine, so was he pretending it was personal?

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.420
 Well, all the detergents come out of the plastic bags, the detergent comes in again.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:06.740
 Well, the prosecution lawyer opened the case by asking the jury, what do you keep in your

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.140
 washing machine?

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:11.700
 Keith Boots had over 11 kilograms of cocaine worth hundreds of thousands of pounds

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.700
 on the street in his.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.420
 I found my cocoa pops in my washing machine the other day, and Phanella put them in there

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.500
 because at our house we were selling our flat at the moment, she thought they'd go through

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:28.900
 the cupboards and they would be put off by seeing a box of cocoa pops out, and she put it

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.620
 in the washing machine, but she didn't tell me.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.740
 So when I went to put the washing in the washing machine, my box of cocoa pops are sitting

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.740
 inside.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.500
 Was it that she thought they'd be put off by particularly dirty cocoa pops and they needed

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500
 to go to a cycle?

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.500
 No, just they just saw.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.660
 I always ask, my first question actually, on viewing any property, is are there any

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.140
 cocoa pops on the premises?

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.780
 I think it was partially that we didn't have space in the cupboard for it and she didn't

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.860
 want it out in display.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.320
 I think your wife is in Paris that you eat cocoa pops in the washing machine.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.060
 Do you keep finding the cocoa pops in the washing machine?

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.060
 Yeah.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.700
 I should put my crunchy nut in the dishwasher once.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.700
 Yeah.

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.500
 It's like a funny treasure hunt in my house, but breakfast in the mornings.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.860
 Have you guys heard of Ricky Maisel?

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860
 Yeah.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.860
 Ricky Maisel.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.860
 Ricky Maisel.

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.860
 No, who is that?

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:16.860
 No, who's he?

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.300
 Ricky Maisel says he's the world leader in escaping washing machines, right?

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:22.060
 So he climbs into a washing machine.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:25.420
 Or Dan's wife throws him into the washing machine because there's someone coming round.

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:29.300
 Well, he's got something to eat in there, don't he?

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.300
 That's what it is.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.900
 Is this where you have to go after you've had an argument, do you have to sleep in the

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.900
 washing machine?

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.500
 I'll be in the machine.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:43.140
 So Ricky gets into these machines, or Phinella puts him in there, and as long as they're

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.540
 in the machine with at least a 14 inch door on a 27 inch drum, apparently.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:52.780
 And he boasts that I have successfully escaped from 40 brands of washing machines in 42

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:53.780
 countries.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:54.780
 Wow.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.780
 Watch a video.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:56.780
 I've watched three.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.620
 That's why you and Dan were both sitting there watching washing machine videos, Dan of

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.620
 women sitting on them.

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.380
 And you have this bloke climbing out of them.

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:05.380
 He climbs in.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:08.660
 And the way it happens is it gets to you climbs in, and it's very small, it's impressive,

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:10.860
 and it gets turned on and you start spinning around.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.860
 It's turned on.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860
 Yeah, it gets turned on.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860
 That's pouring.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:19.860
 It starts spinning up and then after a certain amount of time, he starts banging really, really

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.780
 hard on the window, and the assistant has to stop it and let him out.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.780
 What is that?

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.700
 And that happens in all three videos.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.940
 I think that technically isn't as scary as it is.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.940
 Yeah.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:36.620
 It's like when Houdini's wife just lets him out of the hang.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.940
 So I think very much, don't try this at home.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940
 Yes.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.940
 I'm starting to question Ricky.

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:43.940
 I don't know.

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:46.940
 Well, yeah, I thought the claim to be a washing machine escapist was a strong one given that

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.740
 what you do is scream out for help and the person nearest has to open the machine.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:58.020
 I read a website saying that the first modern washing machine was invented in 1899, and I

00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:59.020
 don't think it's true.

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.020
 Ooh.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:04.820
 But when I was searching to see if it was true, I found a movie from 1899 called Scrubbums

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:08.620
 washing machine, and I can't find the video of it.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.140
 So I'm not sure if it even exists, because it's so old.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:16.460
 But there is a review from 1902, and it was two girls in a hotel laundry are experimenting

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.460
 with a new washing machine.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.460
 I've seen that video.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.300
 They turned the handle the wrong way, and the machine explodes, drenching them with

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.500
 suds and wrecking the place generally.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.700
 The scene is very humorous and exciting.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:29.700
 Mm.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:30.700
 Sounds great.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.700
 Sounds great.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:37.060
 So then I went onto IMDB and search for washing machine, and it's really weird.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.540
 There's hardly any movies called The Washing Machine, some most of cinematic history.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.540
 And then there was one in the '90s or something.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.860
 And then in 2010, there was a movie called The Washing Machine.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:53.820
 In 2012, there was a movie called The Washing Machine, and in 2014, there was also a movie

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.100
 called The Washing Machine, and there were all different movies.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100
 Wow.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.900
 So not reboots?

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.980
 Not reboots, completely different snopsies are completely different.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:03.980
 Wow.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.500
 And also, there is an actor called George Washing Machine.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.500
 No.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:14.220
 He's known for a country practice in 1981 and a place to call home from 2030.

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.580
 What is it one night's way?

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.060
 I would say he is not known for those.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:24.060
 In a very nice way, I think he is more known for being called George Washing Machine.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.020
 Is that double barrel, so a name or one?

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.020
 No, one word.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:31.060
 It could, I mean, unless it's some kind of auto-correcting IMDB or something, and it's

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.180
 supposed to be George Washington, but maybe he was called George Washington.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.420
 Oh, who was famously known for his cameo roles and whatever.

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:39.420
 What is the call home?

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.420
 What is the call home?

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.420
 Auto-correct is bad.

00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:42.420
 I don't think it's that bad.

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.060
 The name corrects Washington, a word and a name.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.020
 So my other thought is maybe he's called George Washington, and there's another one,

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:54.260
 a famous one, so he had to change his name, and this was the first thing he thought

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:55.260
 out.

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.260
 I don't know.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:02.380
 Standing in the utility room, looking around on the phone, Washington's taken.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.540
 George Coco Pops.

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:12.500
 I always reading that in Australia, researchers are on the brink of making a new innovation,

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.180
 which is clothes that wash themselves.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.180
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.180
 Wow.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.180
 So it's quite interesting.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:24.940
 It's all about the fabric that they're using, and what they're harnessing is sunlight.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:31.380
 The idea that as soon as sun touches the fabric, it burns off whatever organic matter is

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:33.540
 on top of the fabric itself.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.220
 So it says to grow special nanostructures, which can degrade organic matter when exposed

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:39.220
 to light.

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.220
 Hang on.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.660
 When I'm on the beach in the sun in my stained clothes, and they're when they're Andy who's

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:53.780
 folding in the hotel, the stains don't disappear as I expose myself to the sunshine.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:55.380
 Yeah, because you're not wearing the new technology.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.180
 You don't have the nanostructures.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.180
 Oh, so you need that.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:00.180
 So they're harnessing sunlight in a specific way.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.180
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.020
 It's like you can flash sunlight on something and it brings it.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.020
 Yeah, they're inventing this thing.

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.020
 Right.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.020
 Yeah.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:08.020
 Right.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.340
 I was reading a paper about the history of the washing machine, and it's written by a

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.100
 really angry man, who opened his paper by saying the entire history of washing machines

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:19.620
 is one of the most ignored and most misrepresented segments of the history of technology.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.260
 And the whole thing is a diatribe against all other washing machine historians who keep

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.420
 on misquoting these first washing machine patents.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.420
 He's really upset.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:32.060
 But I did find in the course of that, the patent for the travel washing machine, have you

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060
 guys seen this?

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.060
 Oh, no.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:36.740
 This is in 1952, and they actually trialed this.

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:40.500
 And the idea was that people were getting into going out in camper vans and they wanted to

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.380
 be able to wash their clothes on the road.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:46.500
 And it was a washing machine where you affix the drum to the wheel of your car, to the back

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:47.500
 wheel.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:48.500
 That's smart.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.100
 And as you drove, it spun around.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.100
 Very good.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.100
 Yeah.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:59.100
 And he's always killed after cutting into wrong washing machine.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:03.140
 Okay, that's it.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.140
 That's all of our facts.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.340
