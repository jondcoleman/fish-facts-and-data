00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,840
 to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,160
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray,

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,000
 and Anna Chazinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,560
 four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 with you.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
 Andy.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,080
 My fact is that sometimes racing ferrets fall asleep halfway along the course, so it's

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,760
 a bit like the tortoise and the hare story, so that the hare is a ferret.

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,200
 The tortoise is another ferret that doesn't roll asleep, all the animals are ferrets.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,800
 Yeah, and sometimes they fall asleep.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,360
 I've confused things too much by introducing them.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's a bit like sleeping beauty on the years of sleeping ferret.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,520
 Was she halfway through a ride?

16
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,280
 I miss that bit of the story.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
 Just the sleeping bit really.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 Right.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then a handsome prince turns up and kisses the ferret.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,160
 He's a ferret too.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,360
 This is an article from the Derby Telegraph who did a report.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
 They've had a ferret race up in Derby recently, at a place called Long Eaton, and there's

23
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,800
 no track what there is, is a tube, and every ferret has its own tube.

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,240
 Oh, I was going to say, not just one tube, but otherwise the person who goes in first will

25
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,240
 be the winner every time.

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,080
 And also, you could just fall asleep, and that's it, yeah.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,200
 That would be like having Bob sledding with just one of those courses and you'll go

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
 at one.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
 That is not the case in this race.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
 No.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,160
 Every ferret gets his or her own tube, and you race along it, and the coach has to encourage

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,200
 the ferret along to the other end.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,520
 But sometimes a ferret can be winning, according to his spokesman, and then decide to lie down

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,520
 for a nap.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
 So a race can take two minutes, or it can take ten minutes.

37
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
 This place in Long Eaton last year, they had a thing called ferret roulette.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,640
 Is it like Russian roulette?

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
 Yeah.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
 The ferret's got a gun.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,640
 Yeah, maybe.

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
 No, no, no.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,920
 You shoot a ferret into the side of your head.

44
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
 It's not like that, no?

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
 Okay.

46
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,720
 Where you had to bet on which tube a ferret would go down.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,000
 You could put on loads of different pairs of trousers, and one of them's got a ferret

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 on it.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,960
 Ah, that is ferret roulette.

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,960
 Yeah.

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,960
 That's really good.

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,800
 I read, I think it was the same one, tickets were £12 each.

53
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
 Is this the same one?

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 I didn't check it.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
 I didn't check the ticket prices, but how many ferret racing events can there have been

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
 in Long Eaton recently?

57
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,000
 Yeah, probably a few.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,160
 The tickets were £12 each, and they included a fish and chips supper.

59
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 Oh, okay.

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
 And it's very good.

61
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
 And it's very good.

62
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 I know, it's my local fish and chips shop.

63
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,000
 Fish chips and mushy peas is £9.80 on its own, so you're paying £2.20 for the ferrets,

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 really?

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 That's very reasonably priced.

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Good, isn't it?

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Yes, very good.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,840
 They should really make the tube see through, I've just realised, because I was thinking

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,920
 what you're really paying for was nothing, because you don't get to see any of it until

70
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
 the ferret pops out.

71
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,440
 Of course, the tube is see through.

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
 No, no, no, no.

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
 Yeah, no, Dan, it's not.

74
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
 Well, the one I watched.

75
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,400
 It's a solid, you've been watching the luxury ferret racing.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,200
 You've clearly paid a bit more than your 12 quid.

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,640
 No, there are sections of wire in the tube, so occasionally you see a ferret passing by.

78
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 Yeah.

79
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
 That's more like a way marker than a...

80
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,360
 That, my one's way better.

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,720
 You get to watch all the workings of the race.

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 Like a race.

83
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,200
 Imagine if there was like a pool cover on the top of an Olympics movie pool.

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,840
 You're like, well, let's see who pops out of the head.

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,600
 Oh, they all drowned, shouldn't have put that cover on them.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,120
 So if you guys heard about ferret legging, yeah, Scott, it's exciting.

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
 The best thing in the world.

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
 Yeah.

89
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,640
 So that's why you put a ferret down your trousers and you see how long you can keep it.

90
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,520
 You tie up the end of your trousers, put a ferret down there.

91
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,080
 It's nice for the ferret, because it reminds it of hunting rabbits, I presume.

92
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,080
 Yes.

93
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,680
 Well, what's it hunting in that case?

94
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,680
 What is it in your trousers that reminds the ferret of a banner?

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:17,720
 Oh, it's supposed to, you're not allowed to wear underwear in ferret legging.

96
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 Oh.

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 You have to have your genitals exposed, I think, in some of it.

98
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,720
 That's the expose.

99
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
 That's the expose.

100
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,720
 To the ferret, to the ferret.

101
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 To the ferret, yeah.

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,720
 It's really definitely would have got that memo wrong and could arrive.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
 Balls out.

104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,800
 But that's the only occasion where, actually, you can claim you're exposing yourself

105
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,720
 for a very good reason, which is to protect your genitals from the ferret.

106
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
 That's true.

107
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 I'm repeating, though.

108
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
 Officer.

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,680
 I think that this might have been enlist, first, actually, that one of the biggest names

110
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,560
 in ferret legging is Regimella.

111
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,880
 And he introduced the concept of wearing white trousers to better display the blood spilled

112
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,880
 from the bites.

113
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
 Oh.

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,760
 In 1972, the ferret legging records stood at 40 seconds, right?

115
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,720
 A few years later, it rose to over one minute and eventually to 90 minutes, which is quite

116
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
 a leap.

117
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 Yeah, that's.

118
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,120
 And then, in 1977, Edward Simpkins, from the Isle of Whites, set the new world record

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,640
 of 5,000-10 minutes, although he only had one ferret in his trousers during the first four

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,840
 hours and two for the last 70 minutes.

121
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,680
 Simpkins sustained two large bites during his record-breaking attempt, but continued to play

122
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,280
 a game of darts undeterred.

123
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 Wow.

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
 What a hero.

125
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
 How did he do in the darts?

126
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
 Did he do it?

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
 It doesn't relate.

128
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:34,840
 He actually won the BDO World Championships that year.

129
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,080
 Now, Pete Jockey Wilson in the final.

130
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,680
 But that's only because he trained the ferret to carry the dart over to the dart board.

131
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,040
 Apparently, what you're meant to do when you do ferret legging is to feed your ferret

132
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:55,240
 a lot, so you don't put a hungry ferret down your trousers, which is what leads to a lot

133
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,600
 of the bites, is because four hours in, they might get a bit hungry and start nibbling

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
 on you.

135
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,320
 You really feed your ferret, you should survive a bite, yeah.

136
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,560
 It's interesting because ferret is.

137
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,880
 I had a look in a slang dictionary, the partridge dictionary of slang, ferret is slang

138
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,440
 for penis, and it's also an RS slang term, which is rhyming slang for beret.

139
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,960
 It's not very good rhyming slang.

140
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,360
 It says in the dictionary, "Brecker's deliberately bad".

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,440
 I think you can tell by the turn of voice in which someone says, "I've got a ferret

142
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,280
 in my trousers, what kind of ferret they're talking about."

143
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
 You think so?

144
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,520
 I think it was always like, "I've got a ferret in my trousers!"

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,760
 That's a penis.

146
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,760
 Their band is Pat's, aren't they, in certain places, so New York, New York.

147
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
 Yeah.

148
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
 I wasn't allowed to bring money in.

149
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,200
 Do you know which area of Britain owns the most ferrets?

150
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
 London.

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
 Pretty much, yeah.

152
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,760
 London and the Southeast.

153
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:01,760
 It's traditionally thought to be a Northern or especially a Yorkshire thing, but 27% of

154
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,880
 the ferrets in the UK live in London and the Southeast.

155
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,280
 Yorkshire only has 7% of the ferrets.

156
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
 No.

157
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,280
 Are they domesticated or do we have wild ferret?

158
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,800
 This is I was Pat's, I think.

159
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
 Yeah, these are his pets.

160
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 Right.

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,920
 I have seen someone near where I live walking around a ferret on a leash.

162
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
 I was so excited.

163
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
 I've seen that before.

164
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
 Yeah.

165
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
 You can get little harnesses for them.

166
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,920
 Yeah.

167
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,920
 Pat ferret.

168
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
 Did he?

169
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,760
 John Mitchinson of QI.

170
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
 Wow, that's cool.

171
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
 I met him.

172
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,760
 We've had four men shot on a ferret.

173
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,760
 They're the meetings with him for years.

174
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
 He had big paws and whiskers.

175
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,760
 Yeah, that's good.

176
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
 Yeah.

177
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
 Pretty much.

178
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
 That's him.

179
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,760
 Cosden, you're trying to get into your trousers.

180
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
 Good old Mitch.

181
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,240
 So they're, they've really vicious, right?

182
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,240
 Animals in this kind of group like weasels and stokes and ferrets are.

183
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
 Stella die.

184
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
 Yeah, a mastella die.

185
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,480
 They're so voracious and such good hunters.

186
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,120
 So there was that David Atmerclip of a stoke that caught a rabbit that was 10 times its size

187
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,240
 and the way they do it is they wrap their bodies around the animal they're trying to catch

188
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,960
 so they're like a little snake and then they bite it always exactly between the skull

189
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,960
 and the spine.

190
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,480
 So it cuts that off.

191
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,560
 But yeah, they're really good hunters and one of the ways they hunt is by doing the,

192
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,480
 I think it's called the Weasel war dance and it's where they just flip their body around

193
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,960
 in insane kind of configuration.

194
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,080
 They can hypnotise a chicken, can't they?

195
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,800
 The idea is that they transfix their prey and their prey so distracted that they get slightly

196
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
 different to hypnotising a chicken.

197
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,320
 Is it if they've just, you know, this is what the All Blacks rugby team do before every

198
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
 game.

199
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
 Hypnotised chicken.

200
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,280
 That's their war dance is they hypnotise the England team into being completely hypnotising

201
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,160
 a rugby.

202
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,200
 Have you heard of the vigilante group, the 12 just men?

203
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
 No.

204
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,240
 They were in a Welsh market town called Newtown.

205
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,480
 There was a report about them in the independent in 1992 and what they did, they thought that

206
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,440
 the local punishments dished out to criminals, you know, like for vandalising and burglary

207
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,200
 and things like that were really pathetic and weak and that the police weren't doing

208
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
 anything.

209
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,320
 So they formed this vigilante group and they would find out about crimes and then they

210
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,640
 would, their spokesman said, "Our plan for keeping law and order is simple.

211
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,440
 Anyone we catch in the act of committing a crime will frog march off to the hills where

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,400
 there's nobody to hear the screams, will hold him down and slip Fred into his trousers."

213
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,640
 They had a ferret called Fred.

214
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,680
 What do you mean by ferret?

215
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,760
 It will be painful and terrifying, but it will teach him a lesson he won't forget in

216
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,760
 a hurry.

217
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,080
 Do you know, was a weasel's make their own fridges?

218
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,800
 Basically have their own fridge set up.

219
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
 They do.

220
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 They do.

221
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
 They do.

222
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,760
 They marzen electricity and they've made, no, they store food underground and they dig underground

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,720
 compartments near their den entrances.

224
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
 I don't see any.

225
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,720
 No, I see any.

226
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,280
 They have they've mastered the art of fridges.

227
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,640
 I would say they are somewhere along with the art of fridges, but mastery is a way off.

228
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,800
 And let me finish.

229
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,600
 They plug it into the main.

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 No, fine.

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,200
 They dig holes underground because they'll sometimes go on a big killing spree and then

232
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
 very, most of their prey underground where it's nice and cold so it gets preserved.

233
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,320
 But they can store huge numbers of things in there.

234
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,960
 So scientists once found a stash in Greenland that was stuffed with the carcasses of 150

235
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
 lemmings.

236
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,280
 Lemmings.

237
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,280
 Yeah, lemmings.

238
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,520
 It's a weasel serial killer who needs to be brought to justice immediately.

239
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,520
 Hang on.

240
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,120
 Am I thinking, lemmings like the size of a sheep, right?

241
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
 No.

242
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
 No, no, no.

243
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
 No, no, no.

244
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
 No, no, no.

245
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
 No, no, no.

246
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
 No, no, no.

247
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
 Like a giddy pig.

248
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
 What are you thinking of?

249
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,440
 I thought it was just this cave of dead sheep, 150 of them.

250
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
 What are you thinking of?

251
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
 Lemmings.

252
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,680
 You can't run off the cliff that Disney, no.

253
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,240
 But that's the myth, right?

254
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
 Yeah, exactly the truth.

255
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,280
 What, so the trope is like a hundred giddy pig size things ran off a cliff.

256
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
 That's cool.

257
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
 I mean, yeah.

258
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
 That was big.

259
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
 In my head, they were sheep size.

260
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
 Yeah.

261
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
 Okay, I mean, we're all learning.

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
 So this is great.

263
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
 You've learned about ferret fridges.

264
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,520
 I've learned about the size of an animal that everyone knows.

265
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,720
 Can I just tell you one thing about a different kind of animal racing?

266
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 Yeah.

267
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,160
 So I think the equivalent of ferret racing in the US is frog jumping contest.

268
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,080
 And this is based on a Mark Twain story.

269
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,600
 I think it was the story of the first story that made Mark Twain famous that he wrote in

270
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,240
 the 1860s, about a fictional frog jumping contest in a counting California, which now happens

271
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
 every year.

272
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,400
 And they attract up to 10,000 people, I think.

273
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,080
 Lots of people go and attend, and you can do stuff like blow on the frog's nether regions.

274
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,680
 And that kind of makes the job a bit harder.

275
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,480
 Or is that included in the 12-12-year issue?

276
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,960
 It's included in the NPV.

277
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,880
 So as fish and ships, do you want to blow up the anus of the frog?

278
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,960
 It's included, so.

279
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,760
 When it's a frog jumping competition, is it height, distance, speed, or what?

280
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,760
 I'm pretty sure it's distance, and I think they do three.

281
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,000
 They're allowed to do three jumps, and then they measure how far they've gone in three jumps.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,200
 It's like the hot pop and the hot pop.

283
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,760
 Oh, exactly.

284
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,960
 But they have to be played soothing music.

285
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,760
 So in the rules of this play, they don't, they like it.

286
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,280
 They like it.

287
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,360
 They prefer it.

288
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,320
 They like it if it is soothing music when you're blowing on a channel.

289
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,840
 It's a romantic scene.

290
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,880
 If you think about it, no, there are actually rules, say, when the frogs aren't working,

291
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,520
 they have to be kept on the ground.

292
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,040
 They have to be kept in a fridge.

293
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,800
 With a massive lemon.

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
 They have to be kept in the dark, in the cool, and be played soothing music to calm their nerves.

295
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
 Yeah.

296
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,440
 It sounds like the frogs get a pretty good deal out of this.

297
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
 Yeah.

298
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
 You get to go to a nice competition.

299
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,480
 You get your own green room, and then you get someone blowing on your genitals.

300
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,200
 I know what your ride is going to be on the next floor.

301
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,160
 God, hair dryer is in the dressing room, Mr. Murray.

302
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,920
 Can I, I really want to ask people something that I have to have a mystery.

303
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,560
 This is basically the reason I brought frogs, right, it was because I went to the countryside

304
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,520
 this weekend and I went on a walk and noticed a dead frog on the path I was on.

305
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
 Okay.

306
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,040
 And then another one, and then I was with this other person,

307
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,360
 and we counted the dead frogs, and in a space of about half a kilometer, we counted 59 dead frogs.

308
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 Okay.

309
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
 And not all of them squash.

310
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
 They were all black.

311
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,200
 They looked like they'd just been frozen in time, kind of black frogs.

312
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 And I don't know why.

313
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,640
 And I've tried looking up why there would suddenly be 59 dead frogs in the countryside of

314
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
 Oxfordshire.

315
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
 Yeah.

316
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
 And if anyone has any idea.

317
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,960
 What about if it was one of those supposedly things when it rains frogs?

318
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,280
 So if anyone has a better suggestion?

319
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,680
 Okay, so there is this idea that sometimes it rains frogs, right?

320
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 And the idea is that a water spout is created by like a mini tornado and it sucks it up into

321
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,240
 the air, and then they rain down.

322
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,040
 Now a lot of people think that they're not real, but what happens instead is it's been raining,

323
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,720
 pond kind of overflows.

324
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
 All of the frogs kind of go into the overflow bit of the pond, and then it dries up because

325
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,080
 it gets evaporated, and then they all have no water, so they all die.

326
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 Okay.

327
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,080
 Can I get that one?

328
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
 Yeah.

329
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,080
 Was it near water?

330
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 We looked for water.

331
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,680
 We think it must have been near water, because the dog disappeared and it came back wet.

332
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
 Yes.

333
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 So it was wet.

334
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 We've been in a garage.

335
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,280
 It's the sixtieth frog in its house.

336
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
 I love that.

337
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:25,280
 That's your method of divining for water is the dog wet.

338
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:33,880
 And we must keep moving then.

339
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

340
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,280
 Okay, my fat this week is that according to Venezuelan law, 90% of wheat must be made

341
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,480
 into loaves of bread rather than cakes or pastries.

342
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 Mm-hmm.

343
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 It's very harsh.

344
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 Why?

345
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,680
 Well, this is what they're calling the bread war in Venezuelan at the moment, and they're

346
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,880
 obviously having a lot of financial problems.

347
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,400
 And what the government don't want bakers to do is to waste flour on cakes and things

348
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
 like that.

349
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
 They want to make sure that they have enough bread for all of the people.

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
 And they're probably arresting people, aren't they?

351
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
 Oh, yeah.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,600
 Like for making brownies and stuff like that as well, it's not just, yeah.

353
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
 Really?

354
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 Yeah.

355
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,400
 But this is like the history really of how important bakers have been, you know, all

356
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,080
 the way through history, bakers have been one of the most important people in society.

357
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,000
 If they do anything wrong, they'll get punished a lot more than normal people.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,680
 It seemed like such a high-risk job looking into history and sort of recorded statements

359
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
 about if you mess with the weight of your bread, if you mess sell your bread, you will be

360
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 killed.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Like that.

362
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,200
 It was as harsh as you'll be killed or you'll be paraded through the towns.

363
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
 Get this.

364
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
 There was a thing where it's so in France, if you were found guilty of swindling customers,

365
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,400
 you would be imprisoned immediately and your shop would be walled up for two years,

366
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
 which is pretty serious.

367
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,600
 Or sometimes they would have all your crimes printed on a massive sheet of paper and they

368
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,400
 would make you wear a sandwich board through the streets.

369
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
 Oh, really?

370
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
 Yeah, it's quite cool.

371
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
 So sandwich board.

372
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
 Exactly, yeah.

373
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
 I don't think I'd call it a sandwich board at the time.

374
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,400
 And sometimes this is from a book about the history of it.

375
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,160
 The police just looked the other way and let angry customers, often women, beat the

376
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
 bakers up.

377
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 Oh.

378
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,160
 Yeah.

379
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
 No way.

380
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,160
 There was a law in Britain until 2008 that you couldn't sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.

381
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,160
 Right.

382
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,560
 The law was that you had to sell it in 400 grams or 800 grams or 1,200 grams, it had to be

383
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,960
 a multiple of 400.

384
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
 Really?

385
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,760
 That was a law that was from the size of bread and ale in 1266.

386
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Wow.

387
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,160
 And it was still going into 2008 when they made it legal to sell a 600 gram loaf of bread.

388
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,760
 But I think most loaves are still 400 or 800 grams, aren't they?

389
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,760
 Yeah.

390
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
 Yeah.

391
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 So even now it's still happening.

392
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,160
 Well, yeah, that's just a leftover from the olden days.

393
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
 Yeah.

394
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,300
 And the myth that this is where bakers doesn't come from.

395
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,820
 So it's the idea is that because bakers were so afraid of being punished for underselling

396
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,800
 to customers, they would always give them a little bit more than they'd ordered, wasn't

397
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
 it?

398
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
 I don't know.

399
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
 Yeah, stopped.

400
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
 And I think that's, I think it's been written in various places that that's where bakers

401
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,600
 doesn't come from.

402
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,320
 I've never seen anyone asserting that it was a myth.

403
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
 OK.

404
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
 And it's the kind of thing that I would have seen, I think.

405
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,320
 So I think it maybe is true.

406
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
 Yeah.

407
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
 I don't know.

408
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
 Right.

409
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,440
 So that, then, keep it to yourself.

410
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,080
 There was a paranoia in the 18th century that bakers would steal human bones and ashes, and

411
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,600
 they would use the bone ash to increase the weight of their flour.

412
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 This is not true.

413
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,400
 There's no evidence it ever happened, but people really hated bakers.

414
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,680
 And as a result, well, not as a result, but just in general, bakers had to carve their

415
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,360
 initials into the underside of every loaf of bread they made.

416
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 Really?

417
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
 Yeah.

418
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,360
 To sort of show this was made by Fred the Baker and it's the--

419
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
 F2B.

420
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,360
 F2B.

421
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
 Yeah.

422
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
 It's the appropriate weight.

423
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,640
 So in 2009, Venezuela banned video games where you shoot people.

424
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
 Did they?

425
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,520
 Yeah, because there was so much shooting going on that they thought that this is just not

426
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
 a good influence.

427
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,240
 So they actually took a stand and completely banned it.

428
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,960
 But anyway, one other thing that they almost banned quite recently, it's because they went

429
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,120
 through an energy crisis.

430
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,560
 The president did come out and say he urged all women to stop using hair dryers because

431
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,400
 that was using up too much energy.

432
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,160
 He thought hair dryers specifically were causing huge shortages.

433
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,640
 What people using them to blow on the genitals of frogs and jumping competitions?

434
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,560
 He said, I think a woman-- this was his justification for why they should stop.

435
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,400
 I think a woman looks better when she runs her fingers through her hair and lets it dry naturally.

436
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,240
 But yeah, they tried to stop hair dryers in Venezuela as well.

437
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,680
 Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves.

438
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
 Does it really?

439
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 Yeah.

440
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
 Oh, wow.

441
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,840
 South of Arabia in 2010.

442
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
 That's amazing.

443
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,040
 The first documented shipment of petroleum from Venezuela was in 1539 when a single barrel

444
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,920
 of oil was sent to Spain to alleviate the gout of Emperor Charles V.

445
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 Wow.

446
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
 There's oil stuff.

447
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 It's great.

448
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,920
 Can you send another million barrels?

449
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
 No, please.

450
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,000
 Our gouts got really bad.

451
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 The first bread maker was horse-powered that I could find.

452
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 The baker was horse-powered?

453
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 No.

454
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 It's a dough mixer.

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,320
 It's a mechanical dough mixer that was referenced in 150 BC.

456
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,400
 It was invented actually by a freed slave and it was this massive basin and it had wooden

457
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,080
 paddles in it that would mix the dough around and horses were attached to them so they'd

458
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
 just go round and round and mix up the dough.

459
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
 Wow.

460
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
 Quite cool.

461
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
 First bread was horse-drawn.

462
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,480
 Yeah.

463
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
 Just one more thing about Venezuela.

464
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
 Yeah.

465
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
 Do you know what it means?

466
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
 The name, Venezuela.

467
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
 Oh.

468
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
 It means little Venice.

469
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,480
 Oh, I did know that.

470
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,160
 It's quite of the fact that this is almost completely unlike the North London area known as

471
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
 little Venice.

472
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,000
 It's not even like Venice either, really.

473
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,960
 No, but they will have named it when they arrived at the Gulf of Marrakayba or whatever it's

474
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,960
 called.

475
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,960
 Yeah.

476
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,960
 Exactly.

477
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
 Lake Marrakayba, yeah.

478
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,960
 It wasn't just thought there's water here.

479
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
 There's water in Venice.

480
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
 It's the dog's wet.

481
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,440
 That's exactly what I know.

482
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,480
 It was a Marigo Vespucci, who is a American named after him or do we think it's not?

483
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,160
 Well, QI thinks it's not.

484
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 I think it is.

485
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 I think it is as well.

486
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 Okay.

487
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,560
 But when he got there, whatever the rights and wrongs of that particular story, he saw

488
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,640
 indigenous stilt houses which were designed to avoid floods and a guy in a gondola.

489
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
 Yeah.

490
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,640
 And a cornetto.

491
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
 Is that what they have?

492
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
 Yeah.

493
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,240
 So he said this is just like Venice.

494
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:46,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chuzinski.

495
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,600
 My fact this week is that GCHQ has an internal ghost hunting club.

496
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
 So cool.

497
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,160
 This is internal ghost hunting.

498
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,080
 It's not looking for internal ghosts.

499
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,440
 Find your inner ghost.

500
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,720
 Wait, is it that they're the first group of spooks to be found looking for ghosts?

501
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 Oh.

502
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
 No, it's not that neat.

503
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
 Right, got it.

504
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
 Cool.

505
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,040
 So this came out a couple of years ago.

506
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,560
 It's come out in 2013 actually.

507
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:17,440
 It was the WikiLeaks leak of lots of GCHQ correspondence, a lot of which was very important.

508
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,480
 And then there was this, which was just an exchange of emails that confirmed it's got a ghost

509
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,240
 hunting group and it arranges trips to kind of haunted houses.

510
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,280
 It's advertised to staff and partners whether they're skeptics or believers.

511
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,360
 And yes, for visits to reputedly haunted properties, how they spend this bird time.

512
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,240
 Yeah, so that was a part of a Edward Snowden leak, that was the big Edward Snowden leak.

513
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,320
 And it was that, it was one bit of it, wasn't it, where it kind of showed the inside social

514
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,800
 life of the people who work at GCHQ, because it goes beyond just having a ghost hunting club.

515
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,560
 It would be weird if that was the only social life I've ever had.

516
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:03,680
 Look at the noticeboards, there's only one that is covered in exoplanes.

517
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:11,200
 But yeah, apparently they have their own in sort of internal social media platform, which

518
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
 is called a pun on my space, spy space.

519
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,760
 It's good that you clarified what that was a pun, otherwise we wouldn't have got it.

520
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,880
 They should call it Facebook, what's that parody pun?

521
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:33,640
 So they have a good social secretary in GCHQ and it sounds like they have a really fun time.

522
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,920
 So there was another bit of correspondence that was leaked about the football tournament.

523
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,640
 They have a sports day every year and the main event is a football tournament in which

524
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,240
 every team has to have one lady player at all times.

525
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,760
 So I thought saying lady player sounds like a weirdly old fashioned term.

526
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,360
 It also sounds like a bloke who sleeps around.

527
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,520
 I guess I'm a bit of a lady player.

528
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,440
 Yeah, maybe that's what it was asking for.

529
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,120
 It was amazing though, the football tournament they had in which that rule was issued came

530
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,320
 with a six-page rule book.

531
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,040
 It said the wearing of shimpads is caps lock on compulsory caps lock off.

532
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,360
 There were a lot of capsules in the correspondence and it made me think they're a bit trumpy in

533
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,000
 the way they communicate in GCHQ.

534
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,680
 They need to chill out a little bit.

535
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,960
 Do you think maybe GCHQ learned the art of shouting in capitals from Trump when they were

536
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
 whitesapping him?

537
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,440
 Oh yeah, good boy.

538
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,440
 And if you're listening, guys, and we know you are naughty, you can't believe you're whitesapping

539
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,440
 Trump.

540
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,920
 I think it's been from there from the beginning because if you look at it, you'll notice

541
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,640
 GCHQ is written completely in capitals for every single time.

542
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
 So they sometimes do think little things to engage with the public.

543
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,240
 Obviously, they're very, very secretive, but they had this Christmas card puzzle last year,

544
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
 which you may remember.

545
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
 Yes.

546
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,120
 So 600,000 people tried at least the opening stage, which is amazing, that's 1% of everyone

547
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,920
 in the country.

548
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,520
 Nobody got it in the time allocated.

549
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,200
 Three people got close and they each won a paperweight.

550
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,200
 Right.

551
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 What was the actual prize if you got it all?

552
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
 I don't know.

553
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,200
 You became a spy.

554
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 I believe so, yeah.

555
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,200
 Do you reckon they tell us if the person got it and was become a spy?

556
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,200
 That's a good point.

557
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,280
 There's a picture on the front cover of a newspaper.

558
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,280
 Maybe hundreds of people got it.

559
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,280
 They all become spies.

560
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
 Yeah, you're right.

561
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:22,120
 That is, I just can't believe that if you're in the top three of 600,000 people, they're just

562
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,080
 giving you one paperweight.

563
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,800
 That must be a code for something.

564
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
 Yeah, exactly.

565
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,040
 It must be an extra bit of puzzle.

566
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,800
 On the bottom of the paperweight, it says Midnight Tower Bridge.

567
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
 Yes.

568
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:35,640
 Leave your family behind.

569
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,600
 We're going ghost hunting.

570
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,840
 I went on the GCHQ website and they have some FAQs there.

571
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,840
 Oh, yeah.

572
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,840
 FAQ.

573
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,840
 Does GCHQ have rabbits running around the garden in the middle of the building?

574
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,840
 What?

575
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,280
 Answer, sadly no.

576
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,840
 We don't have rabbits in our garden.

577
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,440
 The only wildlife we have here are ladybirds, burrows and pigeons.

578
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
 Why would they...

579
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,200
 I think they're ducking the big questions about their role in working with the NSA.

580
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,680
 You might be right about that or I might have deliberately chosen the most reasonable

581
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
 of all the questions.

582
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,960
 Oh, maybe it's a bit of both.

583
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,640
 Do they have any moles?

584
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 Very good.

585
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,640
 Yes, very good.

586
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,640
 Very good.

587
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,640
 Well, there is a question.

588
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,080
 Do you have a network of underground tunnels beneath Cheltenham so staff can move around

589
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,120
 the town without getting stuck in traffic?

590
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
 Yes.

591
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,040
 And have all their ferret racing tournaments in privacy.

592
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,720
 It sounds like Midnight was a ferret asking about the rabbits, actually.

593
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,160
 Maybe FAQs is ferret asking questions.

594
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,880
 What is the...

595
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,040
 So I know that GCHQ is involved in code cracking and deciphering and stuff.

596
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,760
 Are they the sort of digital security for the UK?

597
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,280
 It's eavesdropping, basically.

598
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,680
 I think it's essentially our eavesdropping agency.

599
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,960
 So it's tapping into people's phones, it's hacking into people's computers, that kind of thing.

600
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,560
 But predominantly office-based, as opposed to in the field.

601
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,520
 Yes, so I actually read an interview with a woman called Annie MacMahon.

602
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,800
 I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce her name, but she worked at MI5.

603
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,560
 And she was describing the difference between MI5, MI6 and GCHQ staff.

604
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,600
 And she said, GCHQ staff tend to be the boffins, the types that are technically brilliant

605
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,600
 at things like coding and encryption, but perhaps not brilliant at a party.

606
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 Okay.

607
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
 That's their vibe.

608
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:33,400
 Another Edward Snowden leak was, it was a list of GCHQ techniques and their code names.

609
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,400
 Yeah.

610
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
 And then if you saw that, some quite good names.

611
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,120
 The ones which the newspaper article picked up on were concrete donkey, angry pirate and

612
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,000
 swamp donkey.

613
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,440
 And then a few others that I found, not allergy, country file, dirty devil, clumsy beekeeper and

614
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
 pistrix.

615
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
 Wow.

616
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,520
 Is that the Donald Trump related?

617
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,720
 Hacking wiretapping operation.

618
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,560
 They were all so technical, I couldn't really understand what they meant.

619
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,560
 Okay.

620
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,320
 I met a, years ago, I made a UFO documentary, remember that?

621
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,080
 I can 2014 and I went around meeting a lot of people who both believe in UFOs, but I met

622
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:22,000
 one guy as well called Mark Pilkington, who made a documentary about the idea that governments

623
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,440
 are seeding disinformation into the field of ufology and things generally.

624
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,720
 So they're kind of creating distractions.

625
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,760
 And part of the leaks from the Snowden leak was a PowerPoint that showed members who

626
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,200
 worked with GCHQ how to spread disinformation.

627
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,920
 It was a whole thing, really interesting.

628
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,960
 So do we think this whole ghost-tunting malarkey is just a bit of a red herring to throw

629
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,840
 us off the center of the fact that they're hacking into all of our secret information?

630
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,160
 Maybe they're going, oh, I believe that the Russian Embassy is haunted.

631
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,560
 That's good to see if we can find some ghosts.

632
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,160
 Oh, I think your laptop is haunted, isn't it, even though?

633
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,160
 Look, the mouse is moving all by itself.

634
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,120
 So outside the front of GCHQ, there were these things called the listening stones.

635
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,560
 Have you guys heard of this?

636
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
 An artist created them.

637
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,960
 There's these giant, there's nine of these stones and they're carved with codes and some

638
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,160
 of them have just odd headlines.

639
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:30,400
 So the theory is that the stones are using a very old theory about what ghosts were, which

640
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,760
 is have you heard of the Stone Tape theory?

641
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,760
 No.

642
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,120
 Stone Tape theory, this was put out in the 1960s, I believe.

643
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,080
 The idea is that this person thought that when you exude energy, energy can latch onto

644
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,920
 things in life.

645
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,680
 And so the idea is that ghosts are merely a sort of audio recording, as it were, not the

646
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:56,800
 spirit of someone that's hanging around as dead, but it's sort of left over energy.

647
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,280
 If you're getting murdered, you exude a lot of energy and it traps it there.

648
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:06,920
 And so the idea is that the listening stones are there to trap human conversations that

649
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 they can later listen to.

650
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:14,000
 If GCHQ is spending all of our taxpayers money just eavesdropping on these stones outside

651
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
 the building, you'd be very disappointed, is that what they're doing?

652
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,120
 They think that dead people have trapped their voices inside these stones and that's

653
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,040
 how they're trying to voice it out.

654
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:28,440
 The blog society ex believes so, as you go back to doing their proper job, tapping Donald

655
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,720
 Trump's emails for Barack Obama.

656
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:41,320
 OK, it's time for a final fact of the show.

657
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,520
 And that is my fact.

658
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,320
 My fact this week is that there are now washing machines in India that have a button specifically

659
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
 for curry stains.

660
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,560
 Is it really a button just says curry?

661
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
 Yeah.

662
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,600
 Well, I saw a picture on the BBC website and I don't know if they mocked it up as a sort

663
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,040
 of joke picture, but there's one extra button which is a setting.

664
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,680
 Obviously, this is a panasonic.

665
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,240
 It's a digital interface kind of thing, but it says curry.

666
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,760
 And then it says oil as well.

667
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
 There is one.

668
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,120
 It's an extra setting for hair oil.

669
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
 Yes.

670
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
 Yeah.

671
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,800
 So basically, what they've, what they've realised is obviously the main staple of food

672
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:22,840
 in India is curry and the way that it breaks down in a washing machine isn't that good.

673
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,080
 Predominantly, that's the main stain that you're getting as well.

674
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,640
 So they wanted to deal with that.

675
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,120
 So panasonic have spent two years analysing the ingredients of curry.

676
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,400
 They've been studying water temperatures and so on.

677
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,960
 And they've now worked out a way that removes the stains properly.

678
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,080
 But not many people have washing machines in India.

679
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,400
 It's only about 10% of the population.

680
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:48,280
 So it's a sort of just an innovation that I guess 10% of a billion still are lost.

681
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:52,720
 I just quite like the niche sort of, the dealing of niche stains.

682
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 It's very exciting.

683
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,120
 They've worked out sort of the optimal current strength of the water and the optimum, you

684
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,440
 know, the washing time.

685
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,600
 It just sounds like a very intense washing cycle.

686
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,120
 You know, when you go to different settings on your washing machine, it claims this is

687
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,800
 for cotton, this is for special weave, this is for, and actually, isn't it just that

688
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
 the time goes up and up and up?

689
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
 Temperature.

690
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,240
 And yeah, time and temperature go up and up and up.

691
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
 And maybe it's a spin, I think it might be the spin speed, too.

692
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,440
 Possibly.

693
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,960
 But they're not, they're adding in any special ingredient, do we think?

694
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
 They suddenly inject in some kind of acid as soon as you click curry.

695
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,520
 If you get a red curry on your clothes, you have to wash it out with white curry immediately.

696
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
 It's very cool.

697
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,720
 Will we get, are they going to do a British one for what?

698
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:44,220
 Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what they would do for us, I mean, it would, it would also

699
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,240
 be curry, that's true.

700
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,960
 They have, though, panasonic.

701
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,080
 It's not the only sort of laundry product that they've been looking into.

702
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,360
 They've funded 10% of this new product, which some people have dubbed a lawn droid.

703
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,920
 Because it is a machine that folds your clothes for you.

704
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,280
 So the company that have sort of talked about this and invented this say that they've worked

705
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,720
 out that the average person spends 9,000 hours of their life folding clothes.

706
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,800
 Well, I bring that average really, really far down.

707
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
 Yeah, me too.

708
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,280
 I don't fold any of my clothes.

709
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,920
 I do bring it quite far up again, because I fold my clothes very neatly.

710
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:32,220
 So Andy, as someone who does it a lot, you are wasting, according to them, 375 days of

711
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,220
 your life.

712
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,220
 I don't think of it as wasting then.

713
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,940
 I think I have a better life as a result, and I think with those, I wouldn't know what to

714
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,280
 do with that extra time, frankly, what am I going to do, something to beach somewhere?

715
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 No, thanks.

716
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 I'll be folding.

717
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,280
 I'll be in the folding room.

718
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,840
 Is that a beach with unfolded clothes?

719
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,300
 So this machine, it's been launched, and you can see a video, it's ridiculous, and you

720
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,140
 have to put in one shirt at a time, so far as I could see, you put it in.

721
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:03,380
 It closes its doors like an oven, and then, after 10 minutes, it's folded your shirt.

722
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,880
 10 minutes, I don't like to boast.

723
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,380
 But I've managed to get it down to something a little more like 7.

724
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,140
 So what was the company, the Panasonic?

725
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,380
 Panasonic did this, yeah.

726
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:24,340
 So I think we should give a little bit of balance, Samsung, have got some good innovations

727
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,540
 in washing machines at the moment.

728
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,860
 Some of the more recent innovations, I'm not quite sure what all these are, but the latest

729
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:38,780
 models have got EcoBubble, whatever that is, wobble technology, what that is, and a magic

730
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
 dispenser.

731
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,780
 It is another nickname for the penis, actually.

732
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,760
 Yeah, I don't want that magic dispenser setting anywhere near my clothes, but it's good

733
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,740
 to come out and wash.

734
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,260
 Magic dispenser, and that's a lot of models in Samsung have got magic dispensers at the

735
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
 moment.

736
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,740
 Samsung have an explosion setting at the moment, don't they?

737
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,260
 It was Samsung washing machines, it was exploding last year as well.

738
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,380
 I don't think it was an actual setting on it, but yeah, they like their phones, they were

739
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,100
 exploding, and so they had to recall a lot of washing machines.

740
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,380
 I think it's one of the largest ever product recalls in history.

741
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,860
 I think it was something like 2.8 million washing machines, and that is a lot.

742
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
 That's a lot.

743
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,380
 If you're wondering at home, that is a lot of washing machines.

744
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,380
 How many was it?

745
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
 2.8 million, I think.

746
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
 Oh, that's a lot.

747
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,460
 And they're still, actually, I read a news report about that this morning, they're still hunting

748
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,980
 for 5,000 in Western Australia.

749
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,100
 They should do one of the helicopters.

750
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,100
 They out in the wild?

751
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
 They are.

752
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,940
 They roam in herds of 20 to 30.

753
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,940
 Yep, my washing machine escapes the other day.

754
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,660
 And genuinely, it sits behind a cupboard door, so you know, you put it over the cupboard

755
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,740
 door and the washing machine's behind it, and I put a wash on, and I came out and I

756
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,100
 had thrust the door open, and I was poking about four inches out of it.

757
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
 Good job.

758
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
 You got there in time.

759
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
 Yeah.

760
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,100
 It's a wrangle it back.

761
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,620
 It could have been rampaging across London, as we speak.

762
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,300
 I tried to find a scientific report on, you know, it's that trope you see that women sit

763
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,940
 on washing machines, because it leads to orgasms.

764
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,820
 Because they've heard about the magic dispenser.

765
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
 Yes, exactly.

766
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,820
 Yeah.

767
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,340
 But, no, I couldn't find anything except a lot of videos of women doing it, which I didn't

768
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,340
 watch.

769
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,340
 I was folding at that time.

770
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
 I know, that's what the video was.

771
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,660
 Because I had to watch a few to make sure that the line was correct.

772
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,060
 Well, other naughty things you can do with washing machines.

773
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
 Yeah.

774
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,060
 Keep cocaine in them.

775
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
 Okay.

776
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:36,940
 So, a policeman in Yorkshire has just been found guilty of a range of drug offences, but

777
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,660
 one of the things was he was taking drugs that the police had seized and then selling it

778
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
 back onto the streets.

779
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,660
 Oh, yeah.

780
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,860
 He found out about this, so he's just been found guilty, hasn't been sentenced yet.

781
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,820
 And he was found to be keeping 11 kilos of cocaine in his washing machine.

782
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:54,220
 Was he like, because it's a white powder, and then you've got white powder going into

783
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,980
 your washing machine, so was he pretending it was personal?

784
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,420
 Well, all the detergents come out of the plastic bags, the detergent comes in again.

785
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:06,740
 Well, the prosecution lawyer opened the case by asking the jury, what do you keep in your

786
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,140
 washing machine?

787
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,700
 Keith Boots had over 11 kilograms of cocaine worth hundreds of thousands of pounds

788
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
 on the street in his.

789
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,420
 I found my cocoa pops in my washing machine the other day, and Phanella put them in there

790
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,500
 because at our house we were selling our flat at the moment, she thought they'd go through

791
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,900
 the cupboards and they would be put off by seeing a box of cocoa pops out, and she put it

792
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,620
 in the washing machine, but she didn't tell me.

793
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,740
 So when I went to put the washing in the washing machine, my box of cocoa pops are sitting

794
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
 inside.

795
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,500
 Was it that she thought they'd be put off by particularly dirty cocoa pops and they needed

796
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,500
 to go to a cycle?

797
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,500
 No, just they just saw.

798
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,660
 I always ask, my first question actually, on viewing any property, is are there any

799
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,140
 cocoa pops on the premises?

800
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:49,780
 I think it was partially that we didn't have space in the cupboard for it and she didn't

801
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,860
 want it out in display.

802
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,320
 I think your wife is in Paris that you eat cocoa pops in the washing machine.

803
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,060
 Do you keep finding the cocoa pops in the washing machine?

804
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
 Yeah.

805
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,700
 I should put my crunchy nut in the dishwasher once.

806
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,700
 Yeah.

807
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,500
 It's like a funny treasure hunt in my house, but breakfast in the mornings.

808
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,860
 Have you guys heard of Ricky Maisel?

809
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
 Yeah.

810
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
 Ricky Maisel.

811
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
 Ricky Maisel.

812
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,860
 No, who is that?

813
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
 No, who's he?

814
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,300
 Ricky Maisel says he's the world leader in escaping washing machines, right?

815
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,060
 So he climbs into a washing machine.

816
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,420
 Or Dan's wife throws him into the washing machine because there's someone coming round.

817
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,300
 Well, he's got something to eat in there, don't he?

818
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,300
 That's what it is.

819
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,900
 Is this where you have to go after you've had an argument, do you have to sleep in the

820
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
 washing machine?

821
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
 I'll be in the machine.

822
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:43,140
 So Ricky gets into these machines, or Phinella puts him in there, and as long as they're

823
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,540
 in the machine with at least a 14 inch door on a 27 inch drum, apparently.

824
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:52,780
 And he boasts that I have successfully escaped from 40 brands of washing machines in 42

825
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,780
 countries.

826
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
 Wow.

827
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
 Watch a video.

828
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
 I've watched three.

829
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:00,620
 That's why you and Dan were both sitting there watching washing machine videos, Dan of

830
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,620
 women sitting on them.

831
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,380
 And you have this bloke climbing out of them.

832
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
 He climbs in.

833
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,660
 And the way it happens is it gets to you climbs in, and it's very small, it's impressive,

834
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,860
 and it gets turned on and you start spinning around.

835
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
 It's turned on.

836
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
 Yeah, it gets turned on.

837
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,860
 That's pouring.

838
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:19,860
 It starts spinning up and then after a certain amount of time, he starts banging really, really

839
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,780
 hard on the window, and the assistant has to stop it and let him out.

840
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,780
 What is that?

841
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,700
 And that happens in all three videos.

842
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,940
 I think that technically isn't as scary as it is.

843
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
 Yeah.

844
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,620
 It's like when Houdini's wife just lets him out of the hang.

845
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,940
 So I think very much, don't try this at home.

846
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
 Yes.

847
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
 I'm starting to question Ricky.

848
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
 I don't know.

849
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,940
 Well, yeah, I thought the claim to be a washing machine escapist was a strong one given that

850
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:52,740
 what you do is scream out for help and the person nearest has to open the machine.

851
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,020
 I read a website saying that the first modern washing machine was invented in 1899, and I

852
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,020
 don't think it's true.

853
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,020
 Ooh.

854
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,820
 But when I was searching to see if it was true, I found a movie from 1899 called Scrubbums

855
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,620
 washing machine, and I can't find the video of it.

856
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,140
 So I'm not sure if it even exists, because it's so old.

857
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:16,460
 But there is a review from 1902, and it was two girls in a hotel laundry are experimenting

858
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,460
 with a new washing machine.

859
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,460
 I've seen that video.

860
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:24,300
 They turned the handle the wrong way, and the machine explodes, drenching them with

861
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,500
 suds and wrecking the place generally.

862
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,700
 The scene is very humorous and exciting.

863
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
 Mm.

864
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
 Sounds great.

865
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
 Sounds great.

866
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,060
 So then I went onto IMDB and search for washing machine, and it's really weird.

867
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,540
 There's hardly any movies called The Washing Machine, some most of cinematic history.

868
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,540
 And then there was one in the '90s or something.

869
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:48,860
 And then in 2010, there was a movie called The Washing Machine.

870
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,820
 In 2012, there was a movie called The Washing Machine, and in 2014, there was also a movie

871
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,100
 called The Washing Machine, and there were all different movies.

872
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
 Wow.

873
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,900
 So not reboots?

874
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,980
 Not reboots, completely different snopsies are completely different.

875
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
 Wow.

876
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,500
 And also, there is an actor called George Washing Machine.

877
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,500
 No.

878
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:14,220
 He's known for a country practice in 1981 and a place to call home from 2030.

879
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,580
 What is it one night's way?

880
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,060
 I would say he is not known for those.

881
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,060
 In a very nice way, I think he is more known for being called George Washing Machine.

882
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,020
 Is that double barrel, so a name or one?

883
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,020
 No, one word.

884
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,060
 It could, I mean, unless it's some kind of auto-correcting IMDB or something, and it's

885
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,180
 supposed to be George Washington, but maybe he was called George Washington.

886
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,420
 Oh, who was famously known for his cameo roles and whatever.

887
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,420
 What is the call home?

888
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,420
 What is the call home?

889
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,420
 Auto-correct is bad.

890
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,420
 I don't think it's that bad.

891
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,060
 The name corrects Washington, a word and a name.

892
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,020
 So my other thought is maybe he's called George Washington, and there's another one,

893
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,260
 a famous one, so he had to change his name, and this was the first thing he thought

894
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,260
 out.

895
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,260
 I don't know.

896
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:02,380
 Standing in the utility room, looking around on the phone, Washington's taken.

897
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,540
 George Coco Pops.

898
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:12,500
 I always reading that in Australia, researchers are on the brink of making a new innovation,

899
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,180
 which is clothes that wash themselves.

900
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,180
 Oh, yeah.

901
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,180
 Wow.

902
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,180
 So it's quite interesting.

903
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:24,940
 It's all about the fabric that they're using, and what they're harnessing is sunlight.

904
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:31,380
 The idea that as soon as sun touches the fabric, it burns off whatever organic matter is

905
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,540
 on top of the fabric itself.

906
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:38,220
 So it says to grow special nanostructures, which can degrade organic matter when exposed

907
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
 to light.

908
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
 Hang on.

909
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,660
 When I'm on the beach in the sun in my stained clothes, and they're when they're Andy who's

910
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:53,780
 folding in the hotel, the stains don't disappear as I expose myself to the sunshine.

911
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,380
 Yeah, because you're not wearing the new technology.

912
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,180
 You don't have the nanostructures.

913
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
 Oh, so you need that.

914
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,180
 So they're harnessing sunlight in a specific way.

915
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
 Yeah, yeah.

916
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,020
 It's like you can flash sunlight on something and it brings it.

917
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,020
 Yeah, they're inventing this thing.

918
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,020
 Right.

919
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
 Yeah.

920
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,020
 Right.

921
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,340
 I was reading a paper about the history of the washing machine, and it's written by a

922
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,100
 really angry man, who opened his paper by saying the entire history of washing machines

923
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,620
 is one of the most ignored and most misrepresented segments of the history of technology.

924
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,260
 And the whole thing is a diatribe against all other washing machine historians who keep

925
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,420
 on misquoting these first washing machine patents.

926
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,420
 He's really upset.

927
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,060
 But I did find in the course of that, the patent for the travel washing machine, have you

928
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
 guys seen this?

929
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,060
 Oh, no.

930
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,740
 This is in 1952, and they actually trialed this.

931
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,500
 And the idea was that people were getting into going out in camper vans and they wanted to

932
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,380
 be able to wash their clothes on the road.

933
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:46,500
 And it was a washing machine where you affix the drum to the wheel of your car, to the back

934
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
 wheel.

935
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
 That's smart.

936
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,100
 And as you drove, it spun around.

937
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,100
 Very good.

938
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,100
 Yeah.

939
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:59,100
 And he's always killed after cutting into wrong washing machine.

940
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,140
 Okay, that's it.

941
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
 That's all of our facts.

942
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,340
