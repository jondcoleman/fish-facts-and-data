00:00:09,00:00:17,Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing
00:00:17,00:00:19,"as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast."
00:00:19,00:00:23,"This week, coming to you live from Red Roof."
00:00:23,00:00:25,[cheering]
00:00:28,00:00:30,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:30,00:00:34,"I am sitting here with Aniches Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:34,00:00:35,and James Harkin.
00:00:35,00:00:38,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:38,00:00:41,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:41,00:00:44,"And in no particular order, here, we go."
00:00:44,00:00:46,Starting with fact number one.
00:00:46,00:00:48,And that's my fact this week.
00:00:48,00:00:52,"My fact is, after the author George Elliott died,"
00:00:52,00:00:55,her family spent 50 years publicly denying
00:00:55,00:00:58,that she had a massive right hand.
00:00:58,00:01:01,[laughing]
00:01:01,00:01:03,Where to start with the questions?
00:01:03,00:01:04,Did she?
00:01:04,00:01:07,"Well, basically, before she was famous,"
00:01:07,00:01:09,this was in the 1840s.
00:01:09,00:01:10,She was talking to a neighbor.
00:01:10,00:01:12,She was in her mid-20s pre-fame.
00:01:12,00:01:15,And she stretched out her right hand.
00:01:15,00:01:18,And with some pride demonstrated how massive it was.
00:01:18,00:01:20,So I look how big this is.
00:01:20,00:01:23,"And it was big, she said, because in her teenage years,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,she was making butter and cheese on her family's farm.
00:01:25,00:01:28,So she was doing all the churning that she needed to do.
00:01:28,00:01:32,"And as a result, she built up this massive hand."
00:01:32,00:01:33,So it wasn't even by birth.
00:01:33,00:01:36,"Like, she built it herself."
00:01:36,00:01:39,"And she said that it was so big, her hand,"
00:01:39,00:01:41,"comparative to the left hand that she had,"
00:01:41,00:01:44,"that it left her kind of lopsided, because the weight of it--"
00:01:44,00:01:45,Come on.
00:01:45,00:01:46,"Yeah, she didn't say that."
00:01:46,00:01:48,"She did, to this, in this anecdote."
00:01:48,00:01:49,So this is the problem.
00:01:49,00:01:52,It was an anecdote that was said before she was famous.
00:01:52,00:01:55,"And when she died 28 months after she died,"
00:01:55,00:01:57,"a biography was released, where someone had gone"
00:01:57,00:02:00,"to the local town and so on, and it interviewed neighbors."
00:02:00,00:02:03,"And the neighbor said, yeah, she was this person"
00:02:03,00:02:05,with a massive hand that she told me about.
00:02:05,00:02:07,"It sounds like something that was made up by the neighbor, doesn't it?"
00:02:07,00:02:11,"Well, this is why the family was very furiously denying it."
00:02:11,00:02:13,They were saying it was not--
00:02:13,00:02:14,she was never a dairy farmer.
00:02:14,00:02:15,That was more the thing.
00:02:15,00:02:16,It wasn't so much the hand.
00:02:16,00:02:18,They didn't want her to be thought of.
00:02:18,00:02:21,"Because it kind of showed that she had a really rural upbringing, didn't it?"
00:02:21,00:02:22,"Yeah, exactly."
00:02:22,00:02:27,"Well, also, there was a kind of potential rudeness in what she--"
00:02:27,00:02:28,Because--
00:02:28,00:02:32,"Well, no, just because deories were kind of seen as hotbeds of vice."
00:02:32,00:02:32,Where they?
00:02:32,00:02:36,"Yeah, because there were cows and there are udders and there's milk,"
00:02:36,00:02:39,and it's all very sexy and lovely.
00:02:39,00:02:40,"It's all-- right, no, right."
00:02:40,00:02:42,"I did try to find out a bit more about this,"
00:02:42,00:02:45,but it was quite hard to Google Northy Milk Mades
00:02:45,00:02:48,and find anything sort of germane.
00:02:48,00:02:52,"I went into the National Portrait Gallery website,"
00:02:52,00:02:54,and they have a lot of portraits of her.
00:02:54,00:02:58,And I didn't see a single one where she had a massive right hand.
00:02:58,00:03:01,She always disguising it by wearing one of those big foam fingers
00:03:01,00:03:02,from the haters.
00:03:02,00:03:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:03:05,00:03:07,"She would have asked them to cover it up, though."
00:03:07,00:03:08,I think it could be.
00:03:08,00:03:09,Like William Gladstone--
00:03:09,00:03:12,"I think it was William Gladstone only had a missing finger, didn't he?"
00:03:12,00:03:14,And Portrait artist covered that up his whole life.
00:03:14,00:03:15,You just know what he is.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"And that was, like, agreed by the newspapers, wasn't it?"
00:03:17,00:03:19,All the newspapers agreed that they would never mention it.
00:03:19,00:03:22,And the cartoonists agreed that they would never draw about it.
00:03:22,00:03:22,So weird.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Yeah.
00:03:23,00:03:24,But he had a dummy finger.
00:03:24,00:03:25,Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:27,He wore a fake finger in place of his real finger.
00:03:27,00:03:30,And then he she wore a smaller hand.
00:03:30,00:03:32,"I think you would do it the other way, Rad."
00:03:32,00:03:34,"You would wear a massive hand on your other one,"
00:03:34,00:03:36,so they would have a certain clever.
00:03:36,00:03:37,And so I read a lot about this.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"I don't know if this is where you saw it, Dan."
00:03:40,00:03:43,I saw a review of a book called The Tales of the Flesh
00:03:43,00:03:45,in the Age of Decorum by Catherine Hughes.
00:03:45,00:03:49,And she wrote about both Gladstone and about George Elliot.
00:03:49,00:03:52,"And in this book, she came across George Elliot's glove"
00:03:52,00:03:55,at the end of one of the chapters.
00:03:55,00:03:58,"And of course, that might tell you what's happened."
00:03:58,00:03:59,So she found this glove.
00:03:59,00:04:00,It was the right glove.
00:04:00,00:04:03,"And she looked at it, and it was quite big."
00:04:03,00:04:05,"But of course, the problem was she didn't have the left glove."
00:04:05,00:04:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:08,00:04:10,And then people have suggested to the author
00:04:10,00:04:12,"that maybe she threw away the left glove,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,because it was too small for her.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"We should just quickly say, because George Elliot, to me,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"was a name I was kind of familiar with, but not really."
00:04:20,00:04:22,She was an author.
00:04:22,00:04:24,George Elliot was the pseudonym that she had.
00:04:24,00:04:25,Mary Ann was her name.
00:04:25,00:04:27,Mary Ann Evans.
00:04:27,00:04:27,Mary Ann Evans.
00:04:27,00:04:29,And she wrote Middle March.
00:04:29,00:04:33,And a number of books which today are considered
00:04:33,00:04:36,"by a lot of modern-day writers, like Mordor Namus and so on,"
00:04:36,00:04:39,to be amongst the greatest books ever written in literature.
00:04:39,00:04:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:40,00:04:42,I think she's probably like the greatest novelist ever.
00:04:42,00:04:43,She was genius.
00:04:43,00:04:44,Really?
00:04:44,00:04:46,"Middle March is my favorite book, probably in the world."
00:04:46,00:04:48,"But it is a shame, because she did have people"
00:04:48,00:04:52,"during her life and after it, commenting on her appearance."
00:04:52,00:04:53,"And I know I'm perpetuating that by doing it now,"
00:04:53,00:04:55,but there were some choice phrases.
00:04:55,00:05:01,So she lived this very kind of unusual life for the Victorian era.
00:05:01,00:05:07,And she sort of lived in sin with a married man for about 30 years.
00:05:07,00:05:08,And you can always tell an ex-milk maid.
00:05:08,00:05:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:11,00:05:13,"But people used to be captivated by her,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,but also weirdly repulsed by her.
00:05:14,00:05:17,So Henry James was a huge fan of hers.
00:05:17,00:05:22,"And he called her magnificently ugly, deliciously hideous."
00:05:22,00:05:24,But then said he completely fell in love with her.
00:05:24,00:05:26,"He said, within her vast ugliness,"
00:05:26,00:05:28,resides the most powerful beauty.
00:05:28,00:05:30,And this seemed to be what she did to people.
00:05:30,00:05:33,"It's not prime tend to chat up line territory, is it?"
00:05:33,00:05:38,"Well, hang on, you've not quite given the full quote there from him."
00:05:38,00:05:41,He said all the nice things about how you fall in love with her.
00:05:41,00:05:43,"And he said, yes, behold me literally in love"
00:05:43,00:05:46,with the great horse-faced blue stocking.
00:05:46,00:05:49,"So return to Dickheadland, right in the final bit of this quote."
00:05:49,00:05:51,"A lot of people said that, didn't they?"
00:05:51,00:05:52,They said that she was really ugly.
00:05:52,00:05:55,"But as soon as she spoke, as soon as she engaged you,"
00:05:55,00:05:56,she suddenly captivated you.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"So Lucy Clefford, whose novelist, said"
00:05:58,00:06:00,that she did look like a horse.
00:06:00,00:06:02,But it was a strange variety of horse
00:06:02,00:06:03,that was full of knowledge.
00:06:03,00:06:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:06,00:06:07,"Oh, wow."
00:06:07,00:06:07,So rude.
00:06:07,00:06:08,It is.
00:06:08,00:06:09,"It's rude, yeah."
00:06:09,00:06:10,It's not.
00:06:10,00:06:12,She used to take the piss out of herself as well for it.
00:06:12,00:06:15,"And she saw, vended up with this guy, George Lewis,"
00:06:15,00:06:18,"who was also unattractive, I believe."
00:06:18,00:06:20,"And I think that's why she called herself George Elliott,"
00:06:20,00:06:23,"we assume, is sort of homage to him."
00:06:23,00:06:27,"And also, there's a weird theory that a biographer came up with just after she"
00:06:27,00:06:31,"died, that her surname was also made in homage to him."
00:06:31,00:06:35,"Because apparently, her surname was--"
00:06:35,00:06:39,"so L, so his name is George Lewis, starts with L."
00:06:39,00:06:41,"And it's to L, I, O, it."
00:06:41,00:06:47,"And this biographer theorised that her surname is sort of L, I, O, it."
00:06:47,00:06:48,"It's a stretch, isn't it?"
00:06:48,00:06:49,"It's a big stretch, isn't it?"
00:06:49,00:06:51,"It's a stretch, unfortunately, a stretch"
00:06:51,00:06:53,that George Elliott could make with that hand.
00:06:53,00:06:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:55,00:06:56,She was a great writer.
00:06:56,00:07:00,I looked at some of the words that she had coined.
00:07:00,00:07:04,So she was the first person to use the word pop as in pop music.
00:07:04,00:07:06,And that was in 1862.
00:07:06,00:07:10,"She said, there is too much pop for the thorough enjoyments of chamber music."
00:07:10,00:07:13,"She also coined the words, according to the OED,"
00:07:13,00:07:19,"this is, appealing-ness, besieging-ness, close-ish, and embrowning."
00:07:19,00:07:20,Wow.
00:07:20,00:07:23,"She less coinages is just putting the word ""ness"" after things, isn't it?"
00:07:23,00:07:27,But she was also the first person to write the words lampshade and lunchtime.
00:07:27,00:07:28,Cool.
00:07:28,00:07:30,"Yeah, that's a biggie."
00:07:30,00:07:31,"It is a biggie, isn't it?"
00:07:31,00:07:32,That's a real one.
00:07:32,00:07:34,"We should say, when she used the word pop, it was in a letter."
00:07:34,00:07:37,And she was referring to the fact that Beethoven's septet had been played.
00:07:37,00:07:40,"So I think pop was quite different then, wasn't it?"
00:07:40,00:07:44,"So the pseudonym that she used, it was because she wanted to get away from the fact"
00:07:44,00:07:49,that people would maybe look down on the novel because it was read in by a woman.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"She was trying to, even though there were a lot of women literature authors at the time,"
00:07:53,00:07:56,it was not as taboo as it was in the earlier days.
00:07:56,00:07:58,But she wanted to get away from that.
00:07:58,00:08:01,And so she used George Elliott.
00:08:01,00:08:04,"But when she released her first stuff and when her first novel,"
00:08:04,00:08:07,"this is 1859, Adam Beade was published."
00:08:07,00:08:10,She did it with the pseudonym and obviously no one knew who it was.
00:08:10,00:08:12,So there was a lot of questions about who could this be.
00:08:12,00:08:17,"And a people, like with JK Rowling, having done Robert Galbraith, they did a lot of searching,"
00:08:17,00:08:19,trying to work out who it was.
00:08:19,00:08:25,"And they found that the book had a lot of references to a local place called Non-Eaten,"
00:08:25,00:08:27,which was such good local knowledge.
00:08:27,00:08:29,They thought it must be for someone from there.
00:08:29,00:08:33,"And they pinned it down to a guy called Joseph Liggins, who lived there."
00:08:33,00:08:37,"And Joseph Liggins, when he first got not accused, but pushed to say, ""Oh, the author."""
00:08:37,00:08:40,"He was flattered and went, ""Well, I shouldn't really say."""
00:08:40,00:08:45,"And then when it got really big, he then said, ""Yes, it's me."""
00:08:45,00:08:47,"So he said, ""Yes, I absolutely am."""
00:08:47,00:08:51,"So then the publishers of the book, because this guy was living in poverty at the time."
00:08:51,00:08:53,He'd had a very rough life.
00:08:53,00:08:56,"He started, the publisher is getting all these messages going, ""Why is he so poor?"
00:08:56,00:08:57,This is a big book.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"He should be making a lot of money."""
00:08:59,00:09:03,"So then they had to reveal their cards that it was, in fact, Mary-Anne, ""She put her hand up a one."
00:09:03,00:09:13,"It's me and for miles around, everyone said, ""That's a man's hand, if I ever saw one."""
00:09:13,00:09:17,So he got revealed that he was not the author.
00:09:17,00:09:21,"And that obviously ruined his life, because he was a fantasist."
00:09:21,00:09:23,He was claiming something that he wasn't.
00:09:23,00:09:27,And he ended up living in a workhouse where he eventually died.
00:09:27,00:09:29,And his life just went downhill from there.
00:09:29,00:09:33,"So he died in this place in this workhouse, and that workhouse is no longer there."
00:09:33,00:09:39,"But it's been reused as a new building and renamed the ""George Elliott Hospital."""
00:09:39,00:09:41,So even in death.
00:09:41,00:09:43,Her childhood home is there.
00:09:43,00:09:48,It's now the Griff House beef eater and Nunnyton Premier travel in.
00:09:48,00:09:52,And I look for ages on the trip advisor reviews.
00:09:52,00:09:55,"And none of them mentioned George Elliott, what is that?"
00:09:55,00:09:58,"When she released Adam Bede, I think a lot of reviewers felt quite stupid,"
00:09:58,00:10:02,because a lot of reviewers compared it favorably to women's fiction.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"The economist, which I know we will publicly say to we love, and we do."
00:10:06,00:10:07,But this is a long time ago.
00:10:07,00:10:12,The economist compared it very favorably with fiction written by silly women.
00:10:12,00:10:16,"And another review said it was the work of a brave, manly soul."
00:10:16,00:10:19,"So everyone thought this was, like, really, definitely written by a man."
00:10:19,00:10:22,"But actually, interestingly, Charles Dickens was the first person to spot"
00:10:22,00:10:25,that her books seemed like they were written by a woman.
00:10:25,00:10:29,"And this is when she released her first book, which was scenes from a clerical life."
00:10:29,00:10:33,"And she wrote-- he Dickens wrote to the publishers, saying how much he loved it"
00:10:33,00:10:34,and how brilliant it was.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"And he said, that definitely originates with a woman,"
00:10:37,00:10:40,"this understanding of human nature, this woman's perspective."
00:10:40,00:10:42,"He said, if they originated with no woman,"
00:10:42,00:10:47,I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman
00:10:47,00:10:48,since the world began.
00:10:48,00:10:49,Wow.
00:10:49,00:10:50,"Oh, he called her out."
00:10:50,00:10:54,Give her a big hand.
00:10:54,00:10:56,How long have you been saving that?
00:10:56,00:11:00,"Since I sent the fact to her, actually."
00:11:00,00:11:03,"She hated lots of other women novelists, though."
00:11:03,00:11:08,So the reason maybe that she-- or one of the reasons that she might have written under a man's name--
00:11:08,00:11:09,we mentioned this very briefly before.
00:11:09,00:11:16,"She wrote an essay, I think before her first book, which was called ""Silly Novels"" by Lady Novelists."
00:11:16,00:11:22,"And she said that women author's wrote stupid plots with pointless characters, and she was clearly determined"
00:11:22,00:11:24,to do something about that right now realistically.
00:11:24,00:11:30,"Although she didn't like some female novelist, she liked the Brontese, she liked other female novelists."
00:11:30,00:11:31,Wow.
00:11:31,00:11:32,We were good.
00:11:32,00:11:37,"Well, I'm not sure you've proved your credential there."
00:11:37,00:11:39,"We've got to move on shortly, ish."
00:11:39,00:11:43,"Oh, just using an ish, I've just coined there."
00:11:43,00:11:46,Megan Fox's thumbs a shape like toes.
00:11:46,00:11:47,What?
00:11:47,00:11:49,Just while we're on talented women with weird hands.
00:11:49,00:11:50,That's a great fact.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"It's a good fact, isn't it?"
00:11:51,00:11:53,"I mean, all thumbs are shaped a bit like toes."
00:11:53,00:11:56,"Yeah, but hers are really stumpy and small."
00:11:56,00:12:00,"She's got bracket, that tall-type D, and most surgeons call it stub thumb."
00:12:00,00:12:01,Really?
00:12:01,00:12:04,"Yeah, and if you level look at pictures of them, she's not worried about it."
00:12:04,00:12:05,She shows them off quite often.
00:12:05,00:12:08,They're just like about half the size of a normal thumb.
00:12:08,00:12:10,I share a birthday with Megan Fox.
00:12:10,00:12:11,"Oh, good fact."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"So, anyway, so, yes, she has this thing."
00:12:16,00:12:17,I'm sorry.
00:12:17,00:12:18,I'm sorry.
00:12:18,00:12:20,Can we talk about that? Wow.
00:12:20,00:12:22,"Well, come about. Do you see each other?"
00:12:22,00:12:24,My thumbs are normal.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"So, who's winning there?"
00:12:27,00:12:29,Are the people with weird hands?
00:12:29,00:12:30,"Oh, yeah."
00:12:30,00:12:31,"Oh, OK, yeah."
00:12:31,00:12:34,"So, Rack Mananoff had huge hands."
00:12:34,00:12:35,Right.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"Famously, if you ever read about classical music, it's like the first thing"
00:12:38,00:12:41,that's ever mentioned about him and any article about him is massive handspan.
00:12:41,00:12:44,And especially his left hand was particularly huge.
00:12:44,00:12:49,"So, if he had his little finger on a C, then his thumb on his left hand"
00:12:49,00:12:52,would be able to reach the G of the next octave.
00:12:52,00:12:53,Oh.
00:12:53,00:12:54,It was so extreme.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"I think what we're all wondering is, when was his birthday?"
00:12:57,00:13:06,"But actually, keyboards, people have found recently that they disadvantage female pianists."
00:13:06,00:13:12,"So, according to a recent study, they disadvantage 87% of female pianists."
00:13:12,00:13:15,And they looked at the 12 best pianists in the world.
00:13:15,00:13:19,"And they all had spans of 8.8 inches or above,"
00:13:19,00:13:23,whereas the average female span is about seven inches.
00:13:23,00:13:24,Wow.
00:13:24,00:13:27,"So, it's really difficult for women to play a lot of the songs."
00:13:27,00:13:31,"And so, they looked at those 12 people and there were two women on that group."
00:13:31,00:13:33,And one had a hand span of nine inches.
00:13:33,00:13:35,"And the other one had a hand span of 9.5 inches,"
00:13:35,00:13:39,which goes to show that it's really difficult for women with normal sized hands to get there.
00:13:39,00:13:43,But it's good that George Eliot's descendants have found work.
00:13:43,00:13:45,She could only play the melody.
00:13:45,00:13:46,She could never...
00:13:46,00:13:52,"Just with the family, those 50 years."
00:13:52,00:13:57,"So, as I say before, it's sort of like, were they angry about the idea that she was claimed..."
00:13:57,00:14:01,They said she had a massive hand or was it about the fact that she was a dairy farmer?
00:14:01,00:14:02,That's a bit blurry.
00:14:02,00:14:07,"But they made sure that if anyone wanted to do a biography of her,"
00:14:07,00:14:12,"the stipulation was, you were not allowed to mention the massive hand or the dairy thing."
00:14:12,00:14:16,"You just have to like, actually deny that that was a truth."
00:14:16,00:14:18,"And so, I was thinking about..."
00:14:18,00:14:20,"That happens a lot, doesn't it, whenever a celebrity's interviewed,"
00:14:20,00:14:26,"where they told a PR person says, ""Don't ask the celebrity about this question."""
00:14:26,00:14:29,"Yeah, I found this article by a guy called Jesse Mulligan, who's a New Zealand."
00:14:29,00:14:33,"And he collected, through other journalists, things that they've been told not to ask celebrities."
00:14:33,00:14:36,"So, for example, when Meatloaf went to Auckland,"
00:14:36,00:14:41,all people were told not to ask him what he wouldn't do for love.
00:14:41,00:14:44,"Is it an obvious one, right?"
00:14:44,00:14:47,"When David Eich, the big conspiracy theorist, went to New Zealand,"
00:14:47,00:14:52,"Dom Harvey interviewed him, and he was told no questions about his failed predictions,"
00:14:52,00:14:57,especially the one where he predicted New Zealand would completely disappear in the late 90s.
00:14:59,00:15:04,"And then lastly, the killers, the band, were playing the big day out in Australia,"
00:15:04,00:15:09,and the interviewers were told not to ask about Bruce Springsteen religion or beards.
00:15:09,00:15:12,And that's because the lead singer is a Mormon.
00:15:12,00:15:16,"He'd recently grown a bit of a beard, and their new album was being compared to Bruce Springsteen."
00:15:16,00:15:20,"And at the press junket, one of the interviewers asked,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,"""Who has the best beard? Jesus or Bruce Springsteen?"""
00:15:22,00:15:27,"Very good, mate."
00:15:27,00:15:31,"OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:15:31,00:15:36,My fact is that some grandfather clocks used to use ox testicles for their pulleys.
00:15:36,00:15:39,Were they still attached?
00:15:39,00:15:45,"That would be silly. No, actually, this got sent to me by a listener,"
00:15:45,00:15:51,"someone called Jenny Wildblood, and it's from a book called ""Food in England"" by Dorothy Hartley,"
00:15:51,00:15:57,"and Dorothy Hartley was an incredible woman. She sort of documented all these social customs,"
00:15:57,00:16:02,"dating back centuries, and she lived in the 20th century, and she died in it,"
00:16:02,00:16:06,"and she recorded all these, she didn't make it out, damn it."
00:16:06,00:16:13,"So we don't have many places that this fact has written down, and it's from her book ""Food in England,"""
00:16:13,00:16:18,"and she says that the long testicle cord of a bull used to use all of the animal,"
00:16:18,00:16:23,"and that cord was used as pulleys in some grandfather clocks, because it was strong in texture,"
00:16:23,00:16:28,"and it was long. So, sorry, can I just ask, is the pulley the lump at the bottom of the pendulum?"
00:16:28,00:16:31,"You've got the two things hanging down. No, the pendulum, the pulley, you know."
00:16:31,00:16:35,The thing that you pull the stringy bit that has the blobby bit at the bottom.
00:16:35,00:16:36,Thank you.
00:16:36,00:16:40,"OK, cool, and it was the blobby bit. No, it was the stringy bit."
00:16:40,00:16:44,"The stringy bit is the cord. The testicle cord is not the testicle, it's, yeah."
00:16:44,00:16:48,"No, in theory, they should have just used the testicle as the blobby bit. Yes, true, yeah."
00:16:48,00:16:50,Use it all. Don't waste not one.
00:16:50,00:16:57,"There was one other thing it was useful. I tracked down the book, and it was also the long testicle"
00:16:57,00:17:05,"cord of the ox was valued by drovers as a lash, so you might, as a cattle, be lashed by the testicle"
00:17:05,00:17:11,"of your ancestors. By the testicles of your ancestors, sounds like an amazing exclamation."
00:17:12,00:17:16,By the testicles of your ancestors. Are you crazy?
00:17:16,00:17:21,So grandfather clocks.
00:17:21,00:17:27,"Let's all start picturing testicles and talk about grandfather clocks, which aren't as old as"
00:17:27,00:17:33,"you might think, or the name isn't. So the name comes from 1876, and it's a song by a guy called"
00:17:33,00:17:38,"Henry Claywork. So before grandfather clocks were called that, they were just called something out."
00:17:38,00:17:41,"They were called floor clocks, or they were called long clocks, or I think they had various names."
00:17:41,00:17:47,"But then he wrote this song, where he referred to them as grandfather's clock, and it's such a nice"
00:17:47,00:17:51,song. It's from the perspective of a grandson talking about how his grandfather's clock has been
00:17:51,00:17:55,"born at the same time as his grandfather, and they've both lived this life together, and they're"
00:17:55,00:18:01,"really well bonded, and then when his grandfather dies, the clock stops working. And then it was covered"
00:18:01,00:18:07,"by Johnny Cash some time later, and that's where we got the term. I guess you guys know that song,"
00:18:07,00:18:13,"my grandfather's clock. My grandfather's clock. Yeah, I'd never heard it. It's based on a natural clock."
00:18:13,00:18:19,"On a real-life clock in North York, sure, it's still there. I've forgotten where it. I think it's"
00:18:19,00:18:26,"near Dalington, and Henry Claywork was in this hotel, in this restaurant, and he saw this clock,"
00:18:26,00:18:31,"and they told him the story of how it had stopped on the day that the guy died, and that's how he wrote"
00:18:31,00:18:38,"the song. He said, ""By the testicles of my ancestors, that's something for a song."" Historians think that"
00:18:38,00:18:42,it was a marketing gimmick used by the innkeepers to dress up their inability to get the clock repaired.
00:18:42,00:18:49,"I didn't know that, as well as a grandfather clock, you could get a grandmother clock and a grand"
00:18:49,00:18:56,"daughter clock. How cool is that? How is the gender differentiated on clocks? No gender difference,"
00:18:57,00:19:01,but it's height difference is what it is. They use the vagina of a nox.
00:19:01,00:19:13,"So, a grandfather clock is generally agreed to measure at least six foot three in height."
00:19:13,00:19:18,"So, that's a grandfather clock. A grandmother clock is six foot three below."
00:19:18,00:19:23,"You have to dig a hole, six foot three down into the ground."
00:19:26,00:19:30,You need to go that way. Anything under six foot three is a grandmother clock.
00:19:30,00:19:34,Andy said is right. What's the grand daughter clock?
00:19:34,00:19:42,Daughter clock is exactly six foot three. It's anything that measures in between three and five feet.
00:19:42,00:19:46,"So, it still needs to be a tall standing clock. Otherwise, then, it's just a really tall clock,"
00:19:46,00:19:51,"but it doesn't get status as a grand. And you also get the George Elliott clock, where one of the"
00:19:51,00:20:03,"hands is really big. So, clocks have an amazing history, actually. So, the first clocks or some of"
00:20:03,00:20:08,the first clocks were water clocks. And the first water clock I could find evidence of was from
00:20:08,00:20:15,"ancient Greece, and its whole purpose was to stop people going on too long in words, which is a water"
00:20:15,00:20:21,"clock. So, the way it works in ancient Greece was actually quite different to what came afterwards,"
00:20:21,00:20:25,"but basically, what you had was you had a bowl, a small bowl, and you've got a little hole in the"
00:20:25,00:20:31,"bottom of that bowl, and then you put it in a bigger bowl of water, and then the water gradually goes"
00:20:31,00:20:38,"up through the hole in the bowl, and the time that bowl takes to sink is a certain passage of time."
00:20:38,00:20:42,"And they would use this to time people's speeches in parliament. So, the politician was"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"whining on too long, and then you'd be like, ""Mmm, the bowl's underwater now, get off the stage, mate."""
00:20:46,00:20:52,"And then that was that was their purpose. Wow, that's pretty cool. That is cool. Bring it back. They should"
00:20:52,00:20:57,put the politician in the bowl of water and just slowly the speech we had. I think everyone has put a
00:20:57,00:21:03,"woman in like, ""That would be amazing."" That's a game show, I think. Yeah. It's time to play,"
00:21:03,00:21:10,"""Hole in the Bowl."" Do you know why we say a clock when, if you say it's for a clock,"
00:21:10,00:21:16,"why we say that rather than just saying it's four? Because it's not. No, I don't know why we say that."
00:21:16,00:21:22,"Well, so this goes back such a long way. This goes back to when the, so, sundials for what we used"
00:21:22,00:21:29,before mechanization came into clocks. In the west was about the 14th century when mechanical
00:21:29,00:21:35,"clocks came in. And in sundials, what you had was the day was divided into 12 equal hours, and the"
00:21:35,00:21:40,"night was divided into 12 equal hours. And so because the day is longer in summer, then the hours in"
00:21:40,00:21:45,"summer would be much longer than the hours in winter. Yes. But with mechanical clocks, all hours"
00:21:45,00:21:52,"are the same length. And so, when mechanical clocks came in, then people were sort of living on a"
00:21:52,00:21:57,"half sundial, half mechanical clock basis. And so if you said, ""What's the time?"" As someone said,"
00:21:57,00:22:07,"it's 12, or 12 is a bad, the worst possible example. That's the only one way. It's the same regardless."
00:22:07,00:22:11,"If you said it's eight, then they say, ""Well, what do you mean? Do you mean eight on the sundial?"
00:22:11,00:22:15,"Or do you mean eight on the mechanical clock?"" And that's why it's eight o'clock, as an eight on the"
00:22:15,00:22:22,"mechanical clock. That's what I'm going to start saying. It's eight o' sundial. Okay, we need to move on."
00:22:22,00:22:29,"It is time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the first"
00:22:29,00:22:35,"motel was meant to be called a motor hotel, but the sign was too small to fit all the letters on."
00:22:37,00:22:42,"Couldn't you have just written smaller? He could have done that, I guess, but he'd already bought the"
00:22:42,00:22:46,"letters and it's all the pieces on there. And also, below a certain font size, it's not a useful sign"
00:22:46,00:22:56,"anymore. So right. It becomes a notice. So this is the milestone motel in, which was opened in 1925."
00:22:56,00:23:03,"It was in San Luis Obispo, which is exactly in between Los Angeles and San Francisco. And people"
00:23:03,00:23:08,"had started using their cars to kind of drive around. And that was a very popular journey. But before that,"
00:23:08,00:23:14,people had to just kind of park into the lay-by and kind of camp. But he started this new idea of
00:23:14,00:23:18,having a hotel where people could drive up and they could stay there. And so he wanted to call it the
00:23:18,00:23:25,"milestone motor hotel, but he couldn't fit it on his sign. It sounded really cool. I've seen"
00:23:25,00:23:30,"photos of it. He was very inspired by sort of Spanish houses. So it's this beautiful. I mean,"
00:23:30,00:23:36,"if you picture what an American motel is like now, it's the exact opposite. This was luxury. It looks"
00:23:36,00:23:44,"stunning. It had enough rooms for 160 people to stay there. It had showers, central heating. It"
00:23:44,00:23:50,even had rooms for people's chauffeurs to sleep in. That's how much of an upper-class idea it was for
00:23:50,00:23:56,"him. And unfortunately, I think I'm right in saying he was unable to sort of trademark the idea."
00:23:56,00:24:01,"So as soon as he did it, everyone leaped in and opened their own and his idea of franchising it"
00:24:01,00:24:03,was out the window. That's right. He was called Arthur Heinemann.
00:24:03,00:24:10,"And we should say, because everyone's always wondered what's the difference between a hotel and a"
00:24:10,00:24:16,motel. And I think this is right. A motel basically means you can park up next to your room and
00:24:16,00:24:23,"go into it, right? And it's all kind of, the motel is in sort of a seashape usually and it's just"
00:24:23,00:24:28,all on one floor and you just walk straight into it. But there's no rules. So you can have a motel that's
00:24:28,00:24:33,"a hotel or hotel that's a motel. Yeah. But they had a bad reputation and even before Psycho,"
00:24:33,00:24:41,"so imagine what that did for them. So from then, in 1940, Jay Agahueva, who was director of the FBI,"
00:24:41,00:24:47,said that most motels were dens of vice and high doubts for criminals. And they had this reputation
00:24:47,00:24:53,"for what was called the Hot Pillow Trade, which basically means the shadows of guests stay there"
00:24:53,00:24:58,in the space of 24 hours and not because they're really busy. So there was a study done which found
00:24:58,00:25:03,that about 16 guests per night were staying at one motel because it was a place that you would go
00:25:03,00:25:09,"with your put mistress or your master. And you have a quick shag, you book it for an hour and then"
00:25:09,00:25:16,"you go again and then you leave. And a 1935 study, which was done by a Texas university, found that 75%"
00:25:16,00:25:23,of my tell visits were one man and one woman remaining for a very short stay. And they also found that
00:25:23,00:25:33,"in one motel, 102 out of 109 guests signed in under fake names. Wow. They were dodgy joints."
00:25:33,00:25:39,"There's one really dodgy one, which is in Nevada. It's called the clown motel. And wherever you look,"
00:25:39,00:25:45,"there are clowns looking at you. Oh my god. Basically, every wall there's a clown looking at you."
00:25:45,00:25:49,"But it's all right. You can kind of just nip out of the back if you want. But unfortunately, if you do"
00:25:49,00:25:55,"that, you go to the historic minus cemetery where they have hundreds of corpses from people who died in"
00:25:55,00:26:02,the plague. Yeah. Oh god. A below ground. That's the way thing. I read up on that as well. They describe it
00:26:02,00:26:10,as an abandoned cemetery. And I don't know how you abandoned a cemetery. Right. We're going everyone.
00:26:11,00:26:18,"Is your last chance for the bus? All right. I'd rather like this. In 2017, there was a man in"
00:26:18,00:26:23,India who was arrested for stealing more than 120 televisions from budget hotels across the country
00:26:23,00:26:29,in an incredible four month crime spree. That was one a day. And his motor's operating was brilliant.
00:26:29,00:26:34,"He would check in and carry, as the report said, a fairly large suitcase. And if the TV in his room"
00:26:34,00:26:39,"was really big, he would go off to the shops for a bit and come back with a really big suitcase."
00:26:39,00:26:44,"Well, he would just leave with that. He was caught. He was caught. Yeah."
00:26:44,00:26:48,"I'm amazed it took that long. I know. I found the worst hotel in the world. Oh, great."
00:26:48,00:26:53,"Well, there are theories, obviously, because there's not an official title. But one that gets quoted"
00:26:53,00:26:58,"as the worst hotel in the world is the grand hotel in Pristina, which is the capital in Kosovo."
00:26:58,00:27:03,"And it has truly atrocious reviews. It's very, very, very bad. And when he was asked about it last"
00:27:03,00:27:08,"year, the actual president of Kosovo said, ""I don't think it is the worst hotel in the world,"
00:27:08,00:27:19,"but that is because the world is very big."" This is one more called Hans Brinker, which is an Amsterdam,"
00:27:19,00:27:25,"but they make a virtue of how bad it is. They kind of advertise it. They say, unfortunately,"
00:27:25,00:27:30,"most of the reviews are really true. The hotel website, actual website, for the hotel, says it's"
00:27:30,00:27:36,comparable to a minimum security prison. And they also advertise themselves as being environmentally
00:27:36,00:27:45,"friendly, because the curtains double up as towels. Okay, it is time for our final"
00:27:45,00:27:52,fact of the show. And that is Chisinski. My fact is that a man found guilty of deer poaching has
00:27:52,00:27:58,been sentenced to a year in prison and been ordered to watch Bambi once a month during that year.
00:28:02,00:28:08,"This is great. So this was actually the end of last year, and it was in Missouri, and a judge sentenced"
00:28:08,00:28:15,"a man called David Berry, Jr. And he had been done for poaching. He was like a family thing,"
00:28:15,00:28:19,"like his dad was doing, his brother was doing it, I think. And the judge said, ""Look, you've killed"
00:28:19,00:28:24,"hundreds of deer, so I want you to watch Bambi and see what that deer might have felt like."""
00:28:24,00:28:30,"And apparently, the prosecution said that the judge is hoping there will be some kind of emotional"
00:28:30,00:28:36,"reaction. And weirdly, the guy who worked for the prosecution was called Don Trossa, so it felt like"
00:28:36,00:28:44,"in the deer faction. I think if he's killed hundreds of deer, as he has, I think he might be able to"
00:28:44,00:28:48,cope with Bambi without cracking. I'm not sure who meant his ways because of the Bambi. I think it's a
00:28:48,00:28:55,"good idea, but... No, well, there might be something to the idea. So the person who played young Bambi"
00:28:56,00:29:02,"in Bambi, he was the voice of Bambi. He became a US Marine, so he had to take lives, unfortunately,"
00:29:02,00:29:08,"as part of his career, but he said that experience of seeing what had happened in Bambi's story meant"
00:29:08,00:29:13,"that he never could bring himself to kill an animal. So maybe it does affect. Yeah, just killed."
00:29:13,00:29:20,"Shiller to humans. Yeah, yeah. But the one problem is that according to Sheriff Brad Delay,"
00:29:20,00:29:25,"who is in charge of the Lawrence County Jail, where they sent this guy, they only have one"
00:29:25,00:29:29,"cinema. So whenever they put it on, they have to get everyone else out of the room, and no one"
00:29:29,00:29:33,"else is allowed to watch anything, and this guy just has to watch Bambi. That's amazing."
00:29:33,00:29:38,"Did they just run free? No, it's not. It's just in the recreation room. They just go to another part"
00:29:38,00:29:44,"of the prison. Okay. They don't go, well, the cinema's out of use. Why don't you just have a run"
00:29:44,00:29:50,"around? It's all right. Just come back in an hour. An hour or two, he'll be all right."
00:29:51,00:29:57,"He's amazing. This actor who played Bambi, Donnie Dunnigan, he was five years old when he got the role,"
00:29:57,00:30:03,"which, you know, because that's what the role called for. But he had been in a few movies already,"
00:30:03,00:30:08,"but his agent at the time hated the sound of the film, and he said, I've got a much bigger role for"
00:30:08,00:30:14,you in a Western. So I think you should take that and not become Bambi. And Donnie Dunnigan
00:30:14,00:30:19,"heard this agent talking to his mum on the phone, and he was quite rude to his mum on the phone."
00:30:19,00:30:24,"And so he fired his agent at the age of five, a variety round of stories saying five-year-old actor"
00:30:24,00:30:31,fires his manager. Which is pretty cool. You can't see Bambi doing that. But he did say he had this
00:30:31,00:30:35,"amazing moment, and this kind of depends on you having seen Bambi, which I learned to my horror"
00:30:35,00:30:41,"that James and Dan haven't. Presumably you have. I have. Okay, good. He fought in Vietnam,"
00:30:41,00:30:47,"Donnie Dunnigan, much later on, obviously. And do you remember the scene in Bambi where it's quite"
00:30:47,00:30:52,"near the end, and Bambi gets shot, and he collapses, and you think Bambi's in real trouble here,"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"and then his father, the big scary deer, sorry, this is a huge spoiler by the way, guys. But the big"
00:30:56,00:31:02,"scary deer comes up over him, and suddenly says, you have to get up, looks down at him, and says, you"
00:31:02,00:31:08,"know, Bambi, come on, you have to get up. By the testicles of your ancestors, you must get up."
00:31:12,00:31:22,"It's a very haunting and moving scene. But we all remember it. Yes, he says that verbatim."
00:31:22,00:31:29,"And anyway, Donnie Dunnigan fought in Vietnam, and Grenade went off, and Bazzoli, he was not to the"
00:31:29,00:31:35,"ground, and he got a bullet to the leg, exactly like Bambi did in the film, got a bullet to the leg,"
00:31:35,00:31:39,"collapsed, and his sergeant, he worked up to find his sergeant standing over him, saying, sir,"
00:31:39,00:31:44,"you must get up, you have to get up, and he goes up, isn't that amazing? That's crazy. He was shot"
00:31:44,00:31:49,"in a lot of places. He was asked to enumerate it, and he said he was shot in the back of the head,"
00:31:49,00:31:55,"the stomach, the left leg, the left lung, the scrotum. But he didn't tell anyone else in the U.S."
00:31:55,00:31:59,"Marines that he was the voice of Bambi, because he knew he would have been bullied."
00:31:59,00:32:05,You're going to say he didn't tell anyone he was shot. But your testicles appear to be bleeding.
00:32:07,00:32:13,"I just don't need them to clock somewhere. So Bambi is based on a book, and not many people know it's"
00:32:13,00:32:19,"called Bambi a Life in the Woods, and it's by Felix Salton, and it's very different to the movie."
00:32:19,00:32:23,"So in chapter 12, Bambi has sex with his cousin."
00:32:23,00:32:28,"And that's only in the director's cut of the movie, isn't it?"
00:32:28,00:32:36,"In chapter 12, he has a restless desire. He no longer recognizes his cousin, Faeline."
00:32:36,00:32:42,"She's now a sex object, and he has his merry way with Faeline all night, and he's so turned on"
00:32:42,00:32:48,"he forgets to eat. And then a little bit later, Bambi's father gives him some drugs."
00:32:48,00:32:56,"And he says it tastes terribly better and smells sickeningly, and after many days, in an opium like"
00:32:56,00:33:03,"days, he heals. No. I'm afraid so. What? He does, we should say in Bambi, he does get with his"
00:33:03,00:33:07,"cousin. I don't know, I haven't seen it. Faeline in the film is his cousin, and he gets, you"
00:33:07,00:33:14,"don't see a graphic sexy in the edited version. I'd love to see Felix being sat down by Walt Disney going,"
00:33:14,00:33:20,we love it. We love it. We're so excited to abort it. We've got a few changes we'd like to make.
00:33:20,00:33:25,Another drug scene. We have a thing that's going to go down well with the six-year-olds.
00:33:25,00:33:32,"In the same year as he wrote Bambi, Felix Salton, he wrote a book called The Hound of Florence,"
00:33:32,00:33:39,which is about a man who turns into a dog every other day. That's like they could have done something
00:33:39,00:33:44,"out of that. That sounds quite good. Yeah. Well, he wrote also another very famous book, Danny,"
00:33:44,00:33:52,"which was actually an adult erotica book. Really? Yeah, it was called Josephine Mutzenbacher,"
00:33:52,00:34:00,"the story of a Viennese whore, as told by herself. And it appeared 20 years before his Bambi book,"
00:34:01,00:34:07,"but obviously you can see related themes according to how they return on novel. Yeah, it's still to"
00:34:07,00:34:11,that. It sold three million copies. It was a very big book. I'm just picturing some sort of
00:34:11,00:34:19,"catastrophic mix-up with the two scripts for the films. Actually, weirdly, just quickly, the actor"
00:34:19,00:34:24,"Donnie Dunnigan, who played Bambi, met Thumper for the first time when he was in his 80s. So,"
00:34:24,00:34:28,they never met. The kids just went into film the scenes and then obviously the Thumper Kid went
00:34:28,00:34:32,in afterwards and then they met a few years ago when they were both really old men. They guessed it
00:34:32,00:34:37,"on a TV show and Bambi got to be like, ""Hey Thumper."" That's very true, really sweet. That's very sweet."
00:34:37,00:34:42,"There's a character in it that Bambi refers to as man. Was that right? Yeah, one man is man."
00:34:42,00:34:48,"It's man. Yeah, so that was a code that got used in the Disney offices. Anytime Walt Disney arrived,"
00:34:48,00:34:53,"all the animators and everyone would go, ""Man is in the forest."" That was the code. Oh, really?"
00:34:53,00:34:59,"To let everyone know, ""Look like you're busy."" Oh, really? And man got voted the number 20 villain"
00:34:59,00:35:06,"in the American Film Institute's top 100 villains of all time. Did he? Just man. And also,"
00:35:06,00:35:13,Bambi was voted the 20th most scary horror film of all time. That was according to Time Magazine.
00:35:13,00:35:21,"Wow. They did study a dead deer when they were making the film. Yeah, the animators wanted to see"
00:35:21,00:35:26,"exactly how a deer would move and how it fit together. So, they observed a deer corpse in various"
00:35:26,00:35:31,stages of decomposition for over several evenings to see the muscles and tendons and how they all fit
00:35:31,00:35:37,"together. I know. They said there was a rich aroma in the air. Yeah. But actually, according to"
00:35:37,00:35:43,"scientists, if Bambi's mother had died, then really they should have just shot Bambi as well."
00:35:43,00:35:49,"Because actually, young deer, when they're often, they tend to have very bad lives because their"
00:35:49,00:35:55,"antlers don't work properly and they're very likely to be killed. So, the humane thing if a deer gets"
00:35:55,00:36:01,"off and is, I've left to the audience, I must say. Wow. Wait, the antlers don't work properly?"
00:36:01,00:36:06,"Yeah, it's weird. They don't grow properly. They grow much slower, which means then they're"
00:36:06,00:36:12,"less able to defend themselves. Wow. We should do a series of no such thing as a fish,"
00:36:12,00:36:19,"factually accurate movies. Tonight, Bambi. Four minutes long. Well, here's another thing,"
00:36:19,00:36:25,"man. In 2017, scientists discovered the first instance of a deer eating human remains."
00:36:25,00:36:33,"We put that in there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They found this deer in the middle of the forest and it was"
00:36:33,00:36:41,holding a human bone in its mouth like a cigar. Where did it get the bone? There had been someone
00:36:41,00:36:47,"who had died, unfortunately. It hadn't killed someone. No, no. Because they do eat meat. I couldn't"
00:36:47,00:36:52,believe this. I was reading a blog by someone in America who's been hunting white tail deer in the U.S.
00:36:52,00:36:58,"and says that they can eat meat and they fish. So, first of all, they eat birds. Sometimes they'll"
00:36:58,00:37:05,"catch a bird and then they'll eat it and then they go fishing, she said. They don't go fishing."
00:37:05,00:37:12,"They go fishing. They get a rod and a tackle, but no, no. This is what you said. They use the"
00:37:12,00:37:18,"hooves to disable fish such as trout. They will then grab the fish with their mouths, chew it up"
00:37:18,00:37:26,"and swallow it. Wow. I think if you, as a trout, if you can be caught by a deer, you deserve it."
00:37:26,00:37:34,You failed as a trout. You got cocky. You got too cocky. We're going to have to wrap up very
00:37:34,00:37:39,shortly. It's quite common in America or relatively common where they give these kind of weird
00:37:39,00:37:44,"punishments, don't they? There's a particular judge called Michael Sicione who is from Payne'sville,"
00:37:44,00:37:51,"Ohio. Payne'sville. This is a great name. But over the time, there was a guy who was caught with"
00:37:51,00:37:56,a loaded gun and he was ordered to the local mob to look at corpses. There was a guy who had referred
00:37:56,00:38:02,"to a police officer as a pig and he was ordered to stand beside a live pig with a sign that read,"
00:38:02,00:38:08,"""This is not a police officer."" That's clever. Imagine if that police officer got involved"
00:38:08,00:38:14,in a major crisis where he got involved. There was a car chase and this guy with this massive sign
00:38:14,00:38:23,"he was next to a pig, not a police officer. Imagine the pig suddenly gets involved in like this"
00:38:23,00:38:30,insane. That's a Disney movie I want to say. Oh my god. I still think it's a good idea.
00:38:30,00:38:38,"It doesn't always work that thing. In 2008, I think it was the same judge. The 24-year-old"
00:38:38,00:38:42,"had been blasting really loud music in his car and he was said, ""You can either pay this huge fine"
00:38:42,00:38:47,or you can have a very tiny fine but you have to listen to 20 hours of classical music
00:38:47,00:38:50,to sort of show you that listening to music you don't like is not fun and you shouldn't
00:38:50,00:38:55,"play it for other people."" And the guy said, ""Okay, I'll take the 20 hours of classical music."""
00:38:55,00:39:05,"And he lasted 15 minutes and then said, ""I'm just going to pay the fine actually."" Wow. Okay, that is it."
