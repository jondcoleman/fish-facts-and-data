00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:17,760
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,880
 as a Fish, a Weekly Podcast.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,000
 This week, coming to you live from Red Roof.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,800
 [cheering]

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
 I am sitting here with Aniches Zinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,680
 and James Harkin.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,240
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,360
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,800
 And in no particular order, here, we go.

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,560
 Starting with fact number one.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,120
 And that's my fact this week.

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,520
 My fact is, after the author George Elliott died,

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,880
 her family spent 50 years publicly denying

20
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,680
 that she had a massive right hand.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,000
 [laughing]

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,120
 Where to start with the questions?

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,480
 Did she?

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,000
 Well, basically, before she was famous,

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,200
 this was in the 1840s.

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,560
 She was talking to a neighbor.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
 She was in her mid-20s pre-fame.

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,000
 And she stretched out her right hand.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,920
 And with some pride demonstrated how massive it was.

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,480
 So I look how big this is.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,200
 And it was big, she said, because in her teenage years,

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,720
 she was making butter and cheese on her family's farm.

33
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,000
 So she was doing all the churning that she needed to do.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,440
 And as a result, she built up this massive hand.

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,760
 So it wasn't even by birth.

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,640
 Like, she built it herself.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,000
 And she said that it was so big, her hand,

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,280
 comparative to the left hand that she had,

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,120
 that it left her kind of lopsided, because the weight of it--

40
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,120
 Come on.

41
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,240
 Yeah, she didn't say that.

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,200
 She did, to this, in this anecdote.

43
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,160
 So this is the problem.

44
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,360
 It was an anecdote that was said before she was famous.

45
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,080
 And when she died 28 months after she died,

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,560
 a biography was released, where someone had gone

47
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,600
 to the local town and so on, and it interviewed neighbors.

48
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,280
 And the neighbor said, yeah, she was this person

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
 with a massive hand that she told me about.

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,440
 It sounds like something that was made up by the neighbor, doesn't it?

51
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,640
 Well, this is why the family was very furiously denying it.

52
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
 They were saying it was not--

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,680
 she was never a dairy farmer.

54
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,560
 That was more the thing.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,640
 It wasn't so much the hand.

56
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,280
 They didn't want her to be thought of.

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,480
 Because it kind of showed that she had a really rural upbringing, didn't it?

58
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
 Yeah, exactly.

59
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
 Well, also, there was a kind of potential rudeness in what she--

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 Because--

61
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,360
 Well, no, just because deories were kind of seen as hotbeds of vice.

62
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,880
 Where they?

63
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,400
 Yeah, because there were cows and there are udders and there's milk,

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,160
 and it's all very sexy and lovely.

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,800
 It's all-- right, no, right.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
 I did try to find out a bit more about this,

67
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,240
 but it was quite hard to Google Northy Milk Mades

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,640
 and find anything sort of germane.

69
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,680
 I went into the National Portrait Gallery website,

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,560
 and they have a lot of portraits of her.

71
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,480
 And I didn't see a single one where she had a massive right hand.

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,320
 She always disguising it by wearing one of those big foam fingers

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,160
 from the haters.

74
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,600
 [LAUGHTER]

75
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,720
 She would have asked them to cover it up, though.

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,680
 I think it could be.

77
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,920
 Like William Gladstone--

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,320
 I think it was William Gladstone only had a missing finger, didn't he?

79
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,520
 And Portrait artist covered that up his whole life.

80
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,520
 You just know what he is.

81
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,800
 And that was, like, agreed by the newspapers, wasn't it?

82
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,840
 All the newspapers agreed that they would never mention it.

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
 And the cartoonists agreed that they would never draw about it.

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,840
 So weird.

85
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,360
 Yeah.

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
 But he had a dummy finger.

87
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
 Yeah.

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,440
 He wore a fake finger in place of his real finger.

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 And then he she wore a smaller hand.

90
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,760
 I think you would do it the other way, Rad.

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,520
 You would wear a massive hand on your other one,

92
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
 so they would have a certain clever.

93
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
 And so I read a lot about this.

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,160
 I don't know if this is where you saw it, Dan.

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,200
 I saw a review of a book called The Tales of the Flesh

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
 in the Age of Decorum by Catherine Hughes.

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,280
 And she wrote about both Gladstone and about George Elliot.

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,880
 And in this book, she came across George Elliot's glove

99
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,120
 at the end of one of the chapters.

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,520
 And of course, that might tell you what's happened.

101
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,600
 So she found this glove.

102
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,880
 It was the right glove.

103
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,280
 And she looked at it, and it was quite big.

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,520
 But of course, the problem was she didn't have the left glove.

105
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,520
 [LAUGHTER]

106
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,440
 And then people have suggested to the author

107
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,280
 that maybe she threw away the left glove,

108
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,000
 because it was too small for her.

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,160
 We should just quickly say, because George Elliot, to me,

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,640
 was a name I was kind of familiar with, but not really.

111
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,280
 She was an author.

112
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
 George Elliot was the pseudonym that she had.

113
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,920
 Mary Ann was her name.

114
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
 Mary Ann Evans.

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,920
 Mary Ann Evans.

116
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
 And she wrote Middle March.

117
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,600
 And a number of books which today are considered

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,480
 by a lot of modern-day writers, like Mordor Namus and so on,

119
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,280
 to be amongst the greatest books ever written in literature.

120
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
 Oh, yeah.

121
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,480
 I think she's probably like the greatest novelist ever.

122
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,240
 She was genius.

123
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,080
 Really?

124
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,520
 Middle March is my favorite book, probably in the world.

125
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,680
 But it is a shame, because she did have people

126
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,200
 during her life and after it, commenting on her appearance.

127
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,960
 And I know I'm perpetuating that by doing it now,

128
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,680
 but there were some choice phrases.

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,880
 So she lived this very kind of unusual life for the Victorian era.

130
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,040
 And she sort of lived in sin with a married man for about 30 years.

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,960
 And you can always tell an ex-milk maid.

132
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,480
 [LAUGHTER]

133
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,400
 But people used to be captivated by her,

134
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,680
 but also weirdly repulsed by her.

135
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,240
 So Henry James was a huge fan of hers.

136
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,000
 And he called her magnificently ugly, deliciously hideous.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,200
 But then said he completely fell in love with her.

138
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,480
 He said, within her vast ugliness,

139
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,760
 resides the most powerful beauty.

140
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,560
 And this seemed to be what she did to people.

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,800
 It's not prime tend to chat up line territory, is it?

142
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,800
 Well, hang on, you've not quite given the full quote there from him.

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,080
 He said all the nice things about how you fall in love with her.

144
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,360
 And he said, yes, behold me literally in love

145
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,840
 with the great horse-faced blue stocking.

146
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,920
 So return to Dickheadland, right in the final bit of this quote.

147
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
 A lot of people said that, didn't they?

148
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,520
 They said that she was really ugly.

149
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,000
 But as soon as she spoke, as soon as she engaged you,

150
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,840
 she suddenly captivated you.

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,760
 So Lucy Clefford, whose novelist, said

152
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,240
 that she did look like a horse.

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
 But it was a strange variety of horse

154
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
 that was full of knowledge.

155
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,120
 [LAUGHTER]

156
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
 Oh, wow.

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,880
 So rude.

158
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,520
 It is.

159
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
 It's rude, yeah.

160
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,000
 It's not.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,440
 She used to take the piss out of herself as well for it.

162
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,360
 And she saw, vended up with this guy, George Lewis,

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
 who was also unattractive, I believe.

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
 And I think that's why she called herself George Elliott,

165
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,720
 we assume, is sort of homage to him.

166
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,760
 And also, there's a weird theory that a biographer came up with just after she

167
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,320
 died, that her surname was also made in homage to him.

168
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,200
 Because apparently, her surname was--

169
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,080
 so L, so his name is George Lewis, starts with L.

170
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,920
 And it's to L, I, O, it.

171
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,640
 And this biographer theorised that her surname is sort of L, I, O, it.

172
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,800
 It's a stretch, isn't it?

173
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,960
 It's a big stretch, isn't it?

174
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,160
 It's a stretch, unfortunately, a stretch

175
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,080
 that George Elliott could make with that hand.

176
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,520
 [LAUGHTER]

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,920
 She was a great writer.

178
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,640
 I looked at some of the words that she had coined.

179
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,400
 So she was the first person to use the word pop as in pop music.

180
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,920
 And that was in 1862.

181
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,960
 She said, there is too much pop for the thorough enjoyments of chamber music.

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,320
 She also coined the words, according to the OED,

183
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:19,960
 this is, appealing-ness, besieging-ness, close-ish, and embrowning.

184
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
 Wow.

185
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,960
 She less coinages is just putting the word "ness" after things, isn't it?

186
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,720
 But she was also the first person to write the words lampshade and lunchtime.

187
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 Cool.

188
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,240
 Yeah, that's a biggie.

189
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,400
 It is a biggie, isn't it?

190
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,320
 That's a real one.

191
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,640
 We should say, when she used the word pop, it was in a letter.

192
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,960
 And she was referring to the fact that Beethoven's septet had been played.

193
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,800
 So I think pop was quite different then, wasn't it?

194
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,720
 So the pseudonym that she used, it was because she wanted to get away from the fact

195
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,200
 that people would maybe look down on the novel because it was read in by a woman.

196
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,840
 She was trying to, even though there were a lot of women literature authors at the time,

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,520
 it was not as taboo as it was in the earlier days.

198
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,640
 But she wanted to get away from that.

199
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,040
 And so she used George Elliott.

200
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,440
 But when she released her first stuff and when her first novel,

201
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,920
 this is 1859, Adam Beade was published.

202
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,800
 She did it with the pseudonym and obviously no one knew who it was.

203
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,880
 So there was a lot of questions about who could this be.

204
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,520
 And a people, like with JK Rowling, having done Robert Galbraith, they did a lot of searching,

205
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
 trying to work out who it was.

206
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,320
 And they found that the book had a lot of references to a local place called Non-Eaten,

207
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
 which was such good local knowledge.

208
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,280
 They thought it must be for someone from there.

209
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,160
 And they pinned it down to a guy called Joseph Liggins, who lived there.

210
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,960
 And Joseph Liggins, when he first got not accused, but pushed to say, "Oh, the author."

211
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,840
 He was flattered and went, "Well, I shouldn't really say."

212
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,400
 And then when it got really big, he then said, "Yes, it's me."

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,880
 So he said, "Yes, I absolutely am."

214
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,480
 So then the publishers of the book, because this guy was living in poverty at the time.

215
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,160
 He'd had a very rough life.

216
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,720
 He started, the publisher is getting all these messages going, "Why is he so poor?

217
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 This is a big book.

218
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,320
 He should be making a lot of money."

219
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,800
 So then they had to reveal their cards that it was, in fact, Mary-Anne, "She put her hand up a one.

220
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:13,560
 It's me and for miles around, everyone said, "That's a man's hand, if I ever saw one."

221
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,640
 So he got revealed that he was not the author.

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,200
 And that obviously ruined his life, because he was a fantasist.

223
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,280
 He was claiming something that he wasn't.

224
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,240
 And he ended up living in a workhouse where he eventually died.

225
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,800
 And his life just went downhill from there.

226
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,840
 So he died in this place in this workhouse, and that workhouse is no longer there.

227
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,320
 But it's been reused as a new building and renamed the "George Elliott Hospital."

228
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,480
 So even in death.

229
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,320
 Her childhood home is there.

230
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,560
 It's now the Griff House beef eater and Nunnyton Premier travel in.

231
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,200
 And I look for ages on the trip advisor reviews.

232
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,080
 And none of them mentioned George Elliott, what is that?

233
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,840
 When she released Adam Bede, I think a lot of reviewers felt quite stupid,

234
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,520
 because a lot of reviewers compared it favorably to women's fiction.

235
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,440
 The economist, which I know we will publicly say to we love, and we do.

236
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,920
 But this is a long time ago.

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,600
 The economist compared it very favorably with fiction written by silly women.

238
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 And another review said it was the work of a brave, manly soul.

239
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,400
 So everyone thought this was, like, really, definitely written by a man.

240
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,760
 But actually, interestingly, Charles Dickens was the first person to spot

241
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,480
 that her books seemed like they were written by a woman.

242
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,440
 And this is when she released her first book, which was scenes from a clerical life.

243
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,280
 And she wrote-- he Dickens wrote to the publishers, saying how much he loved it

244
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,640
 and how brilliant it was.

245
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,600
 And he said, that definitely originates with a woman,

246
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,520
 this understanding of human nature, this woman's perspective.

247
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,680
 He said, if they originated with no woman,

248
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,440
 I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself mentally so like a woman

249
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,680
 since the world began.

250
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,480
 Wow.

251
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
 Oh, he called her out.

252
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,080
 Give her a big hand.

253
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,560
 How long have you been saving that?

254
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,000
 Since I sent the fact to her, actually.

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,160
 She hated lots of other women novelists, though.

256
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,640
 So the reason maybe that she-- or one of the reasons that she might have written under a man's name--

257
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
 we mentioned this very briefly before.

258
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,800
 She wrote an essay, I think before her first book, which was called "Silly Novels" by Lady Novelists.

259
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,040
 And she said that women author's wrote stupid plots with pointless characters, and she was clearly determined

260
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,880
 to do something about that right now realistically.

261
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,720
 Although she didn't like some female novelist, she liked the Brontese, she liked other female novelists.

262
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 Wow.

263
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
 We were good.

264
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,240
 Well, I'm not sure you've proved your credential there.

265
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,040
 We've got to move on shortly, ish.

266
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,080
 Oh, just using an ish, I've just coined there.

267
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,120
 Megan Fox's thumbs a shape like toes.

268
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,280
 What?

269
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,960
 Just while we're on talented women with weird hands.

270
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,800
 That's a great fact.

271
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,760
 It's a good fact, isn't it?

272
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,240
 I mean, all thumbs are shaped a bit like toes.

273
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,040
 Yeah, but hers are really stumpy and small.

274
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,840
 She's got bracket, that tall-type D, and most surgeons call it stub thumb.

275
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,520
 Really?

276
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,600
 Yeah, and if you level look at pictures of them, she's not worried about it.

277
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,760
 She shows them off quite often.

278
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,600
 They're just like about half the size of a normal thumb.

279
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,120
 I share a birthday with Megan Fox.

280
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
 Oh, good fact.

281
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,960
 So, anyway, so, yes, she has this thing.

282
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
 I'm sorry.

283
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
 I'm sorry.

284
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,480
 Can we talk about that? Wow.

285
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,640
 Well, come about. Do you see each other?

286
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,240
 My thumbs are normal.

287
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,640
 So, who's winning there?

288
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
 Are the people with weird hands?

289
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 Oh, yeah.

290
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,640
 Oh, OK, yeah.

291
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,240
 So, Rack Mananoff had huge hands.

292
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
 Right.

293
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,240
 Famously, if you ever read about classical music, it's like the first thing

294
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,560
 that's ever mentioned about him and any article about him is massive handspan.

295
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,520
 And especially his left hand was particularly huge.

296
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,920
 So, if he had his little finger on a C, then his thumb on his left hand

297
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,680
 would be able to reach the G of the next octave.

298
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
 Oh.

299
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
 It was so extreme.

300
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,840
 I think what we're all wondering is, when was his birthday?

301
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:06,560
 But actually, keyboards, people have found recently that they disadvantage female pianists.

302
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,440
 So, according to a recent study, they disadvantage 87% of female pianists.

303
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,760
 And they looked at the 12 best pianists in the world.

304
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,200
 And they all had spans of 8.8 inches or above,

305
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,440
 whereas the average female span is about seven inches.

306
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,080
 Wow.

307
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,240
 So, it's really difficult for women to play a lot of the songs.

308
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,240
 And so, they looked at those 12 people and there were two women on that group.

309
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,040
 And one had a hand span of nine inches.

310
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,640
 And the other one had a hand span of 9.5 inches,

311
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,920
 which goes to show that it's really difficult for women with normal sized hands to get there.

312
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
 But it's good that George Eliot's descendants have found work.

313
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,560
 She could only play the melody.

314
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
 She could never...

315
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,600
 Just with the family, those 50 years.

316
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,720
 So, as I say before, it's sort of like, were they angry about the idea that she was claimed...

317
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,320
 They said she had a massive hand or was it about the fact that she was a dairy farmer?

318
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,960
 That's a bit blurry.

319
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,520
 But they made sure that if anyone wanted to do a biography of her,

320
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,640
 the stipulation was, you were not allowed to mention the massive hand or the dairy thing.

321
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,640
 You just have to like, actually deny that that was a truth.

322
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,240
 And so, I was thinking about...

323
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
 That happens a lot, doesn't it, whenever a celebrity's interviewed,

324
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,160
 where they told a PR person says, "Don't ask the celebrity about this question."

325
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,880
 Yeah, I found this article by a guy called Jesse Mulligan, who's a New Zealand.

326
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,640
 And he collected, through other journalists, things that they've been told not to ask celebrities.

327
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,920
 So, for example, when Meatloaf went to Auckland,

328
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,400
 all people were told not to ask him what he wouldn't do for love.

329
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,200
 Is it an obvious one, right?

330
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,880
 When David Eich, the big conspiracy theorist, went to New Zealand,

331
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,920
 Dom Harvey interviewed him, and he was told no questions about his failed predictions,

332
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,320
 especially the one where he predicted New Zealand would completely disappear in the late 90s.

333
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,120
 And then lastly, the killers, the band, were playing the big day out in Australia,

334
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,960
 and the interviewers were told not to ask about Bruce Springsteen religion or beards.

335
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,360
 And that's because the lead singer is a Mormon.

336
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,600
 He'd recently grown a bit of a beard, and their new album was being compared to Bruce Springsteen.

337
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,440
 And at the press junket, one of the interviewers asked,

338
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,920
 "Who has the best beard? Jesus or Bruce Springsteen?"

339
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,240
 Very good, mate.

340
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,720
 OK, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

341
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,760
 My fact is that some grandfather clocks used to use ox testicles for their pulleys.

342
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,480
 Were they still attached?

343
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,480
 That would be silly. No, actually, this got sent to me by a listener,

344
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,320
 someone called Jenny Wildblood, and it's from a book called "Food in England" by Dorothy Hartley,

345
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,480
 and Dorothy Hartley was an incredible woman. She sort of documented all these social customs,

346
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,440
 dating back centuries, and she lived in the 20th century, and she died in it,

347
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,840
 and she recorded all these, she didn't make it out, damn it.

348
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:13,960
 So we don't have many places that this fact has written down, and it's from her book "Food in England,"

349
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,440
 and she says that the long testicle cord of a bull used to use all of the animal,

350
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:23,000
 and that cord was used as pulleys in some grandfather clocks, because it was strong in texture,

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,520
 and it was long. So, sorry, can I just ask, is the pulley the lump at the bottom of the pendulum?

352
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,240
 You've got the two things hanging down. No, the pendulum, the pulley, you know.

353
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,640
 The thing that you pull the stringy bit that has the blobby bit at the bottom.

354
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,120
 Thank you.

355
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,440
 OK, cool, and it was the blobby bit. No, it was the stringy bit.

356
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,440
 The stringy bit is the cord. The testicle cord is not the testicle, it's, yeah.

357
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,520
 No, in theory, they should have just used the testicle as the blobby bit. Yes, true, yeah.

358
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,360
 Use it all. Don't waste not one.

359
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,800
 There was one other thing it was useful. I tracked down the book, and it was also the long testicle

360
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:05,160
 cord of the ox was valued by drovers as a lash, so you might, as a cattle, be lashed by the testicle

361
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,720
 of your ancestors. By the testicles of your ancestors, sounds like an amazing exclamation.

362
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,440
 By the testicles of your ancestors. Are you crazy?

363
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,560
 So grandfather clocks.

364
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,640
 Let's all start picturing testicles and talk about grandfather clocks, which aren't as old as

365
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,880
 you might think, or the name isn't. So the name comes from 1876, and it's a song by a guy called

366
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,120
 Henry Claywork. So before grandfather clocks were called that, they were just called something out.

367
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,640
 They were called floor clocks, or they were called long clocks, or I think they had various names.

368
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:47,160
 But then he wrote this song, where he referred to them as grandfather's clock, and it's such a nice

369
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,000
 song. It's from the perspective of a grandson talking about how his grandfather's clock has been

370
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,880
 born at the same time as his grandfather, and they've both lived this life together, and they're

371
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,240
 really well bonded, and then when his grandfather dies, the clock stops working. And then it was covered

372
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,000
 by Johnny Cash some time later, and that's where we got the term. I guess you guys know that song,

373
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,960
 my grandfather's clock. My grandfather's clock. Yeah, I'd never heard it. It's based on a natural clock.

374
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,080
 On a real-life clock in North York, sure, it's still there. I've forgotten where it. I think it's

375
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:26,680
 near Dalington, and Henry Claywork was in this hotel, in this restaurant, and he saw this clock,

376
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,480
 and they told him the story of how it had stopped on the day that the guy died, and that's how he wrote

377
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,040
 the song. He said, "By the testicles of my ancestors, that's something for a song." Historians think that

378
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,840
 it was a marketing gimmick used by the innkeepers to dress up their inability to get the clock repaired.

379
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:49,880
 I didn't know that, as well as a grandfather clock, you could get a grandmother clock and a grand

380
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,280
 daughter clock. How cool is that? How is the gender differentiated on clocks? No gender difference,

381
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,560
 but it's height difference is what it is. They use the vagina of a nox.

382
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:13,720
 So, a grandfather clock is generally agreed to measure at least six foot three in height.

383
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,360
 So, that's a grandfather clock. A grandmother clock is six foot three below.

384
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,400
 You have to dig a hole, six foot three down into the ground.

385
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,760
 You need to go that way. Anything under six foot three is a grandmother clock.

386
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,600
 Andy said is right. What's the grand daughter clock?

387
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:42,360
 Daughter clock is exactly six foot three. It's anything that measures in between three and five feet.

388
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,680
 So, it still needs to be a tall standing clock. Otherwise, then, it's just a really tall clock,

389
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,560
 but it doesn't get status as a grand. And you also get the George Elliott clock, where one of the

390
00:19:51,560 --> 00:20:03,880
 hands is really big. So, clocks have an amazing history, actually. So, the first clocks or some of

391
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,600
 the first clocks were water clocks. And the first water clock I could find evidence of was from

392
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,640
 ancient Greece, and its whole purpose was to stop people going on too long in words, which is a water

393
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:21,240
 clock. So, the way it works in ancient Greece was actually quite different to what came afterwards,

394
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,720
 but basically, what you had was you had a bowl, a small bowl, and you've got a little hole in the

395
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,800
 bottom of that bowl, and then you put it in a bigger bowl of water, and then the water gradually goes

396
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,520
 up through the hole in the bowl, and the time that bowl takes to sink is a certain passage of time.

397
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,200
 And they would use this to time people's speeches in parliament. So, the politician was

398
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,520
 whining on too long, and then you'd be like, "Mmm, the bowl's underwater now, get off the stage, mate."

399
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,520
 And then that was that was their purpose. Wow, that's pretty cool. That is cool. Bring it back. They should

400
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,000
 put the politician in the bowl of water and just slowly the speech we had. I think everyone has put a

401
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,320
 woman in like, "That would be amazing." That's a game show, I think. Yeah. It's time to play,

402
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:10,840
 "Hole in the Bowl." Do you know why we say a clock when, if you say it's for a clock,

403
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,280
 why we say that rather than just saying it's four? Because it's not. No, I don't know why we say that.

404
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,760
 Well, so this goes back such a long way. This goes back to when the, so, sundials for what we used

405
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,160
 before mechanization came into clocks. In the west was about the 14th century when mechanical

406
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:35,000
 clocks came in. And in sundials, what you had was the day was divided into 12 equal hours, and the

407
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,280
 night was divided into 12 equal hours. And so because the day is longer in summer, then the hours in

408
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,880
 summer would be much longer than the hours in winter. Yes. But with mechanical clocks, all hours

409
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,120
 are the same length. And so, when mechanical clocks came in, then people were sort of living on a

410
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,400
 half sundial, half mechanical clock basis. And so if you said, "What's the time?" As someone said,

411
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:07,800
 it's 12, or 12 is a bad, the worst possible example. That's the only one way. It's the same regardless.

412
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,400
 If you said it's eight, then they say, "Well, what do you mean? Do you mean eight on the sundial?

413
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,320
 Or do you mean eight on the mechanical clock?" And that's why it's eight o'clock, as an eight on the

414
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,920
 mechanical clock. That's what I'm going to start saying. It's eight o' sundial. Okay, we need to move on.

415
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,240
 It is time for fact number three, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that the first

416
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:35,480
 motel was meant to be called a motor hotel, but the sign was too small to fit all the letters on.

417
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,040
 Couldn't you have just written smaller? He could have done that, I guess, but he'd already bought the

418
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,600
 letters and it's all the pieces on there. And also, below a certain font size, it's not a useful sign

419
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:56,760
 anymore. So right. It becomes a notice. So this is the milestone motel in, which was opened in 1925.

420
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,080
 It was in San Luis Obispo, which is exactly in between Los Angeles and San Francisco. And people

421
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,760
 had started using their cars to kind of drive around. And that was a very popular journey. But before that,

422
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,120
 people had to just kind of park into the lay-by and kind of camp. But he started this new idea of

423
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,360
 having a hotel where people could drive up and they could stay there. And so he wanted to call it the

424
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:25,160
 milestone motor hotel, but he couldn't fit it on his sign. It sounded really cool. I've seen

425
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,520
 photos of it. He was very inspired by sort of Spanish houses. So it's this beautiful. I mean,

426
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,200
 if you picture what an American motel is like now, it's the exact opposite. This was luxury. It looks

427
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:44,200
 stunning. It had enough rooms for 160 people to stay there. It had showers, central heating. It

428
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:50,600
 even had rooms for people's chauffeurs to sleep in. That's how much of an upper-class idea it was for

429
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,600
 him. And unfortunately, I think I'm right in saying he was unable to sort of trademark the idea.

430
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,400
 So as soon as he did it, everyone leaped in and opened their own and his idea of franchising it

431
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,960
 was out the window. That's right. He was called Arthur Heinemann.

432
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,360
 And we should say, because everyone's always wondered what's the difference between a hotel and a

433
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,040
 motel. And I think this is right. A motel basically means you can park up next to your room and

434
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:23,080
 go into it, right? And it's all kind of, the motel is in sort of a seashape usually and it's just

435
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,280
 all on one floor and you just walk straight into it. But there's no rules. So you can have a motel that's

436
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,560
 a hotel or hotel that's a motel. Yeah. But they had a bad reputation and even before Psycho,

437
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:41,800
 so imagine what that did for them. So from then, in 1940, Jay Agahueva, who was director of the FBI,

438
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 said that most motels were dens of vice and high doubts for criminals. And they had this reputation

439
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,320
 for what was called the Hot Pillow Trade, which basically means the shadows of guests stay there

440
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,120
 in the space of 24 hours and not because they're really busy. So there was a study done which found

441
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:03,400
 that about 16 guests per night were staying at one motel because it was a place that you would go

442
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,480
 with your put mistress or your master. And you have a quick shag, you book it for an hour and then

443
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:16,840
 you go again and then you leave. And a 1935 study, which was done by a Texas university, found that 75%

444
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:23,720
 of my tell visits were one man and one woman remaining for a very short stay. And they also found that

445
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:33,320
 in one motel, 102 out of 109 guests signed in under fake names. Wow. They were dodgy joints.

446
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,800
 There's one really dodgy one, which is in Nevada. It's called the clown motel. And wherever you look,

447
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:45,240
 there are clowns looking at you. Oh my god. Basically, every wall there's a clown looking at you.

448
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,400
 But it's all right. You can kind of just nip out of the back if you want. But unfortunately, if you do

449
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,480
 that, you go to the historic minus cemetery where they have hundreds of corpses from people who died in

450
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:02,920
 the plague. Yeah. Oh god. A below ground. That's the way thing. I read up on that as well. They describe it

451
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:10,040
 as an abandoned cemetery. And I don't know how you abandoned a cemetery. Right. We're going everyone.

452
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,440
 Is your last chance for the bus? All right. I'd rather like this. In 2017, there was a man in

453
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,880
 India who was arrested for stealing more than 120 televisions from budget hotels across the country

454
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,080
 in an incredible four month crime spree. That was one a day. And his motor's operating was brilliant.

455
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,920
 He would check in and carry, as the report said, a fairly large suitcase. And if the TV in his room

456
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,160
 was really big, he would go off to the shops for a bit and come back with a really big suitcase.

457
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,040
 Well, he would just leave with that. He was caught. He was caught. Yeah.

458
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,680
 I'm amazed it took that long. I know. I found the worst hotel in the world. Oh, great.

459
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,720
 Well, there are theories, obviously, because there's not an official title. But one that gets quoted

460
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,600
 as the worst hotel in the world is the grand hotel in Pristina, which is the capital in Kosovo.

461
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,080
 And it has truly atrocious reviews. It's very, very, very bad. And when he was asked about it last

462
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,120
 year, the actual president of Kosovo said, "I don't think it is the worst hotel in the world,

463
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:19,720
 but that is because the world is very big." This is one more called Hans Brinker, which is an Amsterdam,

464
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:25,560
 but they make a virtue of how bad it is. They kind of advertise it. They say, unfortunately,

465
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,840
 most of the reviews are really true. The hotel website, actual website, for the hotel, says it's

466
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,680
 comparable to a minimum security prison. And they also advertise themselves as being environmentally

467
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:45,560
 friendly, because the curtains double up as towels. Okay, it is time for our final

468
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:52,760
 fact of the show. And that is Chisinski. My fact is that a man found guilty of deer poaching has

469
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,520
 been sentenced to a year in prison and been ordered to watch Bambi once a month during that year.

470
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,440
 This is great. So this was actually the end of last year, and it was in Missouri, and a judge sentenced

471
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,400
 a man called David Berry, Jr. And he had been done for poaching. He was like a family thing,

472
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,800
 like his dad was doing, his brother was doing it, I think. And the judge said, "Look, you've killed

473
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,840
 hundreds of deer, so I want you to watch Bambi and see what that deer might have felt like."

474
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,760
 And apparently, the prosecution said that the judge is hoping there will be some kind of emotional

475
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,760
 reaction. And weirdly, the guy who worked for the prosecution was called Don Trossa, so it felt like

476
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:44,280
 in the deer faction. I think if he's killed hundreds of deer, as he has, I think he might be able to

477
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,280
 cope with Bambi without cracking. I'm not sure who meant his ways because of the Bambi. I think it's a

478
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:55,480
 good idea, but... No, well, there might be something to the idea. So the person who played young Bambi

479
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,840
 in Bambi, he was the voice of Bambi. He became a US Marine, so he had to take lives, unfortunately,

480
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,680
 as part of his career, but he said that experience of seeing what had happened in Bambi's story meant

481
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,560
 that he never could bring himself to kill an animal. So maybe it does affect. Yeah, just killed.

482
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,520
 Shiller to humans. Yeah, yeah. But the one problem is that according to Sheriff Brad Delay,

483
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,560
 who is in charge of the Lawrence County Jail, where they sent this guy, they only have one

484
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,640
 cinema. So whenever they put it on, they have to get everyone else out of the room, and no one

485
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,320
 else is allowed to watch anything, and this guy just has to watch Bambi. That's amazing.

486
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,680
 Did they just run free? No, it's not. It's just in the recreation room. They just go to another part

487
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,920
 of the prison. Okay. They don't go, well, the cinema's out of use. Why don't you just have a run

488
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,040
 around? It's all right. Just come back in an hour. An hour or two, he'll be all right.

489
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,080
 He's amazing. This actor who played Bambi, Donnie Dunnigan, he was five years old when he got the role,

490
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,000
 which, you know, because that's what the role called for. But he had been in a few movies already,

491
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,760
 but his agent at the time hated the sound of the film, and he said, I've got a much bigger role for

492
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,040
 you in a Western. So I think you should take that and not become Bambi. And Donnie Dunnigan

493
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:19,400
 heard this agent talking to his mum on the phone, and he was quite rude to his mum on the phone.

494
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,760
 And so he fired his agent at the age of five, a variety round of stories saying five-year-old actor

495
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,480
 fires his manager. Which is pretty cool. You can't see Bambi doing that. But he did say he had this

496
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,800
 amazing moment, and this kind of depends on you having seen Bambi, which I learned to my horror

497
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,720
 that James and Dan haven't. Presumably you have. I have. Okay, good. He fought in Vietnam,

498
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,560
 Donnie Dunnigan, much later on, obviously. And do you remember the scene in Bambi where it's quite

499
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:52,440
 near the end, and Bambi gets shot, and he collapses, and you think Bambi's in real trouble here,

500
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,120
 and then his father, the big scary deer, sorry, this is a huge spoiler by the way, guys. But the big

501
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,120
 scary deer comes up over him, and suddenly says, you have to get up, looks down at him, and says, you

502
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,760
 know, Bambi, come on, you have to get up. By the testicles of your ancestors, you must get up.

503
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:22,440
 It's a very haunting and moving scene. But we all remember it. Yes, he says that verbatim.

504
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:29,560
 And anyway, Donnie Dunnigan fought in Vietnam, and Grenade went off, and Bazzoli, he was not to the

505
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,000
 ground, and he got a bullet to the leg, exactly like Bambi did in the film, got a bullet to the leg,

506
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,400
 collapsed, and his sergeant, he worked up to find his sergeant standing over him, saying, sir,

507
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,600
 you must get up, you have to get up, and he goes up, isn't that amazing? That's crazy. He was shot

508
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,560
 in a lot of places. He was asked to enumerate it, and he said he was shot in the back of the head,

509
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,880
 the stomach, the left leg, the left lung, the scrotum. But he didn't tell anyone else in the U.S.

510
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,400
 Marines that he was the voice of Bambi, because he knew he would have been bullied.

511
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:05,480
 You're going to say he didn't tell anyone he was shot. But your testicles appear to be bleeding.

512
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:13,480
 I just don't need them to clock somewhere. So Bambi is based on a book, and not many people know it's

513
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:19,560
 called Bambi a Life in the Woods, and it's by Felix Salton, and it's very different to the movie.

514
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,320
 So in chapter 12, Bambi has sex with his cousin.

515
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:28,280
 And that's only in the director's cut of the movie, isn't it?

516
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:36,040
 In chapter 12, he has a restless desire. He no longer recognizes his cousin, Faeline.

517
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:42,760
 She's now a sex object, and he has his merry way with Faeline all night, and he's so turned on

518
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:48,120
 he forgets to eat. And then a little bit later, Bambi's father gives him some drugs.

519
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:56,840
 And he says it tastes terribly better and smells sickeningly, and after many days, in an opium like

520
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,160
 days, he heals. No. I'm afraid so. What? He does, we should say in Bambi, he does get with his

521
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,640
 cousin. I don't know, I haven't seen it. Faeline in the film is his cousin, and he gets, you

522
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:14,600
 don't see a graphic sexy in the edited version. I'd love to see Felix being sat down by Walt Disney going,

523
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,120
 we love it. We love it. We're so excited to abort it. We've got a few changes we'd like to make.

524
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,320
 Another drug scene. We have a thing that's going to go down well with the six-year-olds.

525
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,360
 In the same year as he wrote Bambi, Felix Salton, he wrote a book called The Hound of Florence,

526
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,160
 which is about a man who turns into a dog every other day. That's like they could have done something

527
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,360
 out of that. That sounds quite good. Yeah. Well, he wrote also another very famous book, Danny,

528
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:52,200
 which was actually an adult erotica book. Really? Yeah, it was called Josephine Mutzenbacher,

529
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:00,520
 the story of a Viennese whore, as told by herself. And it appeared 20 years before his Bambi book,

530
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,320
 but obviously you can see related themes according to how they return on novel. Yeah, it's still to

531
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,880
 that. It sold three million copies. It was a very big book. I'm just picturing some sort of

532
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:19,080
 catastrophic mix-up with the two scripts for the films. Actually, weirdly, just quickly, the actor

533
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,440
 Donnie Dunnigan, who played Bambi, met Thumper for the first time when he was in his 80s. So,

534
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,520
 they never met. The kids just went into film the scenes and then obviously the Thumper Kid went

535
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,600
 in afterwards and then they met a few years ago when they were both really old men. They guessed it

536
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,480
 on a TV show and Bambi got to be like, "Hey Thumper." That's very true, really sweet. That's very sweet.

537
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,920
 There's a character in it that Bambi refers to as man. Was that right? Yeah, one man is man.

538
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,920
 It's man. Yeah, so that was a code that got used in the Disney offices. Anytime Walt Disney arrived,

539
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,400
 all the animators and everyone would go, "Man is in the forest." That was the code. Oh, really?

540
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:59,800
 To let everyone know, "Look like you're busy." Oh, really? And man got voted the number 20 villain

541
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:06,040
 in the American Film Institute's top 100 villains of all time. Did he? Just man. And also,

542
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,800
 Bambi was voted the 20th most scary horror film of all time. That was according to Time Magazine.

543
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:21,080
 Wow. They did study a dead deer when they were making the film. Yeah, the animators wanted to see

544
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,440
 exactly how a deer would move and how it fit together. So, they observed a deer corpse in various

545
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,160
 stages of decomposition for over several evenings to see the muscles and tendons and how they all fit

546
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:37,560
 together. I know. They said there was a rich aroma in the air. Yeah. But actually, according to

547
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,080
 scientists, if Bambi's mother had died, then really they should have just shot Bambi as well.

548
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:49,080
 Because actually, young deer, when they're often, they tend to have very bad lives because their

549
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:55,720
 antlers don't work properly and they're very likely to be killed. So, the humane thing if a deer gets

550
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,480
 off and is, I've left to the audience, I must say. Wow. Wait, the antlers don't work properly?

551
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,760
 Yeah, it's weird. They don't grow properly. They grow much slower, which means then they're

552
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:12,360
 less able to defend themselves. Wow. We should do a series of no such thing as a fish,

553
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:19,640
 factually accurate movies. Tonight, Bambi. Four minutes long. Well, here's another thing,

554
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,320
 man. In 2017, scientists discovered the first instance of a deer eating human remains.

555
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:33,720
 We put that in there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They found this deer in the middle of the forest and it was

556
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,880
 holding a human bone in its mouth like a cigar. Where did it get the bone? There had been someone

557
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,080
 who had died, unfortunately. It hadn't killed someone. No, no. Because they do eat meat. I couldn't

558
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:52,520
 believe this. I was reading a blog by someone in America who's been hunting white tail deer in the U.S.

559
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,920
 and says that they can eat meat and they fish. So, first of all, they eat birds. Sometimes they'll

560
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,560
 catch a bird and then they'll eat it and then they go fishing, she said. They don't go fishing.

561
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,920
 They go fishing. They get a rod and a tackle, but no, no. This is what you said. They use the

562
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,520
 hooves to disable fish such as trout. They will then grab the fish with their mouths, chew it up

563
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:26,280
 and swallow it. Wow. I think if you, as a trout, if you can be caught by a deer, you deserve it.

564
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:34,520
 You failed as a trout. You got cocky. You got too cocky. We're going to have to wrap up very

565
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,240
 shortly. It's quite common in America or relatively common where they give these kind of weird

566
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:44,920
 punishments, don't they? There's a particular judge called Michael Sicione who is from Payne'sville,

567
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,080
 Ohio. Payne'sville. This is a great name. But over the time, there was a guy who was caught with

568
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,120
 a loaded gun and he was ordered to the local mob to look at corpses. There was a guy who had referred

569
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:02,040
 to a police officer as a pig and he was ordered to stand beside a live pig with a sign that read,

570
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,120
 "This is not a police officer." That's clever. Imagine if that police officer got involved

571
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:14,280
 in a major crisis where he got involved. There was a car chase and this guy with this massive sign

572
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:23,960
 he was next to a pig, not a police officer. Imagine the pig suddenly gets involved in like this

573
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,680
 insane. That's a Disney movie I want to say. Oh my god. I still think it's a good idea.

574
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:38,040
 It doesn't always work that thing. In 2008, I think it was the same judge. The 24-year-old

575
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,520
 had been blasting really loud music in his car and he was said, "You can either pay this huge fine

576
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,400
 or you can have a very tiny fine but you have to listen to 20 hours of classical music

577
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,840
 to sort of show you that listening to music you don't like is not fun and you shouldn't

578
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,000
 play it for other people." And the guy said, "Okay, I'll take the 20 hours of classical music."

579
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:05,080
 And he lasted 15 minutes and then said, "I'm just going to pay the fine actually." Wow. Okay, that is it.

580
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,480
 That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you would like to get in contact
