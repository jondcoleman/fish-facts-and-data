00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:19,"of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:19,00:00:22,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:22,00:00:24,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here"
00:00:24,00:00:28,"with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:30,00:00:33,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:40,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna."
00:00:40,00:00:42,- My fact this week is that indigenous Bolivian women
00:00:42,00:00:46,"traditionally wear huge, colorful skirts and bowler hats."
00:00:46,00:00:49,(laughing)
00:00:49,00:00:52,And I can't believe I'd never really seen this before.
00:00:52,00:00:54,"It's striking, and they all do."
00:00:54,00:00:57,"So these are, they tend to be known as Cholitas,"
00:00:57,00:01:01,which is basically a term for like the Aymara and the Quechua
00:01:01,00:01:03,and other rural Bolivian women.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"- Not Charlie Chaplin, as it sort of sounds like,"
00:01:07,00:01:07,the Cholitas.
00:01:07,00:01:09,"- It's a, I know you're trying to make a jump"
00:01:09,00:01:11,"to the Charlie Chaplin bowler hat,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,and I appreciate that.
00:01:12,00:01:14,"- Yeah, so like his fan club, you know,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,"all these like Lady Gaga's, I call them monsters."
00:01:17,00:01:18,"- Beliebers, yeah."
00:01:18,00:01:19,"- Maybe you've blown this wide open,"
00:01:19,00:01:21,that is why they do it.
00:01:21,00:01:24,"So Cholitas, it used to be a pejorative term I think,"
00:01:24,00:01:28,"and it was, it comes from the Spanish Cholo for mixed race,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,but it's like very much reclaimed by them now.
00:01:31,00:01:32,"And if you look them up,"
00:01:32,00:01:35,"they always wear these stunning kind of white,"
00:01:35,00:01:37,like silky waistcoats with a brooch
00:01:37,00:01:40,and these huge dresses with like petticoats underneath.
00:01:40,00:01:43,So like really big Elizabethan style dresses.
00:01:43,00:01:46,"And then a bowler hat, which doesn't fit."
00:01:46,00:01:47,- But it does work.
00:01:47,00:01:49,It makes the look awesome.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"- Oh, it works in that way."
00:01:50,00:01:51,- Oh yeah.
00:01:51,00:01:53,"- And it works in like a, you know,"
00:01:53,00:01:55,because bowler hats were originally invented
00:01:55,00:01:57,"to stop twigs from hurting your head when they,"
00:01:57,00:01:58,so I wondered if...
00:01:58,00:02:01,- It would probably stop a twig from hurting your head.
00:02:01,00:02:02,- It's not functional.
00:02:02,00:02:04,"- I'm talking fashion, I was saying it works."
00:02:04,00:02:07,"- That works, it does work."
00:02:07,00:02:10,"Yes, and we're not quite sure why they do it."
00:02:10,00:02:13,They started doing it the turn of the 20th century.
00:02:13,00:02:15,There's the legend that when British
00:02:15,00:02:17,"and Irish railway workers were in Bolivia,"
00:02:17,00:02:19,"which they worked, the railway building company"
00:02:19,00:02:21,was a British company.
00:02:21,00:02:23,There was a big shipment of bowler hats
00:02:23,00:02:25,that was sent for them to wear.
00:02:25,00:02:27,'Cause it was like workers hats and they were too small.
00:02:27,00:02:30,So some clever marketing person flogged them
00:02:30,00:02:31,to the indigenous women.
00:02:31,00:02:34,"I think there was a guy called Domingo Solingo,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,who did a very good job of popularizing them
00:02:37,00:02:39,and like ran a good PR campaign.
00:02:39,00:02:40,- Try to get men to wear it first
00:02:40,00:02:42,"from one of the other stories, versions of the story."
00:02:42,00:02:43,And they were just not interested.
00:02:43,00:02:46,"So they're just as a last minute thing when women,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- But then, when he was walking along"
00:02:48,00:02:50,"with a tray of samples one day, he tripped over"
00:02:50,00:02:53,and one of the hats fell onto a woman's head.
00:02:53,00:02:55,"And completely by accident, he discovered."
00:02:55,00:02:58,"- That's so interesting, 'cause they are, I mean,"
00:02:58,00:03:00,they are comically small.
00:03:00,00:03:03,"They're not like, you know, just a little bit too small"
00:03:03,00:03:04,"to go on your head, are they?"
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- They're not like yamulka, if you're a bit string."
00:03:06,00:03:08,"It's like, yeah, just--"
00:03:08,00:03:09,- They're clearly too small.
00:03:09,00:03:10,It's what I'm saying. - They sit on top.
00:03:10,00:03:11,They sit on top. - They sit on top.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"- So I mean, who were they made for, is my--"
00:03:14,00:03:15,- Yes.
00:03:15,00:03:17,"- This happened, we have this in the house all the time"
00:03:17,00:03:20,where you order something and then a novelty small sized
00:03:20,00:03:22,version comes in the post.
00:03:22,00:03:23,That must be what it was. - What?
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- You know, like, we bought a crown"
00:03:25,00:03:27,"for my son, Will's birthday and it arrived"
00:03:27,00:03:30,and it was the size that would fit a Kendall's head
00:03:30,00:03:32,by accident because we just hadn't read the measurements.
00:03:32,00:03:33,We got a washing line. - I'm not telling you the measurements.
00:03:33,00:03:34,- Need to read the measurements.
00:03:34,00:03:36,They clearly didn't hear as well.
00:03:36,00:03:39,- One thing I like about the charita thing
00:03:39,00:03:41,"is that they, I didn't really, I mean,"
00:03:41,00:03:43,I didn't know anything about this style before
00:03:43,00:03:46,"or even this cultural grouping before researching this,"
00:03:46,00:03:47,but they weren't allowed to walk freely
00:03:47,00:03:49,"in the main square of La Paz,"
00:03:49,00:03:50,"which is the capital of Bolivia,"
00:03:50,00:03:54,or in the wealthy suburbs in this outfit for many years.
00:03:54,00:03:56,And then it's really been brought back on board
00:03:56,00:03:59,to the extent that they're officially a part
00:03:59,00:04:00,of the city's cultural heritage now.
00:04:00,00:04:02,It's called the charita of La Paz.
00:04:02,00:04:06,And also there are charita fashion shows.
00:04:06,00:04:08,There is a charita modeling agency
00:04:08,00:04:11,and I'm sure you guys came across the Fighting Charitas.
00:04:11,00:04:13,"- Oh yeah, I did not, I'd like to hear about"
00:04:13,00:04:15,"the Fighting Charitas. - It's just a wrestling group,"
00:04:15,00:04:18,but they're female wrestlers who wrestle in traditional--
00:04:18,00:04:19,- With the hat. - With the hat.
00:04:19,00:04:21,- Do they do like odd job?
00:04:21,00:04:22,- The odd job kill.
00:04:22,00:04:23,"Yeah, they do, yeah."
00:04:23,00:04:25,They die by the dozen every man.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"Anyway, the Fighting Charitas, they're all right."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"- That's the one where they play golf, isn't it?"
00:04:29,00:04:30,- Golf. (laughing)
00:04:30,00:04:32,"- That's the only Bond film I've seen,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,the one where they play golf.
00:04:33,00:04:35,- Did you Google Bond film golf?
00:04:35,00:04:36,- I just Google golf and it came up.
00:04:36,00:04:38,"- Right, do you have, you know, there's an app"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"that can tell you when to go to the toilet at the cinema,"
00:04:40,00:04:41,like toilet break.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Do you have an app that just tells you
00:04:42,00:04:43,when golf scenes are in a movie?
00:04:43,00:04:44,"- Yeah, yeah. - And you just show up"
00:04:44,00:04:45,for that bit?
00:04:45,00:04:48,"- I do, I only ever watched Caddy Shack in that Bond film."
00:04:48,00:04:50,(laughing)
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- They are a real happy story,"
00:04:52,00:04:54,"which, you know, we're all on the lookout for these days,"
00:04:54,00:04:57,but I think it was basically since Eva Morales
00:04:57,00:04:59,"was in charge of Bolivia, right,"
00:04:59,00:05:01,"who was their first indigenous president,"
00:05:01,00:05:03,who came in the early 2000s
00:05:03,00:05:06,and sort of completely rehabilitated their reputations
00:05:06,00:05:07,'cause they had been kind of ostracized
00:05:07,00:05:10,and had all these horrible repressive rules
00:05:10,00:05:12,made against them.
00:05:12,00:05:14,And now they're doing so well
00:05:14,00:05:18,and it's a real great story and they're quite well off.
00:05:18,00:05:21,They've got all these celebrations about their heritage.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"They have, I think they have a few indigenous people"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"in parliament, they're like lawyers and doctors"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"and yeah, it's quite nice 'cause they have since,"
00:05:29,00:05:31,like literally back in the day when the Spanish colonized
00:05:31,00:05:33,"and they wanted to distinguish them,"
00:05:33,00:05:37,the superior colonists from the indigenous people.
00:05:37,00:05:38,"So they said, okay, well, what do people"
00:05:38,00:05:40,who were lower class do in Spain?
00:05:40,00:05:41,They wear these big peasant dresses
00:05:41,00:05:44,and so they made them all wear these big peasant dresses.
00:05:44,00:05:45,- What does that come from?
00:05:45,00:05:46,"- So yeah, they put them in these,"
00:05:46,00:05:48,to just say like you're beneath us
00:05:48,00:05:49,"and the charlatans just went, all right,"
00:05:49,00:05:50,we're gonna own this.
00:05:50,00:05:53,- It's interesting 'cause like the big dresses
00:05:53,00:05:54,come from the Spanish peasants
00:05:54,00:05:56,"and the Bola hats come from British,"
00:05:56,00:05:57,"you know, up class people."
00:05:57,00:05:59,"- Yeah, I see. - They're such a fusion."
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- Yes, yeah."
00:06:01,00:06:03,Have you guys ever drunk Coca-Cola?
00:06:03,00:06:04,- No.
00:06:04,00:06:05,(laughs)
00:06:05,00:06:06,- Yes.
00:06:06,00:06:07,- What kind of a question is that?
00:06:07,00:06:08,"- You might be right, you might be right that you haven't."
00:06:08,00:06:12,So this launched in April 2010 and Coca-Cola
00:06:12,00:06:15,"- What is it, cola, C-O-L-L-A, Coca-Cola."
00:06:15,00:06:19,"- Yeah, is a local Coca-Cola basically"
00:06:19,00:06:21,that they've just manufactured on their own.
00:06:21,00:06:24,So it has a red label with white writing.
00:06:24,00:06:26,"I mean, the packaging is very similar,"
00:06:26,00:06:29,but it's sold as a legit product there.
00:06:29,00:06:30,They've not been in trouble.
00:06:30,00:06:32,- And they're all right with this.
00:06:32,00:06:34,Or are we now getting them in trouble
00:06:34,00:06:36,if someone knows that Coca-Cola is listening to cola?
00:06:36,00:06:37,"- No, it's becoming a bigger, yeah, yeah."
00:06:37,00:06:39,- 'Cause it's named after the cola people
00:06:39,00:06:42,"and the coca nut, which is in it."
00:06:42,00:06:43,- Yeah.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"- And they say to Coca-Cola or Brit-Vay-Co,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,"everyone's Coca-Cola, they say,"
00:06:47,00:06:50,"""Well, you know, there's nothing you can do about it."""
00:06:50,00:06:52,"And I'm not sure Coca-Cola are particularly happy about it,"
00:06:52,00:06:53,but there's nothing they can do.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- They're definitely not happy about it.
00:06:54,00:06:55,But they can do cool.
00:06:55,00:06:58,And they've got Coca-Leaf extracts in it as well.
00:06:58,00:07:01,So actually it's an illegal drink to be sold over here.
00:07:01,00:07:04,"So they're quite regional because it's legal there,"
00:07:04,00:07:05,"but for us, yeah, it's a drug."
00:07:05,00:07:07,"- I think we should legalize,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"I mean, we should probably legalize all drugs,"
00:07:09,00:07:10,"but Coca-Leaves, I definitely think"
00:07:10,00:07:12,we should legalize in this country.
00:07:12,00:07:14,- So we can get this cola drink?
00:07:14,00:07:17,"- No, because like when I was in the Andes,"
00:07:17,00:07:18,it's the best thing.
00:07:18,00:07:21,It just gives you a little bit of a pickup.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Yeah.
00:07:22,00:07:22,"- Oh, it's so useful."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"Honestly, when you've got a hangover or you're tired"
00:07:24,00:07:26,"or anything, just chew a Coca-Leaf"
00:07:26,00:07:29,and it just makes you feel so much better.
00:07:29,00:07:30,And it's just a tiny little buzz.
00:07:30,00:07:31,- Have you tried cocaine James?
00:07:31,00:07:32,You'll love it.
00:07:32,00:07:35,(all laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:38,"- I think the, I think the Pope has tried the Coca-Leaves."
00:07:38,00:07:40,"- I think he visited several years ago and when he went,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,"I think he said, oh, I'll have some of that."
00:07:42,00:07:43,So.
00:07:43,00:07:44,"- Yeah, everywhere."
00:07:44,00:07:45,"Like if you go to a hotel,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"you know, if you go to a hotel in the UK,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,they might have a bowl of Murray Mint.
00:07:49,00:07:50,"- Oh, a lovely hotel would have that."
00:07:50,00:07:51,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:07:51,00:07:54,"Well, all the hotels in Peru and in Bolivia,"
00:07:54,00:07:55,they have a bowl of these leaves
00:07:55,00:07:56,and you just pick them up and chew on them.
00:07:56,00:07:58,"- It's actually a bowl, it's a bowl of a hat"
00:07:58,00:07:59,"upside down, isn't it?"
00:07:59,00:08:00,Full of those leaves.
00:08:00,00:08:01,- Are you sure it's not just potpourri?
00:08:01,00:08:04,(all laughing)
00:08:04,00:08:06,"Because it leaves your breath really,"
00:08:06,00:08:09,really nice at the end of it.
00:08:09,00:08:12,"- Guys, did you know, not 25 minutes walk"
00:08:12,00:08:13,"from where we're sitting right now,"
00:08:13,00:08:16,is where the first bowl of hats were sold.
00:08:16,00:08:17,- Is that true?
00:08:17,00:08:20,- Invented and sold in St. James's Street.
00:08:20,00:08:22,"I mean, it might have been invented in someone's house,"
00:08:22,00:08:25,"you know, but it was brought to St. James's Street"
00:08:25,00:08:28,to lock and co-hatters who've been going
00:08:28,00:08:31,since like basically the 17th century
00:08:31,00:08:32,when they were founded.
00:08:32,00:08:34,And the shop is still there today.
00:08:34,00:08:36,So you can still buy hats from them.
00:08:36,00:08:37,"- I think we'll pass there quite a lot, do you?"
00:08:37,00:08:40,"- Right, so that's where the bowl of hat is from."
00:08:40,00:08:41,- That's very exciting.
00:08:41,00:08:41,"- That is exciting, isn't it?"
00:08:41,00:08:42,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:08:42,00:08:43,- We're gonna turn up next week in a bowl of hat
00:08:43,00:08:45,"'cause I can see it, of the four of us."
00:08:45,00:08:47,"- Just a comically small one, I think."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:08:49,00:08:51,"- No, that's already, it's a nice shop."
00:08:51,00:08:52,I don't think they make a huge deal out of it
00:08:52,00:08:53,on the shop front.
00:08:53,00:08:55,"- No, they don't, and their legacy is huge"
00:08:55,00:08:57,"because they not only sell bowl of hats,"
00:08:57,00:08:58,they sell all kinds of hats.
00:08:58,00:09:00,"They sold Admiral Lord Nelson,"
00:09:00,00:09:01,"his, what was it called?"
00:09:01,00:09:03,"- The Bicorn. - Bicorn, sorry."
00:09:03,00:09:05,"- Yeah, the Bicorn that he rode."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"- Yeah, Napoleon was the Tricorn."
00:09:07,00:09:10,"- You don't wanna go to use them, they get very offended."
00:09:10,00:09:12,"- No one with a unicorn hat, which is insane."
00:09:12,00:09:13,(laughing)
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- And I think that would've,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,that would've made the Battle of Trafalgar really exciting.
00:09:17,00:09:19,"- That's got the element of surprise, I think,"
00:09:19,00:09:21,in the unicorn hat.
00:09:21,00:09:24,"- According to Locke's, it was devised"
00:09:24,00:09:27,by a pair of people called Thomas and William Bowler.
00:09:27,00:09:30,"Okay, and they, Edward Cook said,"
00:09:30,00:09:33,"""Can you make this hat for us to Locke's?"""
00:09:33,00:09:34,"And Locke said, ""Well, we'll get our mates,"
00:09:34,00:09:37,"""Thomas and William Bowler, to make it."""
00:09:37,00:09:38,"Now, according to the OED,"
00:09:38,00:09:42,"the Bowler hat gets its name because it's shaped like a bowl,"
00:09:42,00:09:44,not because it's named after these guys' bowlers.
00:09:44,00:09:46,"So, I don't wanna upset the people at Locke and Co,"
00:09:46,00:09:49,"'cause I'm sure their story is completely true,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,but there is a suggestion that maybe
00:09:51,00:09:53,there's nothing to do with these Thomas and William Bowler
00:09:53,00:09:57,"people, and if you do look at the kind of newspaper archives,"
00:09:57,00:09:59,there was a thing called a bowl hat
00:09:59,00:10:01,"that existed before the Bowler hat,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,and you can see loads of examples of people
00:10:03,00:10:05,having their bowl hats stolen and stuff like that.
00:10:05,00:10:08,"- So, did the Bowlers exist for the credits?"
00:10:08,00:10:10,"- It feels like, no, in fact, they definitely existed."
00:10:10,00:10:12,"Thomas and William Bowler existed,"
00:10:12,00:10:14,"and actually, there was another guy called William Bowler"
00:10:14,00:10:17,"who existed before them, who was a famous hat maker."
00:10:17,00:10:20,"So, there were bowlers who were making hats for sure,"
00:10:20,00:10:23,but whether these guys invented the Bowler hat
00:10:23,00:10:25,"and gave the name to it, I'm not so sure."
00:10:25,00:10:27,- Yeah. - It's tough and really torn.
00:10:27,00:10:30,- I'm not gonna walk past Locke's sharp
00:10:30,00:10:34,"in case of odd job hat comes to us, you know, that's."
00:10:34,00:10:36,- Do you know what they have on Bowler hats?
00:10:36,00:10:39,"The curl at the edge, which I'd actually never noticed"
00:10:39,00:10:40,was a fundamental feature of them.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- What, on the brim?"
00:10:41,00:10:42,"- Yeah, so there's a brim,"
00:10:42,00:10:44,and then it curls very sharply inwards
00:10:44,00:10:47,"at a 40-degree angle, a little bit,"
00:10:47,00:10:52,"and it's a dorset curl, and it's named after Alfred Dorsey,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,"and this is niche, but he was basically,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,I think he was the Byron of France.
00:10:57,00:10:59,He was apparently extremely attractive.
00:10:59,00:11:00,"He was the handsomest man of his time,"
00:11:00,00:11:04,"and he was mates with Byron, in fact,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,"and he, the other time he might have seen him,"
00:11:06,00:11:10,is he's the model for the New Yorker mascot.
00:11:10,00:11:14,"You know if he, you know all the New Yorkers,"
00:11:14,00:11:16,you've got that bloke who's actually not wearing a bowler hat.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- That's a top hat.
00:11:17,00:11:17,- That's a top hat.
00:11:17,00:11:21,"He wore a number of different hats, just literally."
00:11:21,00:11:24,"- But that's him, his face is him, is what you're saying."
00:11:24,00:11:25,"- His silhouette is him, yeah."
00:11:25,00:11:26,- Alfred Monaco?
00:11:26,00:11:28,"- He's got a magnifying glass, I think,"
00:11:28,00:11:29,and maybe a monocle.
00:11:29,00:11:30,- I think you're thinking of Monopoly.
00:11:30,00:11:32,- Mr. Monopoly is not exactly anything of that.
00:11:32,00:11:34,- That was actually based on Keats.
00:11:34,00:11:37,"- Yeah, apparently, according to--"
00:11:37,00:11:38,- Glad we settled that.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"- No, Anna, that's a great knowledge about his dorset curls."
00:11:42,00:11:44,- I think let's connect the bowler hat to the New Yorker.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"- Sorry, what was the link?"
00:11:46,00:11:49,He invented the thing on the rim.
00:11:49,00:11:50,- It was named after him.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- The curl.
00:11:51,00:11:52,- 'Cause he was such a dandy.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"- I guess he was a curly, curly dandy."
00:11:54,00:11:55,- Wow.
00:11:55,00:11:56,- That's really cool.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"- Well, that's really cool as a strong term, but it's--"
00:11:59,00:12:01,- It's probably the one thing I'll remember
00:12:01,00:12:02,from this podcast.
00:12:02,00:12:04,"- I know, he'll be so annoyed about that."
00:12:04,00:12:08,- The Susie Dent wrote an amazing book
00:12:08,00:12:11,"about how slang is used amongst different tribes of people,"
00:12:11,00:12:14,so like taxi drivers and dock workers and stuff like that.
00:12:14,00:12:16,And she mentions in that section
00:12:16,00:12:20,"that Hackney taxi cabs, the height of the cab,"
00:12:20,00:12:24,was based on the bowler hat height for when you're getting in.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"- Yep, sounds a bit dubious, but I think--"
00:12:27,00:12:28,- I don't know what you're saying.
00:12:28,00:12:29,I didn't say anything.
00:12:29,00:12:31,All I did was pull a face.
00:12:31,00:12:33,And the listener didn't notice that.
00:12:33,00:12:36,"- No, but I think that is a room of that sort of out there,"
00:12:36,00:12:37,isn't it?
00:12:37,00:12:40,"- I thought Hackney cabs were sort of for top parts,"
00:12:40,00:12:41,'cause bowler hats don't really have any height.
00:12:41,00:12:42,They're the same as a head.
00:12:42,00:12:44,- That would only add another centimeter or two
00:12:44,00:12:45,to the height of the cab.
00:12:45,00:12:47,"- Absolutely, but maybe a necessary extra centimeter."
00:12:47,00:12:49,It feels like you wouldn't redesign the whole cab.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"- You've got quite a long torso, Andy, don't you?"
00:12:51,00:12:54,"Oh, do you have long legs, actually, the short torso?"
00:12:54,00:12:55,- I've got a normal torso.
00:12:55,00:12:56,"- Oh, sorry."
00:12:56,00:13:01,"- Long, I've got a normal torso, long legs, long neck, short head."
00:13:01,00:13:04,"- Okay, and that's why the Murray cab,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,"it has a lot of legroom, doesn't it?"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"- A lot of legroom, and then a very low ceiling, yeah."
00:13:10,00:13:11,- Sorry.
00:13:11,00:13:12,(laughing)
00:13:12,00:13:14,"You know before we were talking about bicons,"
00:13:14,00:13:15,"tricons, and unicorns?"
00:13:15,00:13:16,- Yeah.
00:13:16,00:13:19,"- There is a, what I suppose would be a quadricon."
00:13:19,00:13:20,- No.
00:13:20,00:13:21,- Cool.
00:13:21,00:13:21,- And the quadricon is a very--
00:13:21,00:13:23,"- That's too much surprise, Andy, sorry."
00:13:23,00:13:24,- That's awesome.
00:13:24,00:13:26,"- The idea of a four-corner tat,"
00:13:26,00:13:27,which is not worth that.
00:13:27,00:13:28,- You think that's incredible.
00:13:28,00:13:29,- Okay.
00:13:29,00:13:30,- Yeah.
00:13:30,00:13:30,- It's up there with Alfred Dorsay.
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- That's the thing I'm going to remember, Anna."
00:13:32,00:13:34,- I suppose the reason it's interesting
00:13:34,00:13:36,"is because it is related to this fact,"
00:13:36,00:13:38,because it's the traditional hat
00:13:38,00:13:42,"of the Tuwanakan people of Bolivia,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,"and that is like a really old culture,"
00:13:44,00:13:47,"pre-Columbian culture in Bolivia,"
00:13:47,00:13:50,and they had these very intricately designed
00:13:50,00:13:52,"four-cornered hats that sort of,"
00:13:52,00:13:55,"the rich people would wear the intricately designed ones,"
00:13:55,00:13:57,"and the poor people were really plain ones,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,"but you'd have like birds' heads,"
00:13:59,00:14:01,you would stick on there.
00:14:01,00:14:03,Some of them had wings attached to them.
00:14:03,00:14:04,- That's awesome.
00:14:04,00:14:06,- But that sounds a bit grim.
00:14:06,00:14:06,- Yeah.
00:14:06,00:14:07,- Like a decapitated bird's head.
00:14:07,00:14:08,- Maybe.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"- They must have done some kind of,"
00:14:09,00:14:12,"you know, put pickled it or something."
00:14:12,00:14:12,- It was a different time.
00:14:12,00:14:13,- It's popular back in the day
00:14:13,00:14:15,"to put dead birds and things, wasn't it?"
00:14:15,00:14:16,- Yeah.
00:14:16,00:14:17,"- A full bird, yeah."
00:14:17,00:14:18,- Not a decap...
00:14:18,00:14:19,"Okay, gotcha."
00:14:19,00:14:21,- Not just chopping the head off and sticking it on.
00:14:21,00:14:23,- The bloodied neck sort of hanging out.
00:14:23,00:14:24,- I think they wiped that away.
00:14:24,00:14:25,- Yeah.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- The birds.
00:14:26,00:14:30,"Is that where we get, like wearing a knotted handkerchief"
00:14:30,00:14:31,on your head at the beach from this tribe?
00:14:31,00:14:32,"- Absolutely not, no."
00:14:32,00:14:35,(laughing)
00:14:35,00:14:38,- That would be quite unusual for this culture
00:14:38,00:14:40,"to come back to life having, you know,"
00:14:40,00:14:43,gone out before the Spanish came along
00:14:43,00:14:48,and then traveled to 1950s seaside hotels.
00:14:48,00:14:50,(laughing)
00:14:50,00:14:51,- That would be unusual.
00:14:51,00:14:55,- One of the greatest test pilots in America
00:14:55,00:14:58,for wartime planes was a gorilla
00:14:58,00:15:01,"wearing a bowler hat, smoking a cigar."
00:15:01,00:15:02,- Okay.
00:15:02,00:15:03,- Okay.
00:15:03,00:15:04,- And what I've done there is tricked you
00:15:04,00:15:07,"because actually, because actually it was a man."
00:15:07,00:15:09,(laughing)
00:15:09,00:15:11,- What's your career?
00:15:11,00:15:12,"- Oh, no, I do."
00:15:12,00:15:15,"- Oh, no, I don't allow you to say that."
00:15:15,00:15:17,This is a guy called Jack Valentine-Willems
00:15:17,00:15:20,and he was one of the greatest test pilot pilots
00:15:20,00:15:21,that were out there.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"And he used to take out planes that weren't ready,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,"that they were, it was advanced technology."
00:15:25,00:15:26,(laughing)
00:15:26,00:15:27,- Why would you do that?
00:15:27,00:15:29,"- Well, you know, you got a test pilot,"
00:15:29,00:15:29,he's testing.
00:15:29,00:15:31,"- No, but it is ready, right?"
00:15:31,00:15:33,He's not taking a plane with one wing.
00:15:33,00:15:35,"- No, no, but you're, sorry."
00:15:35,00:15:36,"As in, we don't know the limits"
00:15:36,00:15:38,to which we can push this particular plane.
00:15:38,00:15:41,So he would push it to places to see if it worked.
00:15:41,00:15:42,- He just made it sound like he was sneaking
00:15:42,00:15:44,into the hangar at night.
00:15:44,00:15:45,- Sorry.
00:15:45,00:15:47,"- No, these are, they were approved flights."
00:15:47,00:15:50,And what he used to do is a bit of a practical joker
00:15:50,00:15:51,is he used to bring with him a gorilla mask
00:15:51,00:15:54,and he used to bring a polar hat and a cigar.
00:15:54,00:15:56,And he would fly up to other processions of planes
00:15:56,00:15:59,that were flying and he would have that gear on
00:15:59,00:16:01,and he would wave at the other pilots.
00:16:01,00:16:02,"And I think from what I've read,"
00:16:02,00:16:05,the idea was is that no one would believe anything
00:16:05,00:16:07,"about the plane, let alone the pilot."
00:16:07,00:16:08,"They came and said, I saw a new plane"
00:16:08,00:16:09,and it was being flown by a gorilla
00:16:09,00:16:11,with a cigar and a polar hat.
00:16:11,00:16:13,That sounds a bit pushed for me.
00:16:13,00:16:16,I think actually he was just a practical joker.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"But the idea was he was gonna say,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,no one would believe that pilot existed.
00:16:19,00:16:21,"Therefore, they might not believe the plane existed."
00:16:21,00:16:22,That was being tested either.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- It was interesting that you tried
00:16:23,00:16:26,"his practical joke on us, didn't you?"
00:16:26,00:16:27,'Cause he was trying to make people
00:16:27,00:16:28,think a gorilla was flying the plane
00:16:28,00:16:31,"and you also kind of made us, no, you didn't."
00:16:31,00:16:32,- Believed it.
00:16:32,00:16:33,- Yeah.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- But it was less dangerous in this context
00:16:34,00:16:36,'cause we're just sitting around a table.
00:16:36,00:16:38,Whereas I think making a prank
00:16:38,00:16:40,out of putting off pilots flying actual planes
00:16:40,00:16:42,is very responsible.
00:16:42,00:16:44,"Well, they're quite a lot of comical,"
00:16:44,00:16:46,a pilot gets so distracted they fly into a mountain.
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- Oh, yeah."
00:16:47,00:16:48,- Yeah.
00:16:48,00:16:49,- Yeah.
00:16:49,00:16:50,400 deaths were resulted.
00:16:50,00:16:53,A comical flying into the mountain.
00:16:53,00:16:55,(laughing)
00:16:55,00:16:59,- Another death in the army today
00:16:59,00:17:00,"and man, was it funny."
00:17:00,00:17:03,We close our show with this white-hearted story.
00:17:03,00:17:05,- I think it was picturing the cartoon version.
00:17:05,00:17:09,(upbeat music)
00:17:09,00:17:12,(upbeat music)
00:17:12,00:17:12,- Okay.
00:17:12,00:17:15,It is time for fact number two and that is James.
00:17:15,00:17:16,- Okay.
00:17:16,00:17:18,My fact this week is that there are no animals
00:17:18,00:17:20,in the only zoo in Kalamazoo.
00:17:20,00:17:23,(laughing)
00:17:23,00:17:26,- What a sad lot of children there must be in Kalamazoo.
00:17:26,00:17:27,- Yeah.
00:17:27,00:17:28,"- Oh, what?"
00:17:28,00:17:30,It sounds great.
00:17:30,00:17:31,- Does it?
00:17:31,00:17:31,"- Oh, yeah."
00:17:31,00:17:32,- What is there?
00:17:32,00:17:34,- It's the air zoo.
00:17:34,00:17:34,- I see.
00:17:34,00:17:37,- It's the air zoo and the air zoo is a museum
00:17:37,00:17:40,about aeroplanes which has lots of planes
00:17:40,00:17:41,that are named after animals.
00:17:41,00:17:42,- Okay.
00:17:42,00:17:43,'Cause it does sound like the air zoo is what they've called it
00:17:43,00:17:45,'cause all the cages are just full of air.
00:17:45,00:17:46,- Yeah.
00:17:46,00:17:47,(laughing)
00:17:47,00:17:48,- It sounds like an air guitar.
00:17:48,00:17:48,- Yeah.
00:17:48,00:17:49,- Yeah.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- You're right.
00:17:50,00:17:51,"It does sound like that,"
00:17:51,00:17:54,but actually it's a really awesome air museum.
00:17:54,00:17:56,- So planes that are named after animals.
00:17:56,00:17:57,"So I'm thinking immediately,"
00:17:57,00:17:59,I'm thinking the Sopwith Camel.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- It's probably an animal.
00:18:00,00:18:01,- I don't know if there is one of those.
00:18:01,00:18:02,- Okay.
00:18:02,00:18:03,"- All I know is that there's a war hawk,"
00:18:03,00:18:06,"a goonie bird, a wild cat, a bear cat and a hell cat."
00:18:06,00:18:09,"- Oh, these are very American animal play names."
00:18:09,00:18:10,- It's very American.
00:18:10,00:18:14,"Yeah, Kalamazoo is in the north of United States of America."
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Yeah.
00:18:15,00:18:16,- Michigan.
00:18:16,00:18:17,- In Michigan.
00:18:17,00:18:18,- Yeah.
00:18:18,00:18:18,- The hell cat.
00:18:18,00:18:19,"- Yeah, it's a very."
00:18:19,00:18:22,The Sopwith Camel is a very British animal play name.
00:18:22,00:18:23,(laughing)
00:18:23,00:18:24,- Okay.
00:18:24,00:18:25,- Ridiculous.
00:18:25,00:18:27,- A goonie bird sounds quite British as well.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"- No, I still think that's a bit of an American."
00:18:29,00:18:30,- Like a goonie bird.
00:18:30,00:18:32,- You gotta see the goonie bird.
00:18:32,00:18:33,"- Yeah, you do."
00:18:33,00:18:34,- It could be.
00:18:34,00:18:35,- I was thinking goon show.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Yeah.
00:18:36,00:18:37,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:18:37,00:18:39,"- So yeah, and actually on the war hawk,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,"sorry you just mentioned that,"
00:18:40,00:18:45,"the person who runs this museum who's called Sue Parrish,"
00:18:45,00:18:48,she was one of the last 20 members
00:18:48,00:18:51,of the women's Air Force service pilots from World War II
00:18:51,00:18:56,who still flew planes and she flew a bright pink war hawk.
00:18:56,00:18:56,- That's great.
00:18:56,00:18:57,- Is she still alive?
00:18:57,00:19:01,- She was still alive when I read an article
00:19:01,00:19:02,"a few years, it was from a few years ago,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,I couldn't tell whether she died or not.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"- I think she's not, yeah."
00:19:04,00:19:08,"- Yeah, the article actually I read was from the early 90s,"
00:19:08,00:19:10,so she might have died since then.
00:19:10,00:19:13,"- She has, so there's an airport,"
00:19:13,00:19:16,which is Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Airport.
00:19:16,00:19:17,There's a statue of her.
00:19:17,00:19:18,"- Oh, is that?"
00:19:18,00:19:19,- I believe it's at the airport.
00:19:19,00:19:20,"If it's not the airport, it's someone of the vicinity."
00:19:20,00:19:21,- I didn't see that.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"- And you can also see her plane,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,"which is, as you said, pink."
00:19:24,00:19:25,Kind of cool.
00:19:25,00:19:26,- Do you know why I was pink this airplane?
00:19:26,00:19:27,"- Oh, oh, oh, oh."
00:19:27,00:19:30,"- Yes, because she only flew it"
00:19:30,00:19:32,"when it was Red Sky at night,"
00:19:32,00:19:34,"which happens to light in the evenings,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,and it was a cauliflower-ish thing.
00:19:36,00:19:37,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:19:37,00:19:40,"Not far off in fairness, just wrong,"
00:19:40,00:19:42,but not a million miles from.
00:19:42,00:19:44,"- Is it, no, you're right."
00:19:44,00:19:45,"- Dan, please, I've got it."
00:19:45,00:19:48,"She flew only among flocks of flamingos,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,and it was a cauliflower-ish thing.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"- We're getting wrong, guy."
00:19:51,00:19:52,- Okay.
00:19:52,00:19:55,"- It was because she's a woman,"
00:19:55,00:19:56,a women-like pink thing.
00:19:56,00:19:57,"No, it wasn't, it wasn't."
00:19:57,00:19:58,- Damn it.
00:19:58,00:20:00,"- It was because it was originally flown in Libya,"
00:20:00,00:20:03,"these planes, and the landscape,"
00:20:03,00:20:06,"lots of, you know, rocks and sand,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,and quite pink sand and stuff like that.
00:20:08,00:20:11,And so it just helped to blend into the landscape.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- Okay, so it's not hot pink?"
00:20:13,00:20:15,"- No, it's not hot pink."
00:20:15,00:20:16,It's not fluorescent.
00:20:16,00:20:17,"It's pink, it is quite pink."
00:20:17,00:20:18,- It's pretty pink.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"Yeah, it looks awesome."
00:20:19,00:20:21,And I think that's in the entrance
00:20:21,00:20:22,"when you go into the Arab museum,"
00:20:22,00:20:24,as opposed to the airport.
00:20:24,00:20:26,"- Yeah, and after World War II,"
00:20:26,00:20:28,"she wanted to become a commercial pilot,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,"but she got rejected in letters saying,"
00:20:30,00:20:32,"""With your qualifications, if you were a man,"
00:20:32,00:20:34,"""we would have hired you."""
00:20:34,00:20:37,"- Oh, well, that's nice consolation, though, isn't it?"
00:20:37,00:20:38,"- It's awful, that is."
00:20:38,00:20:40,"- It's the highest praise you can give, really."
00:20:40,00:20:41,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:20:41,00:20:43,"But yeah, basically I remembered"
00:20:43,00:20:44,"that there was a place called Kalamazoo,"
00:20:44,00:20:46,"and I Googled to see if there was a zoo there,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"and there isn't, but there is this place."
00:20:48,00:20:50,- I didn't know anything about Kalamazoo
00:20:50,00:20:51,before starting to research it.
00:20:51,00:20:53,"Apart from, of course, the Glenn Miller song,"
00:20:53,00:20:56,I've Got a Girl in Kalamazoo in 1942.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"- Put it on the map, internationally, in a way."
00:20:59,00:21:00,- But it's named as one of those places
00:21:00,00:21:02,"which has a funny name, and no one really knows"
00:21:02,00:21:04,"where it is or if it's real, and it's kind of, you know,"
00:21:04,00:21:07,"it's lumped in with places like Timbuktu,"
00:21:07,00:21:07,which have an interesting--
00:21:07,00:21:08,- I wonder why.
00:21:08,00:21:09,It's like--
00:21:09,00:21:10,- Exactly.
00:21:10,00:21:11,- With your writing songs.
00:21:11,00:21:13,"- Exactly, but Kalamazoo, get this."
00:21:13,00:21:15,"I'm only getting in with this fact before you guys all do,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,"'cause I know you'll all have it, too,"
00:21:17,00:21:21,was the first place in the world to install dropped curbs.
00:21:21,00:21:24,(laughing)
00:21:24,00:21:27,"- Is that a curb where you can get like a buggy down,"
00:21:27,00:21:29,"you mean, like it goes flat?"
00:21:29,00:21:30,- It's as it sounds.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"The curb has been dropped so that you can,"
00:21:32,00:21:33,"yeah, so you can get a buggy down."
00:21:33,00:21:35,"- That's quite amazing, isn't it?"
00:21:35,00:21:36,- I know.
00:21:36,00:21:37,- Do they have a blue plaque there?
00:21:37,00:21:37,They must have.
00:21:37,00:21:39,"- Well, there are lots of claims as to what, you know,"
00:21:39,00:21:42,there are other cities which try to steal Kalamazoo's thunder.
00:21:42,00:21:44,"They're all, I think, incorrect."
00:21:44,00:21:46,I think this was the first city where you had dropped--
00:21:46,00:21:48,- How deep have you had to dig for this?
00:21:48,00:21:49,This is a full day's work.
00:21:49,00:21:52,"- There was this veteran from the second of my walk,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,"who was Jack Fisher, who was an advocate"
00:21:54,00:21:57,"for both veterans and disability rights,"
00:21:57,00:21:59,and he trialed them.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"In America, they're called curb cuts,"
00:22:01,00:22:03,and they were first tried out here.
00:22:03,00:22:04,- That's incredible.
00:22:04,00:22:05,- That's incredible.
00:22:05,00:22:06,- What year were we talking?
00:22:06,00:22:10,"- I think it was the late '40s or early '50s,"
00:22:10,00:22:11,and there are other places
00:22:11,00:22:13,which tried them in the early '60s.
00:22:13,00:22:14,"There was another thing in the '60s,"
00:22:14,00:22:15,"and I think in America,"
00:22:15,00:22:16,there was some disability activists
00:22:16,00:22:19,who hacked away at curbs at night
00:22:19,00:22:22,and laid concrete to smooth their path.
00:22:22,00:22:23,"- That makes sense, yeah."
00:22:23,00:22:24,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:24,00:22:26,"They only did it on a few occasions in a few places,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,"but when you say he tested it,"
00:22:27,00:22:28,what's interesting about it
00:22:28,00:22:30,is it feels it doesn't need testing.
00:22:30,00:22:31,"It feels just logical, right?"
00:22:31,00:22:34,"It just doesn't, what do they think might go wrong?"
00:22:34,00:22:36,"- Well, I guess it's never been done before,"
00:22:36,00:22:37,"and he's just pointing out,"
00:22:37,00:22:39,"""Look, this would make it a lot easier"
00:22:39,00:22:40,for lots of people to get around
00:22:40,00:22:42,"if you install these things."""
00:22:42,00:22:43,"So they say, ""All right, well, we'll install a few."""
00:22:43,00:22:45,"And then, obviously, you just see how it works."
00:22:45,00:22:46,"- I mean, things that can go wrong"
00:22:46,00:22:48,is it allows dickheads like me
00:22:48,00:22:49,to pop your bike up on the pavement
00:22:49,00:22:51,while you're cycling and really upset pedestrians.
00:22:51,00:22:53,"He didn't think of that, did he?"
00:22:53,00:22:54,- No.
00:22:54,00:22:55,"- He didn't think of that, the idiot."
00:22:55,00:22:56,- I don't know.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- Same with my car.
00:22:57,00:23:01,(all laughing)
00:23:01,00:23:04,"- Kalamazoo originally was called Bronson,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,and it was because a guy called Titus Bronson
00:23:06,00:23:08,"was the first white man, basically,"
00:23:08,00:23:11,to arrive there and set up a town there.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"And then, yeah, he turned it into a place"
00:23:14,00:23:16,where the streets were kind of named very obviously
00:23:16,00:23:18,for the thing that they were operating as.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"So there was Church Street,"
00:23:20,00:23:22,where you'd have three churches on there.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"There was the Academy, which had the college on it."
00:23:25,00:23:27,There was Jail Street.
00:23:27,00:23:28,- Jail Street.
00:23:28,00:23:29,"- It makes sense, doesn't it?"
00:23:29,00:23:30,"- Yeah, it makes total sense."
00:23:30,00:23:31,- You know where everything is.
00:23:31,00:23:32,"- I think the church one is weird,"
00:23:32,00:23:35,"'cause I know that, so there's a thing in capitalism,"
00:23:35,00:23:36,"right, where if you've got a shop"
00:23:36,00:23:37,"that sells a certain thing, like baby clothes,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"then you have lots of shops in the same area,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"they cluster, because that works."
00:23:41,00:23:42,- Like the Curry Mile in Manchester
00:23:42,00:23:43,with all the Curry houses. - Exactly.
00:23:43,00:23:46,"But churches, you rarely are like,"
00:23:46,00:23:48,"well, we've got to fit 10 churches into this county."
00:23:48,00:23:50,Shall we just put them all on the same street?
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- Yeah, absolutely true."
00:23:51,00:23:52,- It's interesting.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"- The story goes that Bronson was in Detroit,"
00:23:55,00:23:57,"and he walked west into the woods,"
00:23:57,00:24:00,"and he kept going until he got out of the woods,"
00:24:00,00:24:03,and this was where Kalamazoo was.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"He walked, it's 140 miles walk"
00:24:06,00:24:08,until he got to any kind of clearing.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"There's this, we're not quite sure why,"
00:24:10,00:24:12,but he definitely left town at one stage.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"Now, he might have left town"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"because they changed the name to Kalamazoo,"
00:24:16,00:24:17,or he might have left town
00:24:17,00:24:19,because he stole a cherry tree.
00:24:19,00:24:19,- Yeah.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- He was run out of town.
00:24:20,00:24:21,"- I love that, the cherry tree."
00:24:21,00:24:22,"- And there's a few different stories,"
00:24:22,00:24:24,"and it's not clear what's what,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,"because if you look at contemporary reports,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,neither of them is mentioned.
00:24:28,00:24:30,But there is a 1909 headline
00:24:30,00:24:32,"from the Detroit Free Press that says,"
00:24:32,00:24:34,"""Because of the name of the village he founded"
00:24:34,00:24:37,"""was changed to Kalamazoo, Titus Bronson died"
00:24:37,00:24:38,"""of a broken heart."""
00:24:38,00:24:39,- Ah.
00:24:39,00:24:41,"- And so when they changed the name,"
00:24:41,00:24:44,apparently it hurt him so much that he died.
00:24:44,00:24:46,- They have gone by a lot of different names.
00:24:46,00:24:48,They used to be called the Celery City.
00:24:48,00:24:49,"- What, they grew a lot of celery?"
00:24:49,00:24:50,- They grew a lot of celery.
00:24:50,00:24:52,Someone came over and grew celery there.
00:24:52,00:24:54,"Actually it was a Scott, I think, called George,"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"apparently George Celery Taylor, he was known as."
00:24:57,00:24:58,But you know how you never know
00:24:58,00:25:00,if people were actually called that at the time?
00:25:00,00:25:02,- Like the bowlers from earlier.
00:25:02,00:25:03,- Like the bowl?
00:25:03,00:25:05,"- No, that definitely was the name."
00:25:05,00:25:07,"- Yeah, but that could have been like the trade"
00:25:07,00:25:08,that then became the name.
00:25:08,00:25:10,"- No, but they didn't name themselves out of the hats."
00:25:10,00:25:12,"They were, ""I'm saying we don't know."""
00:25:12,00:25:13,"- ""I'm saying we do."""
00:25:13,00:25:15,"- Ah, okay, well there we go."
00:25:15,00:25:17,- One of the reasons that Kalamazoo is mentioned
00:25:17,00:25:19,"in a lot of songs, so you mentioned,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,who do you mention before? - Glenn Miller.
00:25:21,00:25:21,- Glenn Miller.
00:25:21,00:25:24,"- So Kalamazoo in other songs by Frank Zappa,"
00:25:24,00:25:27,"Ben Folds, Johnny Cash, The Black Keys,"
00:25:27,00:25:28,who I know you like.
00:25:28,00:25:30,I think there's Kalamazoo mentioned in there.
00:25:30,00:25:31,And I think one of the reasons is
00:25:31,00:25:33,'cause Gibson guitars were made in Kalamazoo.
00:25:33,00:25:35,- Yeah.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"- And loads of famous people, Chuck Berry,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"Eric Clapton, Cheryl Crowe, Bob Dylan,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,all people use Gibson guitars.
00:25:42,00:25:44,And really interesting thing about the Gibsons
00:25:44,00:25:45,is the Gibson girls.
00:25:45,00:25:47,"Now during World War II,"
00:25:47,00:25:52,"the Gibson guitar company was still making guitars,"
00:25:52,00:25:54,but the thing was they didn't have anyone
00:25:54,00:25:55,"to make the guitars, right?"
00:25:55,00:25:57,Because all the men had gone to war.
00:25:57,00:25:59,So what they did was they brought in all the local women
00:25:59,00:26:03,"to make these guitars, but they denied making them."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"And the reason being that they thought that,"
00:26:05,00:26:08,"one, if we told people we're making guitars during the war,"
00:26:08,00:26:09,people would think we're being really frivolous
00:26:09,00:26:11,and we shouldn't be doing this kind of thing.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"But secondly, they weren't sure"
00:26:13,00:26:14,whether people would buy guitars
00:26:14,00:26:16,if they knew they were made by women.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Right.
00:26:17,00:26:20,- So they sold them as what they called new old stock.
00:26:20,00:26:23,So they pretended that these were old guitars
00:26:23,00:26:25,that they had in stock and they were selling during the war.
00:26:25,00:26:26,"We're not making them during the war,"
00:26:26,00:26:29,but actually all these women were doing all the work.
00:26:29,00:26:31,And they also sometimes said
00:26:31,00:26:33,that they were made by seasoned craftsmen
00:26:33,00:26:34,who were too old for war.
00:26:34,00:26:35,"- Yeah, right."
00:26:35,00:26:36,- Right.
00:26:36,00:26:37,- Wow.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"- I mean, not brilliant, obviously."
00:26:38,00:26:39,Sorry.
00:26:39,00:26:40,"- It's good, Mark."
00:26:40,00:26:40,You can appreciate the marketing.
00:26:40,00:26:41,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:41,00:26:43,- Did the women who were making them
00:26:43,00:26:46,"leave any kind of clues as to the fact they,"
00:26:46,00:26:47,"like, inside, did they write?"
00:26:47,00:26:50,- Drop a tampon into the body of the guitar.
00:26:50,00:26:51,(all laughing)
00:26:51,00:26:54,- Use tampons and just rattling around in there.
00:26:54,00:26:55,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:26:55,00:26:57,"- That was the key to their individual sound, actually."
00:26:57,00:27:01,(all laughing)
00:27:01,00:27:03,- Just a couple more things on Kalamazoo.
00:27:03,00:27:06,Notable person from there.
00:27:06,00:27:07,William Shakespeare.
00:27:07,00:27:10,Junior.
00:27:10,00:27:14,And what I did there was trick you to make you think.
00:27:14,00:27:16,- It was actually a gorilla.
00:27:16,00:27:17,- It's actually a gorilla.
00:27:17,00:27:19,- He's William Shakespeare Junior.
00:27:19,00:27:21,"He was an inventor, quite a notable inventor there."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"So he was around in the 1800s,"
00:27:23,00:27:26,"and he invented what's known as the Shakespeare fishing tackle,"
00:27:26,00:27:29,which is a really big thing that's still used today.
00:27:29,00:27:30,Do you know it?
00:27:30,00:27:32,"- No, I'm just trying to think of the pun."
00:27:32,00:27:33,(all laughing)
00:27:33,00:27:34,"- Me too, me too."
00:27:34,00:27:37,(all laughing)
00:27:37,00:27:41,"Yeah, so yeah, fishing tackle, lots of innovations"
00:27:41,00:27:42,of that sort.
00:27:42,00:27:44,He had patents for camera equipment and so on.
00:27:44,00:27:46,"- Cast, casting, now."
00:27:46,00:27:48,- Oh yeah.
00:27:48,00:27:50,You can say whatever you want now for the next five minutes.
00:27:50,00:27:53,"- Yeah, well I'm trying to debate, it's not working."
00:27:53,00:27:54,"- Okay, no, I'll join now."
00:27:54,00:27:55,"Anna, you take over."
00:27:55,00:27:59,"- Anyway, let's scale."
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- God, astonishing, you run through his plays."
00:28:01,00:28:02,There are almost no fish puns.
00:28:02,00:28:03,"- It's bad, isn't it?"
00:28:03,00:28:04,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:28:04,00:28:05,- Amidst some nice brim.
00:28:05,00:28:06,- Very good.
00:28:06,00:28:07,"- Nice, there you go."
00:28:07,00:28:08,- There you go.
00:28:08,00:28:09,- Thank God.
00:28:09,00:28:10,- Can we move on?
00:28:10,00:28:11,"Is that, is that?"
00:28:11,00:28:11,- No.
00:28:11,00:28:12,- I get we're still doing it.
00:28:12,00:28:14,(laughing)
00:28:14,00:28:15,"- God, Andy."
00:28:15,00:28:16,- Macro Beth.
00:28:16,00:28:17,- No.
00:28:17,00:28:18,"- No, that's nice, that's great."
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- That's good, that's good."
00:28:19,00:28:20,"- Yeah, we'll take it."
00:28:20,00:28:21,- Yeah.
00:28:21,00:28:23,As you pike it.
00:28:23,00:28:24,"- Oh, very nice."
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- Lovely, I'll tell you off, you guys all got one."
00:28:26,00:28:28,(laughing)
00:28:28,00:28:29,"- All right, if you have one at home,"
00:28:29,00:28:32,then why not send it to Andrew Hunter M?
00:28:32,00:28:34,(laughing)
00:28:34,00:28:37,(upbeat music)
00:28:37,00:28:42,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:28:42,00:28:43,and that is Andy.
00:28:43,00:28:45,- My fact is that some American gravestones
00:28:45,00:28:47,feature recipes.
00:28:47,00:28:47,- Hmm.
00:28:47,00:28:48,"- Yummy, yummy."
00:28:48,00:28:50,- I've had to cook the human below it?
00:28:50,00:28:50,- Yes.
00:28:50,00:28:52,(laughing)
00:28:52,00:28:56,- This is a thing that happens sometimes in the States.
00:28:56,00:28:57,"The original wording of the fact was,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,lots of American gravestones contain recipes
00:28:59,00:29:01,and it was pointed out that they're about 11 so far.
00:29:01,00:29:02,(laughing)
00:29:02,00:29:04,There was a query over whether that's technically lots
00:29:04,00:29:07,"or not, which is fair."
00:29:07,00:29:11,But there are people who have made it their hobby
00:29:11,00:29:13,to track down all gravestones which feature recipes
00:29:13,00:29:15,and bake 'em up.
00:29:15,00:29:19,And it's especially big on places like TikTok.
00:29:19,00:29:21,There are lots of grave people on TikTok
00:29:21,00:29:23,"and they're nicknamed Tapophiles,"
00:29:23,00:29:26,which is people who love graves and cemeteries and--
00:29:26,00:29:28,"- Is that what, it's on TikTok?"
00:29:28,00:29:29,'Cause I haven't been on TikTok.
00:29:29,00:29:30,I didn't realize it was that.
00:29:30,00:29:31,I thought it was like dancing and stuff.
00:29:31,00:29:32,- It's not all of TikTok.
00:29:32,00:29:34,"Yeah, there's a lot, again,"
00:29:34,00:29:36,"when I say lots of people on TikTok do it,"
00:29:36,00:29:37,some people on TikTok do it.
00:29:37,00:29:38,(laughing)
00:29:38,00:29:42,It's more effort than filming it or dance.
00:29:42,00:29:43,But it's not really interesting.
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- Well, I like TikTok Tapophiles."
00:29:44,00:29:47,"It's a nice elicitation, isn't it, worth becoming one?"
00:29:47,00:29:48,- Yeah.
00:29:48,00:29:53,"These grave recipes, some of them date back decades"
00:29:53,00:29:55,or further than that.
00:29:55,00:29:57,"- I just thought TikTok, it's like,"
00:29:57,00:30:00,what do you call that thing that reminds you of death?
00:30:00,00:30:01,"- The pendulum, the reaper."
00:30:01,00:30:02,"- Oh, Memento Mori."
00:30:02,00:30:04,"- Memento Mori, isn't it?"
00:30:04,00:30:06,So whenever you think about TikTok--
00:30:06,00:30:07,- TikTok.
00:30:07,00:30:09,- Is it very morbid place TikTok?
00:30:09,00:30:11,Is it one big Memento Mori?
00:30:11,00:30:13,- It's just thinking about the number of seconds
00:30:13,00:30:13,you have left.
00:30:13,00:30:17,"- Yeah, the number of seconds you spent watching this, crap."
00:30:17,00:30:19,(laughing)
00:30:19,00:30:19,Yeah.
00:30:19,00:30:20,"- Wow, so--"
00:30:20,00:30:23,"- Yeah, so people are doing it on making up the recipes"
00:30:23,00:30:25,"and then showing them on their TikTok videos, right?"
00:30:25,00:30:27,"- Yeah, people are going around doing that."
00:30:27,00:30:28,- Any examples?
00:30:28,00:30:31,"- Well, there's a lovely Fudge recipe."
00:30:31,00:30:33,There is blueberry pie.
00:30:33,00:30:35,There's yeast cake.
00:30:36,00:30:37,- But it doesn't always work.
00:30:37,00:30:39,Sometimes there was one gravestone
00:30:39,00:30:42,which had a typo in the recipe on it.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"- Oh, no."
00:30:43,00:30:46,"- I know, and it would have made very runny fudge"
00:30:46,00:30:47,if you made it according to that.
00:30:47,00:30:48,But thankfully--
00:30:48,00:30:48,- What was the typo?
00:30:48,00:30:50,I want to know what typo is that makes runny fudge.
00:30:50,00:30:52,- It was too much vanilla.
00:30:52,00:30:52,"- Oh, really?"
00:30:52,00:30:56,"- But it's a tablespoon as opposed to a teaspoon,"
00:30:56,00:30:56,I believe was the--
00:30:56,00:30:58,- That's not gonna make it that runny.
00:30:58,00:31:00,"Is it just, that's not much difference."
00:31:00,00:31:02,Like it's not like a kilogram versus a gram.
00:31:02,00:31:05,'Cause you don't put much vanilla in a Fudge recipe.
00:31:05,00:31:06,It's just a tiny amount.
00:31:06,00:31:06,"- Well, that's why."
00:31:06,00:31:09,"Because if you do a tablespoon,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,apparently it turns out vapor.
00:31:10,00:31:13,"Anyway, they corrected the entire gravestone"
00:31:13,00:31:16,"off the back of that, which is a relief."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"- Why would you, yeah."
00:31:18,00:31:20,Trying to look out why you would do it.
00:31:20,00:31:21,"- Do what, put a recipe on?"
00:31:21,00:31:22,- Yeah.
00:31:22,00:31:23,"- Well, people like to be creative"
00:31:23,00:31:23,"on their gravestones, right?"
00:31:23,00:31:24,It's a really fun thing.
00:31:24,00:31:27,"And passing down your great recipe, I think."
00:31:27,00:31:28,- I think that's what it is.
00:31:28,00:31:32,"I think it's something that matters to you,"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"something that's traditional,"
00:31:33,00:31:35,something that a recipe you might have inherited
00:31:35,00:31:36,from the generation above you.
00:31:36,00:31:37,I see it.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- People like to pass on recipes
00:31:38,00:31:40,"to the next generation, don't they?"
00:31:40,00:31:41,And what about a place?
00:31:41,00:31:43,- I guess it's very little you can pass on.
00:31:43,00:31:46,You could pass on like a series of dance moves.
00:31:46,00:31:47,I'm trying to think of something else.
00:31:47,00:31:48,You might pass on to the next generation.
00:31:48,00:31:50,"But you're right, recipes are probably it."
00:31:50,00:31:51,- Dance moves.
00:31:51,00:31:54,On your grave is encouraging people to dance on your grave.
00:31:54,00:31:57,- You could have a set of those footprint outlines.
00:31:57,00:31:59,- Like they have in Japan.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"I was thinking like, you know those games"
00:32:00,00:32:02,that you play in Japan where you can dance.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:04,00:32:05,- What were they like up?
00:32:05,00:32:06,"- Well, I was just thinking,"
00:32:06,00:32:08,I'd like mine to be kind of like that MOLWAKA game.
00:32:08,00:32:11,So you put a coin into the grave
00:32:11,00:32:13,and then my head pops out from one other side.
00:32:13,00:32:14,You gotta slam it with a hammer.
00:32:14,00:32:16,Then my arm comes out another and then my leg.
00:32:16,00:32:18,- It'd be so annoying if you're one of those people
00:32:18,00:32:19,who wasn't actually dead
00:32:19,00:32:20,and tries to escape from your grave.
00:32:20,00:32:23,But it's been constantly malleted down.
00:32:23,00:32:25,"- You guys don't, seriously."
00:32:25,00:32:27,(laughing)
00:32:27,00:32:28,- But I think it's great.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"I mean, there are so many gravestones around the world"
00:32:30,00:32:32,where people as their sort of like last wish
00:32:32,00:32:34,"have said, can you make this happen?"
00:32:34,00:32:36,And people do and they're beautiful.
00:32:36,00:32:37,And I'd read a great one.
00:32:37,00:32:40,"There was a 99 year old woman who in Mexico,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,her dying wish was for her gravestone
00:32:42,00:32:45,to be made according to what she loved most in life.
00:32:45,00:32:47,And so she got it.
00:32:47,00:32:52,"It was a 600 pound, five foot tall penis."
00:32:52,00:32:54,Just a giant penis.
00:32:54,00:32:57,"- What she loved in life, a five foot penis."
00:32:57,00:33:00,"- She loved calling people dicks in life, apparently."
00:33:00,00:33:01,And that's what she asked for.
00:33:01,00:33:03,And I've seen the video of them unveiling it.
00:33:03,00:33:05,"It looks like it's got a giant condom over the top of it,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,which is then removed.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"It's a huge pink penis, like five foot five."
00:33:10,00:33:11,"- But unfortunately, if you're in Libya,"
00:33:11,00:33:12,you couldn't see it.
00:33:12,00:33:13,(laughing)
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- The testicles, apparently,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,they really had a lot of problem with
00:33:17,00:33:20,because the ball sack apparently kept just disfiguring
00:33:20,00:33:23,"during the melting process of the actual materials,"
00:33:23,00:33:24,"which was, I believe, plastic."
00:33:24,00:33:26,And so they had to like build the testicles
00:33:26,00:33:27,quite a few times.
00:33:27,00:33:29,And they're big balls when you see it.
00:33:29,00:33:31,So it's sort of standing up.
00:33:31,00:33:32,- Right.
00:33:32,00:33:35,"- Anyway, is this, is it a churchyard"
00:33:35,00:33:38,or a cemetery surrounded by other?
00:33:38,00:33:39,I can imagine being slightly annoyed
00:33:39,00:33:41,if I had the grave next door.
00:33:41,00:33:42,"- Totally, absolutely."
00:33:42,00:33:44,"- By that time, it can't be annoyed."
00:33:44,00:33:45,"- No, it's true."
00:33:45,00:33:47,"- I know you're an easily annoyed person, Andy,"
00:33:47,00:33:49,"but I reckon that after death,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,you're not going to be under there going.
00:33:51,00:33:52,(laughing)
00:33:52,00:33:53,- He will.
00:33:53,00:33:54,"- If I can, I will."
00:33:54,00:33:57,That's what it's going to say on his tombstone.
00:33:57,00:33:58,(laughing)
00:33:58,00:33:59,"- I'm so with you, though."
00:33:59,00:34:02,"If I was a relative of someone who'd been buried next to that,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,I would find that so irritating.
00:34:05,00:34:08,- But this is what happens a lot in the UK.
00:34:08,00:34:11,"Certainly, so many graves are the traditional,"
00:34:11,00:34:13,"whether it's slate or, you know,"
00:34:13,00:34:16,"it's normally, it's grazed stone and it's carved"
00:34:16,00:34:19,and it's all down to the individual church
00:34:19,00:34:20,or individual local authority.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"And so there's this mad, you know,"
00:34:22,00:34:24,"if you want something out of the ordinary,"
00:34:24,00:34:26,"you might get it approved, but you really might not."
00:34:26,00:34:29,"Like shape-wise, like a big penis."
00:34:29,00:34:30,"- Shape-wise and colour-wise,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"and there are rules about what you can and can't carve,"
00:34:32,00:34:35,but there's no one authority in the UK
00:34:35,00:34:36,which tells you what you can't get.
00:34:36,00:34:37,- It feels like we shouldn't have that.
00:34:37,00:34:40,And it does feel reasonable to say no penises.
00:34:40,00:34:41,- Yeah.
00:34:41,00:34:41,- I don't know.
00:34:41,00:34:44,"- I agree, I agree, definitely."
00:34:44,00:34:47,"- Well, on that and gravestones,"
00:34:47,00:34:48,"there's an amazing cemetery in Paris,"
00:34:48,00:34:50,"the Peer-Lachaise Cemetery,"
00:34:50,00:34:51,and it's got loads of good graves in it.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"But one of them's the grave of Victor Noir,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,who was a 19th century journalist.
00:34:56,00:34:58,And he wasn't that famous in his lifetime.
00:34:58,00:35:02,I think he was shot by Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew in 1870.
00:35:02,00:35:02,- Wow.
00:35:02,00:35:04,- And loads of people suddenly went to his funeral
00:35:04,00:35:07,because it became this kind of political cause.
00:35:07,00:35:08,"But for some reason, we don't know why."
00:35:08,00:35:10,"His effigy, so on his gravestone,"
00:35:10,00:35:13,there's a big bronze effigy of him lying down.
00:35:13,00:35:15,It has a bulge in his crotch.
00:35:15,00:35:16,"- Oh, yeah."
00:35:16,00:35:20,"- It's quite tight trousers, lovely big penis bulge."
00:35:20,00:35:24,"And what's so rank about it is that it's a bit like,"
00:35:24,00:35:25,"you know, there's Grave Fry's Bobby and Edinburgh,"
00:35:25,00:35:26,"a famous dog statue,"
00:35:26,00:35:28,and everyone always rubs its nose for luck.
00:35:28,00:35:29,So that's really shiny.
00:35:29,00:35:33,"And in the same way, everyone keeps rubbing and mounting"
00:35:33,00:35:36,and writhing against this crotch.
00:35:36,00:35:37,So it's incredibly shiny.
00:35:37,00:35:39,"And not only that, it's not just the crotch,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,but his lips and nose.
00:35:41,00:35:42,"- Well, the kiss is lit."
00:35:42,00:35:43,"Yeah, the kiss is lit."
00:35:43,00:35:45,"- I know, do they do to his nose?"
00:35:45,00:35:47,(laughing)
00:35:47,00:35:47,But what?
00:35:47,00:35:49,"I mean, that's, cause that's not just rubbing."
00:35:49,00:35:50,They've mounted fully.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:35:51,00:35:52,So it's a fertility thing.
00:35:52,00:35:54,You go and you do that if you want to get pregnant.
00:35:54,00:35:54,"- People say that, but it's not."
00:35:54,00:35:56,It's people going for a joke.
00:35:56,00:35:58,"Everyone's like, this is 20th century."
00:35:58,00:36:00,This is people going to France and going.
00:36:00,00:36:01,"- It's for Instagram, isn't it?"
00:36:01,00:36:02,That's great.
00:36:02,00:36:04,There is a sign that says any damage caused by graffiti
00:36:04,00:36:07,or in decent rubbing will be prosecuted.
00:36:07,00:36:08,- Oh.
00:36:08,00:36:09,- It's just there.
00:36:09,00:36:10,- It's all in decent rubbing.
00:36:10,00:36:11,(laughing)
00:36:11,00:36:12,- What's decent rubbing?
00:36:12,00:36:15,"Yeah, that's actually a better question, yeah."
00:36:15,00:36:17,"- But I always think with these,"
00:36:17,00:36:19,they would be the best place for like a zombie apocalypse
00:36:19,00:36:22,to start where there's loads of famous people.
00:36:22,00:36:24,"- Oh, that would be great."
00:36:24,00:36:25,- Or like Westminster Abbey.
00:36:25,00:36:27,"That's where you want your zombie apocalypse to start,"
00:36:27,00:36:28,isn't it?
00:36:28,00:36:29,Where all the famous people are buried.
00:36:29,00:36:31,- I think Jim Morrison is in the one
00:36:31,00:36:33,"you were just talking about as well, I believe."
00:36:33,00:36:34,That's really good.
00:36:34,00:36:34,- 'Cause that's a good mix.
00:36:34,00:36:37,"Westminster Abbey is all a bit like Royals and Nobles,"
00:36:37,00:36:37,isn't it?
00:36:37,00:36:38,"But if you went to this one,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,"you get rock stars, you get authors, you get weirdos."
00:36:41,00:36:43,- The doors to hell have opened.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"- Yes, yes, more like that."
00:36:45,00:36:47,- You've redeemed yourself.
00:36:47,00:36:49,Fish gate is forgotten.
00:36:49,00:36:50,(laughing)
00:36:50,00:36:52,- Speaking as we were earlier of people doing
00:36:52,00:36:55,inappropriate things in graveyards.
00:36:55,00:36:57,Do you guys know about the bustuary?
00:36:57,00:37:03,They were sex workers in Rome in the first century AD
00:37:03,00:37:06,and they plied their trade in cemeteries.
00:37:06,00:37:07,"- Oh, naughty."
00:37:07,00:37:10,"- Yeah, so in the daytime, they were professional mourners."
00:37:10,00:37:15,"But in the nighttime, they were sex workers"
00:37:15,00:37:17,and they would write on the gravestones
00:37:17,00:37:19,what the prices and stuff like that.
00:37:19,00:37:20,(laughing)
00:37:20,00:37:21,- They used them like phone boxes.
00:37:21,00:37:24,"- A little bit, yeah, and people would go"
00:37:24,00:37:28,and they had very pale skin and severe expressions
00:37:28,00:37:30,and they were kind of quite gothic
00:37:30,00:37:33,looking in and of themselves.
00:37:33,00:37:36,There was one called Noctina who would sleep on the graves
00:37:36,00:37:39,and cover her eyes with coins
00:37:39,00:37:41,and then they were also prostitutes.
00:37:41,00:37:42,- That feels like she's encouraging
00:37:42,00:37:44,some worrying kinks though.
00:37:44,00:37:45,- I'm afraid that there was some of that.
00:37:45,00:37:48,"If you read Marshall, juvenile and catalyst,"
00:37:48,00:37:50,all talk about it and apparently there was some of this.
00:37:50,00:37:51,- Bloody hell.
00:37:51,00:37:54,- The fact that they're professional mourners
00:37:54,00:37:56,"in the daytime, you know, that's sort of,"
00:37:56,00:37:58,"and then at night time, basically,"
00:37:58,00:38:01,the morning garb comes off and they're saucy.
00:38:01,00:38:03,"- And then in the morning, the morning garb goes back on."
00:38:03,00:38:07,"- Oh yeah, they had this weird thing in Roman tombs"
00:38:07,00:38:09,which were called libation tubes.
00:38:09,00:38:10,Have you heard of this?
00:38:10,00:38:11,- No.
00:38:11,00:38:13,"- This is so cool, these are terracotta tubes"
00:38:13,00:38:15,that go down into the grave from ground double
00:38:15,00:38:17,and they're deliberately so you can give the dead a drink.
00:38:17,00:38:20,"- Yeah, that's so sad."
00:38:20,00:38:21,- You go to mine into them.
00:38:21,00:38:24,"- Yeah, it was just a pipeline right down"
00:38:24,00:38:25,to the mouth of the dead.
00:38:25,00:38:26,- Was that different to the sausage one?
00:38:26,00:38:28,The sausage pipe?
00:38:28,00:38:29,I don't remember the sausage pipe.
00:38:29,00:38:31,"- Yeah, we did talk about that."
00:38:31,00:38:33,- That's rigged such a fake though.
00:38:33,00:38:34,- Yeah.
00:38:34,00:38:35,- Was there a sausage pipe?
00:38:35,00:38:36,- John Bondison wrote about it and buried alive.
00:38:36,00:38:39,"- Yeah, there was a, I think the idea was"
00:38:39,00:38:42,"if you were buried alive, you had a string that you pulled"
00:38:42,00:38:44,and it would ring a bell and they would come and get you
00:38:44,00:38:45,"and say, ""We're coming to get you out,"
00:38:45,00:38:46,"but here have a sausage until then."""
00:38:46,00:38:49,And they would pop a sausage in the sausage pipe
00:38:49,00:38:50,so he had some sustenance while they were.
00:38:50,00:38:51,- A cooked sausage.
00:38:51,00:38:52,- It doesn't say I assume a cooked sausage.
00:38:52,00:38:53,- I must be.
00:38:53,00:38:55,- You don't want to give them food poisoning while they're down.
00:38:55,00:38:57,"- Tragic, he died of botulism"
00:38:57,00:39:00,while we were getting the spade.
00:39:00,00:39:01,A fast-acting lethal sausage.
00:39:01,00:39:08,"- You know, PETA, the animal rights organization,"
00:39:08,00:39:11,they did a thing a few years ago.
00:39:11,00:39:14,They bought a tombstone in a cemetery
00:39:14,00:39:16,for one of their colleagues.
00:39:16,00:39:17,It was called Matt Prescott.
00:39:18,00:39:21,"But it was, they bought a tombstone in a very specific place."
00:39:21,00:39:23,They bought it right near Colonel Sanders.
00:39:23,00:39:26,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:26,00:39:28,- And it had a message on it.
00:39:28,00:39:29,It was a little poem that they'd written
00:39:29,00:39:31,"for their colleague, Matt."
00:39:31,00:39:33,And it was an acrostic.
00:39:33,00:39:36,"And the first letter of every line spelled out the phrase,"
00:39:36,00:39:38,KFC tortures birds.
00:39:38,00:39:38,- Wow.
00:39:38,00:39:40,- I know.
00:39:40,00:39:42,- My favorite gravestone is an acrostic.
00:39:42,00:39:43,- Oh.
00:39:43,00:39:44,- It's awesome.
00:39:44,00:39:48,"It's for a guy called John René, R-E-N-I-E."
00:39:48,00:39:50,René or René.
00:39:50,00:39:54,And what it says on it is it says here lies John René.
00:39:54,00:39:59,"But then it says it basically 45,760 times in total"
00:39:59,00:40:05,because it's an acrostic that goes 19 squares across
00:40:05,00:40:07,and 15 squares down.
00:40:07,00:40:09,"And everywhere you start reading it,"
00:40:09,00:40:13,you can make here lies John René along this box of it.
00:40:13,00:40:14,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:40:14,00:40:17,"- And the total that you can add it up to is, yeah, 45,000."
00:40:17,00:40:19,"So it's like the second line, it reads,"
00:40:19,00:40:21,here lies John René.
00:40:21,00:40:23,Like that.
00:40:23,00:40:24,"- Kind of thing, yeah."
00:40:24,00:40:25,- And then the next one is slightly different.
00:40:25,00:40:26,The next one is slightly different.
00:40:26,00:40:28,So you can read it down diagonally.
00:40:28,00:40:29,- Exactly.
00:40:29,00:40:30,- Like the world's most boring word search.
00:40:30,00:40:31,- Yes.
00:40:31,00:40:34,- But just great.
00:40:34,00:40:36,"Such an, it's an amazing thing to look at."
00:40:36,00:40:40,"- Oh, the guy who first formulated pi to 35 places"
00:40:40,00:40:44,was a German mathematician called Ludolf van Sirlen.
00:40:44,00:40:49,And his gravestone reads 3.14159-265-3589-7932.
00:40:49,00:40:53,- Amazing.
00:40:53,00:40:55,- I don't know why I start if it isn't a recipe for pi.
00:40:55,00:40:58,(laughing)
00:40:58,00:41:06,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:41:06,00:41:07,And that is my fact.
00:41:07,00:41:10,My fact this week is that doctors used to prepare
00:41:10,00:41:13,their patients for surgery by either getting them
00:41:13,00:41:16,really drunk or smacking them on the head with a mallet
00:41:16,00:41:18,and hoping they didn't kill them.
00:41:18,00:41:20,(laughing)
00:41:20,00:41:22,That's back in the day.
00:41:22,00:41:22,So.
00:41:22,00:41:24,- When are we to which day?
00:41:24,00:41:25,- Back in the day.
00:41:25,00:41:27,- This is in the 1800s.
00:41:27,00:41:29,This was in the top floor
00:41:29,00:41:33,of America's oldest surgical ampy theater as it's known.
00:41:33,00:41:35,This is in the Pennsylvania hospital.
00:41:35,00:41:39,And I guess what's so surprising is how late in the day
00:41:39,00:41:39,this was happening.
00:41:39,00:41:42,This is in the sort of mid 1800s.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"- It's not, mid 1800s was when we had,"
00:41:44,00:41:46,"we, I take a lot of credit,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,but we had got like some aether chloroform stuff
00:41:48,00:41:49,was starting to happen.
00:41:49,00:41:51,- And a lot of them weren't fully accepted though.
00:41:51,00:41:54,"So this, it definitely was around at this time."
00:41:54,00:41:56,"But this hospital was like, not into it."
00:41:56,00:41:57,We'd rather hit you on the head.
00:41:57,00:41:59,- Happened in Britain as well.
00:41:59,00:42:00,There was a guy called Henry Hill Hickman
00:42:00,00:42:04,who used to try suffocation to get his ovations.
00:42:04,00:42:07,(laughing)
00:42:07,00:42:10,"- Yeah, so this was a thing."
00:42:10,00:42:13,"And, you know, the drunkenness hopefully would see them"
00:42:13,00:42:16,through an operation as would such a massive hit
00:42:16,00:42:17,on the head.
00:42:17,00:42:19,"- Some of these operations were very quick, weren't they?"
00:42:19,00:42:20,They were amputations and stuff.
00:42:20,00:42:21,And they were trying to do them
00:42:21,00:42:23,in the matter of seconds.
00:42:23,00:42:25,"- In fact, that seems to be the most effective method"
00:42:25,00:42:27,"of pain killing up until, you know,"
00:42:27,00:42:30,they found ether and stuff was just speed.
00:42:30,00:42:31,"And there was, we talked about it."
00:42:31,00:42:32,- The drug.
00:42:32,00:42:33,- QI.
00:42:33,00:42:34,(laughing)
00:42:34,00:42:35,- You love it.
00:42:35,00:42:38,- Just getting incredibly anxious before your friction.
00:42:38,00:42:40,"- Yeah, I was, yeah, doing it within a short amount of time."
00:42:40,00:42:42,"And we've mentioned Robert Liston on QI,"
00:42:42,00:42:45,"but his, he was a famous 19th century surgeon"
00:42:45,00:42:49,"and his catchphrase was, ""Time me, gentlemen, time me."""
00:42:49,00:42:51,And there's a huge amount of showmanship
00:42:51,00:42:53,to his surgical performances.
00:42:53,00:42:54,"- It's a good catchphrase, that."
00:42:54,00:42:55,- It's a good catchphrase.
00:42:55,00:42:57,And it would kind of reassure you.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"If you're having your leg cut off,"
00:42:58,00:42:59,you want it to be quick.
00:42:59,00:43:03,And he used to brag he could amputate a leg in 25 seconds.
00:43:03,00:43:04,- Wow.
00:43:04,00:43:06,"- And his chances of dying,"
00:43:06,00:43:08,'cause he gets a lot of stick these days
00:43:08,00:43:11,for being all about the show and that's about the safety.
00:43:11,00:43:13,"But you only had a one in six chance of dying,"
00:43:13,00:43:16,which was quite good for surgeons then.
00:43:16,00:43:19,"And there was one great, the best story about him,"
00:43:19,00:43:21,which I'm pretty sure we looked at when we did QI
00:43:21,00:43:23,"and is probably not true,"
00:43:23,00:43:28,but it was reported that he once was so focused
00:43:28,00:43:29,on doing something incredibly fast
00:43:29,00:43:31,that he's amputating a limb.
00:43:31,00:43:33,And he accidentally at the same time cut through
00:43:33,00:43:37,his associate nurse's finger on the way.
00:43:37,00:43:39,And so both the person whose limb was amputated
00:43:39,00:43:41,and the person whose finger he amputated died
00:43:41,00:43:43,pretty quickly afterwards.
00:43:43,00:43:46,And also someone who was watching died of shock.
00:43:46,00:43:48,And it's always recorded as the only operation
00:43:48,00:43:50,with a 300% mortality rate.
00:43:50,00:43:53,"- Yeah, wow, great story."
00:43:53,00:43:54,- It's a strong story.
00:43:54,00:43:56,- Don't check it ever.
00:43:56,00:43:57,That's a comical ending.
00:43:57,00:43:59,Like an airplane going into a mountain.
00:43:59,00:44:00,That's comical surgery.
00:44:00,00:44:01,"- That's comedy, you're right."
00:44:01,00:44:03,"That's, yeah."
00:44:03,00:44:06,- Just on the sort of reputation of surgery back in the day.
00:44:06,00:44:07,- Yeah.
00:44:07,00:44:09,- And this is a fact actually got sent in to us
00:44:09,00:44:10,from Sarah on Twitter.
00:44:10,00:44:12,"So thank you, Sarah."
00:44:12,00:44:14,It was about the operating theater in Aberdeen.
00:44:14,00:44:17,And there used to be above the door
00:44:17,00:44:18,"to the operating theater in Aberdeen,"
00:44:18,00:44:21,"the words, ""Prepare to meet thy God."""
00:44:21,00:44:22,- Ooh.
00:44:22,00:44:26,"- Which is, oh, this is such an uncharable thing to read."
00:44:26,00:44:27,- Wow.
00:44:27,00:44:27,- And it was all about this surgeon
00:44:27,00:44:29,called Alexander Ogston who worked there
00:44:29,00:44:31,"and he discovered Staphylococcus,"
00:44:31,00:44:33,which is a very big--
00:44:33,00:44:35,- Common bacteria for getting like--
00:44:35,00:44:39,- Infections and abscesses and all of that.
00:44:39,00:44:40,Really dangerous staphylococcus.
00:44:40,00:44:43,And he was so inspired by antiseptic zeal
00:44:43,00:44:45,that he returned and he pulled the sign down
00:44:45,00:44:46,and burned it on one occasion.
00:44:46,00:44:47,- Wow.
00:44:47,00:44:48,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:48,00:44:49,- Wow.
00:44:49,00:44:51,"- It was a very, very religious place"
00:44:51,00:44:52,to have your operation.
00:44:52,00:44:53,- I can imagine.
00:44:53,00:44:54,"So the one that I was talking about in Pennsylvania,"
00:44:54,00:44:58,the surgery itself had a sky roof basically.
00:44:58,00:45:00,So there was a dome at the top and it was glass.
00:45:00,00:45:02,So they would do all the operations in the day
00:45:02,00:45:04,and natural light was what was giving them--
00:45:04,00:45:05,- That's good.
00:45:05,00:45:06,"- The light, yeah."
00:45:06,00:45:07,- Lovely.
00:45:07,00:45:09,- But I'm afraid the surgeons will take off their robes
00:45:09,00:45:13,"and show you a good time, yeah, yeah."
00:45:13,00:45:16,- They would write their prices on the patient's spleen.
00:45:16,00:45:21,"And they did have anesthetics before then,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,various types throughout the world.
00:45:23,00:45:27,"A Chinese physician called Huatuo,"
00:45:27,00:45:28,I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong.
00:45:28,00:45:29,Apologies if I am.
00:45:29,00:45:34,But from 140 AD to 208 AD.
00:45:34,00:45:38,"This guy, he would use something called mafeisan,"
00:45:38,00:45:41,which is cannabis boil pounder.
00:45:41,00:45:43,So he gave it to the patient.
00:45:43,00:45:45,"And apparently it was so good,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,there was a guy called General Kuanyu
00:45:47,00:45:50,and he was wounded by a poison arrow
00:45:50,00:45:52,and he was sort of given some surgery
00:45:52,00:45:55,to try and bring the arrow out and clean the wound.
00:45:55,00:45:58,And the general played chess while his bone
00:45:58,00:46:00,was being scraped clean.
00:46:00,00:46:02,'Cause his concoction was so good.
00:46:02,00:46:04,- But did he win the game?
00:46:04,00:46:05,(laughing)
00:46:05,00:46:07,- He just kept whacking the pieces
00:46:07,00:46:09,"after he was in a selfish pain, no."
00:46:09,00:46:11,"- Yeah, we still don't know how they work."
00:46:11,00:46:12,"- Yeah, crazy, yeah."
00:46:12,00:46:14,"- I find there's so much momentum,"
00:46:14,00:46:16,we don't know how or why it works.
00:46:16,00:46:19,"It's just, we kept trying and this one stuck."
00:46:19,00:46:22,"I mean, it's people speculate that,"
00:46:22,00:46:25,"this is general anesthetic, so what puts you to sleep."
00:46:25,00:46:27,Speculator that it dissolves some of the fat
00:46:27,00:46:31,"in your brain cells, so stops the cells activity."
00:46:31,00:46:32,There's just been a study that found out
00:46:32,00:46:35,that one particular anesthetic
00:46:35,00:46:37,"maybe weakens the transmission of signal,"
00:46:37,00:46:39,electrical signals between your neurons
00:46:39,00:46:41,in like the higher functioning parts of your brain.
00:46:41,00:46:43,"So that's why it will knock you unconscious,"
00:46:43,00:46:45,but it won't stop you breathing
00:46:45,00:46:48,'cause the lower functioning parts can still keep going.
00:46:48,00:46:51,"But yeah, it's so weird that we don't,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,we just accept it works.
00:46:53,00:46:56,"But I like, before another anesthetic."
00:46:56,00:46:59,I don't know how my microwave works.
00:46:59,00:47:00,- But someone does.
00:47:00,00:47:03,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:47:03,00:47:04,"- Sorry, when I say we, I don't just mean"
00:47:04,00:47:06,we couldn't be asked to research it.
00:47:06,00:47:07,"I mean, even the scientists"
00:47:07,00:47:09,can't be asked to find out properly.
00:47:09,00:47:13,But another ancient way of anesthetizing people
00:47:13,00:47:15,was electric rays.
00:47:15,00:47:18,"- These, the eels. - Yeah, yeah."
00:47:18,00:47:21,So these were used in ancient Rome.
00:47:21,00:47:23,"It was like torpedo fish,"
00:47:23,00:47:24,"I think we've talked about before,"
00:47:24,00:47:26,could give you a real electric shock.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"And it was treatment for gout,"
00:47:28,00:47:29,or it was if you wanted to numb an area
00:47:29,00:47:31,and you needed to do something to it.
00:47:31,00:47:34,It was recommended that you stand on the shore
00:47:34,00:47:36,and you let your legs be washed by the sea
00:47:36,00:47:38,as various electric rays
00:47:38,00:47:40,wrapped themselves around it
00:47:40,00:47:42,and wait for them to electrify you.
00:47:42,00:47:44,"- If you were just stood in the sea,"
00:47:44,00:47:48,"you would need to bring them to you, right?"
00:47:48,00:47:49,They wouldn't just naturally sting you.
00:47:49,00:47:50,"- Yeah, how are you attracting them?"
00:47:50,00:47:51,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:47:51,00:47:53,"- Yeah, maybe you drop some food for them."
00:47:53,00:47:55,"No, wait, are you the food?"
00:47:55,00:47:57,"- You are kind of, you can maybe cut your legs"
00:47:57,00:47:59,so there's a bit of blood in the water.
00:47:59,00:48:00,"- Yeah, nice."
00:48:00,00:48:03,Then awful if the shark comes before the eels.
00:48:03,00:48:04,And then she's holding up to take it.
00:48:04,00:48:06,"- Yeah, it's not convenient though."
00:48:06,00:48:08,"So they quickly, they would shock you,"
00:48:08,00:48:11,"you would go numb, they would carry you out, and then."
00:48:11,00:48:12,- And then they can do a treatment on you
00:48:12,00:48:14,like cut off a bunion. - Like cut off your legs.
00:48:14,00:48:17,"- Or bunion, all that for a bunion, my God."
00:48:17,00:48:19,Jesus.
00:48:19,00:48:22,You know how in the very first episode of this podcast
00:48:22,00:48:24,"we talked about, anyone remember?"
00:48:24,00:48:27,"- We talked, yeah, President Garfield's."
00:48:27,00:48:28,- President Garfield's Anus.
00:48:28,00:48:30,So I have a related fact to this.
00:48:30,00:48:32,- I think you should quickly explain that
00:48:32,00:48:35,for anyone who can't remember 460 episodes ago.
00:48:35,00:48:37,"- So this is the fact that for the last,"
00:48:37,00:48:38,was it month of his life?
00:48:38,00:48:39,"- Three months, I believe."
00:48:39,00:48:40,- Three months.
00:48:40,00:48:43,President Garfield ate everything through his Anus
00:48:43,00:48:44,and that's because he'd been shot
00:48:44,00:48:47,and he wasn't able to eat through the mouth
00:48:47,00:48:49,and so he was fed through the bump.
00:48:49,00:48:54,So the American president usually hands over power
00:48:55,00:48:56,when...
00:48:56,00:48:56,"- Yes, he does."
00:48:56,00:48:58,But in Donald Trump's case...
00:48:58,00:49:00,(laughing)
00:49:00,00:49:02,"You're so right, Donald Trump is the outlier here."
00:49:02,00:49:03,- Is he?
00:49:03,00:49:05,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, James, that's exactly right."
00:49:05,00:49:07,"So, okay, normally when the US president,"
00:49:07,00:49:10,"always a man so far, has a colonoscopy,"
00:49:10,00:49:12,"which is a procedure, and you're a bit older,"
00:49:12,00:49:14,they put a camera up your bum
00:49:14,00:49:16,and they just check what's going on.
00:49:16,00:49:19,"Normally a small camera on a little wire,"
00:49:19,00:49:22,not like a big long lens paparazzi camera.
00:49:22,00:49:24,And it's a very common thing.
00:49:24,00:49:26,"So Joe Biden did it in 2021,"
00:49:26,00:49:28,"handed over to Kamala Harris for the,"
00:49:28,00:49:32,"you know, half an hour, a couple of hours of the anesthetic."
00:49:32,00:49:33,George Bush had it twice
00:49:33,00:49:36,and both times handed over briefly to Dick Cheney.
00:49:36,00:49:38,There was a report a year or so ago
00:49:38,00:49:40,"that Donald Trump underwent this procedure,"
00:49:40,00:49:43,but he refused to have the anesthetic
00:49:43,00:49:45,"because he didn't want to hand over to Mike Pence,"
00:49:45,00:49:48,"however briefly, the reigns of office."
00:49:48,00:49:51,So he just sort of bear-backed it.
00:49:51,00:49:54,"One chance, I thought they had,"
00:49:54,00:49:57,"""Silence, Donald Trump, for a couple of blissful hours."""
00:49:57,00:50:00,That's really interesting.
00:50:00,00:50:03,"I've got another thing about putting stuff up the bum,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,if you want to hear it.
00:50:04,00:50:07,So this is about the first woman physician
00:50:07,00:50:10,"to specialize in anesthesia, who's called Isabella Herb."
00:50:10,00:50:14,And she was the first person to use ethylene
00:50:14,00:50:16,as a general anesthetic.
00:50:16,00:50:18,And there were two main ways
00:50:18,00:50:21,that she'd get you out of the anesthesia state.
00:50:21,00:50:24,"One of them was to give you strychnine,"
00:50:24,00:50:27,"which would apparently help, presumably not that much."
00:50:27,00:50:28,And the other one was the installation
00:50:28,00:50:32,of warm saline solutions to the rectum.
00:50:32,00:50:33,Installation.
00:50:33,00:50:36,"So if you were under because of this ethylene,"
00:50:36,00:50:39,then she would squirt some salty water up your bum
00:50:39,00:50:41,and it would get you out of the...
00:50:41,00:50:41,"Sounds kind of pleasant,"
00:50:41,00:50:43,although is that not the thing that makes you wait yourself?
00:50:43,00:50:45,"No, that's fingering then."
00:50:45,00:50:47,"I think that's putting your hand in a bowl of water,"
00:50:47,00:50:48,it does not squirt.
00:50:48,00:50:52,"I bet if you put your bum in it, though, something happens."
00:50:52,00:50:53,The interesting thing about ethylene
00:50:53,00:50:59,and a problem that she had was that it does explode quite easily.
00:50:59,00:51:04,"And so what she did was, she had her operating theatre"
00:51:04,00:51:06,"and they had very, very high humidity"
00:51:06,00:51:08,because apparently that helped you
00:51:08,00:51:09,"'cause there's slightly less oxygen in the air,"
00:51:09,00:51:11,so less likely to explode.
00:51:11,00:51:14,But also because it was an early time
00:51:14,00:51:17,"of having electric lights and stuff like that,"
00:51:17,00:51:19,they grounded everything in the building.
00:51:19,00:51:23,So the table where the person was being operated on.
00:51:23,00:51:26,"And in fact, everyone kind of had things attached to them."
00:51:26,00:51:28,Do you remember we talked about this big spike
00:51:28,00:51:30,that people had on their heads?
00:51:30,00:51:31,"Yeah, everyone had electrical conductors"
00:51:31,00:51:33,to conduct the charge orders.
00:51:33,00:51:35,"Basically, everyone was wearing these wires to"
00:51:35,00:51:38,"and they attached to the pipes around the room,"
00:51:38,00:51:39,"the water pipes,"
00:51:39,00:51:42,"so that if there was any kind of spark in there,"
00:51:42,00:51:43,"instead of setting off the ethylene,"
00:51:43,00:51:46,it would go into these grounded things
00:51:46,00:51:47,and then go down into the building.
00:51:47,00:51:48,Isn't that amazing?
00:51:48,00:51:49,That's really cool.
00:51:49,00:51:50,Isn't that so cool as well?
00:51:50,00:51:51,What a great name.
00:51:51,00:51:53,"Imagine, you know when you fill in the forms"
00:51:53,00:51:54,"before you do an operation where you say,"
00:51:54,00:51:57,"""I understand that I might blah, blah, and blah, blah."""
00:51:57,00:51:58,"Imagine just that,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,"""Well, I understand there's a 30% chance I'll explode."""
00:52:00,00:52:03,"Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking about."
00:52:03,00:52:06,"Just on doctors sort of beating patients around us,"
00:52:06,00:52:09,this mallet people did in the fact.
00:52:09,00:52:12,August Beer was the person who came up
00:52:12,00:52:13,with the first spinal anesthesia.
00:52:13,00:52:15,"That was in the 1890s, 1898."
00:52:15,00:52:18,"And so that was injecting cocaine into your spinal cord,"
00:52:18,00:52:20,was the first spinal anesthesia.
00:52:20,00:52:22,And he wanted to work out
00:52:22,00:52:24,how much you really needed to inject
00:52:24,00:52:27,"because if you injected too much, had bad side effects."
00:52:27,00:52:30,"And so he thought, ""Okay, well, I'm gonna test out on myself."""
00:52:30,00:52:33,"And so he asked his assistant, also called August,"
00:52:33,00:52:34,to inject him.
00:52:34,00:52:35,(laughing)
00:52:35,00:52:36,- Funnily must have heard.
00:52:36,00:52:37,(laughing)
00:52:37,00:52:38,- To August.
00:52:38,00:52:40,"I mean, a very non-August time."
00:52:40,00:52:43,And so his assistant injected his spine.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"Sadly, his spinal fluid started leaking out"
00:52:45,00:52:47,quite drastically and so they had to stop.
00:52:47,00:52:49,"So he said, ""Do you mind if we swap?"""
00:52:49,00:52:51,So the August swapped.
00:52:51,00:52:55,"And his assistant said, ""Okay, you try it on me."""
00:52:55,00:52:58,"So August, the assistant, lies there."
00:52:58,00:53:01,And August Beer jabs him with the cocaine
00:53:01,00:53:04,and then tests how high his pain threshold is.
00:53:04,00:53:05,And the account is just incredible.
00:53:05,00:53:08,So he starts by tickling his feet.
00:53:08,00:53:09,"Quite pleasant, couldn't feel anything."
00:53:09,00:53:14,And then he jabbed a large blunt needle into his thigh
00:53:14,00:53:17,and then he got a larger blunter needle
00:53:17,00:53:21,"and put it in down his femur, apparently."
00:53:21,00:53:24,"He then, and he's awake through this process"
00:53:24,00:53:25,'cause it's local anaesthetic.
00:53:25,00:53:27,So he's chatting away and having a great time.
00:53:27,00:53:31,He got sharp forceps and crushed his skin up.
00:53:31,00:53:33,He burned a cigar out on him.
00:53:33,00:53:35,He yanked all his pubic hair off.
00:53:35,00:53:37,(laughing)
00:53:37,00:53:40,"- That was just for fun, wasn't it?"
00:53:40,00:53:42,"- Yeah, he'd asked for a wax"
00:53:42,00:53:44,and you might as well two birds one stone.
00:53:44,00:53:46,(laughing)
00:53:46,00:53:49,He actually yanked his pubic hair off
00:53:49,00:53:51,and then did the chest hair for comparison.
00:53:51,00:53:52,- Really?
00:53:52,00:53:54,"- Just to say, see, it would hurt if, you know,"
00:53:54,00:53:55,if you weren't anesthetized.
00:53:55,00:53:56,"- Wow, wow, wow."
00:53:56,00:53:59,"- Hit his shin with a hammer, squeezed his testicles very hard."
00:53:59,00:54:00,And--
00:54:00,00:54:02,"- Squeeze his testicles, oh my God."
00:54:02,00:54:03,- So look how impressive is that?
00:54:03,00:54:05,- I think he compressed his testicles
00:54:05,00:54:07,"between two plates, didn't he?"
00:54:07,00:54:09,"And then just kept squeezing, squeezing, squeezing."
00:54:09,00:54:10,- Did he?
00:54:10,00:54:12,"- I'd remember all the media about this, yeah."
00:54:12,00:54:13,"- Well, they had a big feast afterwards"
00:54:13,00:54:16,so maybe they ate all the testicle plates.
00:54:16,00:54:17,(laughing)
00:54:17,00:54:21,"- Oh my God, so afterwards, was it just broken?"
00:54:21,00:54:22,"- How did you, how did that go for you?"
00:54:22,00:54:24,"- Oh, it's absolutely fine."
00:54:24,00:54:26,(laughing)
00:54:26,00:54:28,- He was a bit bruised as it wore off.
00:54:28,00:54:32,"But he was, they had, they wind and dine and cigar together"
00:54:32,00:54:33,and--
00:54:33,00:54:37,"- Cigar, I wouldn't let cigars anyone see me after that."
00:54:37,00:54:39,- Some people wake up in the middle
00:54:39,00:54:44,of a general anaesthetic and it sounds awful.
00:54:44,00:54:48,The good thing is you almost always forget afterwards.
00:54:48,00:54:51,So I spoke to someone who carries out anaesthesia
00:54:51,00:54:53,quite regularly and says sometimes patients
00:54:53,00:54:55,get chatty during procedures
00:54:55,00:54:57,and you can just tell them to shut up
00:54:57,00:54:58,and be really rude to them 'cause they won't remember
00:54:58,00:55:00,"after the operation, you know?"
00:55:00,00:55:03,"One patient had been going on and on about their job,"
00:55:03,00:55:05,I think at NatWest and how interesting it was
00:55:05,00:55:07,"and they just had to say, look, to shut up, please."
00:55:07,00:55:09,- That's so funny because when I last had
00:55:09,00:55:11,"general anaesthesia, I thought I'll just have a chat"
00:55:11,00:55:14,'cause I've not met an anaesthesia expert before
00:55:14,00:55:17,and I just started chatting to him and then went under
00:55:17,00:55:20,and now I'm realizing that as soon as I went under
00:55:20,00:55:21,"he's like, you barry bastard."
00:55:21,00:55:22,(laughing)
00:55:22,00:55:25,"- You work up with no pews, right?"
00:55:25,00:55:27,(laughing)
00:55:27,00:55:29,"Yeah, so normally you don't remember it"
00:55:29,00:55:32,but sometimes you do remember it and you can't move
00:55:32,00:55:35,because the drugs are paralyzing you.
00:55:35,00:55:36,That sounds like the worst thing in the world
00:55:36,00:55:39,"because you wake up, you know what's going on"
00:55:39,00:55:40,and you can't do anything about it.
00:55:40,00:55:42,"- And all you can hear is the anesthetist going,"
00:55:42,00:55:43,"ah, I shagged your mum, yeah."
00:55:43,00:55:46,(laughing)
00:55:46,00:55:48,- Fenella woke up after she had surgery
00:55:48,00:55:50,where she went under general anaesthetic
00:55:50,00:55:52,and she woke up and was quite tired
00:55:52,00:55:54,and they didn't realize that she was awake.
00:55:54,00:55:56,"This is post-surgery, they were moving her away"
00:55:56,00:55:58,and all she heard was a conversation
00:55:58,00:56:01,about how much the doctors enjoyed no such thing as a fish.
00:56:01,00:56:04,(laughing)
00:56:04,00:56:05,- The worst possible nightmare.
00:56:05,00:56:08,"She was like, ah, Christ."
00:56:08,00:56:09,- I would put you back under.
00:56:09,00:56:11,(laughing)
00:56:11,00:56:14,(upbeat music)
