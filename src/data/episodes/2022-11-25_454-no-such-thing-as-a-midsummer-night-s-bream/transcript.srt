1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,800
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,460
 of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,480
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,000
 with James Harkin, Anna Tyshinski, and Andrew Hunter Murray.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,120
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,040
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,280
 and in no particular order, here we go.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,080
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Anna.

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,960
 - My fact this week is that indigenous Bolivian women

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,960
 traditionally wear huge, colorful skirts and bowler hats.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,240
 (laughing)

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,120
 And I can't believe I'd never really seen this before.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,040
 It's striking, and they all do.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,120
 So these are, they tend to be known as Cholitas,

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,320
 which is basically a term for like the Aymara and the Quechua

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,720
 and other rural Bolivian women.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,120
 - Not Charlie Chaplin, as it sort of sounds like,

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,960
 the Cholitas.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,680
 - It's a, I know you're trying to make a jump

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,120
 to the Charlie Chaplin bowler hat,

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,400
 and I appreciate that.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
 - Yeah, so like his fan club, you know,

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,000
 all these like Lady Gaga's, I call them monsters.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,520
 - Beliebers, yeah.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,960
 - Maybe you've blown this wide open,

28
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,520
 that is why they do it.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,960
 So Cholitas, it used to be a pejorative term I think,

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 and it was, it comes from the Spanish Cholo for mixed race,

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,360
 but it's like very much reclaimed by them now.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,520
 And if you look them up,

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,240
 they always wear these stunning kind of white,

34
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,440
 like silky waistcoats with a brooch

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,240
 and these huge dresses with like petticoats underneath.

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
 So like really big Elizabethan style dresses.

37
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,040
 And then a bowler hat, which doesn't fit.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,720
 - But it does work.

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,400
 It makes the look awesome.

40
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,520
 - Oh, it works in that way.

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,360
 - Oh yeah.

42
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,160
 - And it works in like a, you know,

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,040
 because bowler hats were originally invented

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
 to stop twigs from hurting your head when they,

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,880
 so I wondered if...

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,520
 - It would probably stop a twig from hurting your head.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
 - It's not functional.

48
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,760
 - I'm talking fashion, I was saying it works.

49
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,560
 - That works, it does work.

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,840
 Yes, and we're not quite sure why they do it.

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,400
 They started doing it the turn of the 20th century.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,880
 There's the legend that when British

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,840
 and Irish railway workers were in Bolivia,

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,880
 which they worked, the railway building company

55
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,360
 was a British company.

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
 There was a big shipment of bowler hats

57
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,960
 that was sent for them to wear.

58
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,920
 'Cause it was like workers hats and they were too small.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
 So some clever marketing person flogged them

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,800
 to the indigenous women.

61
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,240
 I think there was a guy called Domingo Solingo,

62
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,200
 who did a very good job of popularizing them

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,040
 and like ran a good PR campaign.

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,400
 - Try to get men to wear it first

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,880
 from one of the other stories, versions of the story.

66
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,960
 And they were just not interested.

67
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,360
 So they're just as a last minute thing when women,

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
 - But then, when he was walking along

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
 with a tray of samples one day, he tripped over

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,160
 and one of the hats fell onto a woman's head.

71
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,840
 And completely by accident, he discovered.

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,840
 - That's so interesting, 'cause they are, I mean,

73
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,760
 they are comically small.

74
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,320
 They're not like, you know, just a little bit too small

75
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,680
 to go on your head, are they?

76
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,800
 - They're not like yamulka, if you're a bit string.

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
 It's like, yeah, just--

78
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,560
 - They're clearly too small.

79
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,760
 It's what I'm saying. - They sit on top.

80
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
 They sit on top. - They sit on top.

81
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,480
 - So I mean, who were they made for, is my--

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
 - Yes.

83
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,680
 - This happened, we have this in the house all the time

84
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,280
 where you order something and then a novelty small sized

85
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,040
 version comes in the post.

86
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,560
 That must be what it was. - What?

87
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
 - You know, like, we bought a crown

88
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,680
 for my son, Will's birthday and it arrived

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,160
 and it was the size that would fit a Kendall's head

90
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,240
 by accident because we just hadn't read the measurements.

91
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,880
 We got a washing line. - I'm not telling you the measurements.

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,720
 - Need to read the measurements.

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
 They clearly didn't hear as well.

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,320
 - One thing I like about the charita thing

95
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
 is that they, I didn't really, I mean,

96
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,160
 I didn't know anything about this style before

97
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,120
 or even this cultural grouping before researching this,

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
 but they weren't allowed to walk freely

99
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,200
 in the main square of La Paz,

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,560
 which is the capital of Bolivia,

101
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,160
 or in the wealthy suburbs in this outfit for many years.

102
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,200
 And then it's really been brought back on board

103
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,360
 to the extent that they're officially a part

104
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
 of the city's cultural heritage now.

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,600
 It's called the charita of La Paz.

106
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,040
 And also there are charita fashion shows.

107
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,400
 There is a charita modeling agency

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,440
 and I'm sure you guys came across the Fighting Charitas.

109
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,320
 - Oh yeah, I did not, I'd like to hear about

110
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,640
 the Fighting Charitas. - It's just a wrestling group,

111
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,400
 but they're female wrestlers who wrestle in traditional--

112
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,960
 - With the hat. - With the hat.

113
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,160
 - Do they do like odd job?

114
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,480
 - The odd job kill.

115
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,520
 Yeah, they do, yeah.

116
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
 They die by the dozen every man.

117
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,200
 Anyway, the Fighting Charitas, they're all right.

118
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,120
 - That's the one where they play golf, isn't it?

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,560
 - Golf. (laughing)

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,080
 - That's the only Bond film I've seen,

121
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,400
 the one where they play golf.

122
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,040
 - Did you Google Bond film golf?

123
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,680
 - I just Google golf and it came up.

124
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
 - Right, do you have, you know, there's an app

125
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,520
 that can tell you when to go to the toilet at the cinema,

126
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,360
 like toilet break.

127
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
 Do you have an app that just tells you

128
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,640
 when golf scenes are in a movie?

129
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
 - Yeah, yeah. - And you just show up

130
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,320
 for that bit?

131
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,040
 - I do, I only ever watched Caddy Shack in that Bond film.

132
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,240
 (laughing)

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,160
 - They are a real happy story,

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
 which, you know, we're all on the lookout for these days,

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,320
 but I think it was basically since Eva Morales

136
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,400
 was in charge of Bolivia, right,

137
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,800
 who was their first indigenous president,

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,200
 who came in the early 2000s

139
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,280
 and sort of completely rehabilitated their reputations

140
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,920
 'cause they had been kind of ostracized

141
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,360
 and had all these horrible repressive rules

142
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,720
 made against them.

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,760
 And now they're doing so well

144
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,040
 and it's a real great story and they're quite well off.

145
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,080
 They've got all these celebrations about their heritage.

146
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,240
 They have, I think they have a few indigenous people

147
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,240
 in parliament, they're like lawyers and doctors

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,000
 and yeah, it's quite nice 'cause they have since,

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,280
 like literally back in the day when the Spanish colonized

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
 and they wanted to distinguish them,

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
 the superior colonists from the indigenous people.

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,840
 So they said, okay, well, what do people

153
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,120
 who were lower class do in Spain?

154
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,960
 They wear these big peasant dresses

155
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,440
 and so they made them all wear these big peasant dresses.

156
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,480
 - What does that come from?

157
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,760
 - So yeah, they put them in these,

158
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,400
 to just say like you're beneath us

159
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,720
 and the charlatans just went, all right,

160
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,760
 we're gonna own this.

161
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,000
 - It's interesting 'cause like the big dresses

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,320
 come from the Spanish peasants

163
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,600
 and the Bola hats come from British,

164
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,960
 you know, up class people.

165
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,560
 - Yeah, I see. - They're such a fusion.

166
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,400
 - Yes, yeah.

167
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,920
 Have you guys ever drunk Coca-Cola?

168
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,760
 - No.

169
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
 (laughs)

170
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
 - Yes.

171
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
 - What kind of a question is that?

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,520
 - You might be right, you might be right that you haven't.

173
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,120
 So this launched in April 2010 and Coca-Cola

174
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,560
 - What is it, cola, C-O-L-L-A, Coca-Cola.

175
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,560
 - Yeah, is a local Coca-Cola basically

176
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,600
 that they've just manufactured on their own.

177
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,440
 So it has a red label with white writing.

178
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,240
 I mean, the packaging is very similar,

179
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
 but it's sold as a legit product there.

180
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
 They've not been in trouble.

181
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
 - And they're all right with this.

182
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
 Or are we now getting them in trouble

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,200
 if someone knows that Coca-Cola is listening to cola?

184
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,680
 - No, it's becoming a bigger, yeah, yeah.

185
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,400
 - 'Cause it's named after the cola people

186
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,320
 and the coca nut, which is in it.

187
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
 - Yeah.

188
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,000
 - And they say to Coca-Cola or Brit-Vay-Co,

189
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,480
 everyone's Coca-Cola, they say,

190
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,000
 "Well, you know, there's nothing you can do about it."

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
 And I'm not sure Coca-Cola are particularly happy about it,

192
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
 but there's nothing they can do.

193
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,560
 - They're definitely not happy about it.

194
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
 But they can do cool.

195
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,560
 And they've got Coca-Leaf extracts in it as well.

196
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,640
 So actually it's an illegal drink to be sold over here.

197
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,560
 So they're quite regional because it's legal there,

198
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
 but for us, yeah, it's a drug.

199
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,080
 - I think we should legalize,

200
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,000
 I mean, we should probably legalize all drugs,

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,840
 but Coca-Leaves, I definitely think

202
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,280
 we should legalize in this country.

203
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,000
 - So we can get this cola drink?

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,760
 - No, because like when I was in the Andes,

205
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
 it's the best thing.

206
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,240
 It just gives you a little bit of a pickup.

207
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,080
 - Yeah.

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,920
 - Oh, it's so useful.

209
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,960
 Honestly, when you've got a hangover or you're tired

210
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,920
 or anything, just chew a Coca-Leaf

211
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,240
 and it just makes you feel so much better.

212
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,960
 And it's just a tiny little buzz.

213
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
 - Have you tried cocaine James?

214
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,800
 You'll love it.

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,040
 (all laughing)

216
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,200
 - I think the, I think the Pope has tried the Coca-Leaves.

217
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,720
 - I think he visited several years ago and when he went,

218
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 I think he said, oh, I'll have some of that.

219
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,560
 So.

220
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
 - Yeah, everywhere.

221
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,760
 Like if you go to a hotel,

222
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
 you know, if you go to a hotel in the UK,

223
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,120
 they might have a bowl of Murray Mint.

224
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,520
 - Oh, a lovely hotel would have that.

225
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,360
 - Yeah, exactly.

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,320
 Well, all the hotels in Peru and in Bolivia,

227
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,640
 they have a bowl of these leaves

228
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
 and you just pick them up and chew on them.

229
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,080
 - It's actually a bowl, it's a bowl of a hat

230
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
 upside down, isn't it?

231
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,080
 Full of those leaves.

232
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
 - Are you sure it's not just potpourri?

233
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,280
 (all laughing)

234
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,240
 Because it leaves your breath really,

235
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,040
 really nice at the end of it.

236
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,040
 - Guys, did you know, not 25 minutes walk

237
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,800
 from where we're sitting right now,

238
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,480
 is where the first bowl of hats were sold.

239
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,560
 - Is that true?

240
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,480
 - Invented and sold in St. James's Street.

241
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,720
 I mean, it might have been invented in someone's house,

242
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,400
 you know, but it was brought to St. James's Street

243
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,160
 to lock and co-hatters who've been going

244
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
 since like basically the 17th century

245
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,200
 when they were founded.

246
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,240
 And the shop is still there today.

247
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
 So you can still buy hats from them.

248
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
 - I think we'll pass there quite a lot, do you?

249
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,200
 - Right, so that's where the bowl of hat is from.

250
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,040
 - That's very exciting.

251
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:41,880
 - That is exciting, isn't it?

252
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,720
 - Yeah, yeah.

253
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,920
 - We're gonna turn up next week in a bowl of hat

254
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,880
 'cause I can see it, of the four of us.

255
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,600
 - Just a comically small one, I think.

256
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

257
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,040
 - No, that's already, it's a nice shop.

258
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
 I don't think they make a huge deal out of it

259
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,760
 on the shop front.

260
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,720
 - No, they don't, and their legacy is huge

261
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,120
 because they not only sell bowl of hats,

262
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
 they sell all kinds of hats.

263
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,000
 They sold Admiral Lord Nelson,

264
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,760
 his, what was it called?

265
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,480
 - The Bicorn. - Bicorn, sorry.

266
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,280
 - Yeah, the Bicorn that he rode.

267
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,400
 - Yeah, Napoleon was the Tricorn.

268
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,000
 - You don't wanna go to use them, they get very offended.

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,840
 - No one with a unicorn hat, which is insane.

270
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,920
 (laughing)

271
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
 - And I think that would've,

272
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,800
 that would've made the Battle of Trafalgar really exciting.

273
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,880
 - That's got the element of surprise, I think,

274
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,680
 in the unicorn hat.

275
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
 - According to Locke's, it was devised

276
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
 by a pair of people called Thomas and William Bowler.

277
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
 Okay, and they, Edward Cook said,

278
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,560
 "Can you make this hat for us to Locke's?"

279
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,880
 And Locke said, "Well, we'll get our mates,

280
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
 "Thomas and William Bowler, to make it."

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,880
 Now, according to the OED,

282
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,640
 the Bowler hat gets its name because it's shaped like a bowl,

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,440
 not because it's named after these guys' bowlers.

284
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,360
 So, I don't wanna upset the people at Locke and Co,

285
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,040
 'cause I'm sure their story is completely true,

286
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,320
 but there is a suggestion that maybe

287
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 there's nothing to do with these Thomas and William Bowler

288
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,240
 people, and if you do look at the kind of newspaper archives,

289
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,640
 there was a thing called a bowl hat

290
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,400
 that existed before the Bowler hat,

291
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,120
 and you can see loads of examples of people

292
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,720
 having their bowl hats stolen and stuff like that.

293
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,040
 - So, did the Bowlers exist for the credits?

294
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,720
 - It feels like, no, in fact, they definitely existed.

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,080
 Thomas and William Bowler existed,

296
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,160
 and actually, there was another guy called William Bowler

297
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,640
 who existed before them, who was a famous hat maker.

298
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,840
 So, there were bowlers who were making hats for sure,

299
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,120
 but whether these guys invented the Bowler hat

300
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,600
 and gave the name to it, I'm not so sure.

301
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
 - Yeah. - It's tough and really torn.

302
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,120
 - I'm not gonna walk past Locke's sharp

303
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,920
 in case of odd job hat comes to us, you know, that's.

304
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,640
 - Do you know what they have on Bowler hats?

305
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,080
 The curl at the edge, which I'd actually never noticed

306
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,680
 was a fundamental feature of them.

307
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,880
 - What, on the brim?

308
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,840
 - Yeah, so there's a brim,

309
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,880
 and then it curls very sharply inwards

310
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,600
 at a 40-degree angle, a little bit,

311
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,600
 and it's a dorset curl, and it's named after Alfred Dorsey,

312
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,520
 and this is niche, but he was basically,

313
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,480
 I think he was the Byron of France.

314
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,120
 He was apparently extremely attractive.

315
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,960
 He was the handsomest man of his time,

316
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,040
 and he was mates with Byron, in fact,

317
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,360
 and he, the other time he might have seen him,

318
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,600
 is he's the model for the New Yorker mascot.

319
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,200
 You know if he, you know all the New Yorkers,

320
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,280
 you've got that bloke who's actually not wearing a bowler hat.

321
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,120
 - That's a top hat.

322
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,960
 - That's a top hat.

323
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,960
 He wore a number of different hats, just literally.

324
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,280
 - But that's him, his face is him, is what you're saying.

325
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,760
 - His silhouette is him, yeah.

326
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,600
 - Alfred Monaco?

327
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,560
 - He's got a magnifying glass, I think,

328
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,400
 and maybe a monocle.

329
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,400
 - I think you're thinking of Monopoly.

330
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,600
 - Mr. Monopoly is not exactly anything of that.

331
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,280
 - That was actually based on Keats.

332
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,040
 - Yeah, apparently, according to--

333
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,880
 - Glad we settled that.

334
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,000
 - No, Anna, that's a great knowledge about his dorset curls.

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,760
 - I think let's connect the bowler hat to the New Yorker.

336
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,200
 - Sorry, what was the link?

337
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,040
 He invented the thing on the rim.

338
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,400
 - It was named after him.

339
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,240
 - The curl.

340
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
 - 'Cause he was such a dandy.

341
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,800
 - I guess he was a curly, curly dandy.

342
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,640
 - Wow.

343
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
 - That's really cool.

344
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,640
 - Well, that's really cool as a strong term, but it's--

345
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,040
 - It's probably the one thing I'll remember

346
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,120
 from this podcast.

347
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,360
 - I know, he'll be so annoyed about that.

348
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,040
 - The Susie Dent wrote an amazing book

349
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,440
 about how slang is used amongst different tribes of people,

350
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,440
 so like taxi drivers and dock workers and stuff like that.

351
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,720
 And she mentions in that section

352
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,480
 that Hackney taxi cabs, the height of the cab,

353
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,400
 was based on the bowler hat height for when you're getting in.

354
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,320
 - Yep, sounds a bit dubious, but I think--

355
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,160
 - I don't know what you're saying.

356
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,520
 I didn't say anything.

357
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,680
 All I did was pull a face.

358
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,800
 And the listener didn't notice that.

359
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,160
 - No, but I think that is a room of that sort of out there,

360
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,000
 isn't it?

361
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,120
 - I thought Hackney cabs were sort of for top parts,

362
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
 'cause bowler hats don't really have any height.

363
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,680
 They're the same as a head.

364
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,360
 - That would only add another centimeter or two

365
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,200
 to the height of the cab.

366
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
 - Absolutely, but maybe a necessary extra centimeter.

367
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,600
 It feels like you wouldn't redesign the whole cab.

368
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,960
 - You've got quite a long torso, Andy, don't you?

369
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,200
 Oh, do you have long legs, actually, the short torso?

370
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,520
 - I've got a normal torso.

371
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
 - Oh, sorry.

372
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,520
 - Long, I've got a normal torso, long legs, long neck, short head.

373
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,240
 - Okay, and that's why the Murray cab,

374
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
 it has a lot of legroom, doesn't it?

375
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,480
 - A lot of legroom, and then a very low ceiling, yeah.

376
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
 - Sorry.

377
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,160
 (laughing)

378
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,360
 You know before we were talking about bicons,

379
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,640
 tricons, and unicorns?

380
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 - Yeah.

381
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,400
 - There is a, what I suppose would be a quadricon.

382
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,220
 - No.

383
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,060
 - Cool.

384
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,900
 - And the quadricon is a very--

385
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,800
 - That's too much surprise, Andy, sorry.

386
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 - That's awesome.

387
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,400
 - The idea of a four-corner tat,

388
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,240
 which is not worth that.

389
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
 - You think that's incredible.

390
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
 - Okay.

391
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,080
 - Yeah.

392
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,920
 - It's up there with Alfred Dorsay.

393
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
 - That's the thing I'm going to remember, Anna.

394
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,520
 - I suppose the reason it's interesting

395
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,760
 is because it is related to this fact,

396
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,400
 because it's the traditional hat

397
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,400
 of the Tuwanakan people of Bolivia,

398
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,520
 and that is like a really old culture,

399
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,000
 pre-Columbian culture in Bolivia,

400
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,080
 and they had these very intricately designed

401
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,720
 four-cornered hats that sort of,

402
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,080
 the rich people would wear the intricately designed ones,

403
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,960
 and the poor people were really plain ones,

404
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,900
 but you'd have like birds' heads,

405
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,320
 you would stick on there.

406
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,760
 Some of them had wings attached to them.

407
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,600
 - That's awesome.

408
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,040
 - But that sounds a bit grim.

409
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
 - Yeah.

410
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
 - Like a decapitated bird's head.

411
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,720
 - Maybe.

412
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,960
 - They must have done some kind of,

413
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,000
 you know, put pickled it or something.

414
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,840
 - It was a different time.

415
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,800
 - It's popular back in the day

416
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,240
 to put dead birds and things, wasn't it?

417
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,080
 - Yeah.

418
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,840
 - A full bird, yeah.

419
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,680
 - Not a decap...

420
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
 Okay, gotcha.

421
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,520
 - Not just chopping the head off and sticking it on.

422
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,520
 - The bloodied neck sort of hanging out.

423
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,680
 - I think they wiped that away.

424
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,520
 - Yeah.

425
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,360
 - The birds.

426
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,080
 Is that where we get, like wearing a knotted handkerchief

427
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,720
 on your head at the beach from this tribe?

428
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,920
 - Absolutely not, no.

429
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,240
 (laughing)

430
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,080
 - That would be quite unusual for this culture

431
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,880
 to come back to life having, you know,

432
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,960
 gone out before the Spanish came along

433
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
 and then traveled to 1950s seaside hotels.

434
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,520
 (laughing)

435
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,920
 - That would be unusual.

436
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,600
 - One of the greatest test pilots in America

437
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,720
 for wartime planes was a gorilla

438
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
 wearing a bowler hat, smoking a cigar.

439
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,560
 - Okay.

440
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,400
 - Okay.

441
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,760
 - And what I've done there is tricked you

442
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,920
 because actually, because actually it was a man.

443
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,760
 (laughing)

444
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,840
 - What's your career?

445
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,680
 - Oh, no, I do.

446
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,840
 - Oh, no, I don't allow you to say that.

447
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,560
 This is a guy called Jack Valentine-Willems

448
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,520
 and he was one of the greatest test pilot pilots

449
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,360
 that were out there.

450
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
 And he used to take out planes that weren't ready,

451
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
 that they were, it was advanced technology.

452
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,640
 (laughing)

453
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,480
 - Why would you do that?

454
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,080
 - Well, you know, you got a test pilot,

455
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,920
 he's testing.

456
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,560
 - No, but it is ready, right?

457
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,320
 He's not taking a plane with one wing.

458
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,080
 - No, no, but you're, sorry.

459
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,520
 As in, we don't know the limits

460
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,680
 to which we can push this particular plane.

461
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,000
 So he would push it to places to see if it worked.

462
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,360
 - He just made it sound like he was sneaking

463
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,300
 into the hangar at night.

464
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,140
 - Sorry.

465
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,600
 - No, these are, they were approved flights.

466
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
 And what he used to do is a bit of a practical joker

467
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
 is he used to bring with him a gorilla mask

468
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,000
 and he used to bring a polar hat and a cigar.

469
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,480
 And he would fly up to other processions of planes

470
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,000
 that were flying and he would have that gear on

471
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,260
 and he would wave at the other pilots.

472
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,680
 And I think from what I've read,

473
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,780
 the idea was is that no one would believe anything

474
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,360
 about the plane, let alone the pilot.

475
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,600
 They came and said, I saw a new plane

476
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,720
 and it was being flown by a gorilla

477
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,600
 with a cigar and a polar hat.

478
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,800
 That sounds a bit pushed for me.

479
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,240
 I think actually he was just a practical joker.

480
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,560
 But the idea was he was gonna say,

481
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,360
 no one would believe that pilot existed.

482
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
 Therefore, they might not believe the plane existed.

483
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,600
 That was being tested either.

484
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,920
 - It was interesting that you tried

485
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,160
 his practical joke on us, didn't you?

486
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,320
 'Cause he was trying to make people

487
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,880
 think a gorilla was flying the plane

488
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,800
 and you also kind of made us, no, you didn't.

489
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,620
 - Believed it.

490
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,460
 - Yeah.

491
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,800
 - But it was less dangerous in this context

492
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
 'cause we're just sitting around a table.

493
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
 Whereas I think making a prank

494
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
 out of putting off pilots flying actual planes

495
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,640
 is very responsible.

496
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,400
 Well, they're quite a lot of comical,

497
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,760
 a pilot gets so distracted they fly into a mountain.

498
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,600
 - Oh, yeah.

499
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,440
 - Yeah.

500
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,280
 - Yeah.

501
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,920
 400 deaths were resulted.

502
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,040
 A comical flying into the mountain.

503
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,300
 (laughing)

504
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,440
 - Another death in the army today

505
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,640
 and man, was it funny.

506
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,400
 We close our show with this white-hearted story.

507
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,880
 - I think it was picturing the cartoon version.

508
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,460
 (upbeat music)

509
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,100
 (upbeat music)

510
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:12,940
 - Okay.

511
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,860
 It is time for fact number two and that is James.

512
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,700
 - Okay.

513
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,540
 My fact this week is that there are no animals

514
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,820
 in the only zoo in Kalamazoo.

515
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,860
 (laughing)

516
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,580
 - What a sad lot of children there must be in Kalamazoo.

517
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,420
 - Yeah.

518
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,860
 - Oh, what?

519
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,220
 It sounds great.

520
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,060
 - Does it?

521
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:31,900
 - Oh, yeah.

522
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,740
 - What is there?

523
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,060
 - It's the air zoo.

524
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,900
 - I see.

525
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
 - It's the air zoo and the air zoo is a museum

526
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:40,020
 about aeroplanes which has lots of planes

527
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,780
 that are named after animals.

528
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,620
 - Okay.

529
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,940
 'Cause it does sound like the air zoo is what they've called it

530
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,580
 'cause all the cages are just full of air.

531
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,420
 - Yeah.

532
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,260
 (laughing)

533
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,100
 - It sounds like an air guitar.

534
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,940
 - Yeah.

535
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,780
 - Yeah.

536
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,620
 - You're right.

537
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,460
 It does sound like that,

538
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,100
 but actually it's a really awesome air museum.

539
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,020
 - So planes that are named after animals.

540
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,420
 So I'm thinking immediately,

541
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,220
 I'm thinking the Sopwith Camel.

542
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,060
 - It's probably an animal.

543
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,220
 - I don't know if there is one of those.

544
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,060
 - Okay.

545
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,420
 - All I know is that there's a war hawk,

546
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,820
 a goonie bird, a wild cat, a bear cat and a hell cat.

547
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,020
 - Oh, these are very American animal play names.

548
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,380
 - It's very American.

549
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,740
 Yeah, Kalamazoo is in the north of United States of America.

550
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,580
 - Yeah.

551
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,420
 - Michigan.

552
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,260
 - In Michigan.

553
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,100
 - Yeah.

554
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,940
 - The hell cat.

555
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,780
 - Yeah, it's a very.

556
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,660
 The Sopwith Camel is a very British animal play name.

557
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,500
 (laughing)

558
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,340
 - Okay.

559
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,180
 - Ridiculous.

560
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,580
 - A goonie bird sounds quite British as well.

561
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,660
 - No, I still think that's a bit of an American.

562
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,500
 - Like a goonie bird.

563
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,380
 - You gotta see the goonie bird.

564
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,220
 - Yeah, you do.

565
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,060
 - It could be.

566
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,180
 - I was thinking goon show.

567
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,020
 Yeah.

568
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,380
 - Yeah, yeah.

569
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,220
 - So yeah, and actually on the war hawk,

570
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,740
 sorry you just mentioned that,

571
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,620
 the person who runs this museum who's called Sue Parrish,

572
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,060
 she was one of the last 20 members

573
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,340
 of the women's Air Force service pilots from World War II

574
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,100
 who still flew planes and she flew a bright pink war hawk.

575
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,940
 - That's great.

576
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,780
 - Is she still alive?

577
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,140
 - She was still alive when I read an article

578
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,860
 a few years, it was from a few years ago,

579
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,700
 I couldn't tell whether she died or not.

580
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,980
 - I think she's not, yeah.

581
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,300
 - Yeah, the article actually I read was from the early 90s,

582
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,580
 so she might have died since then.

583
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,660
 - She has, so there's an airport,

584
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,260
 which is Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Airport.

585
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,340
 There's a statue of her.

586
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,180
 - Oh, is that?

587
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,020
 - I believe it's at the airport.

588
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,500
 If it's not the airport, it's someone of the vicinity.

589
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,340
 - I didn't see that.

590
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,500
 - And you can also see her plane,

591
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
 which is, as you said, pink.

592
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,340
 Kind of cool.

593
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,740
 - Do you know why I was pink this airplane?

594
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,900
 - Oh, oh, oh, oh.

595
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,580
 - Yes, because she only flew it

596
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,700
 when it was Red Sky at night,

597
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,180
 which happens to light in the evenings,

598
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,020
 and it was a cauliflower-ish thing.

599
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,820
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,340
 Not far off in fairness, just wrong,

601
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,180
 but not a million miles from.

602
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,260
 - Is it, no, you're right.

603
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,540
 - Dan, please, I've got it.

604
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,940
 She flew only among flocks of flamingos,

605
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,860
 and it was a cauliflower-ish thing.

606
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,940
 - We're getting wrong, guy.

607
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,780
 - Okay.

608
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,100
 - It was because she's a woman,

609
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,180
 a women-like pink thing.

610
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,420
 No, it wasn't, it wasn't.

611
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,260
 - Damn it.

612
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,940
 - It was because it was originally flown in Libya,

613
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,780
 these planes, and the landscape,

614
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,380
 lots of, you know, rocks and sand,

615
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,940
 and quite pink sand and stuff like that.

616
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,540
 And so it just helped to blend into the landscape.

617
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,660
 - Okay, so it's not hot pink?

618
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,060
 - No, it's not hot pink.

619
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,020
 It's not fluorescent.

620
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,300
 It's pink, it is quite pink.

621
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,620
 - It's pretty pink.

622
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,740
 Yeah, it looks awesome.

623
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,140
 And I think that's in the entrance

624
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,700
 when you go into the Arab museum,

625
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,420
 as opposed to the airport.

626
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,460
 - Yeah, and after World War II,

627
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,700
 she wanted to become a commercial pilot,

628
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,540
 but she got rejected in letters saying,

629
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,620
 "With your qualifications, if you were a man,

630
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,580
 "we would have hired you."

631
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,420
 - Oh, well, that's nice consolation, though, isn't it?

632
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,260
 - It's awful, that is.

633
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,540
 - It's the highest praise you can give, really.

634
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,700
 - Yeah, absolutely.

635
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,220
 But yeah, basically I remembered

636
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,700
 that there was a place called Kalamazoo,

637
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,740
 and I Googled to see if there was a zoo there,

638
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,620
 and there isn't, but there is this place.

639
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,140
 - I didn't know anything about Kalamazoo

640
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,620
 before starting to research it.

641
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,860
 Apart from, of course, the Glenn Miller song,

642
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,980
 I've Got a Girl in Kalamazoo in 1942.

643
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,140
 - Put it on the map, internationally, in a way.

644
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,340
 - But it's named as one of those places

645
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,620
 which has a funny name, and no one really knows

646
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,620
 where it is or if it's real, and it's kind of, you know,

647
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,020
 it's lumped in with places like Timbuktu,

648
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,860
 which have an interesting--

649
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,700
 - I wonder why.

650
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,540
 It's like--

651
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,380
 - Exactly.

652
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,420
 - With your writing songs.

653
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,940
 - Exactly, but Kalamazoo, get this.

654
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,980
 I'm only getting in with this fact before you guys all do,

655
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,580
 'cause I know you'll all have it, too,

656
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,780
 was the first place in the world to install dropped curbs.

657
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,020
 (laughing)

658
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,940
 - Is that a curb where you can get like a buggy down,

659
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,260
 you mean, like it goes flat?

660
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,420
 - It's as it sounds.

661
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,780
 The curb has been dropped so that you can,

662
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
 yeah, so you can get a buggy down.

663
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,340
 - That's quite amazing, isn't it?

664
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,180
 - I know.

665
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,100
 - Do they have a blue plaque there?

666
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,940
 They must have.

667
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,580
 - Well, there are lots of claims as to what, you know,

668
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:42,700
 there are other cities which try to steal Kalamazoo's thunder.

669
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,180
 They're all, I think, incorrect.

670
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,100
 I think this was the first city where you had dropped--

671
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,220
 - How deep have you had to dig for this?

672
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,860
 This is a full day's work.

673
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,860
 - There was this veteran from the second of my walk,

674
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,940
 who was Jack Fisher, who was an advocate

675
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,180
 for both veterans and disability rights,

676
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,020
 and he trialed them.

677
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,660
 In America, they're called curb cuts,

678
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,620
 and they were first tried out here.

679
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,460
 - That's incredible.

680
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
 - That's incredible.

681
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,820
 - What year were we talking?

682
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,060
 - I think it was the late '40s or early '50s,

683
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,100
 and there are other places

684
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,340
 which tried them in the early '60s.

685
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,580
 There was another thing in the '60s,

686
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,420
 and I think in America,

687
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,580
 there was some disability activists

688
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,580
 who hacked away at curbs at night

689
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,380
 and laid concrete to smooth their path.

690
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,220
 - That makes sense, yeah.

691
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,060
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,180
 They only did it on a few occasions in a few places,

693
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,900
 but when you say he tested it,

694
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,740
 what's interesting about it

695
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,060
 is it feels it doesn't need testing.

696
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,380
 It feels just logical, right?

697
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,700
 It just doesn't, what do they think might go wrong?

698
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,780
 - Well, I guess it's never been done before,

699
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,740
 and he's just pointing out,

700
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,180
 "Look, this would make it a lot easier

701
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,540
 for lots of people to get around

702
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,060
 if you install these things."

703
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,900
 So they say, "All right, well, we'll install a few."

704
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,300
 And then, obviously, you just see how it works.

705
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,340
 - I mean, things that can go wrong

706
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,020
 is it allows dickheads like me

707
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,740
 to pop your bike up on the pavement

708
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,980
 while you're cycling and really upset pedestrians.

709
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,300
 He didn't think of that, did he?

710
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,620
 - No.

711
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,940
 - He didn't think of that, the idiot.

712
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:56,780
 - I don't know.

713
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,900
 - Same with my car.

714
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,180
 (all laughing)

715
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,220
 - Kalamazoo originally was called Bronson,

716
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,500
 and it was because a guy called Titus Bronson

717
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,340
 was the first white man, basically,

718
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,620
 to arrive there and set up a town there.

719
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,380
 And then, yeah, he turned it into a place

720
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,820
 where the streets were kind of named very obviously

721
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,660
 for the thing that they were operating as.

722
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,660
 So there was Church Street,

723
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,820
 where you'd have three churches on there.

724
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,340
 There was the Academy, which had the college on it.

725
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,420
 There was Jail Street.

726
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,260
 - Jail Street.

727
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,180
 - It makes sense, doesn't it?

728
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,020
 - Yeah, it makes total sense.

729
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,100
 - You know where everything is.

730
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,540
 - I think the church one is weird,

731
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,260
 'cause I know that, so there's a thing in capitalism,

732
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,380
 right, where if you've got a shop

733
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,900
 that sells a certain thing, like baby clothes,

734
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,700
 then you have lots of shops in the same area,

735
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,020
 they cluster, because that works.

736
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,380
 - Like the Curry Mile in Manchester

737
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,980
 with all the Curry houses. - Exactly.

738
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,340
 But churches, you rarely are like,

739
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,620
 well, we've got to fit 10 churches into this county.

740
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,140
 Shall we just put them all on the same street?

741
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,580
 - Yeah, absolutely true.

742
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,700
 - It's interesting.

743
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,180
 - The story goes that Bronson was in Detroit,

744
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,860
 and he walked west into the woods,

745
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,740
 and he kept going until he got out of the woods,

746
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,700
 and this was where Kalamazoo was.

747
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,260
 He walked, it's 140 miles walk

748
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,340
 until he got to any kind of clearing.

749
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,140
 There's this, we're not quite sure why,

750
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,420
 but he definitely left town at one stage.

751
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,700
 Now, he might have left town

752
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,140
 because they changed the name to Kalamazoo,

753
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,300
 or he might have left town

754
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,020
 because he stole a cherry tree.

755
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
 - Yeah.

756
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,700
 - He was run out of town.

757
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,540
 - I love that, the cherry tree.

758
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
 - And there's a few different stories,

759
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,260
 and it's not clear what's what,

760
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,220
 because if you look at contemporary reports,

761
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,340
 neither of them is mentioned.

762
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,100
 But there is a 1909 headline

763
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,220
 from the Detroit Free Press that says,

764
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,180
 "Because of the name of the village he founded

765
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,100
 "was changed to Kalamazoo, Titus Bronson died

766
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,740
 "of a broken heart."

767
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,660
 - Ah.

768
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,500
 - And so when they changed the name,

769
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,140
 apparently it hurt him so much that he died.

770
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,180
 - They have gone by a lot of different names.

771
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,340
 They used to be called the Celery City.

772
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,900
 - What, they grew a lot of celery?

773
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
 - They grew a lot of celery.

774
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,420
 Someone came over and grew celery there.

775
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,460
 Actually it was a Scott, I think, called George,

776
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,300
 apparently George Celery Taylor, he was known as.

777
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,620
 But you know how you never know

778
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,940
 if people were actually called that at the time?

779
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,580
 - Like the bowlers from earlier.

780
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,500
 - Like the bowl?

781
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,500
 - No, that definitely was the name.

782
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,300
 - Yeah, but that could have been like the trade

783
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,860
 that then became the name.

784
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,380
 - No, but they didn't name themselves out of the hats.

785
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,460
 They were, "I'm saying we don't know."

786
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,420
 - "I'm saying we do."

787
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,740
 - Ah, okay, well there we go.

788
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,940
 - One of the reasons that Kalamazoo is mentioned

789
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,900
 in a lot of songs, so you mentioned,

790
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,020
 who do you mention before? - Glenn Miller.

791
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,860
 - Glenn Miller.

792
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,900
 - So Kalamazoo in other songs by Frank Zappa,

793
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,380
 Ben Folds, Johnny Cash, The Black Keys,

794
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,220
 who I know you like.

795
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,060
 I think there's Kalamazoo mentioned in there.

796
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,340
 And I think one of the reasons is

797
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,900
 'cause Gibson guitars were made in Kalamazoo.

798
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,220
 - Yeah.

799
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,060
 - And loads of famous people, Chuck Berry,

800
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,620
 Eric Clapton, Cheryl Crowe, Bob Dylan,

801
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,100
 all people use Gibson guitars.

802
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,060
 And really interesting thing about the Gibsons

803
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,860
 is the Gibson girls.

804
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,500
 Now during World War II,

805
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:52,460
 the Gibson guitar company was still making guitars,

806
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,180
 but the thing was they didn't have anyone

807
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,300
 to make the guitars, right?

808
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,100
 Because all the men had gone to war.

809
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,420
 So what they did was they brought in all the local women

810
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,020
 to make these guitars, but they denied making them.

811
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,420
 And the reason being that they thought that,

812
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,300
 one, if we told people we're making guitars during the war,

813
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,940
 people would think we're being really frivolous

814
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,780
 and we shouldn't be doing this kind of thing.

815
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,380
 But secondly, they weren't sure

816
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,940
 whether people would buy guitars

817
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,540
 if they knew they were made by women.

818
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,380
 - Right.

819
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,580
 - So they sold them as what they called new old stock.

820
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,300
 So they pretended that these were old guitars

821
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,500
 that they had in stock and they were selling during the war.

822
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,780
 We're not making them during the war,

823
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,620
 but actually all these women were doing all the work.

824
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,220
 And they also sometimes said

825
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,580
 that they were made by seasoned craftsmen

826
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,980
 who were too old for war.

827
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,820
 - Yeah, right.

828
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,660
 - Right.

829
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,500
 - Wow.

830
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
 - I mean, not brilliant, obviously.

831
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,180
 Sorry.

832
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,000
 - It's good, Mark.

833
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,820
 You can appreciate the marketing.

834
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,660
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

835
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,380
 - Did the women who were making them

836
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,140
 leave any kind of clues as to the fact they,

837
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,700
 like, inside, did they write?

838
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,020
 - Drop a tampon into the body of the guitar.

839
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,580
 (all laughing)

840
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,660
 - Use tampons and just rattling around in there.

841
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

842
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,860
 - That was the key to their individual sound, actually.

843
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,260
 (all laughing)

844
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,820
 - Just a couple more things on Kalamazoo.

845
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,060
 Notable person from there.

846
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,700
 William Shakespeare.

847
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,060
 Junior.

848
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,900
 And what I did there was trick you to make you think.

849
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,020
 - It was actually a gorilla.

850
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,900
 - It's actually a gorilla.

851
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,260
 - He's William Shakespeare Junior.

852
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,780
 He was an inventor, quite a notable inventor there.

853
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,460
 So he was around in the 1800s,

854
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,020
 and he invented what's known as the Shakespeare fishing tackle,

855
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,940
 which is a really big thing that's still used today.

856
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,780
 Do you know it?

857
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,100
 - No, I'm just trying to think of the pun.

858
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,620
 (all laughing)

859
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,700
 - Me too, me too.

860
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,300
 (all laughing)

861
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,700
 Yeah, so yeah, fishing tackle, lots of innovations

862
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,900
 of that sort.

863
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,860
 He had patents for camera equipment and so on.

864
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,620
 - Cast, casting, now.

865
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,180
 - Oh yeah.

866
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,300
 You can say whatever you want now for the next five minutes.

867
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,660
 - Yeah, well I'm trying to debate, it's not working.

868
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,620
 - Okay, no, I'll join now.

869
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,620
 Anna, you take over.

870
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,460
 - Anyway, let's scale.

871
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,180
 - God, astonishing, you run through his plays.

872
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,660
 There are almost no fish puns.

873
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,660
 - It's bad, isn't it?

874
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

875
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,980
 - Amidst some nice brim.

876
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,820
 - Very good.

877
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,660
 - Nice, there you go.

878
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,500
 - There you go.

879
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,340
 - Thank God.

880
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,180
 - Can we move on?

881
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,020
 Is that, is that?

882
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,860
 - No.

883
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,700
 - I get we're still doing it.

884
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,100
 (laughing)

885
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,380
 - God, Andy.

886
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,740
 - Macro Beth.

887
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,580
 - No.

888
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,400
 - No, that's nice, that's great.

889
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,240
 - That's good, that's good.

890
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,900
 - Yeah, we'll take it.

891
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,980
 - Yeah.

892
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,460
 As you pike it.

893
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,780
 - Oh, very nice.

894
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,980
 - Lovely, I'll tell you off, you guys all got one.

895
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,820
 (laughing)

896
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,900
 - All right, if you have one at home,

897
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,500
 then why not send it to Andrew Hunter M?

898
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,740
 (laughing)

899
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,320
 (upbeat music)

900
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,140
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three

901
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,580
 and that is Andy.

902
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,660
 - My fact is that some American gravestones

903
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,100
 feature recipes.

904
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,940
 - Hmm.

905
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,920
 - Yummy, yummy.

906
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,140
 - I've had to cook the human below it?

907
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,980
 - Yes.

908
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,340
 (laughing)

909
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,060
 - This is a thing that happens sometimes in the States.

910
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,260
 The original wording of the fact was,

911
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,580
 lots of American gravestones contain recipes

912
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,940
 and it was pointed out that they're about 11 so far.

913
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,780
 (laughing)

914
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,860
 There was a query over whether that's technically lots

915
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,060
 or not, which is fair.

916
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:11,140
 But there are people who have made it their hobby

917
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,860
 to track down all gravestones which feature recipes

918
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,220
 and bake 'em up.

919
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,300
 And it's especially big on places like TikTok.

920
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,460
 There are lots of grave people on TikTok

921
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,780
 and they're nicknamed Tapophiles,

922
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,940
 which is people who love graves and cemeteries and--

923
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,500
 - Is that what, it's on TikTok?

924
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,660
 'Cause I haven't been on TikTok.

925
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,500
 I didn't realize it was that.

926
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,900
 I thought it was like dancing and stuff.

927
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,860
 - It's not all of TikTok.

928
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,780
 Yeah, there's a lot, again,

929
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,740
 when I say lots of people on TikTok do it,

930
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,980
 some people on TikTok do it.

931
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,820
 (laughing)

932
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,260
 It's more effort than filming it or dance.

933
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,100
 But it's not really interesting.

934
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,340
 - Well, I like TikTok Tapophiles.

935
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,500
 It's a nice elicitation, isn't it, worth becoming one?

936
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,340
 - Yeah.

937
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,620
 These grave recipes, some of them date back decades

938
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,260
 or further than that.

939
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,980
 - I just thought TikTok, it's like,

940
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,020
 what do you call that thing that reminds you of death?

941
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,900
 - The pendulum, the reaper.

942
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
 - Oh, Memento Mori.

943
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,140
 - Memento Mori, isn't it?

944
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:06,140
 So whenever you think about TikTok--

945
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,140
 - TikTok.

946
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,220
 - Is it very morbid place TikTok?

947
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,180
 Is it one big Memento Mori?

948
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,020
 - It's just thinking about the number of seconds

949
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,860
 you have left.

950
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,500
 - Yeah, the number of seconds you spent watching this, crap.

951
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,020
 (laughing)

952
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,860
 Yeah.

953
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,700
 - Wow, so--

954
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,540
 - Yeah, so people are doing it on making up the recipes

955
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,740
 and then showing them on their TikTok videos, right?

956
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,700
 - Yeah, people are going around doing that.

957
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,980
 - Any examples?

958
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,740
 - Well, there's a lovely Fudge recipe.

959
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,580
 There is blueberry pie.

960
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,060
 There's yeast cake.

961
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,300
 - But it doesn't always work.

962
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,900
 Sometimes there was one gravestone

963
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,500
 which had a typo in the recipe on it.

964
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,340
 - Oh, no.

965
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,140
 - I know, and it would have made very runny fudge

966
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,260
 if you made it according to that.

967
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,100
 But thankfully--

968
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,940
 - What was the typo?

969
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,380
 I want to know what typo is that makes runny fudge.

970
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,060
 - It was too much vanilla.

971
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,900
 - Oh, really?

972
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,100
 - But it's a tablespoon as opposed to a teaspoon,

973
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,940
 I believe was the--

974
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,020
 - That's not gonna make it that runny.

975
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,220
 Is it just, that's not much difference.

976
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,820
 Like it's not like a kilogram versus a gram.

977
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,020
 'Cause you don't put much vanilla in a Fudge recipe.

978
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,140
 It's just a tiny amount.

979
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,980
 - Well, that's why.

980
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,260
 Because if you do a tablespoon,

981
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,980
 apparently it turns out vapor.

982
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,820
 Anyway, they corrected the entire gravestone

983
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,020
 off the back of that, which is a relief.

984
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,260
 - Why would you, yeah.

985
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,180
 Trying to look out why you would do it.

986
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,380
 - Do what, put a recipe on?

987
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
 - Yeah.

988
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,060
 - Well, people like to be creative

989
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,900
 on their gravestones, right?

990
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
 It's a really fun thing.

991
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,780
 And passing down your great recipe, I think.

992
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,740
 - I think that's what it is.

993
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,180
 I think it's something that matters to you,

994
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,900
 something that's traditional,

995
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,660
 something that a recipe you might have inherited

996
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,820
 from the generation above you.

997
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,660
 I see it.

998
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,980
 - People like to pass on recipes

999
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,340
 to the next generation, don't they?

1000
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,180
 And what about a place?

1001
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,140
 - I guess it's very little you can pass on.

1002
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,380
 You could pass on like a series of dance moves.

1003
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,300
 I'm trying to think of something else.

1004
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,700
 You might pass on to the next generation.

1005
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,220
 But you're right, recipes are probably it.

1006
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,220
 - Dance moves.

1007
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,900
 On your grave is encouraging people to dance on your grave.

1008
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,460
 - You could have a set of those footprint outlines.

1009
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,060
 - Like they have in Japan.

1010
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,740
 I was thinking like, you know those games

1011
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,980
 that you play in Japan where you can dance.

1012
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,620
 - What were they like up?

1014
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,460
 - Well, I was just thinking,

1015
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,780
 I'd like mine to be kind of like that MOLWAKA game.

1016
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,380
 So you put a coin into the grave

1017
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,100
 and then my head pops out from one other side.

1018
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,140
 You gotta slam it with a hammer.

1019
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,660
 Then my arm comes out another and then my leg.

1020
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,220
 - It'd be so annoying if you're one of those people

1021
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,060
 who wasn't actually dead

1022
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,740
 and tries to escape from your grave.

1023
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:23,940
 But it's been constantly malleted down.

1024
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,780
 - You guys don't, seriously.

1025
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,540
 (laughing)

1026
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,380
 - But I think it's great.

1027
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,460
 I mean, there are so many gravestones around the world

1028
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,860
 where people as their sort of like last wish

1029
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,300
 have said, can you make this happen?

1030
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,060
 And people do and they're beautiful.

1031
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,020
 And I'd read a great one.

1032
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:40,260
 There was a 99 year old woman who in Mexico,

1033
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,300
 her dying wish was for her gravestone

1034
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,700
 to be made according to what she loved most in life.

1035
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,580
 And so she got it.

1036
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,580
 It was a 600 pound, five foot tall penis.

1037
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,340
 Just a giant penis.

1038
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,140
 - What she loved in life, a five foot penis.

1039
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,180
 - She loved calling people dicks in life, apparently.

1040
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,100
 And that's what she asked for.

1041
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,220
 And I've seen the video of them unveiling it.

1042
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,860
 It looks like it's got a giant condom over the top of it,

1043
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,020
 which is then removed.

1044
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,100
 It's a huge pink penis, like five foot five.

1045
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,420
 - But unfortunately, if you're in Libya,

1046
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,260
 you couldn't see it.

1047
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,940
 (laughing)

1048
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,220
 - The testicles, apparently,

1049
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,420
 they really had a lot of problem with

1050
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,060
 because the ball sack apparently kept just disfiguring

1051
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,300
 during the melting process of the actual materials,

1052
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,660
 which was, I believe, plastic.

1053
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,620
 And so they had to like build the testicles

1054
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,460
 quite a few times.

1055
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,820
 And they're big balls when you see it.

1056
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,700
 So it's sort of standing up.

1057
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,540
 - Right.

1058
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,740
 - Anyway, is this, is it a churchyard

1059
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,620
 or a cemetery surrounded by other?

1060
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,980
 I can imagine being slightly annoyed

1061
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,180
 if I had the grave next door.

1062
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,460
 - Totally, absolutely.

1063
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,500
 - By that time, it can't be annoyed.

1064
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,820
 - No, it's true.

1065
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,780
 - I know you're an easily annoyed person, Andy,

1066
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,460
 but I reckon that after death,

1067
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,380
 you're not going to be under there going.

1068
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,340
 (laughing)

1069
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,180
 - He will.

1070
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,740
 - If I can, I will.

1071
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,280
 That's what it's going to say on his tombstone.

1072
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,220
 (laughing)

1073
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,860
 - I'm so with you, though.

1074
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,580
 If I was a relative of someone who'd been buried next to that,

1075
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,380
 I would find that so irritating.

1076
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,460
 - But this is what happens a lot in the UK.

1077
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,500
 Certainly, so many graves are the traditional,

1078
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,540
 whether it's slate or, you know,

1079
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:16,460
 it's normally, it's grazed stone and it's carved

1080
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,020
 and it's all down to the individual church

1081
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,780
 or individual local authority.

1082
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,700
 And so there's this mad, you know,

1083
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,780
 if you want something out of the ordinary,

1084
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,780
 you might get it approved, but you really might not.

1085
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,020
 Like shape-wise, like a big penis.

1086
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,300
 - Shape-wise and colour-wise,

1087
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,660
 and there are rules about what you can and can't carve,

1088
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,340
 but there's no one authority in the UK

1089
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,420
 which tells you what you can't get.

1090
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,260
 - It feels like we shouldn't have that.

1091
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:40,260
 And it does feel reasonable to say no penises.

1092
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,100
 - Yeah.

1093
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,940
 - I don't know.

1094
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,220
 - I agree, I agree, definitely.

1095
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,260
 - Well, on that and gravestones,

1096
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,540
 there's an amazing cemetery in Paris,

1097
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,180
 the Peer-Lachaise Cemetery,

1098
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,820
 and it's got loads of good graves in it.

1099
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,820
 But one of them's the grave of Victor Noir,

1100
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,500
 who was a 19th century journalist.

1101
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,460
 And he wasn't that famous in his lifetime.

1102
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,100
 I think he was shot by Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew in 1870.

1103
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,940
 - Wow.

1104
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,900
 - And loads of people suddenly went to his funeral

1105
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,020
 because it became this kind of political cause.

1106
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,820
 But for some reason, we don't know why.

1107
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,660
 His effigy, so on his gravestone,

1108
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,220
 there's a big bronze effigy of him lying down.

1109
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,460
 It has a bulge in his crotch.

1110
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,300
 - Oh, yeah.

1111
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:20,340
 - It's quite tight trousers, lovely big penis bulge.

1112
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,100
 And what's so rank about it is that it's a bit like,

1113
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,820
 you know, there's Grave Fry's Bobby and Edinburgh,

1114
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,980
 a famous dog statue,

1115
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,540
 and everyone always rubs its nose for luck.

1116
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,820
 So that's really shiny.

1117
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,380
 And in the same way, everyone keeps rubbing and mounting

1118
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,220
 and writhing against this crotch.

1119
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,980
 So it's incredibly shiny.

1120
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,740
 And not only that, it's not just the crotch,

1121
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,460
 but his lips and nose.

1122
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,300
 - Well, the kiss is lit.

1123
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,260
 Yeah, the kiss is lit.

1124
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,220
 - I know, do they do to his nose?

1125
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,100
 (laughing)

1126
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,940
 But what?

1127
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,220
 I mean, that's, cause that's not just rubbing.

1128
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,500
 They've mounted fully.

1129
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,340
 - Yeah, yeah.

1130
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,180
 So it's a fertility thing.

1131
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,020
 You go and you do that if you want to get pregnant.

1132
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,860
 - People say that, but it's not.

1133
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,300
 It's people going for a joke.

1134
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,460
 Everyone's like, this is 20th century.

1135
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,140
 This is people going to France and going.

1136
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,380
 - It's for Instagram, isn't it?

1137
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,220
 That's great.

1138
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,940
 There is a sign that says any damage caused by graffiti

1139
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,340
 or in decent rubbing will be prosecuted.

1140
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,180
 - Oh.

1141
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,340
 - It's just there.

1142
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,780
 - It's all in decent rubbing.

1143
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,620
 (laughing)

1144
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,460
 - What's decent rubbing?

1145
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,980
 Yeah, that's actually a better question, yeah.

1146
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,220
 - But I always think with these,

1147
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,500
 they would be the best place for like a zombie apocalypse

1148
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,340
 to start where there's loads of famous people.

1149
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,400
 - Oh, that would be great.

1150
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,860
 - Or like Westminster Abbey.

1151
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,900
 That's where you want your zombie apocalypse to start,

1152
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,740
 isn't it?

1153
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,720
 Where all the famous people are buried.

1154
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,100
 - I think Jim Morrison is in the one

1155
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,300
 you were just talking about as well, I believe.

1156
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,140
 That's really good.

1157
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,980
 - 'Cause that's a good mix.

1158
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,060
 Westminster Abbey is all a bit like Royals and Nobles,

1159
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,900
 isn't it?

1160
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,740
 But if you went to this one,

1161
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,460
 you get rock stars, you get authors, you get weirdos.

1162
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,300
 - The doors to hell have opened.

1163
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,660
 - Yes, yes, more like that.

1164
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,900
 - You've redeemed yourself.

1165
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,060
 Fish gate is forgotten.

1166
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,300
 (laughing)

1167
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,740
 - Speaking as we were earlier of people doing

1168
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,240
 inappropriate things in graveyards.

1169
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,920
 Do you guys know about the bustuary?

1170
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,480
 They were sex workers in Rome in the first century AD

1171
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,080
 and they plied their trade in cemeteries.

1172
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,360
 - Oh, naughty.

1173
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,720
 - Yeah, so in the daytime, they were professional mourners.

1174
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,160
 But in the nighttime, they were sex workers

1175
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,080
 and they would write on the gravestones

1176
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,400
 what the prices and stuff like that.

1177
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,240
 (laughing)

1178
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,680
 - They used them like phone boxes.

1179
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,100
 - A little bit, yeah, and people would go

1180
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,380
 and they had very pale skin and severe expressions

1181
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,460
 and they were kind of quite gothic

1182
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,180
 looking in and of themselves.

1183
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,580
 There was one called Noctina who would sleep on the graves

1184
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,540
 and cover her eyes with coins

1185
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,780
 and then they were also prostitutes.

1186
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,860
 - That feels like she's encouraging

1187
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,060
 some worrying kinks though.

1188
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,900
 - I'm afraid that there was some of that.

1189
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,420
 If you read Marshall, juvenile and catalyst,

1190
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,940
 all talk about it and apparently there was some of this.

1191
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,940
 - Bloody hell.

1192
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,160
 - The fact that they're professional mourners

1193
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,560
 in the daytime, you know, that's sort of,

1194
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,640
 and then at night time, basically,

1195
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,400
 the morning garb comes off and they're saucy.

1196
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,640
 - And then in the morning, the morning garb goes back on.

1197
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,400
 - Oh yeah, they had this weird thing in Roman tombs

1198
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,600
 which were called libation tubes.

1199
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,440
 Have you heard of this?

1200
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,280
 - No.

1201
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,040
 - This is so cool, these are terracotta tubes

1202
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,760
 that go down into the grave from ground double

1203
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,840
 and they're deliberately so you can give the dead a drink.

1204
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,040
 - Yeah, that's so sad.

1205
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,460
 - You go to mine into them.

1206
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,620
 - Yeah, it was just a pipeline right down

1207
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,460
 to the mouth of the dead.

1208
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,820
 - Was that different to the sausage one?

1209
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,660
 The sausage pipe?

1210
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,900
 I don't remember the sausage pipe.

1211
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,740
 - Yeah, we did talk about that.

1212
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:33,780
 - That's rigged such a fake though.

1213
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,620
 - Yeah.

1214
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,460
 - Was there a sausage pipe?

1215
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,740
 - John Bondison wrote about it and buried alive.

1216
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:39,180
 - Yeah, there was a, I think the idea was

1217
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,340
 if you were buried alive, you had a string that you pulled

1218
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,140
 and it would ring a bell and they would come and get you

1219
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,340
 and say, "We're coming to get you out,

1220
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,740
 but here have a sausage until then."

1221
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,220
 And they would pop a sausage in the sausage pipe

1222
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,680
 so he had some sustenance while they were.

1223
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,520
 - A cooked sausage.

1224
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,880
 - It doesn't say I assume a cooked sausage.

1225
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,720
 - I must be.

1226
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,760
 - You don't want to give them food poisoning while they're down.

1227
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,860
 - Tragic, he died of botulism

1228
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,000
 while we were getting the spade.

1229
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,880
 A fast-acting lethal sausage.

1230
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:08,040
 - You know, PETA, the animal rights organization,

1231
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,280
 they did a thing a few years ago.

1232
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,120
 They bought a tombstone in a cemetery

1233
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,120
 for one of their colleagues.

1234
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,520
 It was called Matt Prescott.

1235
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,180
 But it was, they bought a tombstone in a very specific place.

1236
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,820
 They bought it right near Colonel Sanders.

1237
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,460
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1238
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,580
 - And it had a message on it.

1239
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,860
 It was a little poem that they'd written

1240
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,460
 for their colleague, Matt.

1241
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,140
 And it was an acrostic.

1242
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,300
 And the first letter of every line spelled out the phrase,

1243
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,000
 KFC tortures birds.

1244
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,840
 - Wow.

1245
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,060
 - I know.

1246
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,580
 - My favorite gravestone is an acrostic.

1247
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,420
 - Oh.

1248
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,260
 - It's awesome.

1249
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:48,580
 It's for a guy called John René, R-E-N-I-E.

1250
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,520
 René or René.

1251
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,720
 And what it says on it is it says here lies John René.

1252
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,720
 But then it says it basically 45,760 times in total

1253
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,040
 because it's an acrostic that goes 19 squares across

1254
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,120
 and 15 squares down.

1255
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,440
 And everywhere you start reading it,

1256
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,160
 you can make here lies John René along this box of it.

1257
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,000
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

1258
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,040
 - And the total that you can add it up to is, yeah, 45,000.

1259
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,820
 So it's like the second line, it reads,

1260
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,700
 here lies John René.

1261
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,620
 Like that.

1262
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,460
 - Kind of thing, yeah.

1263
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,300
 - And then the next one is slightly different.

1264
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,140
 The next one is slightly different.

1265
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,300
 So you can read it down diagonally.

1266
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,140
 - Exactly.

1267
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,500
 - Like the world's most boring word search.

1268
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
 - Yes.

1269
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,180
 - But just great.

1270
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,180
 Such an, it's an amazing thing to look at.

1271
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,980
 - Oh, the guy who first formulated pi to 35 places

1272
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,140
 was a German mathematician called Ludolf van Sirlen.

1273
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,140
 And his gravestone reads 3.14159-265-3589-7932.

1274
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:53,040
 - Amazing.

1275
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,780
 - I don't know why I start if it isn't a recipe for pi.

1276
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,020
 (laughing)

1277
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:06,640
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show.

1278
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,760
 And that is my fact.

1279
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,400
 My fact this week is that doctors used to prepare

1280
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,320
 their patients for surgery by either getting them

1281
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,380
 really drunk or smacking them on the head with a mallet

1282
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,140
 and hoping they didn't kill them.

1283
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,980
 (laughing)

1284
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,060
 That's back in the day.

1285
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,900
 So.

1286
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,420
 - When are we to which day?

1287
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,780
 - Back in the day.

1288
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,580
 - This is in the 1800s.

1289
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,540
 This was in the top floor

1290
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,860
 of America's oldest surgical ampy theater as it's known.

1291
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,980
 This is in the Pennsylvania hospital.

1292
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:39,060
 And I guess what's so surprising is how late in the day

1293
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,900
 this was happening.

1294
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,340
 This is in the sort of mid 1800s.

1295
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,360
 - It's not, mid 1800s was when we had,

1296
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,040
 we, I take a lot of credit,

1297
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,760
 but we had got like some aether chloroform stuff

1298
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,600
 was starting to happen.

1299
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,900
 - And a lot of them weren't fully accepted though.

1300
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,080
 So this, it definitely was around at this time.

1301
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,380
 But this hospital was like, not into it.

1302
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,880
 We'd rather hit you on the head.

1303
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,000
 - Happened in Britain as well.

1304
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,860
 There was a guy called Henry Hill Hickman

1305
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,960
 who used to try suffocation to get his ovations.

1306
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,720
 (laughing)

1307
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,440
 - Yeah, so this was a thing.

1308
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,560
 And, you know, the drunkenness hopefully would see them

1309
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,320
 through an operation as would such a massive hit

1310
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,160
 on the head.

1311
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
 - Some of these operations were very quick, weren't they?

1312
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,880
 They were amputations and stuff.

1313
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,840
 And they were trying to do them

1314
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,480
 in the matter of seconds.

1315
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,500
 - In fact, that seems to be the most effective method

1316
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,660
 of pain killing up until, you know,

1317
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,340
 they found ether and stuff was just speed.

1318
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,680
 And there was, we talked about it.

1319
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,520
 - The drug.

1320
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,360
 - QI.

1321
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,200
 (laughing)

1322
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,040
 - You love it.

1323
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,300
 - Just getting incredibly anxious before your friction.

1324
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,620
 - Yeah, I was, yeah, doing it within a short amount of time.

1325
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,820
 And we've mentioned Robert Liston on QI,

1326
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,100
 but his, he was a famous 19th century surgeon

1327
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:49,140
 and his catchphrase was, "Time me, gentlemen, time me."

1328
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,340
 And there's a huge amount of showmanship

1329
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,140
 to his surgical performances.

1330
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,540
 - It's a good catchphrase, that.

1331
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,900
 - It's a good catchphrase.

1332
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,580
 And it would kind of reassure you.

1333
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,420
 If you're having your leg cut off,

1334
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,780
 you want it to be quick.

1335
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,340
 And he used to brag he could amputate a leg in 25 seconds.

1336
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,420
 - Wow.

1337
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,300
 - And his chances of dying,

1338
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,180
 'cause he gets a lot of stick these days

1339
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,100
 for being all about the show and that's about the safety.

1340
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,380
 But you only had a one in six chance of dying,

1341
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,700
 which was quite good for surgeons then.

1342
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,340
 And there was one great, the best story about him,

1343
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,700
 which I'm pretty sure we looked at when we did QI

1344
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:23,460
 and is probably not true,

1345
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,300
 but it was reported that he once was so focused

1346
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,940
 on doing something incredibly fast

1347
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,580
 that he's amputating a limb.

1348
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,980
 And he accidentally at the same time cut through

1349
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,020
 his associate nurse's finger on the way.

1350
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,180
 And so both the person whose limb was amputated

1351
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,860
 and the person whose finger he amputated died

1352
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,180
 pretty quickly afterwards.

1353
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,420
 And also someone who was watching died of shock.

1354
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,500
 And it's always recorded as the only operation

1355
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,420
 with a 300% mortality rate.

1356
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,580
 - Yeah, wow, great story.

1357
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,580
 - It's a strong story.

1358
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,380
 - Don't check it ever.

1359
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,900
 That's a comical ending.

1360
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,620
 Like an airplane going into a mountain.

1361
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,460
 That's comical surgery.

1362
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,700
 - That's comedy, you're right.

1363
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,100
 That's, yeah.

1364
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,980
 - Just on the sort of reputation of surgery back in the day.

1365
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,820
 - Yeah.

1366
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,860
 - And this is a fact actually got sent in to us

1367
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:10,940
 from Sarah on Twitter.

1368
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,020
 So thank you, Sarah.

1369
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,580
 It was about the operating theater in Aberdeen.

1370
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,060
 And there used to be above the door

1371
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,700
 to the operating theater in Aberdeen,

1372
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,380
 the words, "Prepare to meet thy God."

1373
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,220
 - Ooh.

1374
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,180
 - Which is, oh, this is such an uncharable thing to read.

1375
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,020
 - Wow.

1376
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:27,860
 - And it was all about this surgeon

1377
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,620
 called Alexander Ogston who worked there

1378
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,300
 and he discovered Staphylococcus,

1379
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,620
 which is a very big--

1380
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,900
 - Common bacteria for getting like--

1381
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,060
 - Infections and abscesses and all of that.

1382
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,420
 Really dangerous staphylococcus.

1383
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,180
 And he was so inspired by antiseptic zeal

1384
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,140
 that he returned and he pulled the sign down

1385
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,860
 and burned it on one occasion.

1386
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:47,700
 - Wow.

1387
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,540
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1388
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,380
 - Wow.

1389
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,380
 - It was a very, very religious place

1390
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,220
 to have your operation.

1391
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,060
 - I can imagine.

1392
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,700
 So the one that I was talking about in Pennsylvania,

1393
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,100
 the surgery itself had a sky roof basically.

1394
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,620
 So there was a dome at the top and it was glass.

1395
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,820
 So they would do all the operations in the day

1396
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,700
 and natural light was what was giving them--

1397
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:05,540
 - That's good.

1398
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,380
 - The light, yeah.

1399
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,220
 - Lovely.

1400
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,700
 - But I'm afraid the surgeons will take off their robes

1401
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,820
 and show you a good time, yeah, yeah.

1402
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,900
 - They would write their prices on the patient's spleen.

1403
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,860
 And they did have anesthetics before then,

1404
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,940
 various types throughout the world.

1405
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,140
 A Chinese physician called Huatuo,

1406
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,340
 I'm sure I'm pronouncing that wrong.

1407
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,580
 Apologies if I am.

1408
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,260
 But from 140 AD to 208 AD.

1409
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,180
 This guy, he would use something called mafeisan,

1410
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,620
 which is cannabis boil pounder.

1411
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,660
 So he gave it to the patient.

1412
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:45,300
 And apparently it was so good,

1413
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,740
 there was a guy called General Kuanyu

1414
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,340
 and he was wounded by a poison arrow

1415
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,780
 and he was sort of given some surgery

1416
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,620
 to try and bring the arrow out and clean the wound.

1417
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,660
 And the general played chess while his bone

1418
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,900
 was being scraped clean.

1419
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,460
 'Cause his concoction was so good.

1420
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,020
 - But did he win the game?

1421
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,660
 (laughing)

1422
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,220
 - He just kept whacking the pieces

1423
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,620
 after he was in a selfish pain, no.

1424
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,340
 - Yeah, we still don't know how they work.

1425
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:12,700
 - Yeah, crazy, yeah.

1426
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,420
 - I find there's so much momentum,

1427
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,020
 we don't know how or why it works.

1428
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,300
 It's just, we kept trying and this one stuck.

1429
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,100
 I mean, it's people speculate that,

1430
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,140
 this is general anesthetic, so what puts you to sleep.

1431
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,740
 Speculator that it dissolves some of the fat

1432
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,100
 in your brain cells, so stops the cells activity.

1433
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,900
 There's just been a study that found out

1434
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,260
 that one particular anesthetic

1435
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,900
 maybe weakens the transmission of signal,

1436
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,420
 electrical signals between your neurons

1437
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,580
 in like the higher functioning parts of your brain.

1438
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,780
 So that's why it will knock you unconscious,

1439
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,260
 but it won't stop you breathing

1440
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,980
 'cause the lower functioning parts can still keep going.

1441
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,620
 But yeah, it's so weird that we don't,

1442
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,220
 we just accept it works.

1443
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,860
 But I like, before another anesthetic.

1444
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,140
 I don't know how my microwave works.

1445
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,380
 - But someone does.

1446
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:03,300
 - Yeah, that's true.

1447
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,980
 - Sorry, when I say we, I don't just mean

1448
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,500
 we couldn't be asked to research it.

1449
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,780
 I mean, even the scientists

1450
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,660
 can't be asked to find out properly.

1451
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,260
 But another ancient way of anesthetizing people

1452
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,580
 was electric rays.

1453
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,580
 - These, the eels. - Yeah, yeah.

1454
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,940
 So these were used in ancient Rome.

1455
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,380
 It was like torpedo fish,

1456
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,420
 I think we've talked about before,

1457
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,700
 could give you a real electric shock.

1458
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,260
 And it was treatment for gout,

1459
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,780
 or it was if you wanted to numb an area

1460
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,500
 and you needed to do something to it.

1461
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,020
 It was recommended that you stand on the shore

1462
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:36,860
 and you let your legs be washed by the sea

1463
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,740
 as various electric rays

1464
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,500
 wrapped themselves around it

1465
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,180
 and wait for them to electrify you.

1466
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,820
 - If you were just stood in the sea,

1467
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,100
 you would need to bring them to you, right?

1468
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,140
 They wouldn't just naturally sting you.

1469
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,300
 - Yeah, how are you attracting them?

1470
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,820
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1471
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,740
 - Yeah, maybe you drop some food for them.

1472
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,140
 No, wait, are you the food?

1473
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,500
 - You are kind of, you can maybe cut your legs

1474
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,580
 so there's a bit of blood in the water.

1475
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,420
 - Yeah, nice.

1476
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,180
 Then awful if the shark comes before the eels.

1477
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,980
 And then she's holding up to take it.

1478
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,460
 - Yeah, it's not convenient though.

1479
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,260
 So they quickly, they would shock you,

1480
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:11,180
 you would go numb, they would carry you out, and then.

1481
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,940
 - And then they can do a treatment on you

1482
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,460
 like cut off a bunion. - Like cut off your legs.

1483
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,780
 - Or bunion, all that for a bunion, my God.

1484
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,380
 Jesus.

1485
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:22,540
 You know how in the very first episode of this podcast

1486
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,860
 we talked about, anyone remember?

1487
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,420
 - We talked, yeah, President Garfield's.

1488
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,380
 - President Garfield's Anus.

1489
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,740
 So I have a related fact to this.

1490
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,260
 - I think you should quickly explain that

1491
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,380
 for anyone who can't remember 460 episodes ago.

1492
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,460
 - So this is the fact that for the last,

1493
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,460
 was it month of his life?

1494
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,300
 - Three months, I believe.

1495
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,140
 - Three months.

1496
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:43,300
 President Garfield ate everything through his Anus

1497
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:44,980
 and that's because he'd been shot

1498
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,500
 and he wasn't able to eat through the mouth

1499
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,620
 and so he was fed through the bump.

1500
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:54,620
 So the American president usually hands over power

1501
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,060
 when...

1502
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:56,900
 - Yes, he does.

1503
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,340
 But in Donald Trump's case...

1504
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,500
 (laughing)

1505
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,340
 You're so right, Donald Trump is the outlier here.

1506
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,180
 - Is he?

1507
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, James, that's exactly right.

1508
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,900
 So, okay, normally when the US president,

1509
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,660
 always a man so far, has a colonoscopy,

1510
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,900
 which is a procedure, and you're a bit older,

1511
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,300
 they put a camera up your bum

1512
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,140
 and they just check what's going on.

1513
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,860
 Normally a small camera on a little wire,

1514
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:22,780
 not like a big long lens paparazzi camera.

1515
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,900
 And it's a very common thing.

1516
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,660
 So Joe Biden did it in 2021,

1517
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,820
 handed over to Kamala Harris for the,

1518
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,140
 you know, half an hour, a couple of hours of the anesthetic.

1519
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,740
 George Bush had it twice

1520
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,340
 and both times handed over briefly to Dick Cheney.

1521
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,660
 There was a report a year or so ago

1522
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,700
 that Donald Trump underwent this procedure,

1523
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,340
 but he refused to have the anesthetic

1524
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,900
 because he didn't want to hand over to Mike Pence,

1525
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,700
 however briefly, the reigns of office.

1526
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,180
 So he just sort of bear-backed it.

1527
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,060
 One chance, I thought they had,

1528
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,100
 "Silence, Donald Trump, for a couple of blissful hours."

1529
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,660
 That's really interesting.

1530
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,300
 I've got another thing about putting stuff up the bum,

1531
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,860
 if you want to hear it.

1532
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,060
 So this is about the first woman physician

1533
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,740
 to specialize in anesthesia, who's called Isabella Herb.

1534
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,220
 And she was the first person to use ethylene

1535
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,380
 as a general anesthetic.

1536
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,180
 And there were two main ways

1537
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,260
 that she'd get you out of the anesthesia state.

1538
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,060
 One of them was to give you strychnine,

1539
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,060
 which would apparently help, presumably not that much.

1540
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:28,980
 And the other one was the installation

1541
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,180
 of warm saline solutions to the rectum.

1542
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,540
 Installation.

1543
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,860
 So if you were under because of this ethylene,

1544
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,380
 then she would squirt some salty water up your bum

1545
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:41,060
 and it would get you out of the...

1546
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,900
 Sounds kind of pleasant,

1547
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,820
 although is that not the thing that makes you wait yourself?

1548
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,180
 No, that's fingering then.

1549
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:47,660
 I think that's putting your hand in a bowl of water,

1550
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,820
 it does not squirt.

1551
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,100
 I bet if you put your bum in it, though, something happens.

1552
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,580
 The interesting thing about ethylene

1553
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:59,580
 and a problem that she had was that it does explode quite easily.

1554
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:04,060
 And so what she did was, she had her operating theatre

1555
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,820
 and they had very, very high humidity

1556
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,260
 because apparently that helped you

1557
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:09,900
 'cause there's slightly less oxygen in the air,

1558
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,980
 so less likely to explode.

1559
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,860
 But also because it was an early time

1560
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,180
 of having electric lights and stuff like that,

1561
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,620
 they grounded everything in the building.

1562
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,380
 So the table where the person was being operated on.

1563
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,380
 And in fact, everyone kind of had things attached to them.

1564
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,900
 Do you remember we talked about this big spike

1565
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,140
 that people had on their heads?

1566
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,900
 Yeah, everyone had electrical conductors

1567
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,580
 to conduct the charge orders.

1568
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,860
 Basically, everyone was wearing these wires to

1569
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,620
 and they attached to the pipes around the room,

1570
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:39,820
 the water pipes,

1571
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:42,060
 so that if there was any kind of spark in there,

1572
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,620
 instead of setting off the ethylene,

1573
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,020
 it would go into these grounded things

1574
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,580
 and then go down into the building.

1575
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:48,420
 Isn't that amazing?

1576
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,460
 That's really cool.

1577
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,860
 Isn't that so cool as well?

1578
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,700
 What a great name.

1579
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:53,180
 Imagine, you know when you fill in the forms

1580
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,500
 before you do an operation where you say,

1581
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,060
 "I understand that I might blah, blah, and blah, blah."

1582
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,100
 Imagine just that,

1583
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,620
 "Well, I understand there's a 30% chance I'll explode."

1584
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,540
 Yeah, yeah, I know what you're thinking about.

1585
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,700
 Just on doctors sort of beating patients around us,

1586
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,860
 this mallet people did in the fact.

1587
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,180
 August Beer was the person who came up

1588
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,900
 with the first spinal anesthesia.

1589
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,980
 That was in the 1890s, 1898.

1590
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:18,620
 And so that was injecting cocaine into your spinal cord,

1591
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:20,380
 was the first spinal anesthesia.

1592
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,580
 And he wanted to work out

1593
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:24,780
 how much you really needed to inject

1594
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,500
 because if you injected too much, had bad side effects.

1595
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,260
 And so he thought, "Okay, well, I'm gonna test out on myself."

1596
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,540
 And so he asked his assistant, also called August,

1597
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,900
 to inject him.

1598
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,820
 (laughing)

1599
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,820
 - Funnily must have heard.

1600
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,660
 (laughing)

1601
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,500
 - To August.

1602
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,860
 I mean, a very non-August time.

1603
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,260
 And so his assistant injected his spine.

1604
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:45,700
 Sadly, his spinal fluid started leaking out

1605
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,980
 quite drastically and so they had to stop.

1606
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,860
 So he said, "Do you mind if we swap?"

1607
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,500
 So the August swapped.

1608
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,620
 And his assistant said, "Okay, you try it on me."

1609
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,300
 So August, the assistant, lies there.

1610
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,580
 And August Beer jabs him with the cocaine

1611
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,440
 and then tests how high his pain threshold is.

1612
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,900
 And the account is just incredible.

1613
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,020
 So he starts by tickling his feet.

1614
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,980
 Quite pleasant, couldn't feel anything.

1615
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,860
 And then he jabbed a large blunt needle into his thigh

1616
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,420
 and then he got a larger blunter needle

1617
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,020
 and put it in down his femur, apparently.

1618
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,260
 He then, and he's awake through this process

1619
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:25,100
 'cause it's local anaesthetic.

1620
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:27,740
 So he's chatting away and having a great time.

1621
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,220
 He got sharp forceps and crushed his skin up.

1622
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,300
 He burned a cigar out on him.

1623
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,860
 He yanked all his pubic hair off.

1624
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,700
 (laughing)

1625
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,740
 - That was just for fun, wasn't it?

1626
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,540
 - Yeah, he'd asked for a wax

1627
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,380
 and you might as well two birds one stone.

1628
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:46,620
 (laughing)

1629
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,460
 He actually yanked his pubic hair off

1630
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,380
 and then did the chest hair for comparison.

1631
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:52,220
 - Really?

1632
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,340
 - Just to say, see, it would hurt if, you know,

1633
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,380
 if you weren't anesthetized.

1634
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,220
 - Wow, wow, wow.

1635
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,340
 - Hit his shin with a hammer, squeezed his testicles very hard.

1636
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,180
 And--

1637
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,020
 - Squeeze his testicles, oh my God.

1638
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,420
 - So look how impressive is that?

1639
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,300
 - I think he compressed his testicles

1640
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,180
 between two plates, didn't he?

1641
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,460
 And then just kept squeezing, squeezing, squeezing.

1642
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,300
 - Did he?

1643
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:12,060
 - I'd remember all the media about this, yeah.

1644
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,740
 - Well, they had a big feast afterwards

1645
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,020
 so maybe they ate all the testicle plates.

1646
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,180
 (laughing)

1647
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,180
 - Oh my God, so afterwards, was it just broken?

1648
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,900
 - How did you, how did that go for you?

1649
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,240
 - Oh, it's absolutely fine.

1650
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,620
 (laughing)

1651
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,860
 - He was a bit bruised as it wore off.

1652
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:32,820
 But he was, they had, they wind and dine and cigar together

1653
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,660
 and--

1654
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,520
 - Cigar, I wouldn't let cigars anyone see me after that.

1655
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,740
 - Some people wake up in the middle

1656
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,740
 of a general anaesthetic and it sounds awful.

1657
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,320
 The good thing is you almost always forget afterwards.

1658
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,300
 So I spoke to someone who carries out anaesthesia

1659
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,300
 quite regularly and says sometimes patients

1660
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:55,580
 get chatty during procedures

1661
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,140
 and you can just tell them to shut up

1662
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:58,860
 and be really rude to them 'cause they won't remember

1663
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,380
 after the operation, you know?

1664
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,540
 One patient had been going on and on about their job,

1665
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,820
 I think at NatWest and how interesting it was

1666
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,380
 and they just had to say, look, to shut up, please.

1667
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,420
 - That's so funny because when I last had

1668
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,740
 general anaesthesia, I thought I'll just have a chat

1669
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,900
 'cause I've not met an anaesthesia expert before

1670
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,460
 and I just started chatting to him and then went under

1671
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,100
 and now I'm realizing that as soon as I went under

1672
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,780
 he's like, you barry bastard.

1673
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:22,860
 (laughing)

1674
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,220
 - You work up with no pews, right?

1675
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:27,380
 (laughing)

1676
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,380
 Yeah, so normally you don't remember it

1677
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,960
 but sometimes you do remember it and you can't move

1678
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,180
 because the drugs are paralyzing you.

1679
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,420
 That sounds like the worst thing in the world

1680
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,380
 because you wake up, you know what's going on

1681
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,580
 and you can't do anything about it.

1682
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,180
 - And all you can hear is the anesthetist going,

1683
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,860
 ah, I shagged your mum, yeah.

1684
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:46,600
 (laughing)

1685
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,940
 - Fenella woke up after she had surgery

1686
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:50,340
 where she went under general anaesthetic

1687
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:52,580
 and she woke up and was quite tired

1688
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,620
 and they didn't realize that she was awake.

1689
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,900
 This is post-surgery, they were moving her away

1690
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,980
 and all she heard was a conversation

1691
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,900
 about how much the doctors enjoyed no such thing as a fish.

1692
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,260
 (laughing)

1693
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,740
 - The worst possible nightmare.

1694
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:08,020
 She was like, ah, Christ.

1695
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,480
 - I would put you back under.

1696
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:11,740
 (laughing)

1697
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,320
 (upbeat music)

1698
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,740
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.
