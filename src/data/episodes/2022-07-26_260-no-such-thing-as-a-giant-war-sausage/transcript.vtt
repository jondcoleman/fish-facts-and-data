WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 Hi everyone, before we start this week's show, we want to remind you that we're going

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.320
 on tour.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320
 We are.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.620
 We are, in fact, currently on tour.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.620
 Actually, yeah.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.520
 We're playing the Hammersmith tonight, I think.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.080
 As this goes out, we're backstage at the Hammersmith Apollo.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 We are indeed.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.800
 And you're probably too late to catch that show, but you can definitely catch one of the

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.800
 others we're doing.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.800
 So where are we going?

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.520
 We are going up to Newcastle, going to Sulford, back down to Norwich Birmingham, a number

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520
 of other places.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.760
 Edinburgh, Sheffield, Dublin, Brighton and Oxford.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.720
 There are the other places in an unbelievable order in which we go from one part of the country

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 to the other part with really no thought put into it whatsoever.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.840
 Yep, that is why we have called our tour in no particular order.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.080
 It's mainly about our travel arrangements, but it's a super fun show.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.600
 So we have a first half that we've written where we each do a little bit full of interesting

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 facts.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.920
 And then the second half we record a podcast.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.600
 We always have such a good time and we'd love to see you there.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.360
 And if you are from Europe, if you're from Gothenburg, Stockholm, Oslo, Amsterdam, Groningen,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.480
 either Copenhagen or Antwerp, or indeed one of a couple of very large cities in Northern

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 Europe that we haven't announced yet, then you can also get tickets and you can get those

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.280
 by going to qi.com/fishevents.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 That is right.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 qi.com/fishevents.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.880
 Get tickets for any of those shows.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 Please do come along.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.880
 We'd love to see you there.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.480
 OK, I'm with the podcast.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:34.120
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.440
 week coming to you live from Aberdeen.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.240
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.680
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and James Harkin.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.760
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.040
 the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:07.120
 My fact is that 15 years after it was invented, the US government banned sliced bread.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.280
 Why did they ban it?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.040
 It was too good, no, it was, it was 1943, it was a very bad time actually, it was a famously

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:24.920
 bad time, it was a time of war and it's not an audio book.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.320
 So it was done with machines as it still is, sliced bread and it was, the machines were

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320
 very expensive.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.400
 So if you didn't pretty slice it, it was a way to keep the prices of bread down because

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.120
 the US never had bread rationing but lots of nations did.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.000
 But the price had been going up everywhere, hadn't it, because of the war.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Exactly, yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.520
 And then you'd use like the metal for aeroplanes and staff, then you'd use all the materials.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.520
 Exactly, yeah.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520
 Right.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.600
 The bread for missiles.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600
 Yeah.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 You know when you put it in your mouth and you look it and it's like a little torpedo, yeah,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
 like that.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.600
 Well.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600
 They know.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600
 They know.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.400
 Okay, we'll bread torpedoes aside.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.720
 It was a serious, like you could be fined a thousand dollars if you used sliced bread or

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720
 if you sold it.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.240
 So a baker could be fined.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.640
 Yeah, not if you were a sandwich.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 No.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.720
 But couldn't you just slice it on your own?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 You were still allowed to slice it on your own.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 You didn't have to shove the whole loaf of your face.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.600
 Which time would it be for the walk?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.720
 You know, it also happened in Britain actually in wartime.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.040
 So I was looking at this.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.840
 And it's not very well reported, but if you go into the old British newspaper archive and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.120
 you type in sliced bread, the main things that come up are people being arrested throughout

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.280
 the UK for slicing bread, not at home, but in shops and stuff.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.000
 So it was from 1941 and I actually found an article from 1949 where it was still illegal.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.240
 I think it was Liverpool for someone who was arrested for slicing bread still.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
 Really?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240
 Yeah.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240
 People were really annoyed though.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 I mean, the band didn't last long.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240
 No.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.240
 It lasted in America only.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.240
 What? A year or maybe less than a year?

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.760
 When the law first came in and the newspapers, which were all written by men, they were complaining

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.960
 that housewives would not know how to cut bread.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.280
 And so they were giving the best kind of ideas of how to cut bread that they could do, which

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.800
 was keep your head down, keep your eye on the loaf, and don't bear down, which is basically

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.480
 how to play golf.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.080
 Oh.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.240
 And then about two or three months later, when the band stopped, the headline in the New

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:38.040
 York Times was, "Slice bread put back on sale, housewives thumbs safe again."

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.160
 The way that slice bread was packaged back then was that they shove hat pins through the

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.960
 slices in order to keep them together.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.680
 And that was actually how housewives did that before he invented the machine as well.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.080
 He'd chuck a hat pin in in slice bread and it doesn't fall apart.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.760
 Yeah, it came with instructions, like an IKEA cabinet.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.840
 Like you were given instructions for how to unwrap it to take the pins out, remove your

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.880
 bread, stick the pin back in, because the idea was no one wanted slice bread, because psychologically

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.880
 they were told that a loaf of slice bread would go stale much quicker.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880
 So he had to get around that.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.040
 And also scientifically, it goes stale much quicker.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.040
 But...

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.640
 That's mostly a psychological thing.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640
 No, it was...

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120
 If slices fall apart from each other, then you've got that exposed surface area that's

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.920
 going to be more vulnerable to stale-ness.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
 Yes.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920
 Yeah.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.560
 And we love facts on this podcast, so.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:40.360
 Some more bread laws from history, so until the 24th of September 2008, it was illegal in

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.440
 the UK to sell a loaf of bread, which wasn't 400 grams or 800 grams in weight.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.440
 Really?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.440
 Yeah.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.440
 And then the Europeans changed the law and then we could have any kind of slice bread.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440
 We can have...

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.640
 We can have 500 grams or 600 grams or whatever we want.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.520
 Oh, I can't wait 'til those days are over.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.360
 (audience laughing)

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.080
 - The paralysis of choice in the bakery aisle.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.720
 - Well, when this happened, Jonathan Robertson,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.320
 who owns Robertson's bread,

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.360
 he said that, "Now we can sell 600 gram bread,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.280
 "which we think will be fantastically popular."

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.320
 Okay, and I went on to a card, though,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.880
 and looked at the most popular breads that they sell.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.320
 And they are 800 grams, 800 grams, 800 grams, 800 grams,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.080
 400 grams, 800 grams, 400 grams, 400 grams, 400 grams,

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 400 grams, 500 grams, 500 grams.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.560
 But that's gluten-free, so it doesn't really count.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.480
 (audience laughing)

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.640
 800, 400, it just goes all in on.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.360
 And a 600 gram loaf is the 42nd most popular breads

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.960
 that they sell. - Wow.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.760
 I found another bread law, French bread law.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.400
 So until 2015, bakers in Paris were not all allowed

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.000
 to go on their summer holidays at the same time.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.160
 So half of them had to stay open in July,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.680
 and half of them had to stay open in August,

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.600
 'cause lots of people go on their holidays,

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.400
 it's really big in France and especially Paris.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.720
 And if you broke the rules, you were fine.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.680
 Every single day, you went on holiday

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.520
 when you weren't allowed to as a baker.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520
 - Wow. - Wow.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520
 - That's what the name's not lasted until.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.520
 - Oh, yeah. - It's actually cool.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.520
 - Do you know why mechanized bread making

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.520
 came into fashion?

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.080
 So slice bread was all about getting machines

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.960
 involved in the bread process.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.560
 And now, I guess the artisan hipsters of the world

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.200
 think that you want handmade bread

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.600
 and the slice stuff is rubbish.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.840
 But the turn of the 20th century,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.120
 it was terrible to be handmade,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.000
 because being a baker was so sweaty.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.280
 So this is one of the main arguments was that,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.840
 if you were a baker who sweated so much,

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.440
 there was this woman called Eliza Action,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.640
 who was arguing for mechanizing and adding machines

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.360
 of the bread making process in the 1840s.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.200
 And she was saying that the problem is that,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.840
 due to the muscular effort that the baker's body

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.600
 has to make, it's overflowing with perspiration,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.640
 which falls in large drops and is amalgamated

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.440
 with the dough he is kneading and becomes a part of the life.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.960
 - They cut that out of a great British bake-off domain.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.160
 (audience laughing)

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.360
 But yeah, the first machine made bread

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.360
 as its main advertising slogans would say,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.120
 untouched by human hands.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.600
 The idea was that no human should get in there,

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.280
 it was just machines.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.840
 - France has an online baguette booking service.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.400
 So you can buy--

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.760
 - I suppose if anyone was going to have it

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.440
 France would, exactly.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.480
 - So it was started by a burgundy man who was annoyed,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.640
 'cause the shop... - That wasn't the color of him, was it?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.480
 (audience laughing)

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.040
 - He was so angry. - He was angry.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.880
 - Yeah.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.680
 He was annoyed, 'cause the shop kept not having any fresh bread

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.880
 when he got there, 'cause he got up very late.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.920
 And he said, "I have two passions in life,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.720
 "getting up late and fresh bread."

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.160
 (audience laughing)

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:44.480
 He read this poll, which said,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.480
 the result of the poll was that 92% of French people

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.080
 said they were terrified by the thought of not having

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.000
 fresh bread with a meal.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.320
 So he set up a thing where you can just go online

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.200
 and reserve a baguette in your local Boulangerie.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.440
 - Wow. - And then you're gonna pick it up.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.720
 - That's terrifying, hey.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.760
 (audience laughing)

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.280
 - And I wanted it in farewell in the war, I mean.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.960
 (audience laughing)

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.400
 - So in Turkey and Egypt, if you made bread which was too light,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.320
 so it wasn't like 400 grams or whatever it had to be,

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.080
 you could be punished by having your ear nailed

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.920
 to the doorpost of your shop.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.880
 - Oh. - You'd have to try really hard to style that out,

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.680
 wouldn't you, pretend to be leaning against the doorpost

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.880
 of your shop all day.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880
 (audience laughing)

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.120
 - Good morning.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.720
 Good morning, Mr. Jones.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.960
 Just having a lean.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.760
 (audience laughing)

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.480
 - Just one more tiny thing, like another wartime ban

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.440
 for the same reason, sausages were banned in Germany,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.080
 which was a horrible moment, but this was in the First World War,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.160
 and this was to make airships.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.160
 So Zeppelin's.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.480
 - Very tiny, tiny airships.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.480
 (audience laughing)

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.120
 - They were little ants in them, and they sent them to invade.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.280
 No, it was the best kind of material.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.960
 So the sort of sheep's intestine that is needed to wrap sausages

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.720
 is the best kind of airtight material to make airships out of,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.440
 and the Zeppelin was gonna be the great war weapon of the future,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.520
 and sausages were banned because all of that cow intestine,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.800
 sheep intestine had to go towards making airships,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.720
 and they actually used to put that kind as agents used to be sent

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.520
 to butchers across the land to guard them

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.880
 and make sure that all of their sausages were being sent to the M.O.D.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.720
 - Yeah.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.560
 - Really?

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.400
 - Yeah.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.160
 - But they weren't going in and sneakily buying sausages,

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.080
 and then hustling them back to add to the giant sausage,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.800
 giant war sausage that they were expecting.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.560
 - No, what they were doing.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.880
 They were sending all giant war sausage.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.760
 They were firing at the enemy.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.600
 (audience laughing)

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.440
 - I don't know.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.480
 - We smashed the giant war sausage.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.560
 (audience laughing)

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.000
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.160
 - Okay, my fact this week is that a common problem for ice hockey players

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.600
 is that they have such mussely bums

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.480
 that they can't find jeans that fit.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 (audience laughing)

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.920
 - Why do they have such mussely bums?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.600
 - Well, 'cause they're athletes, then.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.160
 - But why do they specifically ice hockey players?

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.680
 Is it that, I guess they're just doing a lot of moving side to side?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.520
 - I don't know.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.360
 - I'm not an ice hockey person myself, but I--

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.120
 - You have to squat.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.320
 - You have to squat, guys.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.160
 - How you have to--

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.800
 - Yeah, that's just good advice in life.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.480
 You have to squat.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.320
 - Always squat.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.160
 - Don't stand up straight.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.320
 - So they do lots of turns and stuff, and so it's the glutes

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.600
 and it's the quadriceps that get much bigger than the rest of their body.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.760
 And this was an article in ESPN, and there was a guy from the Edmonton Oilers,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.960
 the captain's called Conor McDavid, and he said,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.000
 "Can it be hard for me to find pants?"

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.640
 Yes, always.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.320
 The waist, you need to get around your thighs and butt,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.320
 but that doesn't always match how tall you are.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.720
 I definitely have a hard time finding jeans of fit.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.040
 And they went through a whole load of hockey players and asked them all,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.080
 and they all have exactly the same problem.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.000
 They can't get jeans of fit them.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.120
 But they have, they have like personal tailors.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.400
 There's a guy who looks after over 250 hockey players,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.760
 goes round, measuring their butts, and then...

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.240
 - Sure, he does, yeah.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.960
 - And they never have from him again.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.600
 (laughter)

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.560
 - There's also a company, isn't they, called Lululemon,

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:15.800
 or Lululemon, if you're from the continent.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.240
 And they mark it a line of trousers that are for hockey players.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.360
 There's, for what's called the hockey butt,

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.080
 and they specifically design their pants for hockey players so they can play in them.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.760
 - Yeah, another company called Gong Show.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.560
 They do the same thing, just, you know, in case people think

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.040
 there won't be an advertised by Lulule,

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.440
 whatever they call it. - Lululemon, Lululemon.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.040
 And Gong shows, they have like stretchy jeans,

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.480
 spandex in the jeans, and their biggest pair of jeans

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.560
 is called the quadrisaurus.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.920
 - Nice. - Nice.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.760
 - Very good. You know, you can get stronger muscles,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.120
 just by thinking about doing exercise, even if you do not tense your muscles.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.680
 - Wow. - So, you have to just imagine...

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.440
 - I'm thinking about squatting right now.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.480
 - Imagine contracting those muscles as vividly as you can, really picture it.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:12.360
 - And the muscles don't get bigger. They don't grow larger, but they do get stronger.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:17.000
 So you end up using more of the fibers in individual muscles just by thinking about it.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.680
 So not actually just sitting and tensing where you are, but just imagining tensing.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.800
 - The glutes are very important.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.280
 And I think people will think about the gluteus maximus as being the last muscle

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.280
 that's the most important.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.600
 But I've been reading a lot about the gluteus medius,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.760
 which a lot of people say causes a vast majority of injuries

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.200
 for sports people, is it's in the gluteus medius, which is the muscle that's in the middle

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.040
 between the maximus and the minimus.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.920
 And what that does is quite cool.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.760
 That's what basically stops you from falling over as far as I can tell.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.080
 So when you take a step, I'd never thought about this,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.880
 but when you lift up your leg to step forward, if you were a plastic doll,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.320
 then as soon as that doll's leg lifts up, they just fall over.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:01.440
 And the only reason you don't fall over is because your gluteus medius is counterbalancing that.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.560
 And so that's super important because otherwise you topple over.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.520
 And there's a special thing that is called a trendle and burg gate.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.680
 And that shows that you've got a weak gluteus medius, and that's the supermodel walk.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.800
 So that's, you know, when you walk and you overcompensate by kind of wiggling your hips a lot.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.720
 Oh, sure do.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720
 Yeah.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720
 Well.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.280
 But you don't know what I'm overcompensating for.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.800
 I think everyone here knows.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:37.640
 When you do that supermodel gate, that's to overcompensate with the fact that your gluteus medius is weak.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.040
 And so you have to lean your weight on the opposite side that's not lifting its leg up.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.680
 Otherwise, you'd fall over.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.520
 That's a very important muscle.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.560
 Do you know, you soon, they've been testing this out.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.040
 But soon we might become, when so muscles, if they get damaged, often get replaced.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:58.200
 But the problem is you can't put new muscle in because the living cells don't quite react.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:05.960
 So we might all soon be made up of onions, because onions are being tested and seen to be, it's true.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.400
 In, in, in, this is onion transplants.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.640
 This is what they're talking about.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:20.240
 So you can take, if you take the skin of an onion or like a little bit of an onion and you get rid of all the water, dehydrated, it acts very much like a muscle.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.880
 It contracts and it moves and so on.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:28.480
 And they've been putting electrodes into it and seeing how it responds to, basically, being worked out.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000
 And it works perfectly like a muscle.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:41.480
 So they're suggesting that what we should be doing in the future is implanting our muscles with onions instead and be more vegetable-based as humans.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.480
 I'm so sorry, your husband's a vegetable.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.560
 Look inside, he's doing weights, finishing everything in the air.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.200
 Did you know that we, most of us, have a claw retractor muscle?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.720
 Oh, a claw retractor.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.680
 A claw retractor?

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.320
 Like a wolfery, might have.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.640
 Yes, exactly. Does he retract his claws?

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.120
 Yes, he's a wolf. Great.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.000
 Erm, it's more of a hard-and-metallos colour set implanted by the military.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.760
 OK.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.440
 You've got the reference too much.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:18.360
 Erm, look, so the claw retractor muscle, officially called the Palmaras Longus, is something that about 85% of people still have.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:25.280
 And you can tell whether or not you have it, and it's the muscle that now cats, for instance, use to retract their claws when they're pulling their claws and when they're not using them.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.840
 It's very important for primates when they're climbing trees, but we don't really use it anymore.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.800
 And 15% of people are missing it.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:40.680
 And the way you can tell is you can clench your fist or you touch your thumb against your fourth or fifth finger and sort of pull your hand inward towards your elbow.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:46.600
 And if you can see the bits sticking up there in this tendon, in the wrist, in the inner wrist, that means you've got it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.120
 You've got 15% of people don't have it.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.960
 But other 15% of people don't have it more evolved, because you don't need it.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.440
 Exactly. So if you don't have it, well done.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.440
 I can't believe you're still using your Palmaras Longus.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.840
 Yeah, you've got a huge one. I'm afraid you're very backward. You've got seven.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.120
 But I didn't know this. And some people have double ones. Like, I've got a double one.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.200
 Some people have just one long line, one long tendon, and I didn't realise some people don't have that.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:17.560
 There is a muscle which we've got, which is around your ear, and it's another leftover muscle.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.640
 But if you can wiggle your ears, some people can do that. And if you're just shaking your head, you're not going to do it.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:26.600
 I can't cry, I'll be shaking my head because I can't do it.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.840
 That's true. I mean, I'm more or less involved. Don't tell me it's less involved again.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:39.800
 I think it means you're more evolved, actually, yeah. So if you can wiggle your ears, you have a limited amount of control over these muscles.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.120
 But they're left over from a time, and this is many hundreds of thousands of years ago,

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.560
 when we could prick up our ears to locate the origin of a sound.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.960
 Wow. So the muscles are still there, and they still respond to sound today,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.520
 but they're not strong enough to move your ear into position, but they are there still.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:02.360
 Poor things, so they're just sitting there saying, I can hear a noise, but they can't have any impact on your body.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.880
 Yeah. That's tragic.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:13.000
 I have a few facts on Bums. Yeah, oh, great. Sorry, two enthusiastic.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.240
 Someone's ears pricked up.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:24.840
 A Cillenadon is a little shrew. It's found in Cuba and in Hispaniola and around there.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.440
 I demand the Queen Republic and stuff like that.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.520
 Females give birth to three offspring, but only two survive because she only has two nipples,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.840
 and both nipples are on her bum.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.600
 No way.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.360
 So in the Cillenadon world, if anyone asks, are you a bumman or a boobman, the answer is yes.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.280
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:54.360
 My fact this week is that when it was playing on Broadway, Bill Murray went to see the musical

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.520
 Groundhog Day. Then the next day, he went again.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.320
 And then the next day, no, he didn't do it. But yeah, Bill Murray was seen.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.480
 So I really, really threw a lot of people because the paparazzi were like, Bill Murray is coming tonight.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.920
 The cast and crew knew who he was coming, and then there he was again, the next night.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.360
 He went on the first night with the original writer of the show, which is called Danny Rubin,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.200
 and he went with a friend of his, sorry, a relative, his brother.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.960
 And then when he saw it, it was done in such a way.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.720
 So the music and the lyrics are by Tim mentioned, who's a very deep thinker.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.840
 And he basically saw what he wanted the movie to be, something that was steeped in philosophy,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.760
 very different to the movie, which turned out to be an all-out comedy.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.560
 And he fell in love with it, and he loved it so much. He said, I've got to come back.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.480
 So he went the second night on his own because he just wanted to experience it properly again.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.440
 Really? Yeah, he did go there.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.360
 He did go there. But he was erratic as hell. He was climbing over audience members.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.640
 He was tipping people, thousands of dollars. He does do that, doesn't he?

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:01.320
 Yeah, he liked to get to the bar. He climbed back over a bunch of seats rather than go the normal way.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.200
 But he did, I think, he cried at the end of the first performance because he was very moved by it.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.680
 Or because he knew he was going to have to go back the next day.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.120
 I've got to see this joke through.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.240
 I've been looking up Broadway shows, which closed quickly.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.520
 And there are some incredible ones that have opened.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.360
 And so there was the most famous...

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.840
 We should say, the grandel day closed quite fast on Broadway, despite Bermurri liking it, no one else did.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.480
 And despite having a plot about something that runs forever and ever and ever.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.160
 The irony.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.640
 Yeah. So there was one in 1983, which was called Moose Murders,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.120
 and it was meant to be a kind of fast and a funny show.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.880
 And it lasted one night into its proper run.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.280
 Although we are on the first night of our tour, so we can't criticize.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.240
 But the right one is a guy called Arthur Bicknell.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.920
 And the reviews included things like, "If your name is Arthur Bicknell, or anything like it, change it."

00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.520
 And after one performance, the writer Arthur Bicknell, he saw a woman on the street,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.040
 shout to a New York cop. Officer, arrest that show!

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:10.200
 You know, another big Broadway disaster was they converted...

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:16.280
 They turned the novel, and I think movie, "Carrie," the Stephen King book, into a musical.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:24.280
 And it closed after five shows. It was said to be the most expensive flop in all of Broadway history.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.800
 It was open in 1988, and the New York Times compared it to the Hindenburg disaster.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.120
 Yeah, favorably, or...

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:37.080
 It was just like a massive sausage burning up in this guy.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.240
 Have you heard of what the sequel, kind of, the sequel to Oliver?

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.000
 So after Lionel Bart, wrote Oliver, exclamation mark, you know,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.200
 the "extreme thing." It was the next one, Oliver, question mark.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.360
 It was twang with two exclamation marks, and it was a burless Robin Hood show.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.880
 And he lost all his money on it.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:03.960
 Oh, no, he lost all the money he'd gained and earned through Oliver, because it was such a flop.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:09.640
 It's because Oliver, it's funny Lionel Bart, isn't it, because Oliver's my favourite musical,

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.760
 my favourite thing maybe. It's so good, but it does have an exclamation mark at the end of it, Oliver.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:18.200
 And you think, "Oh, gosh, that's a bit tacky, wonder why you did that?"

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:23.080
 And I think he thought maybe the success was due to the exclamation mark, I'll try to next time.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.720
 My problem with Oliver was no twist.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.880
 It's like you didn't know what you were coming to.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:37.160
 I wrote a really good ask, cool. I was just looking into a Broadway and Broadway shows and what it's like.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:41.640
 But in Broadway, they have this way of practice, and they're can sort of applaud more readily, maybe,

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.120
 than it's habitual here, especially tonight.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:50.280
 And it's too late now.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.640
 I'll also go and complain about this, because they will applaud when a celebrity comes on stage,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.320
 and a lot of shows now have a famous person in them. So he said, for instance,

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.920
 Paul Rodd was in, Paul Rodd, who was in France, who's a famous actor, was in a show recently,

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.920
 and his opening scene was, he had to shoot two characters dead.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.680
 But they have to pause for the audience to pause, so he walked on stage, shot a character,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.000
 and had to leave a massive pause while the audience all applauded before he could shoot his other character

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.600
 in this guy, Max XC.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.320
 Was the other guy running around looking for a way out of the room?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.560
 Morning, his dead friend.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.800
 Stage manager in the wings, pushing him back on.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.960
 And directors have actually started to try and circumvent this.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:36.920
 And so they started having lead actors, for instance, speaking offstage, starting their lines off stage,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.080
 so that you're sort of in the scene before the audience applaud, so they feel worse about applauding.

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.760
 Or sometimes they come on with a mask on, more often now, the relief celebrities.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.240
 In 2011, Ben Stiller was in a show called In the House of Blue Leaves,

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.680
 and he was positioned to start with his back to the audience, so they wouldn't know,

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.480
 so people couldn't gratuitously applaud when they saw him.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.480
 But people recognized his silhouette from his back, and started screaming and applauding,

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.840
 and awarding him a standing ovation, according to Mark Lawson, before he even turned around.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.040
 So yeah, different practice.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.640
 Can I pick you up on something you just said before?

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.720
 Did you say Paul Rodd from France?

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.320
 Paul Rodd, you know, massive blockbusters, like Ant-Man, famous for a clueless.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.240
 And what was he in friends?

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.480
 I think friends is a big thing, isn't it?

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.400
 Paul Rodd.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.880
 He was in more of friends than those other things he'd mentioned.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.920
 That's him, okay.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.120
 He was Phoebe's husband.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.320
 We don't need to get into it now.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.800
 In 2018, the first British performance of the show Titanic, The Musical,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.560
 was stopped after the ship hit the iceberg,

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.280
 and Pluster started falling onto the stage.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:43.560
 It was genuinely stopped due to a health and safety.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.760
 You know, before the Wizard of Oz movie,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.320
 Balm wrote The Musical of The Wizard of Oz for Broadway.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.400
 So there were 60 songs to it, and it was very different to what we now know.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.640
 Yes, 60 songs in this musical.

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.320
 And it's too far too bad, isn't it?

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.120
 The Wicked Witch of the West was not in it.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:08.120
 Missing all together, it took her out.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.240
 Well, the character wasn't in it.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.600
 Yeah, the character was taken away.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.120
 There was a different villain.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.160
 The cowardly lion was a very small role in it,

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.280
 and Toto was replaced with a cow called Imogen.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:24.920
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Chazinski.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.080
 My fact this week is that there is only one confirmed male,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.560
 yanksy, giant, soft shell turtle left in the world,

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:34.760
 and his penis is broken.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.480
 [laughter]

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.880
 This is actually a bit of a disaster.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.640
 This guy is in China.

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.000
 There are four of these yanksy, soft shell turtles in the world.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.920
 Two of them are in a zoo in China.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.400
 Two of them are in separate lakes in Vietnam.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.760
 I think they're in drops with each other.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.400
 They won't speak.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.160
 So we don't know what sex they are.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.960
 But in China, one's female, one's male,

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.600
 and they're obviously endangered, because they're only four of them.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.360
 And they've been trying to make them for ages,

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.360
 but they can't, because his penis is damaged.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.400
 And it got damaged a while ago.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.440
 So he's quite old.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.280
 They lived a very long time, and almost 30 years ago,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.440
 he was introduced to a female turtle to mate with her,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.000
 so they could make the species continue.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.840
 And it turned out, once he was introduced to her,

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.040
 that her was him, and it was just another turtle.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.080
 And they fought a lot, because they were rivals.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.040
 And one of them died, the one that wasn't one we're talking about,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.520
 and the other one ended up with a ruined penis.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.360
 And they've tried artificial insemination, and it has not worked.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.800
 Very sad.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.080
 That is disastrous.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:39.560
 I know.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.880
 It's a problem for the Axie's soft-shelled turtles.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.880
 Yeah, and he's very old, isn't he?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.000
 He's like a hundred years old.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.640
 Yeah, I think he is.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:52.040
 They certainly do grow to be 100, maybe 120 max.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.480
 Yeah, so what are they doing?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.520
 Are they going to...

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.680
 Well, so they've tried artificial insemination three times, I think,

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.640
 so they've got this female in the zoo with him.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.360
 And it's very complex, artificially inseminating them,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.800
 because the genitalia are quite difficult for both of these turtles.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.120
 So the males, according to the New York Times,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.320
 look a bit like a medieval weapon with fleshy spikes and lobes

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.360
 poking out of it.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.320
 And it's designed to perfectly navigate, like...

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.840
 Like theses in the minotaur.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.720
 Theses is the penis, and the labyrinth is the vagina.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.240
 Sorry, what's the minotaur?

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.840
 The minotaur, I think, is the egg?

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.960
 Who's the princess?

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.240
 Is it the thesis?

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:29.720
 The end.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.400
 This is broken down remarkably first.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.600
 After!

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.200
 It's the zookeeper.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.920
 My netherworld's run out.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.520
 But the genitals are very difficult.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.880
 So artificial insemination has been really hard and unsuccessful.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.240
 Yeah, scientific American said of the turtle penis that

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.720
 it has this weird configuration of sinuses and associated folds.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.840
 It says, "Some of the configurations look terrifying."

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.360
 Others look really terrifying.

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.920
 They're so cool soft-shell turtles.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.560
 They're not like a turtle that's been run over, don't they?

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.200
 Yeah, they've got this sort of pancake on their back.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.360
 And it's leathery skin.

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.840
 It's not a hard shell, so hence the name.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.080
 And they can breathe partially through the soft shell.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.720
 And they hibernate in pools of water and they're kind of half buried.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.280
 And we didn't know how they lived long enough to...

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.680
 We didn't know how they got enough oxygen under the water.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.360
 And it turns out that how they do it,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.200
 they do press-ups under the water.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.000
 What?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.520
 Yeah, so they're partially buried.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:32.200
 But they do press-ups with their back end.

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.240
 They raise and lower their back end thousands of times in a row.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.200
 And we think it's because it moves the water round.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.720
 So it replaces the water next to them,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.360
 which they've already breathed in and out of through

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.040
 with oxygenated water.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.800
 Wow. So they can get a bit more oxygen in.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.600
 That's incredible.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.840
 They're just lying at the bottom of rivers doing press-ups all the time.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.040
 That's so cool.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.880
 You were asking Dan about what they're going to do in the future.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.920
 The truth is the two turtles that live in the lakes,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.240
 they're not really sure if they're male or female.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.960
 In fact, one of them, they only got it from DNA collected from water samples.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.160
 So they kind of...

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.600
 They took the DNA out of it and realized that there must be a turtle living in there,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.760
 but they just don't know anything about it at all.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.600
 And actually, it's really hard to tell whether a soft shell turtle is male or female

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.760
 because for the males, the penis is hidden inside the shell.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.240
 The best way to find them is to give them a vibrator.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.880
 This is genuinely the best way to sex a turtle, sorry.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.080
 If you were to get a vibrator on a tortoise

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.080
 and you kind of go into circles around its belly

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.800
 and then you move it down towards the tail,

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.480
 100% of the time he will either send out his penis

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.720
 or he'll be a female and not send out the penis.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.720
 Send it out. It's not an ambassador.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.960
 You have a mission for you.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.120
 Be back within the month.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.240
 Explore the source of this erotic massage.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:59.000
 This is a relatively new invention, isn't it?

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.080
 I think a guy called Donald McKnight,

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.840
 who's a PhD candidate in Australia,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:06.840
 invented a vibrator for these giants of cells.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.160
 A lot of turtles, specifically for turtles.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.920
 Yeah, turtles, absolutely.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.160
 And he said that the difficult thing about them

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:15.480
 is they demand for play, apparently.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.040
 He said, ultimately, most erections happened

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.960
 when the vibrator was on the tail itself,

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.760
 but the turtles generally weren't let you start there.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.640
 You first have to spend a few minutes on other parts of the body.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.640
 Yeah. Ask it how its day's been.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.760
 He also said, we weren't doing this

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.120
 because we thought it would be fun.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:34.680
 So it's what they weren't doing?

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.760
 No, they weren't. It feels like it was protesting a bit too hard.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.000
 And then he said, like I said,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.320
 it was a successful 100% of the time

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.320
 and he added one of them was showing his penis

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.520
 in like four seconds.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.560
 There's another really cool thing that turtles

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.400
 have, sort of, ability to have.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.320
 So these are snapping turtles, common snapping turtles.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.480
 They live in mud holes in the winter

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.920
 and they go back to exactly the same mud hole every year

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.760
 and they've measured it and it's to the centimetre.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:03.640
 To the centimetre, every year, they get back.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.880
 And scientists tested this by giving them a drug

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.560
 called scopolamine, which prevents the brain from forming memories

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.680
 and they observed that the turtles just wandered around in circles

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.920
 not finding their way back, which seems very cruel.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.120
 But then it wore off and they just go straight back to the path

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.600
 and then they land right to the centimetre in their thing.

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.240
 It's amazing.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.840
 But I found another thing off the back of this.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.720
 Scopolamine is a drug that works on humans as well.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.760
 It's a very powerful, knocks out your memory, basically.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.240
 So there was a campaign in the 1910s by feminists at the time

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.880
 for the right to forget childbirth by taking this drug.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.600
 Wow. They said we do not want to remember it.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.840
 And so if you take it, you would basically wake up

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.440
 with a baby after 12 hours.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.720
 And that was it when you're offering this drug on the way out

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.600
 tonight, by the way.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:56.280
 A traumatic as childbirth.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.320
 Yeah, people traveled from all over Europe and from America,

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.040
 specifically to Germany, because that was where you could get it,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.880
 without a big prescription or a big kerfuffle.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.160
 And there was an association called the Twilight Sleep Association

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.160
 who campaigned to get it universally accepted.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:11.960
 No way.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.760
 People always sort of clean that childbirth.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.800
 There's some sort of formula release that means you forget it anyway,

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.000
 because it's so rubbish.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.280
 But I don't know if that's true, because I haven't done it.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.600
 Or what have I?

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:39.960
 On animal penises, did you know that alligator penises are always erect?

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.080
 And they are, I think the only animal that has a permanently erect penis.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.400
 Which is quite interesting, I think.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.320
 So there's also the only animal that has a penis that doesn't inflate

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.840
 or enlarge when it's aroused.

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:57.480
 So every other animal has its penis inflates or enlarges.

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.920
 But the alligator penis sits inside its body.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.960
 It's just this lump of protein, basically.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.360
 It's free-floating and it sits in the sort of cradle,

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.080
 which is its cloaca, which if you think of it like a hammock,

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.120
 which the penis is in.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.360
 And then when it needs to procreate, then it just fires it out.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.600
 So the hammock tenses up and it fires this out like a projectile.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.440
 Dispatch the love sausage.

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:28.280
 Okay, that is it.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.400
 That is all of our facts.

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:30.760
