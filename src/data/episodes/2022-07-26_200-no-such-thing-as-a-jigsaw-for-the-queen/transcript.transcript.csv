00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi guys, just before we start this show, I want to celebrate the fact that this is our 200th episode."
00:00:06,00:00:09,"Oh, no such thing as a fish. Thanks for that, Dan."
00:00:09,00:00:11,A little woohoo.
00:00:11,00:00:13,"Yep, for the second one."
00:00:13,00:00:17,And the way I've celebrated our 200th episode is by making a mistake.
00:00:17,00:00:21,"Yep, last week's episode, there was an incorrect fact in it."
00:00:21,00:00:28,"So we recorded the show live in Leicester, and my fact was about how the Walker's crisp factory"
00:00:28,00:00:30,can't tell the difference between golf balls and crisps.
00:00:30,00:00:35,"And after we recorded this show, someone came up to me, he was called Greg Hilliard,"
00:00:35,00:00:39,"and he actually works in the Walker's crisp factory, and he informed me that fact was out of date"
00:00:39,00:00:44,because they've now created a machine that can distinguish between the two.
00:00:44,00:00:49,"So in the last couple of years, so walkers can now tell the difference between golf balls and crisps."
00:00:49,00:00:51,"Happy birthday, no such thing as a fish."
00:00:51,00:01:17,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:01:17,00:01:21,"Guys, I'm trying to do the intro here."
00:01:21,00:01:32,"It's a weekly podcast, coming to you from Birmingham!"
00:01:32,00:01:37,"My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anne Chasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:37,00:01:42,"and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:01:42,00:01:46,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:01:46,00:01:51,"Starting with my fact this week, my fact this week is that in Brussels, there is a"
00:01:51,00:01:57,commemorative statue to where Peter the Great once vomited.
00:01:57,00:02:07,That was so cool!
00:02:07,00:02:12,Anyone else want to vomit at this stage?
00:02:12,00:02:14,"Is it in the shape of vomit, or what?"
00:02:14,00:02:16,"Would you mean, oh, the statue?"
00:02:16,00:02:20,"No, it's of Peter the Great, yeah, yeah, but what it was is he was over in Brussels,"
00:02:20,00:02:26,"and he was out just having a big day, and he had a bit too much of a big day, and they pulled"
00:02:26,00:02:32,"over to where this sort of little fountain he bitters, and he vomited, and it was established"
00:02:32,00:02:36,"that that's what he did, historically, and then years later, it was in 1856, there was a"
00:02:36,00:02:41,"prince who donated a statue to say we need to commemorate this, so it said it had this little"
00:02:41,00:02:45,"plaque on it, which says, ""As he sat on the edge of this fountain, he enabled its waters"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"with the wine of his libations."""
00:02:47,00:02:53,"Did I say any of the words right, and that was close enough, yeah?"
00:02:53,00:02:54,"Yes, I think his."
00:02:54,00:02:58,"Peter the Great was obviously, in one sense, this very grand historical figure, probably"
00:02:58,00:03:04,"the most influential czar Russia ever had, early 18th century, influenced everything that"
00:03:04,00:03:13,"came off him, but also he was an absolute lad, so he founded a drinking society called, it"
00:03:13,00:03:17,"was originally called the Jolly Company, and then it was called the All-Joking All-Drunken"
00:03:17,00:03:24,"Sinod of Fools and Gestors, and it had a few rules, so there were rules like you were never"
00:03:24,00:03:29,"allowed to go to bed sober, you always had to empty your cup when instructed to, and they"
00:03:29,00:03:34,"just did mad stuff all the time, just constantly fooling around, so there was, I think there"
00:03:34,00:03:40,"was something where his favourite jester got married, he had this jester, and he decided"
00:03:40,00:03:44,"he was xar by this time, so he could do whatever he wanted, so he decided to make this wedding"
00:03:44,00:03:49,"like a massive royal deal, and he gave his jester his xar's carriage, and then him and his"
00:03:49,00:03:56,"drinking society wore boots made of straw, and they wore gloves in the, like, made of mice,"
00:03:56,00:03:57,"so they shoved their hands into mice, and they wore-"
00:03:57,00:03:58,What?
00:03:58,00:03:59,Sorry.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Do you mean like finger puppets?
00:04:00,00:04:01,No.
00:04:01,00:04:02,"Must think mouse skin, right?"
00:04:02,00:04:04,They weren't putting the hand up a mouse's-
00:04:04,00:04:05,"Oh, yeah, okay."
00:04:05,00:04:10,"Well, I don't know 'cause they wore squirrels' tails and cat's paws just hanging off their clothes"
00:04:10,00:04:16,"for fun, and then they made the married couple enter Moscow on the back of a camel, and then"
00:04:16,00:04:21,"they just spent three days getting absolutely smashed, and as one biographer put it, the joke"
00:04:21,00:04:28,may have been carried too far because the groom died during the celebrations.
00:04:28,00:04:29,May.
00:04:29,00:04:32,May have been carried too far.
00:04:32,00:04:34,"That's a historian's way of looking at it, isn't it?"
00:04:34,00:04:40,"He was a terrifying man, so he was a six foot seven."
00:04:40,00:04:46,"He had a standing desk, that's not terrifying, but the standing desk he had, the writing surface"
00:04:46,00:04:48,was five foot six inches off the floor.
00:04:48,00:04:49,Wow.
00:04:49,00:04:50,He was huge.
00:04:50,00:04:53,"Yeah, and also the other thing about him, he was obsessed with dwarfs."
00:04:53,00:04:56,"So when he was a baby, this is before he was-"
00:04:56,00:05:00,"To him that everyone would have been a dwarf, but he had a retinue of dwarfs acting as"
00:05:00,00:05:04,"his servants and playmates, and he had a mini carriage, and he would ride in it, drawn"
00:05:04,00:05:08,by four dwarf ponies with four dwarfs riding their own horses at the side.
00:05:08,00:05:11,"And even in later life, he became obsessed with dwarfs in pies."
00:05:11,00:05:13,He loved a dwarf jumping out of a pie at a banquet.
00:05:13,00:05:14,Really?
00:05:14,00:05:16,He was obsessed with it.
00:05:16,00:05:19,"Often naked, naked dwarfs jumping out of pies, he was really into, yeah."
00:05:19,00:05:23,"So Simon C. Back at Montefuri wrote a really good biography, and he basically said, all of"
00:05:23,00:05:28,"the parties they had had naked girls jumping out of pies, dwarves being tossed, dwarves dressed"
00:05:28,00:05:33,"as old men, old men dressed as dwarves, all of them naked except for the bishop who would"
00:05:33,00:05:35,be carrying dildos on a cushion.
00:05:35,00:05:42,"But that's the thing about it, is this thing that he did this club, it was called a synod, wasn't"
00:05:42,00:05:43,it?
00:05:43,00:05:45,And so it was basically to take the piss out of the church.
00:05:45,00:05:46,Yeah.
00:05:46,00:05:47,That's why he did the whole time.
00:05:47,00:05:51,"So instead of Holy Water, they would scatter vodka."
00:05:51,00:05:52,Wow.
00:05:52,00:05:57,"And if you were ever caught being sober, you'd get ex-communicated from his club."
00:05:57,00:06:02,"But the worst thing was, if you got ex-communicated, you were barred from all the pubs in the whole"
00:06:02,00:06:03,of Russia.
00:06:03,00:06:04,Oh.
00:06:04,00:06:05,Wow.
00:06:05,00:06:06,No way.
00:06:06,00:06:07,Way.
00:06:07,00:06:08,Wow.
00:06:08,00:06:10,"Imagine the horror, Anna."
00:06:10,00:06:11,You.
00:06:11,00:06:14,"Listening at home, you want to be able to imagine the horror on Anna's face right now."
00:06:14,00:06:19,"He did another thing where, so he did a number of trips to Europe, he was famous for these massive"
00:06:19,00:06:25,"trips, and one time he came back and he was so impressed by the clean shavenness of the Europeans"
00:06:25,00:06:30,"that he imposed a beard tax into Russia, but the way he did it was, he came back and they"
00:06:30,00:06:35,"threw a massive reception for him, and he was giving a sort of arousing speech, and everyone"
00:06:35,00:06:36,said it was elation.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Everyone was so excited.
00:06:37,00:06:42,"And then it turned to horror when he suddenly said, I don't want beards anymore, and he pulls"
00:06:42,00:06:47,"out a massive razor, and he starts shaving the faces of people who were attending."
00:06:47,00:06:51,"What they thought was just a pleasant talk of a homecoming hero, and they all left without"
00:06:51,00:06:53,their face hair.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"But he did the tax to start off with, and then when people started paying the tax, he"
00:06:57,00:07:00,"just went, oh, I'm just going to ban them then."
00:07:00,00:07:04,"So he just didn't want beards at all, because he saw that as an example of the old Russia,"
00:07:04,00:07:07,and he was a great modernizer of Russia.
00:07:07,00:07:12,"So he had a law that everyone had to dress as either a Hungarian, a Frenchman or a German."
00:07:12,00:07:18,"That was because he knew a very funny joke about a Hungarian, a Frenchman."
00:07:18,00:07:23,"But with the beard tax, the thing was, with the tax, they gave you these coins, and I didn't"
00:07:23,00:07:24,realize these coins are still in existence.
00:07:24,00:07:26,"This is from the 1700s, and you can see them."
00:07:26,00:07:32,"These pictures online, where it's like a sort of a goatee and a little, what's that bit?"
00:07:32,00:07:37,"A soul patch, a soul patch kind of thing, but like Satan would have, you know, the more"
00:07:37,00:07:38,pointy one.
00:07:38,00:07:39,A goatee.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"Oh, yeah, a goatee."
00:07:40,00:07:42,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:07:42,00:07:45,"So that would be on the coin, and you would carry your coin around with you."
00:07:45,00:07:48,"So if you were seen in the streets with a beard, they'd go, where's your coin, and you'd"
00:07:48,00:07:49,look around for the coin.
00:07:49,00:07:53,"And if you didn't have your coin, they'd shave your face on the spot."
00:07:53,00:07:57,"He took Russia back 5,000 years, as well as being a massive modernizer."
00:07:57,00:07:58,What do you mean?
00:07:58,00:08:05,"He left Russia in the year 7,206, and he got back, and he said, ""I don't want this anymore,"""
00:08:05,00:08:11,"because Russia used to begin at 5,508 BC, and he left Russia for the West, and he found,"
00:08:11,00:08:15,"""Oh, it's 1700 here, well, I prefer this."""
00:08:15,00:08:19,"And so he came back and said, ""Right, it's 1700, forget the 7,200 nonsense, changing it."
00:08:19,00:08:22,"Beardstone exists in the future."""
00:08:22,00:08:23,That's so cool.
00:08:23,00:08:27,"So he just altered time, and he trained as a shipbuilder."
00:08:27,00:08:28,Did he?
00:08:28,00:08:34,"When he was touring Europe, he personally went to a shipyard and just worked there in Amsterdam"
00:08:34,00:08:38,"for months, and he cooked his own meals, and he lit his own fires, and he ignored anybody"
00:08:38,00:08:40,who called him your majesty.
00:08:40,00:08:42,He answered only to carpenter Peter.
00:08:42,00:08:48,"He was very eccentric, but an incredibly practical man in loads of ways."
00:08:48,00:08:49,Yeah.
00:08:49,00:08:54,"He liked cutting something else off people, so you would be actually thankful if he cut your"
00:08:54,00:08:57,"beard off, because he loved cutting people's heads off himself."
00:08:57,00:09:00,"So usually as a world leader at the time, people were beheaded, but you know, you'd get your"
00:09:00,00:09:05,"executioner to do it, but he really liked to be there in the thick of it, and so he did"
00:09:05,00:09:09,"lots of executions himself, and he was really fascinated by it enough to me, again, because"
00:09:09,00:09:13,"I think he liked Europeans, and they were maybe ahead in biology."
00:09:13,00:09:17,"If he comes at you with a razor, at what stage do you know he's going to go for the beard"
00:09:17,00:09:18,and not cut your hair?
00:09:18,00:09:19,Yeah.
00:09:19,00:09:21,That's got to be absolutely terrifying.
00:09:21,00:09:22,It comes out with a great big axe.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"No, this is just my beard axe, don't worry."
00:09:26,00:09:29,"He actually had a mistress called Mary Hamilton, and then she ended up being beheaded as"
00:09:29,00:09:35,"lots of mistresses did, and when she was beheaded, he was there, and as soon as she was beheaded,"
00:09:35,00:09:40,"he lifted up her head in front of the crown, so we're all watching, and he gave them all"
00:09:40,00:09:45,"a medical lesson on anatomy, so he turned her neck side out, and was like, this is the"
00:09:45,00:09:51,"shrekia, this is her carotid artery, and then he gave her a big snog, and then he dropped"
00:09:51,00:09:52,the head and walked away.
00:09:52,00:09:53,He gave her a snog?
00:09:53,00:09:57,"Yeah, he gave her a big kiss on the list."
00:09:57,00:10:02,"So this fact was sent to me by a listener of our podcast called Carrie, and I loved it"
00:10:02,00:10:06,because there are amazing statues all over the world that represent very odd things.
00:10:06,00:10:11,"I found one which I've been trying to track down, whether the truth of this, which is"
00:10:11,00:10:15,"George Washington in Trafalgar Square, very close to where we work in Covern Garden, literally"
00:10:15,00:10:17,a walking distance.
00:10:17,00:10:21,"There's a statue of George Washington there, outside the National Portrait Gallery,"
00:10:21,00:10:25,"and it was donated by the Americans, however, there was a sentence that George Washington"
00:10:25,00:10:30,"said just before he died, which is he said, ""I would never will stand on British soil again."""
00:10:30,00:10:34,"And as a result, it is said, and this is what tour guides tell everyone, that as they were"
00:10:34,00:10:39,"putting down the statue of George Washington, they imported American soil and sitting underneath"
00:10:39,00:10:45,"it is American soils, so he still is not standing, but what's under the American soil?"
00:10:45,00:10:49,It's more British soil.
00:10:49,00:10:52,"How far down does this go, basically?"
00:10:52,00:11:00,"On vomiting, and on American presidents, actually, Ulysses S. Grant was president, and also"
00:11:00,00:11:05,"he was prominent in the Civil War and the American Civil War before that, and so he was kind"
00:11:05,00:11:08,"of a war hero, but at the same time he was an alcoholic."
00:11:08,00:11:13,"So he used to sweep whiskey wherever he went, apparently, and at one point in battle, he"
00:11:13,00:11:15,vomited into his horse's mane.
00:11:15,00:11:16,Oh!
00:11:16,00:11:19,"Yeah, and just went on with it."
00:11:19,00:11:20,What about George W. Bush?
00:11:20,00:11:21,Was it George W. Bush?
00:11:21,00:11:23,"No, it's George H. W. Bush, wasn't it?"
00:11:23,00:11:24,Yeah.
00:11:24,00:11:31,"Who vomited on the lap of Japan's Prime Minister in 1992, and as a result, the Japanese"
00:11:31,00:11:39,"coined the phrase ""Bushu Suru"", meaning embarrassing public vomiting, or literally to do a"
00:11:39,00:11:40,bush.
00:11:40,00:11:43,"Because that is frowned on, isn't it, in Japan?"
00:11:43,00:11:45,"Yeah, actually, everywhere."
00:11:45,00:11:46,What?
00:11:46,00:11:50,"Oh, I've got so many apologetic texts to say."
00:11:50,00:11:54,"Do you know, he was so good-natured about that moment, though, so he kind of collapsed"
00:11:54,00:11:55,with his dinner.
00:11:55,00:11:56,He'd been feeling bad anyway.
00:11:56,00:11:59,"I think, because he'd just played a tennis match against Japanese Emperor, and he'd"
00:11:59,00:12:00,lost.
00:12:00,00:12:04,"So he was feeling really unwell after that, and he collapsed onto the floor, vomited, passed"
00:12:04,00:12:09,"out, and as soon as he woke up with the Japanese Prime Minister there, above him saying, ""You're"
00:12:09,00:12:10,"okay."""
00:12:10,00:12:12,"He said, ""Why don't you just roll me under the table, and I'll sleep it off while you're"
00:12:12,00:12:13,"finished dinner?"""
00:12:13,00:12:14,Really?
00:12:14,00:12:17,"It was just quite cool, yeah."
00:12:17,00:12:24,"One thing about Peter the Great is, at his parties, he would train bears to serve alcohol,"
00:12:24,00:12:29,and they would growl and harass those who said no.
00:12:29,00:12:35,"So I thought I'd look at some other awesome parties, and I really like the engagement party"
00:12:35,00:12:37,of the newspaper Magnet Gordon Bennett.
00:12:37,00:12:42,"He turned up at his own engagement party, so drunk that he immediately urinated into the"
00:12:42,00:12:49,"living room fireplace, in full view of his hosts, and it's in the Guinness Book of Records"
00:12:49,00:12:54,as the greatest engagement faux pas.
00:12:54,00:13:01,"And it's supposed to be where we get the phrase, ""Gordon Bennett"", something bad, yeah."
00:13:01,00:13:05,Guinness is still accepting any advance on urinating into the fireplace.
00:13:05,00:13:06,Okay.
00:13:06,00:13:07,Go for it.
00:13:07,00:13:09,I think we could smash that.
00:13:09,00:13:12,"During the Jin craze, there was quite a few good parties."
00:13:12,00:13:17,"So this was in the 18th century, and a lot of people were drinking Jin, especially in London."
00:13:17,00:13:21,"There was an author called Henry McKenzie, who was at a drinking party, and he didn't"
00:13:21,00:13:28,"want to drink anymore, so he fell to the floor to disguise himself as a drunken body."
00:13:28,00:13:31,"And then soon after, he felt a small hand around his neck, and he was like, ""What's going"
00:13:31,00:13:32,"on?"""
00:13:32,00:13:35,"And he confronted the boy who was doing it, and apparently the boy said it was his job"
00:13:35,00:13:40,to loosen the neck ties of the guests to prevent them from choking on their own vomit.
00:13:40,00:13:41,Wow.
00:13:41,00:13:46,"If you have to hire someone to do that, yeah."
00:13:46,00:13:47,I had at my stag-do party.
00:13:47,00:13:49,"Oh, are we really?"
00:13:49,00:13:51,"Yeah, just before I did my speech."
00:13:51,00:13:55,"My brother made me drink what, in Australia, is called a Shoey, and they do it on the Formula"
00:13:55,00:13:56,One.
00:13:56,00:13:59,"You fill a shoe full of beer, and you have to drink the whole shoe of beer."
00:13:59,00:14:00,So I did that.
00:14:00,00:14:04,"Right after I decided I'd say a quick thank you to everyone that came, and I did that, passed"
00:14:04,00:14:08,"out, woke up in the morning, and thought, ""I did a pretty good speech last night, and"
00:14:08,00:14:09,"my brother said I recorded it."""
00:14:09,00:14:15,"I thought it was like about two minutes, 45 minutes, and a 45 minute speech."
00:14:15,00:14:16,Who's Shoe?
00:14:16,00:14:17,Did you have to drink up?
00:14:17,00:14:18,"My brother's, it was disgusting."
00:14:18,00:14:19,"Because he's a clown, isn't he?"
00:14:19,00:14:22,That was a problem.
00:14:22,00:14:27,Let's move on to our second fact of the show.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:14:30,00:14:36,"Okay, my fact this week is that only one study has ever found that men are better than women"
00:14:36,00:14:38,at recognising faces.
00:14:38,00:14:47,It was a study looking at the recognition of the Transformers.
00:14:47,00:14:51,"I know that's bad, obviously, but internally I'm thinking, yeah, I'm pretty good at recognising"
00:14:51,00:14:52,Transformers.
00:14:52,00:14:53,This is true.
00:14:53,00:14:57,"And they're robots in disguise, so that's even better, right?"
00:14:57,00:15:01,"So this is obviously like an on average thing, so you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna"
00:15:01,00:15:05,"would be worse at recognising Transformers than Dan, just on average women are worse than"
00:15:05,00:15:06,men.
00:15:06,00:15:10,"Although you know that I asked you earlier what Transformers were, and that was having"
00:15:10,00:15:13,"just read the Wikipedia page of Transformers, wasn't it?"
00:15:13,00:15:16,I still didn't understand it.
00:15:16,00:15:18,I was thinking to stereotype.
00:15:18,00:15:22,"And you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna would be worse than Anna at recognising Barbie"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"faces, which is the other part of this study."
00:15:25,00:15:29,"So they took Barbie faces and they took Transformer faces, and they found the women were better"
00:15:29,00:15:33,"at recognising Barbie, and the men were better at recognising Transformers."
00:15:33,00:15:37,And what they think is this is a study about looking where that experience is important
00:15:37,00:15:39,when it comes to recognising faces.
00:15:39,00:15:43,So they found these things where they thought women would have more experience in looking
00:15:43,00:15:46,"at Barbies, and men would have more experience in looking at Transformers."
00:15:46,00:15:51,"And they found that maybe experience has something to do with it, but actually overall women are"
00:15:51,00:15:53,"a lot, lot better than men are looking at faces."
00:15:53,00:15:58,"Yeah, because Anna, I think I read a study, and this is off-memories, they're very risky"
00:15:58,00:16:05,"right now, but the also women, because of the genetic material instinct, then you kind"
00:16:05,00:16:10,"of have to be primed to recognise people more often, and you have to take an interest"
00:16:10,00:16:13,"in more people so you can form a bond with them, and as soon as you form an emotional"
00:16:13,00:16:16,"bond with people, then you're more likely to recognise the next time you see them."
00:16:16,00:16:17,"Yeah, it could be that."
00:16:17,00:16:18,It could be that.
00:16:18,00:16:21,But it's probably the Barbie thing.
00:16:21,00:16:25,"So you have these things called face patches in your brain, and there's these little bits,"
00:16:25,00:16:29,"they're about the size of a blueberry, and they are specifically for recognising faces."
00:16:29,00:16:33,"So they've test, they don't respond if you get shown another body part, but they do respond"
00:16:33,00:16:34,if you get shown a face.
00:16:34,00:16:38,"And they are so predictable these face patches that scientists tried it out with monkeys, monkeys"
00:16:38,00:16:40,also have face patches.
00:16:40,00:16:45,"And they would measure the electrical activity of the face cells, and then they could recreate"
00:16:45,00:16:47,the face that the monkey had seen accurately.
00:16:47,00:16:48,No.
00:16:48,00:16:49,Yes.
00:16:49,00:16:50,From the activity in the brain cells.
00:16:50,00:16:51,Wow.
00:16:51,00:16:52,That is magic.
00:16:52,00:16:56,"But monkeys don't aren't recognising faces, I don't think are they?"
00:16:56,00:16:59,"I think great apes are, but monkeys are quite bad."
00:16:59,00:17:02,"They aren't good, though, at recognising bottoms."
00:17:02,00:17:03,Oh yeah.
00:17:03,00:17:06,"Monkeys, chimpanzees, especially recognise each other by the bottoms, the way that we recognise"
00:17:06,00:17:08,each other by the face.
00:17:08,00:17:10,"Well, not exactly the same way."
00:17:10,00:17:13,"Well, the same way, but upside down."
00:17:13,00:17:14,Yeah.
00:17:14,00:17:17,Does that mean they back into every social engagement?
00:17:17,00:17:19,They go ask first.
00:17:19,00:17:22,"Well, then they can't, because one of them has to be face first in order to see the ass."
00:17:22,00:17:23,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:23,00:17:28,"It's unbelievably embarrassing when one comes in ask first, and another one comes in ask first."
00:17:28,00:17:30,Imagine that in an engagement.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Yeah.
00:17:31,00:17:34,But you know how they tested this?
00:17:34,00:17:39,"They tested it by showing them, they showed humans' faces and then faces upside down."
00:17:39,00:17:43,"And it's much, humans are much slower to recognise faces when they turned upside down."
00:17:43,00:17:48,"They then showed the chimpanzees, arses, chimpanzees arses, and then arses upside down."
00:17:48,00:17:53,"And the slowdown was the same, whereas humans did not slow down when they were shown a normal"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"bottom and then an upside down bottom, which they also did for this experiment."
00:17:56,00:17:59,Could the humans recognise the bottoms?
00:17:59,00:18:00,No.
00:18:00,00:18:02,They also could not recognise upside down bottoms.
00:18:02,00:18:03,Okay.
00:18:03,00:18:04,I got it.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Yeah.
00:18:05,00:18:07,I just thought maybe I'd have a quick game of transformer or Barbie.
00:18:07,00:18:08,"Oh, okay."
00:18:08,00:18:09,Great.
00:18:09,00:18:12,"We can't do the images, because this is a podcast."
00:18:12,00:18:13,Yeah.
00:18:13,00:18:18,"What I can do is give you some names of either these are people from transformers, not people,"
00:18:18,00:18:19,transformers.
00:18:19,00:18:21,They're either transformers from transformers.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"They're people to me, James."
00:18:24,00:18:26,Or toys from the Barbie universe.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Okay.
00:18:27,00:18:28,Okay.
00:18:28,00:18:33,"So, dude, a friend of Ken."
00:18:33,00:18:34,Yeah.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Must be a Barbie thing.
00:18:35,00:18:36,Transformer.
00:18:36,00:18:37,It is everyone?
00:18:37,00:18:38,Barbie.
00:18:38,00:18:39,They knew it.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Yeah.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Yeah.
00:18:41,00:18:42,It's a friend of Jazzy.
00:18:42,00:18:43,What?
00:18:43,00:18:44,Slag.
00:18:44,00:18:45,Barbie.
00:18:45,00:18:49,Is that a Barbie doll?
00:18:49,00:18:50,I think it is.
00:18:50,00:18:51,Is it a transformer?
00:18:51,00:18:57,I think it's an incredibly ill-conceived Barbie.
00:18:57,00:18:59,It's a triceratops dyno bot.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Oh.
00:19:00,00:19:01,It's how I got it.
00:19:01,00:19:02,M.C.
00:19:02,00:19:03,Hammer.
00:19:03,00:19:04,Barbie.
00:19:04,00:19:05,Barbie.
00:19:05,00:19:06,Yeah.
00:19:06,00:19:07,He's got it.
00:19:07,00:19:08,Yeah.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Yeah.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Because they do celebrity Barbies.
00:19:10,00:19:11,There's an Angela Merkel as well.
00:19:11,00:19:12,Yeah.
00:19:12,00:19:13,Yeah.
00:19:13,00:19:18,"I tried to get one and they'd said it was for sale, but then it turned out it was they brought"
00:19:18,00:19:20,it just to an EU conference.
00:19:20,00:19:24,Barbie created an Angela Merkel Barbie and so it's not for sale for general public.
00:19:24,00:19:25,It should be.
00:19:25,00:19:27,It is if you pay 50 billion pounds.
00:19:27,00:19:28,Yes.
00:19:28,00:19:29,Yeah.
00:19:29,00:19:30,One more.
00:19:30,00:19:31,Alan.
00:19:31,00:19:32,Oh.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Transformer.
00:19:33,00:19:34,Transformer.
00:19:34,00:19:35,Yeah.
00:19:35,00:19:36,Transformer.
00:19:36,00:19:37,Who's the transformer?
00:19:37,00:19:38,Who?
00:19:38,00:19:39,Who's the Barbie?
00:19:39,00:19:40,Yeah.
00:19:40,00:19:41,Yeah.
00:19:41,00:19:42,Who doesn't give a shit?
00:19:42,00:19:43,Yeah.
00:19:43,00:19:44,Yeah.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Okay.
00:19:45,00:19:47,It's time for factor three then.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"Well, the answer is you were right not to give a shit because it's both."
00:19:51,00:19:52,Oh.
00:19:52,00:19:57,It's a high-speed train and someone who's married to Barbie's friend Mitch.
00:19:57,00:19:58,What?
00:19:58,00:20:00,I'm beg your pardon.
00:20:00,00:20:01,I said Mitch.
00:20:01,00:20:02,"Oh, Mitch."
00:20:02,00:20:03,Cool.
00:20:03,00:20:09,"I mean, if her friend was called Mitch, that would have been one of my…"
00:20:09,00:20:15,So you may well have heard of these guys called super recognisers.
00:20:15,00:20:16,"Oh, yeah."
00:20:16,00:20:20,So they're police officers and they're incredibly good at recognising a criminal's face
00:20:20,00:20:22,is based on really blurry CCTV.
00:20:22,00:20:27,"So in the metropolitan police, they identify a quarter of all the criminals, despite the"
00:20:27,00:20:32,"fact that out of 32,000 metropolitan police officers, there are only six super recognisers"
00:20:32,00:20:34,and they get a quarter.
00:20:34,00:20:39,"And they're so good that one officer was interviewed for the Guardian and he said, ""I was"
00:20:39,00:20:42,coming back from court and I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences because they
00:20:42,00:20:43,just spot.
00:20:43,00:20:47,"They remember the faces of people who were wanted and they just see them and they go, ""That"
00:20:47,00:20:48,"guy."""
00:20:48,00:20:49,I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences.
00:20:49,00:20:52,"Once I had to stop the car three times, I would take one person in and then on the way"
00:20:52,00:20:55,"to the station, I saw someone else who was wanted."
00:20:55,00:20:58,"So I picked them up and then as we were driving, I saw someone else."
00:20:58,00:20:59,No.
00:20:59,00:21:00,Yeah.
00:21:00,00:21:01,They're just constantly seeing crooks.
00:21:01,00:21:02,Wow.
00:21:02,00:21:07,Do you know who was very bad at recognising people was back to American President Ronald
00:21:07,00:21:08,Reagan.
00:21:08,00:21:14,"So he had to speak at a graduation ceremony in 1964 and he was giving, you know, the graduation"
00:21:14,00:21:20,"certificate to students and boy came up on stage and he shut the boy's hand, gave him a"
00:21:20,00:21:22,"certificate and said, ""My name's Ronald."
00:21:22,00:21:23,"What's yours?"""
00:21:23,00:21:24,"And the boy said, ""I'm Michael."
00:21:24,00:21:25,"I'm your son."""
00:21:25,00:21:26,Oh.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:30,It was his adoptive son.
00:21:30,00:21:32,They adopted him when he was a baby.
00:21:32,00:21:33,He was 19 by that point.
00:21:33,00:21:34,Oh.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"I mean, for an actor who has to recognise people, you would think that would be a flaw,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,not being able to recognise other humans.
00:21:39,00:21:40,You would think.
00:21:40,00:21:41,Yeah.
00:21:41,00:21:42,That's your actors need to recognise people?
00:21:42,00:21:43,Yeah.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"I mean, it helps if you're facing the right way."
00:21:45,00:21:48,"You want me to recognise the camera then, no?"
00:21:48,00:21:49,I guess so.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Do you know what it is?
00:21:50,00:21:53,"I just because I can't recognise people, so I'm just a bit worried I can't do an actor."
00:21:53,00:21:56,James has genuine face blindness.
00:21:56,00:21:57,He doesn't remember faces.
00:21:57,00:21:58,"Yeah, kind of."
00:21:58,00:22:01,I have no imagination.
00:22:01,00:22:06,"Oh, James, I thought those poems you showed me were wonderful."
00:22:06,00:22:10,That whole Barbie Transformer game was top.
00:22:10,00:22:12,I can't imagine people's faces.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"I can't imagine what my wife looks like, for instance."
00:22:14,00:22:16,"So, he's not proper face blindness."
00:22:16,00:22:19,"It's A-Fantasia, it's cold, but it means that I can't recognise people very well."
00:22:19,00:22:20,A-Fantasia?
00:22:20,00:22:21,Yeah.
00:22:21,00:22:23,What a whimsical name for presumably a bad condition.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"Oh, it's not."
00:22:24,00:22:25,It's not that bad.
00:22:25,00:22:26,It's not that bad.
00:22:26,00:22:27,It's not fair to say it.
00:22:27,00:22:28,It's not fair to say it.
00:22:28,00:22:29,It's not fair to say it.
00:22:29,00:22:30,It's not fair to say it.
00:22:30,00:22:31,You are.
00:22:31,00:22:43,I'm your wife.
00:22:43,00:22:45,Just one quick thing about face recognition.
00:22:45,00:22:50,"This year, there was a festival in Wales that used facial recognition technology to recognise"
00:22:50,00:22:51,evil elvises.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Wow.
00:22:52,00:22:57,"They were trying to scan for people who were wanted, same as the A and L, when they were on"
00:22:57,00:23:03,"their way into the world's largest Elvis festival in Bridgend in September, 35,000 people were"
00:23:03,00:23:04,going in.
00:23:04,00:23:08,Most of them dressed as Elvis and officers scanned their faces all.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"And what they were looking for, bad guys, all."
00:23:10,00:23:11,Yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:12,Bad guys.
00:23:12,00:23:15,"Well, there's a thing as well in Barcelona."
00:23:15,00:23:19,They've tested out this new thing at comedy clubs whereby they've put on the back of seats
00:23:19,00:23:24,little cameras that stairs directly into the face of the person sitting watching the
00:23:24,00:23:30,"comedy show and it's there to monitor laughter patterns so every time you laugh, it clicks and"
00:23:30,00:23:32,says you've laughed once.
00:23:32,00:23:37,"So if people at the end of the show go up and say, I found that very disappointing, I would"
00:23:37,00:23:38,like a refund.
00:23:38,00:23:43,"They can go, ""Well, actually, you've laughed 67 times this evening and you can't have your"
00:23:43,00:23:44,money back.
00:23:44,00:23:45,There's one.
00:23:45,00:23:46,Yeah.
00:23:46,00:23:53,"Everyone's fake laughs at a comedy show, don't think for a minute, we genuinely think you're"
00:23:53,00:23:54,laughing.
00:23:54,00:23:55,Everyone's put on a fake.
00:23:55,00:23:56,You could be laughing at how shit it is.
00:23:56,00:23:57,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:57,00:24:03,"No, it's a test to see how it would work because what they do is they then they drop the"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"price altogether of the ticket and so they clock up everyone's, this is free gig."
00:24:07,00:24:08,You go to it.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"They clock up the laughter amount and then at the end of the gig, they say you've laughed"
00:24:12,00:24:13,and there's a cap on how much laughter it is.
00:24:13,00:24:17,"Everyone's just going to go, ""I'm just going to enjoy this but I'm not going to laugh"
00:24:17,00:24:18,"so I get it for free."""
00:24:18,00:24:20,It's going to be awful.
00:24:20,00:24:21,Yeah.
00:24:21,00:24:24,"Mouth closed, looks straight ahead, think of death, think of old people, just think of"
00:24:24,00:24:25,sadness.
00:24:25,00:24:30,Some people don't laugh even when they're finding things really funny.
00:24:30,00:24:34,"You keep telling yourself that after your Edinburgh show, I'd refer you to the audiences at"
00:24:34,00:24:39,"my solo show, who had a wonderful time on the feedback forms, just explained a lot of"
00:24:39,00:24:45,them were remembering something sad.
00:24:45,00:24:48,Go quickly tell you my favorite headline that I've read recently.
00:24:48,00:24:49,This is about recognising stuff.
00:24:49,00:24:55,The headline is that babies can see things that adults can't but are unable to tell them.
00:24:55,00:25:00,They'll look at a picture and they'll notice differences that we won't have spotted or
00:25:00,00:25:03,maybe they haven't told us that we don't know.
00:25:03,00:25:04,That's what they think.
00:25:04,00:25:06,So how do we know they can see the differences?
00:25:06,00:25:07,I don't know.
00:25:07,00:25:08,I didn't read the article.
00:25:08,00:25:09,I just read the headline.
00:25:09,00:25:12,"That's going to go on your headstone, Dan."
00:25:12,00:25:17,Should we move on to another episode?
00:25:17,00:25:18,Yeah.
00:25:18,00:25:19,Okay.
00:25:19,00:25:22,It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.
00:25:22,00:25:27,My fact is that there is a woman whose job for the last 30 years has been squatting above
00:25:27,00:25:31,the Queen's throne so the TV cameras can get their angle right.
00:25:31,00:25:32,That is amazing.
00:25:32,00:25:34,"The Queen doesn't squat above the throne, does she?"
00:25:34,00:25:35,No.
00:25:35,00:25:36,Exactly.
00:25:36,00:25:37,Certainly not.
00:25:37,00:25:42,"Bella Slack and she's in her early 70s, she is the official stand-in for the Queen at"
00:25:42,00:25:46,all events where there are going to be TV cameras because she's pretty much exactly the same
00:25:46,00:25:48,size as the Queen.
00:25:48,00:25:53,"And she doesn't look like the Queen at all, but she does it and she's done it 50 times"
00:25:53,00:25:54,with different state occasions.
00:25:54,00:25:55,Why the squatting thing?
00:25:55,00:25:56,That's what I want to know.
00:25:56,00:26:01,"Well, she said she was interviewed about her life, not quite being the Queen."
00:26:01,00:26:05,"By quite a long way not being the Queen, but she's not even in the line of succession"
00:26:05,00:26:07,frames.
00:26:07,00:26:11,That's what makes you famous these days not being the Queen.
00:26:11,00:26:13,"Well, she said about the ceremony."
00:26:13,00:26:17,How long have you not been the Queen?
00:26:17,00:26:21,"She said about the ceremonies, ""I've never been allowed to sit on the throne in the House"
00:26:21,00:26:23,"of Lords for the State opening of Parliament."""
00:26:23,00:26:24,"Oh, I see."
00:26:24,00:26:26,"She said, ""I have to lurk above it."""
00:26:26,00:26:27,Yeah.
00:26:27,00:26:31,"But she says it's a very strict rule and she does say, ""If I'm in a carriage or a car, I"
00:26:31,00:26:32,"will wave."""
00:26:32,00:26:35,"Which is very sweet, yeah."
00:26:35,00:26:40,She was employed over 30 years ago when it was realised that the Queen had the sun in her
00:26:40,00:26:45,"eyes at some event, and so the Queen might have the sun in her eyes, but she was selling"
00:26:45,00:26:46,on a podium.
00:26:46,00:26:48,And so this woman was sent to check that the sun wouldn't be in her eyes.
00:26:48,00:26:49,And now she checks for that.
00:26:49,00:26:52,"So whenever the Queen has to stand up on a sunny day, she goes and checks first that the"
00:26:52,00:26:55,sun won't be in her eyes.
00:26:55,00:26:59,"She checks that she'll be visible over podiums, in case you've made a podium too high."
00:26:59,00:27:03,In case Peter the Great's desk is brought up.
00:27:03,00:27:04,Wow.
00:27:04,00:27:08,"And she has her own Queen costume, which she's put together from charity shops."
00:27:08,00:27:10,So her Queen handbag cost one quid.
00:27:10,00:27:11,Yeah.
00:27:11,00:27:14,And she got fake diamonds from Woolworths for the millennium.
00:27:14,00:27:15,I just love it.
00:27:15,00:27:16,I just think it's very nice.
00:27:16,00:27:17,She's not paid.
00:27:17,00:27:19,She refuses to accept any money for the work she does.
00:27:19,00:27:20,And she's been doing it for 30 years.
00:27:20,00:27:22,I think she's one of the great unsung heroes of this country.
00:27:22,00:27:23,Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:26,It's weird that she doesn't accept any payment and she pays for her travel and everything.
00:27:26,00:27:27,"I mean, I agree."
00:27:27,00:27:30,"Is there a, in a very small way?"
00:27:30,00:27:31,Yeah.
00:27:31,00:27:36,"Speaking of clothing, there is someone else who sort of does a stand-in job for the Queen as"
00:27:36,00:27:37,well.
00:27:37,00:27:42,And that is it's someone specifically whose job is to break in the shoes of the Queen that
00:27:42,00:27:44,are as of yet unworn.
00:27:44,00:27:46,So that's what they do.
00:27:46,00:27:50,"The people who provide all the clothing for her, her fashion people, the Queen's fashion"
00:27:50,00:27:51,people.
00:27:51,00:27:52,They buy new shoes.
00:27:52,00:27:54,"And obviously, when you're wearing new shoes, they're very painful."
00:27:54,00:27:59,And so someone is hired to just walk around in the new pair of shoes before she has a go
00:27:59,00:28:00,at them.
00:28:00,00:28:01,That's cool.
00:28:01,00:28:03,"So they must have the same size feet as the Queen, right?"
00:28:03,00:28:04,Or yes.
00:28:04,00:28:07,It would be very funny if they did not.
00:28:07,00:28:13,I just think in that the audition for that job or the job interview would be just like Cinderella
00:28:13,00:28:14,or something.
00:28:14,00:28:17,"I mean, you just have a load of people sat there, they just need the right size feet."
00:28:17,00:28:18,Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Because there's no other skill there, is there?"
00:28:20,00:28:21,No.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"It's probably a quick audition process, are you size eight, no?"
00:28:24,00:28:25,"Okay, thank you."
00:28:25,00:28:26,Size eight.
00:28:26,00:28:27,The Queen.
00:28:27,00:28:28,A massive feet.
00:28:28,00:28:29,Yeah.
00:28:29,00:28:30,Wow.
00:28:30,00:28:31,"Size eight is not massive, by the way."
00:28:31,00:28:32,What size is it?
00:28:32,00:28:33,It's supposed to be.
00:28:33,00:28:34,"It's supposed to be your five foot, too."
00:28:34,00:28:35,Yeah.
00:28:35,00:28:36,"Yeah, okay."
00:28:36,00:28:42,"Do you know, so I was looking at sort of the reason this lady, Ella Slack, she called."
00:28:42,00:28:43,Yeah.
00:28:43,00:28:46,Reason she does is it's like to prepare for ceremonial events.
00:28:46,00:28:51,"And the royal family, they have to rehearse all the royal ceremonies quite a lot."
00:28:51,00:28:56,"And in fact, the Queen herself spent weeks rehearsing for her coronation in 1953."
00:28:56,00:28:58,So she was really nervous about it.
00:28:58,00:29:02,And she used to play recordings of her father's coronation over and over again.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"Her father was George, you know, who had a stutter and so it's quite difficult for him."
00:29:06,00:29:08,She used to play recordings of his coronation.
00:29:08,00:29:12,And she paraded up and down what was called the white drawing room.
00:29:12,00:29:15,Because that had the same dimensions as the theatre and the abbey where she was going
00:29:15,00:29:16,to be coronated.
00:29:16,00:29:20,"And she timed herself doing it to make sure she was going to walk the right, you know,"
00:29:20,00:29:21,distance at the right pace.
00:29:21,00:29:24,And she got all her ladies and waiting to walk alongside her.
00:29:24,00:29:31,"And she used to wear her bedsheets as a robe, as her queenly robes, which is so cool."
00:29:31,00:29:32,That is really cool.
00:29:32,00:29:36,She know in 2012 there was a queen shortage in the UK.
00:29:36,00:29:37,Sorry?
00:29:37,00:29:39,There was a queen shortage.
00:29:39,00:29:43,It was due to all the Jubilee stuff and they needed queen lookalikes.
00:29:43,00:29:47,"And basically there's about, I don't know, there's about a couple of dozen people who can"
00:29:47,00:29:50,do queen lookalikes and they needed them all the time.
00:29:50,00:29:55,"And they said, the main lookalike company, Susan Scott lookalike said, we could have done"
00:29:55,00:29:57,with double or triple the amount of queens.
00:29:57,00:29:58,That is amazing.
00:29:58,00:30:05,"Imagine when the button was pressed, dispatched the queens."
00:30:05,00:30:07,They'll come out.
00:30:07,00:30:08,What do you do?
00:30:08,00:30:10,What do you do?
00:30:10,00:30:16,"What have room, do you think they've ever all been at the same place at the same time?"
00:30:16,00:30:20,"I don't know, but I did read an interview with Kate Middleton lookalike and she says that"
00:30:20,00:30:26,"one of the queens, or one of the queen lookalikes, is like her honorary granny."
00:30:26,00:30:29,And the reason is because they all hang out together all these lookalikes.
00:30:29,00:30:30,Of course she do.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"You would think, because you're all working in the same role."
00:30:32,00:30:35,The queen lookalikes and the Kate Middleton lookalikes will hang out with you.
00:30:35,00:30:39,"And the Pippa Middleton lookalikes, the Harry Potter lookalikes, the David Beckham lookalikes,"
00:30:39,00:30:40,they all hang out together.
00:30:40,00:30:45,Why is Harry Potter at that party?
00:30:45,00:30:47,It's just breaking a wall of some sort.
00:30:47,00:30:52,"Because then that's the only time they can truly be themselves, because outside those circles"
00:30:52,00:30:55,"everyone's always saying, ""Oh, you look just like Camilla Parker-Bulls."""
00:30:55,00:30:57,"Well, to the Harry Potter lookalike."
00:30:57,00:31:01,"Have you ever thought about changing your lookalike, mate?"
00:31:01,00:31:04,You don't look like Harry Potter.
00:31:04,00:31:09,"They just on that subject, they do often, if they're a couple who are celebrity couples"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"in real life, they will fall in love with each other and get married."
00:31:12,00:31:18,I think there's examples of like a Katie Price and a Peter Andre lookalike when that was
00:31:18,00:31:21,"massive, falling in love because they did so many events together."
00:31:21,00:31:23,And when that was massive?
00:31:23,00:31:24,Yeah.
00:31:24,00:31:27,Did you know by the whole new world album?
00:31:27,00:31:35,"So on body doubles, General Montgomery in the Second World War, Monty had an impersonator"
00:31:35,00:31:40,who for spying purposes pretended to be him and would go to different places so that
00:31:40,00:31:43,"German spies would think, ""Oh, Monty's over here."""
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Actually, Monty wasn't over here."
00:31:45,00:31:48,Monty was over there defeating the Germans.
00:31:48,00:31:52,So the only problem was that the lookalike had had a finger shot off in the First World
00:31:52,00:31:54,War.
00:31:54,00:31:56,So you needed to count the fingers on the fake Monty.
00:31:56,00:31:57,Really?
00:31:57,00:32:01,He would have walked gloves or a prosthetic finger or something.
00:32:01,00:32:05,And the only thing was there was another body double who was called Keith Deema Banwell
00:32:05,00:32:07,who looked exactly like Montgomery.
00:32:07,00:32:12,"So he was used as a lookalike, the only problem was he was substantially taller than Monty"
00:32:12,00:32:16,so he was never allowed on any account to get out of his car.
00:32:16,00:32:18,That's really good.
00:32:18,00:32:22,"Was that Tex Banwell or Clifton James, I think?"
00:32:22,00:32:27,"Clifton James was the first one with Clifton James, yeah, it was called Operation Copperhead"
00:32:27,00:32:32,and basically it was when we were planning the British Replanning Tax on the Germans and
00:32:32,00:32:36,it was dispatched people who looked like him to all parts of the world.
00:32:36,00:32:39,But he was a drunk as well so he was an absolute liability I think.
00:32:39,00:32:42,It's only funny the idea of dispatching these fake Monty's everywhere.
00:32:42,00:32:47,"Well, we've had intelligence that he's an Antarctica, should be strengths and defenses"
00:32:47,00:32:48,in Antarctica.
00:32:48,00:32:53,Did you guys read about the Mexican politician who's actually looking for body doubles or he
00:32:53,00:32:55,was looking for body doubles?
00:32:55,00:33:01,"This is a guy called Renato Dronco Gomez and this was in 2015, he's a politician in the"
00:33:01,00:33:07,Mexican Parliament and he put out a call for body doubles because he wants to maintain his
00:33:07,00:33:11,"popularity and he's like, I'm so popular that I need to be in multiple places at once."
00:33:11,00:33:16,So he's trying to do an ego on the band.
00:33:16,00:33:18,"He said, and he said, I'm not that fussy."
00:33:18,00:33:21,If you're short then you can wear platform shoes.
00:33:21,00:33:24,"If you're chubby you can lose weight, if you're thin you can gain weight."
00:33:24,00:33:25,It's fine.
00:33:25,00:33:29,If you're tall I'll cut your feet off.
00:33:29,00:33:33,He said the band from smoking and drinking because he doesn't smoke and drinking has to be realistic.
00:33:33,00:33:37,"Although at any public events he stipulated that they would have to say, I'm the double"
00:33:37,00:33:41,"by the way, you're not quite getting the real guy you're getting a look alike."
00:33:41,00:33:45,"And he said, most importantly, they will not be able to live in my home, sleep with my"
00:33:45,00:33:48,wife or go to congress.
00:33:48,00:33:51,So no shagging as part of the job.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Yeah.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"It's any second most important on his list though, wasn't it?"
00:33:55,00:33:58,In order of importance between going to congress and living in my house.
00:33:58,00:34:02,"I can imagine his wife going, wait a minute, you've got no feet."
00:34:02,00:34:10,"Hey, I read a thing guys, which is that, so on the subject of body doubles, a lot of"
00:34:10,00:34:14,in movies there's obviously stunt doubles and body doubles for the biggest actors in
00:34:14,00:34:15,the world.
00:34:15,00:34:16,They all have them.
00:34:16,00:34:21,And I started looking into stunt doubles generally for this topic tonight and found this
00:34:21,00:34:27,thing where there's a lot of anger amongst the Hollywood community of stunt doubles because
00:34:27,00:34:32,there's no Oscar for stunt doubling or body doubling and that is such a huge part of the
00:34:32,00:34:33,movies.
00:34:33,00:34:36,What you see in there is making people believe that you've been blown out of a window or
00:34:36,00:34:39,they have it for special effects.
00:34:39,00:34:42,"They have a special event, but they think they should have an Oscar for it."
00:34:42,00:34:45,And I found that there's actually a big petition that's been going on.
00:34:45,00:34:50,"And as far as I could see, as of last year, they stopped pushing it to the public because"
00:34:50,00:34:52,"they didn't get the 100,000 votes that they needed."
00:34:52,00:35:01,"So it's on a site where they've managed to get 87,393 supporters and they've not quite"
00:35:01,00:35:04,"hit the 100,000 that they need."
00:35:04,00:35:08,So I'm going to read out the website for this here.
00:35:08,00:35:09,It's called thepetitionSite.com.
00:35:09,00:35:14,You've got to look for a standup for stunts and I reckon if enough people who are listening
00:35:14,00:35:20,to this podcast can just go to that site very quickly and just give them a petition support
00:35:20,00:35:25,"we could get to 100,000 maybe next year or the year after stunt people can get an Oscar"
00:35:25,00:35:26,at the main award.
00:35:26,00:35:27,How cool would that be?
00:35:27,00:35:30,But they could upscale through the ceiling and pick up their award.
00:35:30,00:35:31,"Yes, yes."
00:35:31,00:35:35,"They're so close and the last update was a year ago, so they've given up and that's so"
00:35:35,00:35:36,sad because they're incredible.
00:35:36,00:35:39,I would love to see the stunt Oscars.
00:35:39,00:35:43,"Everyone's constantly blowing shit up, smashing through the glass."
00:35:43,00:35:44,That would be incredible.
00:35:44,00:35:48,"As a member of the audience, you'd be constantly looking for the emergency exit before someone"
00:35:48,00:35:49,"said, ""No, no, no, it's fine."
00:35:49,00:35:50,"It's part of it."""
00:35:50,00:35:56,"But they are, they're more kind of omnipresent than you think, aren't they?"
00:35:56,00:36:00,So you know that bit in Notting Hill where Judy Roberts talks about people having butt
00:36:00,00:36:01,doubles.
00:36:01,00:36:04,"I always thought that was a bit that had been scripted in and wasn't true, but they all"
00:36:04,00:36:05,have body doubles.
00:36:05,00:36:11,"And in fact, really trashy piece of celebrity information, but in pretty women, Judy Roberts"
00:36:11,00:36:15,had a body double for that as she was called Shelley Michelle and actually in the really
00:36:15,00:36:19,"iconic poster of pretty women where, you know, she's kind of leaning against something and"
00:36:19,00:36:22,"she's got something over her shoulder, she's wearing some short leather skirt or something."
00:36:22,00:36:26,"The whole, the only bit of her that's Judy Roberts is the head."
00:36:26,00:36:28,The rest of that is a body.
00:36:28,00:36:33,"So it's, I just wonder so weird."
00:36:33,00:36:34,Someone else is body.
00:36:34,00:36:38,"But there are a lot of monkeys looking at that picture going, ""That's not Julia Roberts's"
00:36:38,00:36:39,"ass."""
00:36:39,00:36:43,"Guys, we need to move on to our final facts."
00:36:43,00:36:45,"James, you got something before we do?"
00:36:45,00:36:50,So I was looking at Queen's jobs because this is person who's employed to do something
00:36:50,00:36:51,for the Queen.
00:36:51,00:36:59,The Queen has a keeper of the Queen's stamps because the Queen doesn't like stamp collecting
00:36:59,00:37:02,while she has a shitload of stamps.
00:37:02,00:37:05,And so she implies someone to be her official stamp collector.
00:37:05,00:37:06,You're kidding.
00:37:06,00:37:07,I am not kidding.
00:37:07,00:37:10,"And does she go and say, ""How's my stamp collection doing?"""
00:37:10,00:37:11,I guess so.
00:37:11,00:37:16,"Why doesn't she like, does she not like the, licking the back of her own head?"
00:37:16,00:37:18,"If you collect stamps, you don't lick them."
00:37:18,00:37:19,What?
00:37:19,00:37:22,That's surely one of the perks of stamp collecting.
00:37:22,00:37:23,It's fun.
00:37:23,00:37:27,"You just can't get your stamp sac, oh, just lick that one again."
00:37:27,00:37:30,I wouldn't lick the fronts of the stamps.
00:37:30,00:37:31,That is deranged.
00:37:31,00:37:34,"Now, it's forcing her to collect stamps."
00:37:34,00:37:38,"No, she has a collection that's already there."
00:37:38,00:37:39,So she needs someone to look after it.
00:37:39,00:37:43,But this guy does go and get extra stamps for her collection.
00:37:43,00:37:44,Yeah.
00:37:44,00:37:46,So he is basically doing a hobby for her.
00:37:46,00:37:47,Yeah.
00:37:47,00:37:49,It's like having an official jigsaw maker.
00:37:49,00:37:50,Yes.
00:37:50,00:37:52,"Oh, but she does collect jigsaws."
00:37:52,00:37:53,"No, wait."
00:37:53,00:37:54,The fact is she doesn't collect jigsaws.
00:37:54,00:37:58,"Sorry, it's not, no, hang on."
00:37:58,00:38:01,It's better than it sounds.
00:38:01,00:38:02,She doesn't collect jigsaws.
00:38:02,00:38:03,She does jigsaws.
00:38:03,00:38:04,She loves them.
00:38:04,00:38:09,"But to save buying loads of jigsaws, she gets them out of her jigsaw library."
00:38:09,00:38:12,You can rent jigsaws?
00:38:12,00:38:13,Yeah.
00:38:13,00:38:14,It's just a library.
00:38:14,00:38:15,It's a free library for jigsaws.
00:38:15,00:38:16,Sorry.
00:38:16,00:38:18,Is she low on cash?
00:38:18,00:38:19,God.
00:38:19,00:38:20,She is thrifty.
00:38:20,00:38:23,"Well, I think they should put our taxes up."
00:38:23,00:38:27,"If the queen's on a four jigsaws, I'm not paying enough tax."
00:38:27,00:38:31,"Hey, listen, let's move on to our final factor, the show."
00:38:31,00:38:33,And that is Chazinski.
00:38:33,00:38:34,My fight is that.
00:38:34,00:38:44,"The US president, Jimmy Carter, once sent the nuclear launch codes to his dry cleaner."
00:38:44,00:38:47,And not on purpose.
00:38:47,00:38:53,"This is, I read this article in Timeline, which is one of my favourite websites, timeline.com."
00:38:53,00:38:57,And it's about the fact that there's been an open secret in Washington since Jimmy Carter
00:38:57,00:39:01,"was president that he lost the nuclear biscuit, as it's known, which is the little kind of"
00:39:01,00:39:05,"credit card with the codes on it, because he sent a suit to the dry cleaners."
00:39:05,00:39:09,"And it was in the pocket, because the president has to have it on him at all times."
00:39:09,00:39:11,"And it's just, it's amazing."
00:39:11,00:39:16,"Did it come back sort of slightly blurry and he was like, oh, is that a, is that a six or"
00:39:16,00:39:17,a five?
00:39:17,00:39:18,I'll wing it.
00:39:18,00:39:19,I'll wing it.
00:39:19,00:39:25,But isn't it true that basically all the presidents lose the codes all the time?
00:39:25,00:39:27,They're very scattered with it.
00:39:27,00:39:30,"We can only hope that they lose the codes all the time, from wing at the moment."
00:39:30,00:39:35,One of the problems that they do have from George W. Bush onwards is that the person carrying
00:39:35,00:39:40,"the football has to be by the president at all times, but the president often forgets that."
00:39:40,00:39:43,"So the president will finish what they're doing, hop in a car, and drive off."
00:39:43,00:39:47,"And then suddenly guy with the nuclear code is going, what do I do?"
00:39:47,00:39:52,And they have to chase after the president and try and get back to him in case he's needed
00:39:52,00:39:54,I would constantly hide as president.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"You actually would, wouldn't you?"
00:39:57,00:39:59,You'd be deliberately all the time trying to sneak off.
00:39:59,00:40:00,Yeah.
00:40:00,00:40:02,You go even in the same lift as the president.
00:40:02,00:40:05,I don't know what happens when the president asleep though.
00:40:05,00:40:07,They sleep in the same bed as them.
00:40:07,00:40:08,Do they?
00:40:08,00:40:09,Yeah.
00:40:09,00:40:14,"When you found a fact for our book, which is about the fact that if Trump goes to, yes,"
00:40:14,00:40:19,"yeah, if he goes to New York, the nuclear button has its own multi-million dollar flat in"
00:40:19,00:40:23,"New York, which he didn't, the flat didn't get used for the first eight months of the"
00:40:23,00:40:27,"presidency because he didn't go to New York, but they've hired a luxury apartment just"
00:40:27,00:40:28,for the button to sit in.
00:40:28,00:40:32,But I like the fact that it's for the button and it's also for the people who guard the button
00:40:32,00:40:33,so it's for his staff.
00:40:33,00:40:37,"But I like the idea that it is mainly for the button, so the button's in the double bed."
00:40:37,00:40:41,And the staff are just standing to attention around the bed.
00:40:41,00:40:44,"Are you comfortable, sir?"
00:40:44,00:40:46,"As you say, Clinton lost it."
00:40:46,00:40:47,"Yeah, Clinton lost it."
00:40:47,00:40:52,He kept it rubber banded to his credit cards in a trouser pocket.
00:40:52,00:40:54,Imagine that.
00:40:54,00:40:55,That makes sense.
00:40:55,00:40:56,It doesn't make sense.
00:40:56,00:40:58,It's a very crazy thing to do.
00:40:58,00:41:03,"If you accidentally put in your nuclear button card into the machine at the till, I don't"
00:41:03,00:41:06,"think that's how it sets off stuff, I don't think."
00:41:06,00:41:11,This is why they say contactless is a very dangerous technology.
00:41:11,00:41:15,"And they only found out, didn't they, when I think Clinton's aide said, look, could you"
00:41:15,00:41:19,give me the biscuit back because we need to give you an updated version.
00:41:19,00:41:22,"This came out in a autobiography here a while ago, I think that's someone called"
00:41:22,00:41:23,Patterson.
00:41:23,00:41:27,"And here's, so his aide said, give me the biscuit back because we need to swap it."
00:41:27,00:41:31,"And Clinton said, yeah, yeah, sure, I think his upstairs, I just left it upstairs, I'll go"
00:41:31,00:41:32,and get it.
00:41:32,00:41:33,And he's going around for a bit.
00:41:33,00:41:37,And then eventually he admitted that he hadn't seen it for months and he had no idea where
00:41:37,00:41:38,he put it.
00:41:38,00:41:39,"Oh, my God."
00:41:39,00:41:43,But he must have known he hadn't seen it for months and he must have been…
00:41:43,00:41:44,"Oh, he would have been convocating."
00:41:44,00:41:45,Absolutely.
00:41:45,00:41:46,Shit.
00:41:46,00:41:47,Yeah.
00:41:47,00:41:52,So there was a lot of worry that a president with this kind of power could launch based
00:41:52,00:41:55,"on, let's say, even in our current climate, you know, you get too angry one day."
00:41:55,00:41:59,"The president might suddenly go, even in the current climate, that might happen."
00:41:59,00:42:02,"Yeah, in the current blissfully calm environment, we're all living in that climate, yeah."
00:42:02,00:42:06,"But he might suddenly, you know, it's a very, it's quite an easy process to do."
00:42:06,00:42:10,"And back in the day, there was a Harvard professor who thought about this and thought, actually,"
00:42:10,00:42:13,"we need to make it a bit harder, we need to make it a big decision for the president to"
00:42:13,00:42:14,do.
00:42:14,00:42:15,So this is what he suggested.
00:42:15,00:42:18,"He said, my suggestion was quite simple."
00:42:18,00:42:24,Put the code that you needed to launch the nuclear warheads in a little capsule.
00:42:24,00:42:29,And plant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer.
00:42:29,00:42:33,"The volunteer would carry with him a big butcher's knife, as he accompanied the president."
00:42:33,00:42:38,"If the president ever wanted to fire the nuclear weapons, the only way he would do so would"
00:42:38,00:42:43,be with his own hands to kill the person and then to break it out of them in order to
00:42:43,00:42:44,do it.
00:42:44,00:42:45,Yeah.
00:42:45,00:42:51,"And that wasn't a popular suggestion, in fact, they even went for it with Peter the Grey,"
00:42:51,00:42:55,he would have absolutely loved it.
00:42:55,00:42:57,It's in here somewhere.
00:42:57,00:43:01,"Although interestingly, this is the carotid."
00:43:01,00:43:04,I think that's a very impractical suggestion.
00:43:04,00:43:07,"It's a guy Roger Fisher, he was a Harvard professor, he published it in the Bulletin of"
00:43:07,00:43:08,Atomic Science.
00:43:08,00:43:10,It was a real thing and it was very talked about.
00:43:10,00:43:11,I don't know.
00:43:11,00:43:15,"The president constantly being company, but his man with a knife."
00:43:15,00:43:19,"This absolutely terrified, lucky man with a knife, is that?"
00:43:19,00:43:20,How?
00:43:20,00:43:23,"Just to finish that off, because I found that as well."
00:43:23,00:43:25,"They suggested it to the Pentagon, didn't they?"
00:43:25,00:43:26,Yeah.
00:43:26,00:43:29,"And the Pentagon said, my God, that's terrible."
00:43:29,00:43:32,"Having to kill someone would distort the president's judgment, he might never push the"
00:43:32,00:43:33,button.
00:43:33,00:43:34,Really?
00:43:34,00:43:35,Wow.
00:43:35,00:43:36,Wow.
00:43:36,00:43:41,"So, like you said, there are two things, isn't there?"
00:43:41,00:43:43,"There's this card, which is the biscuit."
00:43:43,00:43:44,Yeah.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"And then there's the briefcase, which is the football."
00:43:46,00:43:51,The briefcase is manufactured by a company called Zero Halliburton.
00:43:51,00:43:56,"Okay, and Zero Halliburton, they were Utah firm, and they do this, and the other thing is"
00:43:56,00:43:58,they do aluminium briefcases for Hollywood.
00:43:58,00:44:07,"So they've made briefcases for 24, West Wing, Independence Day, and Santa with Muscles."
00:44:07,00:44:10,That's the main ones.
00:44:10,00:44:15,Santa with Muscles is the 79th worst rated film in the whole of IMDB.
00:44:15,00:44:16,Wow.
00:44:16,00:44:17,No way.
00:44:17,00:44:18,Wow.
00:44:18,00:44:19,In the whole thing.
00:44:19,00:44:20,In the whole thing.
00:44:20,00:44:22,There must be billions in there.
00:44:22,00:44:26,"Sorry, they make, so they make this, they make, well, they're not fake because they need to"
00:44:26,00:44:32,"use them in the movies, but these really are some kind of aluminium briefcases, because"
00:44:32,00:44:36,"the guy who invented it realized that briefcases are not so good, and aluminium ones will"
00:44:36,00:44:37,be better.
00:44:37,00:44:39,And they're good for carrying nuclear codes.
00:44:39,00:44:42,"The nuclear codes that they have, by the way, are pretty weird, so that it's basically"
00:44:42,00:44:51,"two lists, and they're pictorial, and one list is places to bomb, and the other one is how"
00:44:51,00:44:53,to bomb them.
00:44:53,00:44:59,"So you basically go down, you go, ""Hell, go for this one, Pyongyang, and this one, a big"
00:44:59,00:45:00,"fuck off bomb."""
00:45:00,00:45:01,Wow.
00:45:01,00:45:05,"I can't, but, I mean, the one thing keeping the world safe was the idea that Trump would have"
00:45:05,00:45:07,to read more than six words.
00:45:07,00:45:11,A military aide to Bill Clinton said it was like a Denny's breakfast menu.
00:45:11,00:45:12,Yeah.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"He said, ""You picked one out of Colomé, and two out of Colomé."""
00:45:15,00:45:17,But it's bad.
00:45:17,00:45:23,"I wonder how seriously, because it obviously scares you to hear that this thing exists generally,"
00:45:23,00:45:24,I think.
00:45:24,00:45:25,But I don't know how seriously they took it.
00:45:25,00:45:31,So the fact is about Jimmy Carter having sent it accidentally the codes to the dry cleaners.
00:45:31,00:45:36,"When Jimmy Carter first got the nuclear football, it was given to him by the LBJ presidential"
00:45:36,00:45:42,"administration, and when it was brought to him, the guy looked inside the briefcase when"
00:45:42,00:45:48,"he first opened it in the companionship of, when he was with Jimmy Carter."
00:45:48,00:45:51,"And inside it, when they opened it, they found that the previous administration was having"
00:45:51,00:45:58,"a bit of a joke, because they left inside it an empty beer can and a condom not for humans"
00:45:58,00:45:59,for horses.
00:45:59,00:46:04,And that was inside the most deadly bag that a president could have next to them.
00:46:04,00:46:05,And he didn't tell Jimmy Carter.
00:46:05,00:46:06,He closed it.
00:46:06,00:46:07,"He went, ""Yup, it's all good."""
00:46:07,00:46:09,And Jimmy Carter never found out about that.
00:46:09,00:46:10,What?
00:46:10,00:46:11,Yeah.
00:46:11,00:46:12,The horses have condoms.
00:46:12,00:46:13,I didn't know that either.
00:46:13,00:46:14,No.
00:46:14,00:46:15,Yeah.
00:46:15,00:46:16,For me is the headline from that story.
00:46:16,00:46:17,Yeah.
00:46:17,00:46:18,Yeah.
00:46:18,00:46:20,How do they put them on?
00:46:20,00:46:23,"Yeah, I've not even thought about."
00:46:23,00:46:24,Nobody knows.
00:46:24,00:46:31,"On the US News, so there is a secretive US agency, and their job is to transport all the"
00:46:31,00:46:35,"nuclear material around America, because obviously you've got loads of missile silos, you've"
00:46:35,00:46:39,"got loads of nuclear science, and very few people know about this, but they're called"
00:46:39,00:46:44,"the Office of Secure Transportation, and their vehicles sound absolutely insane."
00:46:44,00:46:49,"So the defenses, obviously, they've got convoys they go with, but the defenses include"
00:46:49,00:46:54,"shock delivering systems, which basically means if you touch it, it electrocutes you."
00:46:54,00:46:58,"They've got axles which explode, so you can't drive them away even if you do manage to"
00:46:58,00:46:59,take over it.
00:46:59,00:47:04,And they also have thick walls which ooze immobilizing foam.
00:47:04,00:47:05,Wow.
00:47:05,00:47:12,"So if you are wrong and you touch the lorry, it just oozes out at you, and then catches"
00:47:12,00:47:13,you like you're on fly paper.
00:47:13,00:47:16,"It's so weird, because foam isn't that immobilizing."
00:47:16,00:47:17,I put in baths.
00:47:17,00:47:18,Yeah.
00:47:18,00:47:23,I think of how difficult it is to get out of the bath.
00:47:23,00:47:24,Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:26,"They have special stuff, don't they?"
00:47:26,00:47:27,I think it's special.
00:47:27,00:47:28,It's special foam.
00:47:28,00:47:29,Yeah.
00:47:29,00:47:30,It's a mobilizing foam.
00:47:30,00:47:31,Got it.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Not palm or live.
00:47:32,00:47:34,Black or African bubble bath.
00:47:34,00:47:38,"We're going to have to wrap up in a sec, anything before we do, guys."
00:47:38,00:47:42,I can tell you that we've been talking about American nuclear bombs.
00:47:42,00:47:44,We have nuclear bombs as well in the UK.
00:47:44,00:47:49,And it is technically legal for Prince Charles to set off a nuclear bomb.
00:47:49,00:47:50,No.
00:47:50,00:47:51,That's true.
00:47:51,00:47:52,It's true.
00:47:52,00:47:54,It's because he is the Duke of Cornwall.
00:47:54,00:47:58,"And if you're Duke of Cornwall, there's a few laws you technically don't have to follow."
00:47:58,00:48:02,And one of them is the Nuclear Explosions Act.
00:48:02,00:48:04,The other one is the Data Protection Act.
00:48:04,00:48:07,And another one is the Wildlife and Countryside Act.
00:48:07,00:48:11,"So it means, as well as being able to set off nuclear bombs, he can share your email address"
00:48:11,00:48:15,with third parties.
00:48:15,00:48:23,"And technically, he's allowed to shoot a great-crested newt with a machine gun."
00:48:23,00:48:27,That's amazing.
00:48:27,00:48:29,OK.
00:48:29,00:48:30,That is it.
00:48:30,00:48:31,That is all of our facts.

00:48:55,00:48:59,"Also got a link to our book, which we're about to give a copy away to one member of"
00:48:59,00:49:01,the audience here in Birmingham.
00:49:01,00:49:04,We asked you to send in your facts before the show started.
00:49:04,00:49:06,And here we go.
00:49:06,00:49:07,This is the fact.
00:49:07,00:49:08,"Andy, what is it?"
00:49:08,00:49:09,I've got it.
00:49:09,00:49:11,I'm just taking the phone off airplane mode.
00:49:11,00:49:12,Unbelievable.
00:49:12,00:49:13,OK.
00:49:13,00:49:16,So this fact was sent in by a man called Steven Conneber.
00:49:16,00:49:23,And his fact is that the game Cludo was invented by a Pratt from Birmingham.
00:49:23,00:49:24,Sorry.
00:49:24,00:49:26,That's a Pratt from Birmingham.
00:49:26,00:49:31,And it was called Murder at Tudor Close.
00:49:31,00:49:32,Wow.
00:49:32,00:49:33,Cool.
00:49:33,00:49:34,OK.
00:49:34,00:49:37,"Well, if you're here, come and grab a book from us at the end."
00:49:37,00:49:38,"Guys, as I said at the beginning, we're going to be in the back."
00:49:38,00:49:39,We've got books.
00:49:39,00:49:43,"If you want to get one, we'll be there signing them."
00:49:43,00:49:47,"Hopefully, I don't know how much time we have, but we'll try and bang through as many"
00:49:47,00:49:48,of you as possible.
00:49:48,00:49:49,And then we'll study on them.
00:49:49,00:49:52,"I mean, in the correct climate, then."
00:49:52,00:49:53,Bad choice of words.
00:49:53,00:49:57,Bad choice of words.
00:49:57,00:49:59,"But Birmingham, this has been awesome."
00:49:59,00:50:02,"And by the way, just before we wrap up, because again, we're doing these bigger venues, we"
00:50:02,00:50:04,thought we'd end on something special.
00:50:04,00:50:08,"We have here tonight, as I said, the singer and songwriter, Emperor Yes, Ash Gardener is"
00:50:08,00:50:09,here.
00:50:09,00:50:14,And we're going to go out by playing our theme tune live for you guys tonight as I go.
00:50:14,00:50:15,Yeah.
00:50:15,00:50:18,"So please welcome to the stage, ladies and gentlemen."
00:50:18,00:50:21,It is Ash Gardener.
00:50:21,00:50:23,"There he is, everybody."
00:50:23,00:50:24,"And thank you so much, Birmingham."
00:50:24,00:50:25,That was awesome.
00:50:25,00:50:26,Thank you.
