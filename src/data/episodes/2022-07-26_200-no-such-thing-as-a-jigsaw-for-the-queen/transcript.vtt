00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, I want to celebrate the fact that this is our 200th episode.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.000
 Oh, no such thing as a fish. Thanks for that, Dan.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080
 A little woohoo.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 Yep, for the second one.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.680
 And the way I've celebrated our 200th episode is by making a mistake.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.800
 Yep, last week's episode, there was an incorrect fact in it.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.120
 So we recorded the show live in Leicester, and my fact was about how the Walker's crisp factory

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.840
 can't tell the difference between golf balls and crisps.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.000
 And after we recorded this show, someone came up to me, he was called Greg Hilliard,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.560
 and he actually works in the Walker's crisp factory, and he informed me that fact was out of date

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.080
 because they've now created a machine that can distinguish between the two.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.320
 So in the last couple of years, so walkers can now tell the difference between golf balls and crisps.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.960
 Happy birthday, no such thing as a fish.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:17.200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.280
 Guys, I'm trying to do the intro here.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:32.320
 It's a weekly podcast, coming to you from Birmingham!

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anne Chasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.800
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.040
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact this week is that in Brussels, there is a

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.760
 commemorative statue to where Peter the Great once vomited.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:07.240
 That was so cool!

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.840
 Anyone else want to vomit at this stage?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.880
 Is it in the shape of vomit, or what?

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 Would you mean, oh, the statue?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.920
 No, it's of Peter the Great, yeah, yeah, but what it was is he was over in Brussels,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.520
 and he was out just having a big day, and he had a bit too much of a big day, and they pulled

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.240
 over to where this sort of little fountain he bitters, and he vomited, and it was established

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.840
 that that's what he did, historically, and then years later, it was in 1856, there was a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.440
 prince who donated a statue to say we need to commemorate this, so it said it had this little

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 plaque on it, which says, "As he sat on the edge of this fountain, he enabled its waters

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 with the wine of his libations."

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.160
 Did I say any of the words right, and that was close enough, yeah?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
 Yes, I think his.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.720
 Peter the Great was obviously, in one sense, this very grand historical figure, probably

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.880
 the most influential czar Russia ever had, early 18th century, influenced everything that

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:13.160
 came off him, but also he was an absolute lad, so he founded a drinking society called, it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 was originally called the Jolly Company, and then it was called the All-Joking All-Drunken

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.760
 Sinod of Fools and Gestors, and it had a few rules, so there were rules like you were never

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.600
 allowed to go to bed sober, you always had to empty your cup when instructed to, and they

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.400
 just did mad stuff all the time, just constantly fooling around, so there was, I think there

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.360
 was something where his favourite jester got married, he had this jester, and he decided

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.400
 he was xar by this time, so he could do whatever he wanted, so he decided to make this wedding

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.720
 like a massive royal deal, and he gave his jester his xar's carriage, and then him and his

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.000
 drinking society wore boots made of straw, and they wore gloves in the, like, made of mice,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.680
 so they shoved their hands into mice, and they wore-

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.680
 What?

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.680
 Sorry.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.680
 Do you mean like finger puppets?

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 No.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.680
 Must think mouse skin, right?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.920
 They weren't putting the hand up a mouse's-

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
 Oh, yeah, okay.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.720
 Well, I don't know 'cause they wore squirrels' tails and cat's paws just hanging off their clothes

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.640
 for fun, and then they made the married couple enter Moscow on the back of a camel, and then

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.840
 they just spent three days getting absolutely smashed, and as one biographer put it, the joke

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.960
 may have been carried too far because the groom died during the celebrations.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960
 May.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.080
 May have been carried too far.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.880
 That's a historian's way of looking at it, isn't it?

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.440
 He was a terrifying man, so he was a six foot seven.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.360
 He had a standing desk, that's not terrifying, but the standing desk he had, the writing surface

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.640
 was five foot six inches off the floor.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640
 Wow.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.640
 He was huge.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.960
 Yeah, and also the other thing about him, he was obsessed with dwarfs.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.440
 So when he was a baby, this is before he was-

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.560
 To him that everyone would have been a dwarf, but he had a retinue of dwarfs acting as

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.320
 his servants and playmates, and he had a mini carriage, and he would ride in it, drawn

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.040
 by four dwarf ponies with four dwarfs riding their own horses at the side.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.360
 And even in later life, he became obsessed with dwarfs in pies.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.720
 He loved a dwarf jumping out of a pie at a banquet.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.720
 Really?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.120
 He was obsessed with it.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.360
 Often naked, naked dwarfs jumping out of pies, he was really into, yeah.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.440
 So Simon C. Back at Montefuri wrote a really good biography, and he basically said, all of

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.160
 the parties they had had naked girls jumping out of pies, dwarves being tossed, dwarves dressed

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.280
 as old men, old men dressed as dwarves, all of them naked except for the bishop who would

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.720
 be carrying dildos on a cushion.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.080
 But that's the thing about it, is this thing that he did this club, it was called a synod, wasn't

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.080
 it?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.920
 And so it was basically to take the piss out of the church.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 Yeah.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920
 That's why he did the whole time.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.920
 So instead of Holy Water, they would scatter vodka.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920
 Wow.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.400
 And if you were ever caught being sober, you'd get ex-communicated from his club.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.440
 But the worst thing was, if you got ex-communicated, you were barred from all the pubs in the whole

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440
 of Russia.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.440
 Oh.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440
 Wow.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440
 No way.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440
 Way.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440
 Wow.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.440
 Imagine the horror, Anna.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440
 You.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.520
 Listening at home, you want to be able to imagine the horror on Anna's face right now.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.320
 He did another thing where, so he did a number of trips to Europe, he was famous for these massive

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:25.320
 trips, and one time he came back and he was so impressed by the clean shavenness of the Europeans

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.760
 that he imposed a beard tax into Russia, but the way he did it was, he came back and they

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.560
 threw a massive reception for him, and he was giving a sort of arousing speech, and everyone

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560
 said it was elation.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.560
 Everyone was so excited.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:42.520
 And then it turned to horror when he suddenly said, I don't want beards anymore, and he pulls

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:47.480
 out a massive razor, and he starts shaving the faces of people who were attending.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.760
 What they thought was just a pleasant talk of a homecoming hero, and they all left without

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760
 their face hair.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.840
 But he did the tax to start off with, and then when people started paying the tax, he

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.560
 just went, oh, I'm just going to ban them then.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560
 So he just didn't want beards at all, because he saw that as an example of the old Russia,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.040
 and he was a great modernizer of Russia.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.320
 So he had a law that everyone had to dress as either a Hungarian, a Frenchman or a German.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:18.280
 That was because he knew a very funny joke about a Hungarian, a Frenchman.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.000
 But with the beard tax, the thing was, with the tax, they gave you these coins, and I didn't

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.840
 realize these coins are still in existence.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.880
 This is from the 1700s, and you can see them.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.600
 These pictures online, where it's like a sort of a goatee and a little, what's that bit?

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.400
 A soul patch, a soul patch kind of thing, but like Satan would have, you know, the more

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400
 pointy one.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400
 A goatee.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400
 Oh, yeah, a goatee.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.280
 So that would be on the coin, and you would carry your coin around with you.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.760
 So if you were seen in the streets with a beard, they'd go, where's your coin, and you'd

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760
 look around for the coin.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.320
 And if you didn't have your coin, they'd shave your face on the spot.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.800
 He took Russia back 5,000 years, as well as being a massive modernizer.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.800
 What do you mean?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:05.480
 He left Russia in the year 7,206, and he got back, and he said, "I don't want this anymore,"

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.720
 because Russia used to begin at 5,508 BC, and he left Russia for the West, and he found,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.000
 "Oh, it's 1700 here, well, I prefer this."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.440
 And so he came back and said, "Right, it's 1700, forget the 7,200 nonsense, changing it.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.960
 Beardstone exists in the future."

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.960
 That's so cool.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.280
 So he just altered time, and he trained as a shipbuilder.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280
 Did he?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:34.340
 When he was touring Europe, he personally went to a shipyard and just worked there in Amsterdam

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.400
 for months, and he cooked his own meals, and he lit his own fires, and he ignored anybody

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.000
 who called him your majesty.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 He answered only to carpenter Peter.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.240
 He was very eccentric, but an incredibly practical man in loads of ways.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
 Yeah.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.000
 He liked cutting something else off people, so you would be actually thankful if he cut your

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.360
 beard off, because he loved cutting people's heads off himself.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.760
 So usually as a world leader at the time, people were beheaded, but you know, you'd get your

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.200
 executioner to do it, but he really liked to be there in the thick of it, and so he did

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.240
 lots of executions himself, and he was really fascinated by it enough to me, again, because

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.720
 I think he liked Europeans, and they were maybe ahead in biology.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.840
 If he comes at you with a razor, at what stage do you know he's going to go for the beard

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840
 and not cut your hair?

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840
 Yeah.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.160
 That's got to be absolutely terrifying.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.640
 It comes out with a great big axe.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.480
 No, this is just my beard axe, don't worry.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.920
 He actually had a mistress called Mary Hamilton, and then she ended up being beheaded as

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:35.080
 lots of mistresses did, and when she was beheaded, he was there, and as soon as she was beheaded,

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:40.400
 he lifted up her head in front of the crown, so we're all watching, and he gave them all

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.320
 a medical lesson on anatomy, so he turned her neck side out, and was like, this is the

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.280
 shrekia, this is her carotid artery, and then he gave her a big snog, and then he dropped

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.480
 the head and walked away.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.480
 He gave her a snog?

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.000
 Yeah, he gave her a big kiss on the list.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.360
 So this fact was sent to me by a listener of our podcast called Carrie, and I loved it

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.280
 because there are amazing statues all over the world that represent very odd things.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:11.120
 I found one which I've been trying to track down, whether the truth of this, which is

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.840
 George Washington in Trafalgar Square, very close to where we work in Covern Garden, literally

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.160
 a walking distance.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.120
 There's a statue of George Washington there, outside the National Portrait Gallery,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.600
 and it was donated by the Americans, however, there was a sentence that George Washington

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.600
 said just before he died, which is he said, "I would never will stand on British soil again."

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.640
 And as a result, it is said, and this is what tour guides tell everyone, that as they were

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.680
 putting down the statue of George Washington, they imported American soil and sitting underneath

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.300
 it is American soils, so he still is not standing, but what's under the American soil?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.320
 It's more British soil.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.880
 How far down does this go, basically?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:00.800
 On vomiting, and on American presidents, actually, Ulysses S. Grant was president, and also

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.440
 he was prominent in the Civil War and the American Civil War before that, and so he was kind

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.360
 of a war hero, but at the same time he was an alcoholic.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:13.480
 So he used to sweep whiskey wherever he went, apparently, and at one point in battle, he

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.640
 vomited into his horse's mane.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640
 Oh!

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.360
 Yeah, and just went on with it.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.920
 What about George W. Bush?

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.920
 Was it George W. Bush?

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.520
 No, it's George H. W. Bush, wasn't it?

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.520
 Yeah.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:31.120
 Who vomited on the lap of Japan's Prime Minister in 1992, and as a result, the Japanese

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:39.760
 coined the phrase "Bushu Suru", meaning embarrassing public vomiting, or literally to do a

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.760
 bush.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.840
 Because that is frowned on, isn't it, in Japan?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.800
 Yeah, actually, everywhere.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800
 What?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.520
 Oh, I've got so many apologetic texts to say.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.320
 Do you know, he was so good-natured about that moment, though, so he kind of collapsed

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320
 with his dinner.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.320
 He'd been feeling bad anyway.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.680
 I think, because he'd just played a tennis match against Japanese Emperor, and he'd

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680
 lost.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.560
 So he was feeling really unwell after that, and he collapsed onto the floor, vomited, passed

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:09.760
 out, and as soon as he woke up with the Japanese Prime Minister there, above him saying, "You're

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760
 okay."

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.960
 He said, "Why don't you just roll me under the table, and I'll sleep it off while you're

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.960
 finished dinner?"

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.960
 Really?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.440
 It was just quite cool, yeah.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:24.480
 One thing about Peter the Great is, at his parties, he would train bears to serve alcohol,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:29.880
 and they would growl and harass those who said no.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:35.000
 So I thought I'd look at some other awesome parties, and I really like the engagement party

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.800
 of the newspaper Magnet Gordon Bennett.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.960
 He turned up at his own engagement party, so drunk that he immediately urinated into the

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:49.400
 living room fireplace, in full view of his hosts, and it's in the Guinness Book of Records

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.600
 as the greatest engagement faux pas.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.160
 And it's supposed to be where we get the phrase, "Gordon Bennett", something bad, yeah.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:05.920
 Guinness is still accepting any advance on urinating into the fireplace.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920
 Okay.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.920
 Go for it.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.760
 I think we could smash that.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.560
 During the Jin craze, there was quite a few good parties.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:17.720
 So this was in the 18th century, and a lot of people were drinking Jin, especially in London.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.440
 There was an author called Henry McKenzie, who was at a drinking party, and he didn't

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:28.000
 want to drink anymore, so he fell to the floor to disguise himself as a drunken body.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.640
 And then soon after, he felt a small hand around his neck, and he was like, "What's going

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.640
 on?"

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.920
 And he confronted the boy who was doing it, and apparently the boy said it was his job

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.880
 to loosen the neck ties of the guests to prevent them from choking on their own vomit.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880
 Wow.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.000
 If you have to hire someone to do that, yeah.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.880
 I had at my stag-do party.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.400
 Oh, are we really?

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.120
 Yeah, just before I did my speech.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.120
 My brother made me drink what, in Australia, is called a Shoey, and they do it on the Formula

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.120
 One.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.400
 You fill a shoe full of beer, and you have to drink the whole shoe of beer.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.400
 So I did that.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.720
 Right after I decided I'd say a quick thank you to everyone that came, and I did that, passed

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.240
 out, woke up in the morning, and thought, "I did a pretty good speech last night, and

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.400
 my brother said I recorded it."

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.800
 I thought it was like about two minutes, 45 minutes, and a 45 minute speech.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800
 Who's Shoe?

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800
 Did you have to drink up?

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800
 My brother's, it was disgusting.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800
 Because he's a clown, isn't he?

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.640
 That was a problem.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.280
 Let's move on to our second fact of the show.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:36.400
 Okay, my fact this week is that only one study has ever found that men are better than women

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.800
 at recognising faces.

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:47.120
 It was a study looking at the recognition of the Transformers.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:51.600
 I know that's bad, obviously, but internally I'm thinking, yeah, I'm pretty good at recognising

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600
 Transformers.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600
 This is true.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.040
 And they're robots in disguise, so that's even better, right?

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.120
 So this is obviously like an on average thing, so you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.480
 would be worse at recognising Transformers than Dan, just on average women are worse than

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.480
 men.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.120
 Although you know that I asked you earlier what Transformers were, and that was having

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.440
 just read the Wikipedia page of Transformers, wasn't it?

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.760
 I still didn't understand it.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.760
 I was thinking to stereotype.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.400
 And you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna would be worse than Anna at recognising Barbie

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.560
 faces, which is the other part of this study.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.440
 So they took Barbie faces and they took Transformer faces, and they found the women were better

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.320
 at recognising Barbie, and the men were better at recognising Transformers.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:37.920
 And what they think is this is a study about looking where that experience is important

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.960
 when it comes to recognising faces.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:43.320
 So they found these things where they thought women would have more experience in looking

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.480
 at Barbies, and men would have more experience in looking at Transformers.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:51.080
 And they found that maybe experience has something to do with it, but actually overall women are

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.920
 a lot, lot better than men are looking at faces.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.640
 Yeah, because Anna, I think I read a study, and this is off-memories, they're very risky

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:05.040
 right now, but the also women, because of the genetic material instinct, then you kind

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.000
 of have to be primed to recognise people more often, and you have to take an interest

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.040
 in more people so you can form a bond with them, and as soon as you form an emotional

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.440
 bond with people, then you're more likely to recognise the next time you see them.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.440
 Yeah, it could be that.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:18.440
 It could be that.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.520
 But it's probably the Barbie thing.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.800
 So you have these things called face patches in your brain, and there's these little bits,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.440
 they're about the size of a blueberry, and they are specifically for recognising faces.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.480
 So they've test, they don't respond if you get shown another body part, but they do respond

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.840
 if you get shown a face.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.800
 And they are so predictable these face patches that scientists tried it out with monkeys, monkeys

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.440
 also have face patches.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:45.040
 And they would measure the electrical activity of the face cells, and then they could recreate

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.760
 the face that the monkey had seen accurately.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760
 No.

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.760
 Yes.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.760
 From the activity in the brain cells.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:51.760
 Wow.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.760
 That is magic.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.480
 But monkeys don't aren't recognising faces, I don't think are they?

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.880
 I think great apes are, but monkeys are quite bad.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.360
 They aren't good, though, at recognising bottoms.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.360
 Oh yeah.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.960
 Monkeys, chimpanzees, especially recognise each other by the bottoms, the way that we recognise

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.400
 each other by the face.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400
 Well, not exactly the same way.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.000
 Well, the same way, but upside down.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
 Yeah.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.400
 Does that mean they back into every social engagement?

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.400
 They go ask first.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.920
 Well, then they can't, because one of them has to be face first in order to see the ass.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.560
 It's unbelievably embarrassing when one comes in ask first, and another one comes in ask first.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.240
 Imagine that in an engagement.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.240
 Yeah.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.240
 But you know how they tested this?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.640
 They tested it by showing them, they showed humans' faces and then faces upside down.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.400
 And it's much, humans are much slower to recognise faces when they turned upside down.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.760
 They then showed the chimpanzees, arses, chimpanzees arses, and then arses upside down.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.000
 And the slowdown was the same, whereas humans did not slow down when they were shown a normal

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.960
 bottom and then an upside down bottom, which they also did for this experiment.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.320
 Could the humans recognise the bottoms?

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:00.320
 No.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.200
 They also could not recognise upside down bottoms.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200
 Okay.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200
 I got it.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200
 Yeah.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.680
 I just thought maybe I'd have a quick game of transformer or Barbie.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680
 Oh, okay.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
 Great.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.240
 We can't do the images, because this is a podcast.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.240
 Yeah.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.960
 What I can do is give you some names of either these are people from transformers, not people,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960
 transformers.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.840
 They're either transformers from transformers.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.280
 They're people to me, James.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.840
 Or toys from the Barbie universe.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840
 Okay.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840
 Okay.

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.040
 So, dude, a friend of Ken.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.040
 Yeah.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.440
 Must be a Barbie thing.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
 Transformer.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:37.440
 It is everyone?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.440
 Barbie.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440
 They knew it.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440
 Yeah.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.440
 Yeah.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
 It's a friend of Jazzy.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440
 What?

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440
 Slag.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.440
 Barbie.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.680
 Is that a Barbie doll?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680
 I think it is.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680
 Is it a transformer?

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.760
 I think it's an incredibly ill-conceived Barbie.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.480
 It's a triceratops dyno bot.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480
 Oh.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.480
 It's how I got it.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.480
 M.C.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:03.480
 Hammer.

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.480
 Barbie.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.480
 Barbie.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.480
 Yeah.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.480
 He's got it.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.480
 Yeah.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480
 Yeah.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.480
 Because they do celebrity Barbies.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 There's an Angela Merkel as well.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.400
 Yeah.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.400
 Yeah.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.840
 I tried to get one and they'd said it was for sale, but then it turned out it was they brought

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.440
 it just to an EU conference.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.960
 Barbie created an Angela Merkel Barbie and so it's not for sale for general public.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.960
 It should be.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.840
 It is if you pay 50 billion pounds.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:28.840
 Yes.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840
 Yeah.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840
 One more.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840
 Alan.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840
 Oh.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840
 Transformer.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840
 Transformer.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840
 Yeah.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840
 Transformer.

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840
 Who's the transformer?

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.840
 Who?

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:39.840
 Who's the Barbie?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:40.840
 Yeah.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.840
 Yeah.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.840
 Who doesn't give a shit?

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840
 Yeah.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840
 Yeah.

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840
 Okay.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.840
 It's time for factor three then.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.400
 Well, the answer is you were right not to give a shit because it's both.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.400
 Oh.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.840
 It's a high-speed train and someone who's married to Barbie's friend Mitch.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.840
 What?

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:00.560
 I'm beg your pardon.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.560
 I said Mitch.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.560
 Oh, Mitch.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:03.560
 Cool.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:09.560
 I mean, if her friend was called Mitch, that would have been one of my…

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:15.480
 So you may well have heard of these guys called super recognisers.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.200
 So they're police officers and they're incredibly good at recognising a criminal's face

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.360
 is based on really blurry CCTV.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:27.320
 So in the metropolitan police, they identify a quarter of all the criminals, despite the

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.760
 fact that out of 32,000 metropolitan police officers, there are only six super recognisers

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.680
 and they get a quarter.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.320
 And they're so good that one officer was interviewed for the Guardian and he said, "I was

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.520
 coming back from court and I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences because they

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:43.520
 just spot.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.000
 They remember the faces of people who were wanted and they just see them and they go, "That

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
 guy."

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.720
 I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.960
 Once I had to stop the car three times, I would take one person in and then on the way

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.880
 to the station, I saw someone else who was wanted.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.760
 So I picked them up and then as we were driving, I saw someone else.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760
 No.

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.760
 Yeah.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760
 They're just constantly seeing crooks.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760
 Wow.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:07.760
 Do you know who was very bad at recognising people was back to American President Ronald

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.760
 Reagan.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:14.960
 So he had to speak at a graduation ceremony in 1964 and he was giving, you know, the graduation

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:20.640
 certificate to students and boy came up on stage and he shut the boy's hand, gave him a

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.400
 certificate and said, "My name's Ronald.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.400
 What's yours?"

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400
 And the boy said, "I'm Michael.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400
 I'm your son."

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400
 Oh.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:27.400
 Yeah.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.440
 It was his adoptive son.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.040
 They adopted him when he was a baby.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.640
 He was 19 by that point.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.640
 Oh.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.520
 I mean, for an actor who has to recognise people, you would think that would be a flaw,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.000
 not being able to recognise other humans.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 You would think.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
 Yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 That's your actors need to recognise people?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
 Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
 I mean, it helps if you're facing the right way.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.120
 You want me to recognise the camera then, no?

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120
 I guess so.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120
 Do you know what it is?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.920
 I just because I can't recognise people, so I'm just a bit worried I can't do an actor.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.320
 James has genuine face blindness.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320
 He doesn't remember faces.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.320
 Yeah, kind of.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.080
 I have no imagination.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:06.400
 Oh, James, I thought those poems you showed me were wonderful.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.600
 That whole Barbie Transformer game was top.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.480
 I can't imagine people's faces.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.520
 I can't imagine what my wife looks like, for instance.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.360
 So, he's not proper face blindness.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.760
 It's A-Fantasia, it's cold, but it means that I can't recognise people very well.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.760
 A-Fantasia?

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:21.760
 Yeah.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.760
 What a whimsical name for presumably a bad condition.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:24.760
 Oh, it's not.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:25.760
 It's not that bad.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.760
 It's not that bad.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.760
 It's not fair to say it.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760
 It's not fair to say it.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.760
 It's not fair to say it.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760
 It's not fair to say it.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760
 You are.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:43.320
 I'm your wife.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.800
 Just one quick thing about face recognition.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.520
 This year, there was a festival in Wales that used facial recognition technology to recognise

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.520
 evil elvises.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
 Wow.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 They were trying to scan for people who were wanted, same as the A and L, when they were on

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.520
 their way into the world's largest Elvis festival in Bridgend in September, 35,000 people were

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.520
 going in.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.600
 Most of them dressed as Elvis and officers scanned their faces all.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.760
 And what they were looking for, bad guys, all.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.760
 Yeah.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.760
 Bad guys.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.560
 Well, there's a thing as well in Barcelona.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.960
 They've tested out this new thing at comedy clubs whereby they've put on the back of seats

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.760
 little cameras that stairs directly into the face of the person sitting watching the

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.960
 comedy show and it's there to monitor laughter patterns so every time you laugh, it clicks and

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.560
 says you've laughed once.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.240
 So if people at the end of the show go up and say, I found that very disappointing, I would

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.240
 like a refund.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.000
 They can go, "Well, actually, you've laughed 67 times this evening and you can't have your

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 money back.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
 There's one.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
 Yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.280
 Everyone's fake laughs at a comedy show, don't think for a minute, we genuinely think you're

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280
 laughing.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.280
 Everyone's put on a fake.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.880
 You could be laughing at how shit it is.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:03.080
 No, it's a test to see how it would work because what they do is they then they drop the

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.560
 price altogether of the ticket and so they clock up everyone's, this is free gig.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.560
 You go to it.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.080
 They clock up the laughter amount and then at the end of the gig, they say you've laughed

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.800
 and there's a cap on how much laughter it is.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.200
 Everyone's just going to go, "I'm just going to enjoy this but I'm not going to laugh

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.200
 so I get it for free."

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.200
 It's going to be awful.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.200
 Yeah.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.980
 Mouth closed, looks straight ahead, think of death, think of old people, just think of

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:25.980
 sadness.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.420
 Some people don't laugh even when they're finding things really funny.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.000
 You keep telling yourself that after your Edinburgh show, I'd refer you to the audiences at

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.720
 my solo show, who had a wonderful time on the feedback forms, just explained a lot of

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:45.620
 them were remembering something sad.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.080
 Go quickly tell you my favorite headline that I've read recently.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.960
 This is about recognising stuff.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:55.400
 The headline is that babies can see things that adults can't but are unable to tell them.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.960
 They'll look at a picture and they'll notice differences that we won't have spotted or

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.880
 maybe they haven't told us that we don't know.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.880
 That's what they think.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.600
 So how do we know they can see the differences?

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600
 I don't know.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600
 I didn't read the article.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600
 I just read the headline.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.560
 That's going to go on your headstone, Dan.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.360
 Should we move on to another episode?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360
 Yeah.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.360
 Okay.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.840
 It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.560
 My fact is that there is a woman whose job for the last 30 years has been squatting above

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.200
 the Queen's throne so the TV cameras can get their angle right.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200
 That is amazing.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.440
 The Queen doesn't squat above the throne, does she?

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.440
 No.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.440
 Exactly.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 Certainly not.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.200
 Bella Slack and she's in her early 70s, she is the official stand-in for the Queen at

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.480
 all events where there are going to be TV cameras because she's pretty much exactly the same

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.280
 size as the Queen.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.640
 And she doesn't look like the Queen at all, but she does it and she's done it 50 times

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640
 with different state occasions.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640
 Why the squatting thing?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640
 That's what I want to know.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.560
 Well, she said she was interviewed about her life, not quite being the Queen.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.680
 By quite a long way not being the Queen, but she's not even in the line of succession

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.680
 frames.

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.920
 That's what makes you famous these days not being the Queen.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.920
 Well, she said about the ceremony.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.840
 How long have you not been the Queen?

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.880
 She said about the ceremonies, "I've never been allowed to sit on the throne in the House

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.480
 of Lords for the State opening of Parliament."

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.480
 Oh, I see.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.520
 She said, "I have to lurk above it."

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520
 Yeah.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.760
 But she says it's a very strict rule and she does say, "If I'm in a carriage or a car, I

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.760
 will wave."

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.640
 Which is very sweet, yeah.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.600
 She was employed over 30 years ago when it was realised that the Queen had the sun in her

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.000
 eyes at some event, and so the Queen might have the sun in her eyes, but she was selling

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
 on a podium.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.560
 And so this woman was sent to check that the sun wouldn't be in her eyes.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560
 And now she checks for that.

00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:52.880
 So whenever the Queen has to stand up on a sunny day, she goes and checks first that the

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.280
 sun won't be in her eyes.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.040
 She checks that she'll be visible over podiums, in case you've made a podium too high.

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.760
 In case Peter the Great's desk is brought up.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 Wow.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.440
 And she has her own Queen costume, which she's put together from charity shops.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.680
 So her Queen handbag cost one quid.

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:11.680
 Yeah.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.400
 And she got fake diamonds from Woolworths for the millennium.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400
 I just love it.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.400
 I just think it's very nice.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.400
 She's not paid.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.400
 She refuses to accept any money for the work she does.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.400
 And she's been doing it for 30 years.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.840
 I think she's one of the great unsung heroes of this country.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.840
 Yeah.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.840
 It's weird that she doesn't accept any payment and she pays for her travel and everything.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.840
 I mean, I agree.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.160
 Is there a, in a very small way?

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.160
 Yeah.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.160
 Speaking of clothing, there is someone else who sort of does a stand-in job for the Queen as

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.160
 well.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.040
 And that is it's someone specifically whose job is to break in the shoes of the Queen that

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.000
 are as of yet unworn.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
 So that's what they do.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.240
 The people who provide all the clothing for her, her fashion people, the Queen's fashion

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240
 people.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240
 They buy new shoes.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.360
 And obviously, when you're wearing new shoes, they're very painful.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.600
 And so someone is hired to just walk around in the new pair of shoes before she has a go

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.600
 at them.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.600
 That's cool.

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.360
 So they must have the same size feet as the Queen, right?

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.360
 Or yes.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.560
 It would be very funny if they did not.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:13.160
 I just think in that the audition for that job or the job interview would be just like Cinderella

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160
 or something.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.560
 I mean, you just have a load of people sat there, they just need the right size feet.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.560
 Yeah.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.840
 Because there's no other skill there, is there?

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.840
 No.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.720
 It's probably a quick audition process, are you size eight, no?

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.720
 Okay, thank you.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.720
 Size eight.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.720
 The Queen.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.720
 A massive feet.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 Yeah.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.720
 Wow.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:31.720
 Size eight is not massive, by the way.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.720
 What size is it?

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.720
 It's supposed to be.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720
 It's supposed to be your five foot, too.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.720
 Yeah.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720
 Yeah, okay.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.680
 Do you know, so I was looking at sort of the reason this lady, Ella Slack, she called.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680
 Yeah.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.080
 Reason she does is it's like to prepare for ceremonial events.

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.160
 And the royal family, they have to rehearse all the royal ceremonies quite a lot.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.440
 And in fact, the Queen herself spent weeks rehearsing for her coronation in 1953.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.480
 So she was really nervous about it.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.480
 And she used to play recordings of her father's coronation over and over again.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.480
 Her father was George, you know, who had a stutter and so it's quite difficult for him.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.640
 She used to play recordings of his coronation.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.080
 And she paraded up and down what was called the white drawing room.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.240
 Because that had the same dimensions as the theatre and the abbey where she was going

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240
 to be coronated.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.040
 And she timed herself doing it to make sure she was going to walk the right, you know,

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.720
 distance at the right pace.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.840
 And she got all her ladies and waiting to walk alongside her.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:31.920
 And she used to wear her bedsheets as a robe, as her queenly robes, which is so cool.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.920
 That is really cool.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.960
 She know in 2012 there was a queen shortage in the UK.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960
 Sorry?

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.880
 There was a queen shortage.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.760
 It was due to all the Jubilee stuff and they needed queen lookalikes.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.520
 And basically there's about, I don't know, there's about a couple of dozen people who can

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.960
 do queen lookalikes and they needed them all the time.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.520
 And they said, the main lookalike company, Susan Scott lookalike said, we could have done

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.840
 with double or triple the amount of queens.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.840
 That is amazing.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.280
 Imagine when the button was pressed, dispatched the queens.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.560
 They'll come out.

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.560
 What do you do?

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.560
 What do you do?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:16.000
 What have room, do you think they've ever all been at the same place at the same time?

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.720
 I don't know, but I did read an interview with Kate Middleton lookalike and she says that

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.320
 one of the queens, or one of the queen lookalikes, is like her honorary granny.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.040
 And the reason is because they all hang out together all these lookalikes.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040
 Of course she do.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.080
 You would think, because you're all working in the same role.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.440
 The queen lookalikes and the Kate Middleton lookalikes will hang out with you.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:39.920
 And the Pippa Middleton lookalikes, the Harry Potter lookalikes, the David Beckham lookalikes,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:40.920
 they all hang out together.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.320
 Why is Harry Potter at that party?

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.320
 It's just breaking a wall of some sort.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:52.320
 Because then that's the only time they can truly be themselves, because outside those circles

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.320
 everyone's always saying, "Oh, you look just like Camilla Parker-Bulls."

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.320
 Well, to the Harry Potter lookalike.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.560
 Have you ever thought about changing your lookalike, mate?

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.520
 You don't look like Harry Potter.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.600
 They just on that subject, they do often, if they're a couple who are celebrity couples

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.560
 in real life, they will fall in love with each other and get married.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.480
 I think there's examples of like a Katie Price and a Peter Andre lookalike when that was

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.000
 massive, falling in love because they did so many events together.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
 And when that was massive?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
 Yeah.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.280
 Did you know by the whole new world album?

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:35.480
 So on body doubles, General Montgomery in the Second World War, Monty had an impersonator

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.560
 who for spying purposes pretended to be him and would go to different places so that

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.480
 German spies would think, "Oh, Monty's over here."

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.000
 Actually, Monty wasn't over here.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.920
 Monty was over there defeating the Germans.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.880
 So the only problem was that the lookalike had had a finger shot off in the First World

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.200
 War.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.760
 So you needed to count the fingers on the fake Monty.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760
 Really?

00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.600
 He would have walked gloves or a prosthetic finger or something.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.240
 And the only thing was there was another body double who was called Keith Deema Banwell

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.680
 who looked exactly like Montgomery.

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:12.160
 So he was used as a lookalike, the only problem was he was substantially taller than Monty

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:16.680
 so he was never allowed on any account to get out of his car.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.680
 That's really good.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.920
 Was that Tex Banwell or Clifton James, I think?

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:27.520
 Clifton James was the first one with Clifton James, yeah, it was called Operation Copperhead

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.640
 and basically it was when we were planning the British Replanning Tax on the Germans and

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.120
 it was dispatched people who looked like him to all parts of the world.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.840
 But he was a drunk as well so he was an absolute liability I think.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.960
 It's only funny the idea of dispatching these fake Monty's everywhere.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.640
 Well, we've had intelligence that he's an Antarctica, should be strengths and defenses

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640
 in Antarctica.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:53.560
 Did you guys read about the Mexican politician who's actually looking for body doubles or he

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.520
 was looking for body doubles?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.840
 This is a guy called Renato Dronco Gomez and this was in 2015, he's a politician in the

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:07.200
 Mexican Parliament and he put out a call for body doubles because he wants to maintain his

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.600
 popularity and he's like, I'm so popular that I need to be in multiple places at once.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.400
 So he's trying to do an ego on the band.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.640
 He said, and he said, I'm not that fussy.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.080
 If you're short then you can wear platform shoes.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.080
 If you're chubby you can lose weight, if you're thin you can gain weight.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.080
 It's fine.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.520
 If you're tall I'll cut your feet off.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.480
 He said the band from smoking and drinking because he doesn't smoke and drinking has to be realistic.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.120
 Although at any public events he stipulated that they would have to say, I'm the double

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.320
 by the way, you're not quite getting the real guy you're getting a look alike.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.260
 And he said, most importantly, they will not be able to live in my home, sleep with my

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.040
 wife or go to congress.

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.200
 So no shagging as part of the job.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.200
 Yeah.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.560
 It's any second most important on his list though, wasn't it?

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.360
 In order of importance between going to congress and living in my house.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.960
 I can imagine his wife going, wait a minute, you've got no feet.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:10.200
 Hey, I read a thing guys, which is that, so on the subject of body doubles, a lot of

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:14.760
 in movies there's obviously stunt doubles and body doubles for the biggest actors in

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760
 the world.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.760
 They all have them.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.640
 And I started looking into stunt doubles generally for this topic tonight and found this

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:27.200
 thing where there's a lot of anger amongst the Hollywood community of stunt doubles because

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:32.360
 there's no Oscar for stunt doubling or body doubling and that is such a huge part of the

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.360
 movies.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:36.920
 What you see in there is making people believe that you've been blown out of a window or

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.200
 they have it for special effects.

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.200
 They have a special event, but they think they should have an Oscar for it.

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.580
 And I found that there's actually a big petition that's been going on.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:50.200
 And as far as I could see, as of last year, they stopped pushing it to the public because

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.680
 they didn't get the 100,000 votes that they needed.

00:34:52.680 --> 00:35:01.660
 So it's on a site where they've managed to get 87,393 supporters and they've not quite

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:04.960
 hit the 100,000 that they need.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.720
 So I'm going to read out the website for this here.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.920
 It's called thepetitionSite.com.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.680
 You've got to look for a standup for stunts and I reckon if enough people who are listening

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.040
 to this podcast can just go to that site very quickly and just give them a petition support

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:25.240
 we could get to 100,000 maybe next year or the year after stunt people can get an Oscar

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.240
 at the main award.

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.240
 How cool would that be?

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:30.440
 But they could upscale through the ceiling and pick up their award.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.440
 Yes, yes.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:35.140
 They're so close and the last update was a year ago, so they've given up and that's so

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.840
 sad because they're incredible.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.880
 I would love to see the stunt Oscars.

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.720
 Everyone's constantly blowing shit up, smashing through the glass.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.720
 That would be incredible.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.960
 As a member of the audience, you'd be constantly looking for the emergency exit before someone

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.960
 said, "No, no, no, it's fine.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.960
 It's part of it."

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:56.200
 But they are, they're more kind of omnipresent than you think, aren't they?

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.000
 So you know that bit in Notting Hill where Judy Roberts talks about people having butt

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
 doubles.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.040
 I always thought that was a bit that had been scripted in and wasn't true, but they all

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:05.440
 have body doubles.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:11.000
 And in fact, really trashy piece of celebrity information, but in pretty women, Judy Roberts

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.200
 had a body double for that as she was called Shelley Michelle and actually in the really

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.280
 iconic poster of pretty women where, you know, she's kind of leaning against something and

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.720
 she's got something over her shoulder, she's wearing some short leather skirt or something.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.440
 The whole, the only bit of her that's Judy Roberts is the head.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.680
 The rest of that is a body.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:33.080
 So it's, I just wonder so weird.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.320
 Someone else is body.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.960
 But there are a lot of monkeys looking at that picture going, "That's not Julia Roberts's

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
 ass."

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:43.680
 Guys, we need to move on to our final facts.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.160
 James, you got something before we do?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.400
 So I was looking at Queen's jobs because this is person who's employed to do something

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.720
 for the Queen.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:59.120
 The Queen has a keeper of the Queen's stamps because the Queen doesn't like stamp collecting

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:02.000
 while she has a shitload of stamps.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.640
 And so she implies someone to be her official stamp collector.

00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.640
 You're kidding.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.640
 I am not kidding.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.920
 And does she go and say, "How's my stamp collection doing?"

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.920
 I guess so.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.000
 Why doesn't she like, does she not like the, licking the back of her own head?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.760
 If you collect stamps, you don't lick them.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 What?

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.240
 That's surely one of the perks of stamp collecting.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240
 It's fun.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.880
 You just can't get your stamp sac, oh, just lick that one again.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.360
 I wouldn't lick the fronts of the stamps.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.760
 That is deranged.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.760
 Now, it's forcing her to collect stamps.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.000
 No, she has a collection that's already there.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.760
 So she needs someone to look after it.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:43.080
 But this guy does go and get extra stamps for her collection.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080
 Yeah.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.640
 So he is basically doing a hobby for her.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640
 Yeah.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.400
 It's like having an official jigsaw maker.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:50.400
 Yes.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.200
 Oh, but she does collect jigsaws.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200
 No, wait.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.720
 The fact is she doesn't collect jigsaws.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:58.800
 Sorry, it's not, no, hang on.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.720
 It's better than it sounds.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.800
 She doesn't collect jigsaws.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800
 She does jigsaws.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800
 She loves them.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:09.720
 But to save buying loads of jigsaws, she gets them out of her jigsaw library.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.040
 You can rent jigsaws?

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040
 Yeah.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040
 It's just a library.

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.040
 It's a free library for jigsaws.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.040
 Sorry.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.040
 Is she low on cash?

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040
 God.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.040
 She is thrifty.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.040
 Well, I think they should put our taxes up.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:27.040
 If the queen's on a four jigsaws, I'm not paying enough tax.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:31.040
 Hey, listen, let's move on to our final factor, the show.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.040
 And that is Chazinski.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:34.840
 My fight is that.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:44.560
 The US president, Jimmy Carter, once sent the nuclear launch codes to his dry cleaner.

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.600
 And not on purpose.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:53.160
 This is, I read this article in Timeline, which is one of my favourite websites, timeline.com.

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.040
 And it's about the fact that there's been an open secret in Washington since Jimmy Carter

00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.320
 was president that he lost the nuclear biscuit, as it's known, which is the little kind of

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.400
 credit card with the codes on it, because he sent a suit to the dry cleaners.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.560
 And it was in the pocket, because the president has to have it on him at all times.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.760
 And it's just, it's amazing.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.200
 Did it come back sort of slightly blurry and he was like, oh, is that a, is that a six or

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:17.200
 a five?

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200
 I'll wing it.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200
 I'll wing it.

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:25.800
 But isn't it true that basically all the presidents lose the codes all the time?

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.120
 They're very scattered with it.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.840
 We can only hope that they lose the codes all the time, from wing at the moment.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.720
 One of the problems that they do have from George W. Bush onwards is that the person carrying

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:40.800
 the football has to be by the president at all times, but the president often forgets that.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.840
 So the president will finish what they're doing, hop in a car, and drive off.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.200
 And then suddenly guy with the nuclear code is going, what do I do?

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:52.000
 And they have to chase after the president and try and get back to him in case he's needed

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.160
 I would constantly hide as president.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.320
 You actually would, wouldn't you?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.440
 You'd be deliberately all the time trying to sneak off.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.440
 Yeah.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.520
 You go even in the same lift as the president.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:05.400
 I don't know what happens when the president asleep though.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:07.040
 They sleep in the same bed as them.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040
 Do they?

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040
 Yeah.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:14.360
 When you found a fact for our book, which is about the fact that if Trump goes to, yes,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.200
 yeah, if he goes to New York, the nuclear button has its own multi-million dollar flat in

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.760
 New York, which he didn't, the flat didn't get used for the first eight months of the

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.240
 presidency because he didn't go to New York, but they've hired a luxury apartment just

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.560
 for the button to sit in.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.520
 But I like the fact that it's for the button and it's also for the people who guard the button

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:33.520
 so it's for his staff.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.840
 But I like the idea that it is mainly for the button, so the button's in the double bed.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.880
 And the staff are just standing to attention around the bed.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.200
 Are you comfortable, sir?

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.600
 As you say, Clinton lost it.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600
 Yeah, Clinton lost it.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.840
 He kept it rubber banded to his credit cards in a trouser pocket.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:54.680
 Imagine that.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680
 That makes sense.

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680
 It doesn't make sense.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.440
 It's a very crazy thing to do.

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:03.040
 If you accidentally put in your nuclear button card into the machine at the till, I don't

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.360
 think that's how it sets off stuff, I don't think.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:11.240
 This is why they say contactless is a very dangerous technology.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.440
 And they only found out, didn't they, when I think Clinton's aide said, look, could you

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.560
 give me the biscuit back because we need to give you an updated version.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.880
 This came out in a autobiography here a while ago, I think that's someone called

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880
 Patterson.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:27.400
 And here's, so his aide said, give me the biscuit back because we need to swap it.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.720
 And Clinton said, yeah, yeah, sure, I think his upstairs, I just left it upstairs, I'll go

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720
 and get it.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720
 And he's going around for a bit.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:37.520
 And then eventually he admitted that he hadn't seen it for months and he had no idea where

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 he put it.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.520
 Oh, my God.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:43.120
 But he must have known he hadn't seen it for months and he must have been…

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120
 Oh, he would have been convocating.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120
 Absolutely.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120
 Shit.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120
 Yeah.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.080
 So there was a lot of worry that a president with this kind of power could launch based

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.880
 on, let's say, even in our current climate, you know, you get too angry one day.

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.120
 The president might suddenly go, even in the current climate, that might happen.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.800
 Yeah, in the current blissfully calm environment, we're all living in that climate, yeah.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.240
 But he might suddenly, you know, it's a very, it's quite an easy process to do.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.080
 And back in the day, there was a Harvard professor who thought about this and thought, actually,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.560
 we need to make it a bit harder, we need to make it a big decision for the president to

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.560
 do.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560
 So this is what he suggested.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.280
 He said, my suggestion was quite simple.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:24.000
 Put the code that you needed to launch the nuclear warheads in a little capsule.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.160
 And plant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.520
 The volunteer would carry with him a big butcher's knife, as he accompanied the president.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:38.080
 If the president ever wanted to fire the nuclear weapons, the only way he would do so would

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.240
 be with his own hands to kill the person and then to break it out of them in order to

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240
 do it.

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240
 Yeah.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:51.680
 And that wasn't a popular suggestion, in fact, they even went for it with Peter the Grey,

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.480
 he would have absolutely loved it.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.440
 It's in here somewhere.

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.920
 Although interestingly, this is the carotid.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.080
 I think that's a very impractical suggestion.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.240
 It's a guy Roger Fisher, he was a Harvard professor, he published it in the Bulletin of

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.240
 Atomic Science.

00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.440
 It was a real thing and it was very talked about.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440
 I don't know.

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:15.320
 The president constantly being company, but his man with a knife.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.840
 This absolutely terrified, lucky man with a knife, is that?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.840
 How?

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.400
 Just to finish that off, because I found that as well.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.160
 They suggested it to the Pentagon, didn't they?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160
 Yeah.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.040
 And the Pentagon said, my God, that's terrible.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.960
 Having to kill someone would distort the president's judgment, he might never push the

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.960
 button.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.960
 Really?

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.960
 Wow.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.960
 Wow.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.240
 So, like you said, there are two things, isn't there?

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.280
 There's this card, which is the biscuit.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280
 Yeah.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.960
 And then there's the briefcase, which is the football.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.680
 The briefcase is manufactured by a company called Zero Halliburton.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.160
 Okay, and Zero Halliburton, they were Utah firm, and they do this, and the other thing is

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.960
 they do aluminium briefcases for Hollywood.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:07.640
 So they've made briefcases for 24, West Wing, Independence Day, and Santa with Muscles.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.520
 That's the main ones.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.480
 Santa with Muscles is the 79th worst rated film in the whole of IMDB.

00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:16.480
 Wow.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.480
 No way.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.480
 Wow.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480
 In the whole thing.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.480
 In the whole thing.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.000
 There must be billions in there.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.480
 Sorry, they make, so they make this, they make, well, they're not fake because they need to

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:32.480
 use them in the movies, but these really are some kind of aluminium briefcases, because

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:36.920
 the guy who invented it realized that briefcases are not so good, and aluminium ones will

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920
 be better.

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.720
 And they're good for carrying nuclear codes.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.840
 The nuclear codes that they have, by the way, are pretty weird, so that it's basically

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:51.400
 two lists, and they're pictorial, and one list is places to bomb, and the other one is how

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.040
 to bomb them.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:59.140
 So you basically go down, you go, "Hell, go for this one, Pyongyang, and this one, a big

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.140
 fuck off bomb."

00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:01.140
 Wow.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.080
 I can't, but, I mean, the one thing keeping the world safe was the idea that Trump would have

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:07.200
 to read more than six words.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.400
 A military aide to Bill Clinton said it was like a Denny's breakfast menu.

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400
 Yeah.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.240
 He said, "You picked one out of Colomé, and two out of Colomé."

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.240
 But it's bad.

00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:23.200
 I wonder how seriously, because it obviously scares you to hear that this thing exists generally,

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.200
 I think.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.440
 But I don't know how seriously they took it.

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:31.080
 So the fact is about Jimmy Carter having sent it accidentally the codes to the dry cleaners.

00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.880
 When Jimmy Carter first got the nuclear football, it was given to him by the LBJ presidential

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.000
 administration, and when it was brought to him, the guy looked inside the briefcase when

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.320
 he first opened it in the companionship of, when he was with Jimmy Carter.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:51.880
 And inside it, when they opened it, they found that the previous administration was having

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:58.200
 a bit of a joke, because they left inside it an empty beer can and a condom not for humans

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.480
 for horses.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:04.040
 And that was inside the most deadly bag that a president could have next to them.

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.040
 And he didn't tell Jimmy Carter.

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.040
 He closed it.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.040
 He went, "Yup, it's all good."

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.640
 And Jimmy Carter never found out about that.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.640
 What?

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:11.640
 Yeah.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640
 The horses have condoms.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640
 I didn't know that either.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640
 No.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640
 Yeah.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:16.640
 For me is the headline from that story.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.640
 Yeah.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:18.640
 Yeah.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.640
 How do they put them on?

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.960
 Yeah, I've not even thought about.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:24.960
 Nobody knows.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.240
 On the US News, so there is a secretive US agency, and their job is to transport all the

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:35.600
 nuclear material around America, because obviously you've got loads of missile silos, you've

00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:39.800
 got loads of nuclear science, and very few people know about this, but they're called

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.960
 the Office of Secure Transportation, and their vehicles sound absolutely insane.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.800
 So the defenses, obviously, they've got convoys they go with, but the defenses include

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.200
 shock delivering systems, which basically means if you touch it, it electrocutes you.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.480
 They've got axles which explode, so you can't drive them away even if you do manage to

00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480
 take over it.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.760
 And they also have thick walls which ooze immobilizing foam.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:05.760
 Wow.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:12.040
 So if you are wrong and you touch the lorry, it just oozes out at you, and then catches

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.520
 you like you're on fly paper.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.600
 It's so weird, because foam isn't that immobilizing.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:17.600
 I put in baths.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:18.600
 Yeah.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:23.640
 I think of how difficult it is to get out of the bath.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:24.640
 Yeah.

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:26.320
 They have special stuff, don't they?

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:27.320
 I think it's special.

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.320
 It's special foam.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.320
 Yeah.

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320
 It's a mobilizing foam.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.320
 Got it.

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.320
 Not palm or live.

00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.320
 Black or African bubble bath.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.560
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec, anything before we do, guys.

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.360
 I can tell you that we've been talking about American nuclear bombs.

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.520
 We have nuclear bombs as well in the UK.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:49.000
 And it is technically legal for Prince Charles to set off a nuclear bomb.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
 No.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
 That's true.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
 It's true.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.560
 It's because he is the Duke of Cornwall.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:58.560
 And if you're Duke of Cornwall, there's a few laws you technically don't have to follow.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.400
 And one of them is the Nuclear Explosions Act.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.640
 The other one is the Data Protection Act.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.360
 And another one is the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.760
 So it means, as well as being able to set off nuclear bombs, he can share your email address

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:15.720
 with third parties.

00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:23.200
 And technically, he's allowed to shoot a great-crested newt with a machine gun.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.520
 That's amazing.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.320
 OK.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.320
 That is it.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.320
 That is all of our facts.

00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:33.040
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.800
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said over the

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.760
 course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.760
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.760
 Andy.

00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:41.760
 @AndruhunterM.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:42.760
 James.

00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:43.760
 @JamesHarkin.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:44.760
 And Jaczynski.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.760
 You can email pockons.ky.com.

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:46.760
 Yep.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:50.320
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.680
 Or you can go to our website.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.960
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com where we have all of our previous episodes.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.640
 Also got a link to our book, which we're about to give a copy away to one member of

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.000
 the audience here in Birmingham.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.520
 We asked you to send in your facts before the show started.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.040
 And here we go.

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:07.040
 This is the fact.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.040
 Andy, what is it?

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.040
 I've got it.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.040
 I'm just taking the phone off airplane mode.

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.040
 Unbelievable.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.040
 OK.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.760
 So this fact was sent in by a man called Steven Conneber.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:23.040
 And his fact is that the game Cludo was invented by a Pratt from Birmingham.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040
 Sorry.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:26.800
 That's a Pratt from Birmingham.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:31.000
 And it was called Murder at Tudor Close.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
 Wow.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
 Cool.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
 OK.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.200
 Well, if you're here, come and grab a book from us at the end.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:38.800
 Guys, as I said at the beginning, we're going to be in the back.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.800
 We've got books.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.000
 If you want to get one, we'll be there signing them.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.200
 Hopefully, I don't know how much time we have, but we'll try and bang through as many

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.200
 of you as possible.

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.200
 And then we'll study on them.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.200
 I mean, in the correct climate, then.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.200
 Bad choice of words.

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:57.600
 Bad choice of words.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.000
 But Birmingham, this has been awesome.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.600
 And by the way, just before we wrap up, because again, we're doing these bigger venues, we

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.280
 thought we'd end on something special.

00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:08.800
 We have here tonight, as I said, the singer and songwriter, Emperor Yes, Ash Gardener is

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:09.800
 here.

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.400
 And we're going to go out by playing our theme tune live for you guys tonight as I go.

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400
 Yeah.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.960
 So please welcome to the stage, ladies and gentlemen.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.000
 It is Ash Gardener.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.800
 There he is, everybody.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:24.800
 And thank you so much, Birmingham.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800
 That was awesome.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800
 Thank you.

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800
