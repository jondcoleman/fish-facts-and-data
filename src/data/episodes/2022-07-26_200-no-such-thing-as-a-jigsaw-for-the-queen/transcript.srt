00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
 Hi guys, just before we start this show, I want to celebrate the fact that this is our 200th episode.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,000
 Oh, no such thing as a fish. Thanks for that, Dan.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,080
 A little woohoo.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,320
 Yep, for the second one.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,680
 And the way I've celebrated our 200th episode is by making a mistake.

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,800
 Yep, last week's episode, there was an incorrect fact in it.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,120
 So we recorded the show live in Leicester, and my fact was about how the Walker's crisp factory

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,840
 can't tell the difference between golf balls and crisps.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,000
 And after we recorded this show, someone came up to me, he was called Greg Hilliard,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,560
 and he actually works in the Walker's crisp factory, and he informed me that fact was out of date

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,080
 because they've now created a machine that can distinguish between the two.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,320
 So in the last couple of years, so walkers can now tell the difference between golf balls and crisps.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,960
 Happy birthday, no such thing as a fish.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:17,200
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,280
 Guys, I'm trying to do the intro here.

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:32,320
 It's a weekly podcast, coming to you from Birmingham!

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anne Chasinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,240
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,800
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,040
 Starting with my fact this week, my fact this week is that in Brussels, there is a

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,760
 commemorative statue to where Peter the Great once vomited.

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:07,240
 That was so cool!

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,840
 Anyone else want to vomit at this stage?

24
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,880
 Is it in the shape of vomit, or what?

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,080
 Would you mean, oh, the statue?

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,920
 No, it's of Peter the Great, yeah, yeah, but what it was is he was over in Brussels,

27
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,520
 and he was out just having a big day, and he had a bit too much of a big day, and they pulled

28
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,240
 over to where this sort of little fountain he bitters, and he vomited, and it was established

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,840
 that that's what he did, historically, and then years later, it was in 1856, there was a

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,440
 prince who donated a statue to say we need to commemorate this, so it said it had this little

31
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,320
 plaque on it, which says, "As he sat on the edge of this fountain, he enabled its waters

32
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,640
 with the wine of his libations."

33
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,160
 Did I say any of the words right, and that was close enough, yeah?

34
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 Yes, I think his.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,720
 Peter the Great was obviously, in one sense, this very grand historical figure, probably

36
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,880
 the most influential czar Russia ever had, early 18th century, influenced everything that

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:13,160
 came off him, but also he was an absolute lad, so he founded a drinking society called, it

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,880
 was originally called the Jolly Company, and then it was called the All-Joking All-Drunken

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:24,760
 Sinod of Fools and Gestors, and it had a few rules, so there were rules like you were never

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,600
 allowed to go to bed sober, you always had to empty your cup when instructed to, and they

41
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,400
 just did mad stuff all the time, just constantly fooling around, so there was, I think there

42
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,360
 was something where his favourite jester got married, he had this jester, and he decided

43
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,400
 he was xar by this time, so he could do whatever he wanted, so he decided to make this wedding

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,720
 like a massive royal deal, and he gave his jester his xar's carriage, and then him and his

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,000
 drinking society wore boots made of straw, and they wore gloves in the, like, made of mice,

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
 so they shoved their hands into mice, and they wore-

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
 What?

48
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
 Sorry.

49
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,680
 Do you mean like finger puppets?

50
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
 No.

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
 Must think mouse skin, right?

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,920
 They weren't putting the hand up a mouse's-

53
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
 Oh, yeah, okay.

54
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,720
 Well, I don't know 'cause they wore squirrels' tails and cat's paws just hanging off their clothes

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,640
 for fun, and then they made the married couple enter Moscow on the back of a camel, and then

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,840
 they just spent three days getting absolutely smashed, and as one biographer put it, the joke

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,960
 may have been carried too far because the groom died during the celebrations.

58
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,960
 May.

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,080
 May have been carried too far.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,880
 That's a historian's way of looking at it, isn't it?

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,440
 He was a terrifying man, so he was a six foot seven.

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,360
 He had a standing desk, that's not terrifying, but the standing desk he had, the writing surface

63
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,640
 was five foot six inches off the floor.

64
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
 Wow.

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
 He was huge.

66
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,960
 Yeah, and also the other thing about him, he was obsessed with dwarfs.

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,440
 So when he was a baby, this is before he was-

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,560
 To him that everyone would have been a dwarf, but he had a retinue of dwarfs acting as

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,320
 his servants and playmates, and he had a mini carriage, and he would ride in it, drawn

70
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,040
 by four dwarf ponies with four dwarfs riding their own horses at the side.

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,360
 And even in later life, he became obsessed with dwarfs in pies.

72
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,720
 He loved a dwarf jumping out of a pie at a banquet.

73
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
 Really?

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,120
 He was obsessed with it.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,360
 Often naked, naked dwarfs jumping out of pies, he was really into, yeah.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,440
 So Simon C. Back at Montefuri wrote a really good biography, and he basically said, all of

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,160
 the parties they had had naked girls jumping out of pies, dwarves being tossed, dwarves dressed

78
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,280
 as old men, old men dressed as dwarves, all of them naked except for the bishop who would

79
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,720
 be carrying dildos on a cushion.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:42,080
 But that's the thing about it, is this thing that he did this club, it was called a synod, wasn't

81
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
 it?

82
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,920
 And so it was basically to take the piss out of the church.

83
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
 Yeah.

84
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
 That's why he did the whole time.

85
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,920
 So instead of Holy Water, they would scatter vodka.

86
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,920
 Wow.

87
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,400
 And if you were ever caught being sober, you'd get ex-communicated from his club.

88
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,440
 But the worst thing was, if you got ex-communicated, you were barred from all the pubs in the whole

89
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
 of Russia.

90
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
 Oh.

91
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
 Wow.

92
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
 No way.

93
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 Way.

94
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
 Wow.

95
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
 Imagine the horror, Anna.

96
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
 You.

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,520
 Listening at home, you want to be able to imagine the horror on Anna's face right now.

98
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,320
 He did another thing where, so he did a number of trips to Europe, he was famous for these massive

99
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,320
 trips, and one time he came back and he was so impressed by the clean shavenness of the Europeans

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,760
 that he imposed a beard tax into Russia, but the way he did it was, he came back and they

101
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,560
 threw a massive reception for him, and he was giving a sort of arousing speech, and everyone

102
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
 said it was elation.

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
 Everyone was so excited.

104
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,520
 And then it turned to horror when he suddenly said, I don't want beards anymore, and he pulls

105
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,480
 out a massive razor, and he starts shaving the faces of people who were attending.

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,760
 What they thought was just a pleasant talk of a homecoming hero, and they all left without

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
 their face hair.

108
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,840
 But he did the tax to start off with, and then when people started paying the tax, he

109
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
 just went, oh, I'm just going to ban them then.

110
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
 So he just didn't want beards at all, because he saw that as an example of the old Russia,

111
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,040
 and he was a great modernizer of Russia.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,320
 So he had a law that everyone had to dress as either a Hungarian, a Frenchman or a German.

113
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,280
 That was because he knew a very funny joke about a Hungarian, a Frenchman.

114
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,000
 But with the beard tax, the thing was, with the tax, they gave you these coins, and I didn't

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,840
 realize these coins are still in existence.

116
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,880
 This is from the 1700s, and you can see them.

117
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,600
 These pictures online, where it's like a sort of a goatee and a little, what's that bit?

118
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,400
 A soul patch, a soul patch kind of thing, but like Satan would have, you know, the more

119
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
 pointy one.

120
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
 A goatee.

121
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
 Oh, yeah, a goatee.

122
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,100
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,280
 So that would be on the coin, and you would carry your coin around with you.

124
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,760
 So if you were seen in the streets with a beard, they'd go, where's your coin, and you'd

125
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
 look around for the coin.

126
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,320
 And if you didn't have your coin, they'd shave your face on the spot.

127
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,800
 He took Russia back 5,000 years, as well as being a massive modernizer.

128
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 What do you mean?

129
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,480
 He left Russia in the year 7,206, and he got back, and he said, "I don't want this anymore,"

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,720
 because Russia used to begin at 5,508 BC, and he left Russia for the West, and he found,

131
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,000
 "Oh, it's 1700 here, well, I prefer this."

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,440
 And so he came back and said, "Right, it's 1700, forget the 7,200 nonsense, changing it.

133
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,960
 Beardstone exists in the future."

134
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
 That's so cool.

135
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,280
 So he just altered time, and he trained as a shipbuilder.

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
 Did he?

137
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,340
 When he was touring Europe, he personally went to a shipyard and just worked there in Amsterdam

138
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,400
 for months, and he cooked his own meals, and he lit his own fires, and he ignored anybody

139
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,000
 who called him your majesty.

140
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 He answered only to carpenter Peter.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,240
 He was very eccentric, but an incredibly practical man in loads of ways.

142
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
 Yeah.

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,000
 He liked cutting something else off people, so you would be actually thankful if he cut your

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,360
 beard off, because he loved cutting people's heads off himself.

145
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,760
 So usually as a world leader at the time, people were beheaded, but you know, you'd get your

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,200
 executioner to do it, but he really liked to be there in the thick of it, and so he did

147
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,240
 lots of executions himself, and he was really fascinated by it enough to me, again, because

148
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,720
 I think he liked Europeans, and they were maybe ahead in biology.

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,840
 If he comes at you with a razor, at what stage do you know he's going to go for the beard

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,840
 and not cut your hair?

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,840
 Yeah.

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,160
 That's got to be absolutely terrifying.

153
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,640
 It comes out with a great big axe.

154
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
 No, this is just my beard axe, don't worry.

155
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,920
 He actually had a mistress called Mary Hamilton, and then she ended up being beheaded as

156
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,080
 lots of mistresses did, and when she was beheaded, he was there, and as soon as she was beheaded,

157
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,400
 he lifted up her head in front of the crown, so we're all watching, and he gave them all

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,320
 a medical lesson on anatomy, so he turned her neck side out, and was like, this is the

159
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,280
 shrekia, this is her carotid artery, and then he gave her a big snog, and then he dropped

160
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,480
 the head and walked away.

161
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 He gave her a snog?

162
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,000
 Yeah, he gave her a big kiss on the list.

163
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,360
 So this fact was sent to me by a listener of our podcast called Carrie, and I loved it

164
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,280
 because there are amazing statues all over the world that represent very odd things.

165
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:11,120
 I found one which I've been trying to track down, whether the truth of this, which is

166
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,840
 George Washington in Trafalgar Square, very close to where we work in Covern Garden, literally

167
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,160
 a walking distance.

168
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,120
 There's a statue of George Washington there, outside the National Portrait Gallery,

169
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,600
 and it was donated by the Americans, however, there was a sentence that George Washington

170
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 said just before he died, which is he said, "I would never will stand on British soil again."

171
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,640
 And as a result, it is said, and this is what tour guides tell everyone, that as they were

172
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,680
 putting down the statue of George Washington, they imported American soil and sitting underneath

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,300
 it is American soils, so he still is not standing, but what's under the American soil?

174
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,320
 It's more British soil.

175
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,880
 How far down does this go, basically?

176
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,800
 On vomiting, and on American presidents, actually, Ulysses S. Grant was president, and also

177
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,440
 he was prominent in the Civil War and the American Civil War before that, and so he was kind

178
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,360
 of a war hero, but at the same time he was an alcoholic.

179
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,480
 So he used to sweep whiskey wherever he went, apparently, and at one point in battle, he

180
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,640
 vomited into his horse's mane.

181
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,640
 Oh!

182
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,360
 Yeah, and just went on with it.

183
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,920
 What about George W. Bush?

184
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,920
 Was it George W. Bush?

185
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,520
 No, it's George H. W. Bush, wasn't it?

186
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
 Yeah.

187
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,120
 Who vomited on the lap of Japan's Prime Minister in 1992, and as a result, the Japanese

188
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,760
 coined the phrase "Bushu Suru", meaning embarrassing public vomiting, or literally to do a

189
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
 bush.

190
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,840
 Because that is frowned on, isn't it, in Japan?

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,800
 Yeah, actually, everywhere.

192
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
 What?

193
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,520
 Oh, I've got so many apologetic texts to say.

194
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,320
 Do you know, he was so good-natured about that moment, though, so he kind of collapsed

195
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
 with his dinner.

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,320
 He'd been feeling bad anyway.

197
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
 I think, because he'd just played a tennis match against Japanese Emperor, and he'd

198
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 lost.

199
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,560
 So he was feeling really unwell after that, and he collapsed onto the floor, vomited, passed

200
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,760
 out, and as soon as he woke up with the Japanese Prime Minister there, above him saying, "You're

201
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
 okay."

202
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,960
 He said, "Why don't you just roll me under the table, and I'll sleep it off while you're

203
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
 finished dinner?"

204
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
 Really?

205
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,440
 It was just quite cool, yeah.

206
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,480
 One thing about Peter the Great is, at his parties, he would train bears to serve alcohol,

207
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,880
 and they would growl and harass those who said no.

208
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,000
 So I thought I'd look at some other awesome parties, and I really like the engagement party

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,800
 of the newspaper Magnet Gordon Bennett.

210
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,960
 He turned up at his own engagement party, so drunk that he immediately urinated into the

211
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:49,400
 living room fireplace, in full view of his hosts, and it's in the Guinness Book of Records

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,600
 as the greatest engagement faux pas.

213
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:01,160
 And it's supposed to be where we get the phrase, "Gordon Bennett", something bad, yeah.

214
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,920
 Guinness is still accepting any advance on urinating into the fireplace.

215
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
 Okay.

216
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
 Go for it.

217
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,760
 I think we could smash that.

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,560
 During the Jin craze, there was quite a few good parties.

219
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,720
 So this was in the 18th century, and a lot of people were drinking Jin, especially in London.

220
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,440
 There was an author called Henry McKenzie, who was at a drinking party, and he didn't

221
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,000
 want to drink anymore, so he fell to the floor to disguise himself as a drunken body.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,640
 And then soon after, he felt a small hand around his neck, and he was like, "What's going

223
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
 on?"

224
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,920
 And he confronted the boy who was doing it, and apparently the boy said it was his job

225
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,880
 to loosen the neck ties of the guests to prevent them from choking on their own vomit.

226
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,880
 Wow.

227
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,000
 If you have to hire someone to do that, yeah.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,880
 I had at my stag-do party.

229
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,400
 Oh, are we really?

230
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,120
 Yeah, just before I did my speech.

231
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
 My brother made me drink what, in Australia, is called a Shoey, and they do it on the Formula

232
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
 One.

233
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,400
 You fill a shoe full of beer, and you have to drink the whole shoe of beer.

234
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
 So I did that.

235
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,720
 Right after I decided I'd say a quick thank you to everyone that came, and I did that, passed

236
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
 out, woke up in the morning, and thought, "I did a pretty good speech last night, and

237
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,400
 my brother said I recorded it."

238
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,800
 I thought it was like about two minutes, 45 minutes, and a 45 minute speech.

239
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
 Who's Shoe?

240
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
 Did you have to drink up?

241
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
 My brother's, it was disgusting.

242
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
 Because he's a clown, isn't he?

243
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,640
 That was a problem.

244
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,280
 Let's move on to our second fact of the show.

245
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,640
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

246
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,400
 Okay, my fact this week is that only one study has ever found that men are better than women

247
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
 at recognising faces.

248
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:47,120
 It was a study looking at the recognition of the Transformers.

249
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,600
 I know that's bad, obviously, but internally I'm thinking, yeah, I'm pretty good at recognising

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 Transformers.

251
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
 This is true.

252
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
 And they're robots in disguise, so that's even better, right?

253
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,120
 So this is obviously like an on average thing, so you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna

254
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,480
 would be worse at recognising Transformers than Dan, just on average women are worse than

255
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,480
 men.

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,120
 Although you know that I asked you earlier what Transformers were, and that was having

257
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,440
 just read the Wikipedia page of Transformers, wasn't it?

258
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,760
 I still didn't understand it.

259
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
 I was thinking to stereotype.

260
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:22,400
 And you couldn't say, for instance, that Anna would be worse than Anna at recognising Barbie

261
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,560
 faces, which is the other part of this study.

262
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,440
 So they took Barbie faces and they took Transformer faces, and they found the women were better

263
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,320
 at recognising Barbie, and the men were better at recognising Transformers.

264
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,920
 And what they think is this is a study about looking where that experience is important

265
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,960
 when it comes to recognising faces.

266
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,320
 So they found these things where they thought women would have more experience in looking

267
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,480
 at Barbies, and men would have more experience in looking at Transformers.

268
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,080
 And they found that maybe experience has something to do with it, but actually overall women are

269
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,920
 a lot, lot better than men are looking at faces.

270
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,640
 Yeah, because Anna, I think I read a study, and this is off-memories, they're very risky

271
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:05,040
 right now, but the also women, because of the genetic material instinct, then you kind

272
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,000
 of have to be primed to recognise people more often, and you have to take an interest

273
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
 in more people so you can form a bond with them, and as soon as you form an emotional

274
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,440
 bond with people, then you're more likely to recognise the next time you see them.

275
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
 Yeah, it could be that.

276
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
 It could be that.

277
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,520
 But it's probably the Barbie thing.

278
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,800
 So you have these things called face patches in your brain, and there's these little bits,

279
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,440
 they're about the size of a blueberry, and they are specifically for recognising faces.

280
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,480
 So they've test, they don't respond if you get shown another body part, but they do respond

281
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,840
 if you get shown a face.

282
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,800
 And they are so predictable these face patches that scientists tried it out with monkeys, monkeys

283
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,440
 also have face patches.

284
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,040
 And they would measure the electrical activity of the face cells, and then they could recreate

285
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,760
 the face that the monkey had seen accurately.

286
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,760
 No.

287
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
 Yes.

288
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,760
 From the activity in the brain cells.

289
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
 Wow.

290
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
 That is magic.

291
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,480
 But monkeys don't aren't recognising faces, I don't think are they?

292
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,880
 I think great apes are, but monkeys are quite bad.

293
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,360
 They aren't good, though, at recognising bottoms.

294
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
 Oh yeah.

295
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,960
 Monkeys, chimpanzees, especially recognise each other by the bottoms, the way that we recognise

296
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,400
 each other by the face.

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
 Well, not exactly the same way.

298
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,000
 Well, the same way, but upside down.

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Yeah.

300
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,400
 Does that mean they back into every social engagement?

301
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
 They go ask first.

302
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,920
 Well, then they can't, because one of them has to be face first in order to see the ass.

303
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
 Oh, yeah.

304
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,560
 It's unbelievably embarrassing when one comes in ask first, and another one comes in ask first.

305
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,240
 Imagine that in an engagement.

306
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,240
 Yeah.

307
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,240
 But you know how they tested this?

308
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,640
 They tested it by showing them, they showed humans' faces and then faces upside down.

309
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,400
 And it's much, humans are much slower to recognise faces when they turned upside down.

310
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,760
 They then showed the chimpanzees, arses, chimpanzees arses, and then arses upside down.

311
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,000
 And the slowdown was the same, whereas humans did not slow down when they were shown a normal

312
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,960
 bottom and then an upside down bottom, which they also did for this experiment.

313
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,320
 Could the humans recognise the bottoms?

314
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
 No.

315
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,200
 They also could not recognise upside down bottoms.

316
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
 Okay.

317
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 I got it.

318
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
 Yeah.

319
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,680
 I just thought maybe I'd have a quick game of transformer or Barbie.

320
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
 Oh, okay.

321
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 Great.

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
 We can't do the images, because this is a podcast.

323
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
 Yeah.

324
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,960
 What I can do is give you some names of either these are people from transformers, not people,

325
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
 transformers.

326
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,840
 They're either transformers from transformers.

327
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,280
 They're people to me, James.

328
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
 Or toys from the Barbie universe.

329
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
 Okay.

330
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
 Okay.

331
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,040
 So, dude, a friend of Ken.

332
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,040
 Yeah.

333
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,440
 Must be a Barbie thing.

334
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 Transformer.

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
 It is everyone?

336
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
 Barbie.

337
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
 They knew it.

338
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
 Yeah.

339
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
 Yeah.

340
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
 It's a friend of Jazzy.

341
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
 What?

342
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
 Slag.

343
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
 Barbie.

344
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,680
 Is that a Barbie doll?

345
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
 I think it is.

346
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 Is it a transformer?

347
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,760
 I think it's an incredibly ill-conceived Barbie.

348
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,480
 It's a triceratops dyno bot.

349
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
 Oh.

350
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
 It's how I got it.

351
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
 M.C.

352
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
 Hammer.

353
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
 Barbie.

354
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
 Barbie.

355
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
 Yeah.

356
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
 He's got it.

357
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
 Yeah.

358
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
 Yeah.

359
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
 Because they do celebrity Barbies.

360
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
 There's an Angela Merkel as well.

361
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,400
 Yeah.

362
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
 Yeah.

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,840
 I tried to get one and they'd said it was for sale, but then it turned out it was they brought

364
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,440
 it just to an EU conference.

365
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:24,960
 Barbie created an Angela Merkel Barbie and so it's not for sale for general public.

366
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
 It should be.

367
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,840
 It is if you pay 50 billion pounds.

368
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,840
 Yes.

369
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
 Yeah.

370
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
 One more.

371
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
 Alan.

372
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
 Oh.

373
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
 Transformer.

374
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,840
 Transformer.

375
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
 Yeah.

376
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
 Transformer.

377
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
 Who's the transformer?

378
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
 Who?

379
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
 Who's the Barbie?

380
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
 Yeah.

381
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
 Yeah.

382
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
 Who doesn't give a shit?

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
 Yeah.

384
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
 Yeah.

385
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
 Okay.

386
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,840
 It's time for factor three then.

387
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,400
 Well, the answer is you were right not to give a shit because it's both.

388
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
 Oh.

389
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,840
 It's a high-speed train and someone who's married to Barbie's friend Mitch.

390
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
 What?

391
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,560
 I'm beg your pardon.

392
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
 I said Mitch.

393
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
 Oh, Mitch.

394
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 Cool.

395
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,560
 I mean, if her friend was called Mitch, that would have been one of my…

396
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,480
 So you may well have heard of these guys called super recognisers.

397
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
 Oh, yeah.

398
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,200
 So they're police officers and they're incredibly good at recognising a criminal's face

399
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
 is based on really blurry CCTV.

400
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,320
 So in the metropolitan police, they identify a quarter of all the criminals, despite the

401
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,760
 fact that out of 32,000 metropolitan police officers, there are only six super recognisers

402
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,680
 and they get a quarter.

403
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,320
 And they're so good that one officer was interviewed for the Guardian and he said, "I was

404
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,520
 coming back from court and I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences because they

405
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
 just spot.

406
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,000
 They remember the faces of people who were wanted and they just see them and they go, "That

407
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 guy."

408
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,720
 I saw someone who was wanted for seven offences.

409
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,960
 Once I had to stop the car three times, I would take one person in and then on the way

410
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,880
 to the station, I saw someone else who was wanted.

411
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,760
 So I picked them up and then as we were driving, I saw someone else.

412
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,760
 No.

413
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
 Yeah.

414
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
 They're just constantly seeing crooks.

415
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
 Wow.

416
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,760
 Do you know who was very bad at recognising people was back to American President Ronald

417
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
 Reagan.

418
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,960
 So he had to speak at a graduation ceremony in 1964 and he was giving, you know, the graduation

419
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,640
 certificate to students and boy came up on stage and he shut the boy's hand, gave him a

420
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,400
 certificate and said, "My name's Ronald.

421
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
 What's yours?"

422
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,400
 And the boy said, "I'm Michael.

423
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
 I'm your son."

424
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
 Oh.

425
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
 Yeah.

426
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,440
 It was his adoptive son.

427
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,040
 They adopted him when he was a baby.

428
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,640
 He was 19 by that point.

429
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 Oh.

430
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,520
 I mean, for an actor who has to recognise people, you would think that would be a flaw,

431
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,000
 not being able to recognise other humans.

432
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You would think.

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 Yeah.

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 That's your actors need to recognise people?

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Yeah.

436
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 I mean, it helps if you're facing the right way.

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,120
 You want me to recognise the camera then, no?

438
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
 I guess so.

439
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
 Do you know what it is?

440
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,920
 I just because I can't recognise people, so I'm just a bit worried I can't do an actor.

441
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,320
 James has genuine face blindness.

442
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
 He doesn't remember faces.

443
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
 Yeah, kind of.

444
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,080
 I have no imagination.

445
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,400
 Oh, James, I thought those poems you showed me were wonderful.

446
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,600
 That whole Barbie Transformer game was top.

447
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,480
 I can't imagine people's faces.

448
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,520
 I can't imagine what my wife looks like, for instance.

449
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,360
 So, he's not proper face blindness.

450
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,760
 It's A-Fantasia, it's cold, but it means that I can't recognise people very well.

451
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
 A-Fantasia?

452
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,760
 Yeah.

453
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
 What a whimsical name for presumably a bad condition.

454
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
 Oh, it's not.

455
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
 It's not that bad.

456
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
 It's not that bad.

457
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
 It's not fair to say it.

458
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
 It's not fair to say it.

459
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
 It's not fair to say it.

460
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
 It's not fair to say it.

461
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,760
 You are.

462
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:43,320
 I'm your wife.

463
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,800
 Just one quick thing about face recognition.

464
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,520
 This year, there was a festival in Wales that used facial recognition technology to recognise

465
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
 evil elvises.

466
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
 Wow.

467
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 They were trying to scan for people who were wanted, same as the A and L, when they were on

468
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,520
 their way into the world's largest Elvis festival in Bridgend in September, 35,000 people were

469
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
 going in.

470
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,600
 Most of them dressed as Elvis and officers scanned their faces all.

471
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,760
 And what they were looking for, bad guys, all.

472
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
 Yeah.

473
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 Bad guys.

474
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,560
 Well, there's a thing as well in Barcelona.

475
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,960
 They've tested out this new thing at comedy clubs whereby they've put on the back of seats

476
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,760
 little cameras that stairs directly into the face of the person sitting watching the

477
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:30,960
 comedy show and it's there to monitor laughter patterns so every time you laugh, it clicks and

478
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,560
 says you've laughed once.

479
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:37,240
 So if people at the end of the show go up and say, I found that very disappointing, I would

480
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
 like a refund.

481
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,000
 They can go, "Well, actually, you've laughed 67 times this evening and you can't have your

482
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 money back.

483
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 There's one.

484
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Yeah.

485
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,280
 Everyone's fake laughs at a comedy show, don't think for a minute, we genuinely think you're

486
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 laughing.

487
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,280
 Everyone's put on a fake.

488
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,880
 You could be laughing at how shit it is.

489
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,880
 Yeah, yeah.

490
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,080
 No, it's a test to see how it would work because what they do is they then they drop the

491
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,560
 price altogether of the ticket and so they clock up everyone's, this is free gig.

492
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
 You go to it.

493
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,080
 They clock up the laughter amount and then at the end of the gig, they say you've laughed

494
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,800
 and there's a cap on how much laughter it is.

495
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,200
 Everyone's just going to go, "I'm just going to enjoy this but I'm not going to laugh

496
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
 so I get it for free."

497
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 It's going to be awful.

498
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
 Yeah.

499
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,980
 Mouth closed, looks straight ahead, think of death, think of old people, just think of

500
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
 sadness.

501
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,420
 Some people don't laugh even when they're finding things really funny.

502
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,000
 You keep telling yourself that after your Edinburgh show, I'd refer you to the audiences at

503
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,720
 my solo show, who had a wonderful time on the feedback forms, just explained a lot of

504
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,620
 them were remembering something sad.

505
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,080
 Go quickly tell you my favorite headline that I've read recently.

506
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,960
 This is about recognising stuff.

507
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,400
 The headline is that babies can see things that adults can't but are unable to tell them.

508
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,960
 They'll look at a picture and they'll notice differences that we won't have spotted or

509
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,880
 maybe they haven't told us that we don't know.

510
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,880
 That's what they think.

511
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,600
 So how do we know they can see the differences?

512
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,600
 I don't know.

513
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 I didn't read the article.

514
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
 I just read the headline.

515
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,560
 That's going to go on your headstone, Dan.

516
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,360
 Should we move on to another episode?

517
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,360
 Yeah.

518
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
 Okay.

519
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,840
 It is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

520
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,560
 My fact is that there is a woman whose job for the last 30 years has been squatting above

521
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,200
 the Queen's throne so the TV cameras can get their angle right.

522
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
 That is amazing.

523
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,440
 The Queen doesn't squat above the throne, does she?

524
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
 No.

525
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,440
 Exactly.

526
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 Certainly not.

527
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,200
 Bella Slack and she's in her early 70s, she is the official stand-in for the Queen at

528
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:46,480
 all events where there are going to be TV cameras because she's pretty much exactly the same

529
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,280
 size as the Queen.

530
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,640
 And she doesn't look like the Queen at all, but she does it and she's done it 50 times

531
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
 with different state occasions.

532
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,640
 Why the squatting thing?

533
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,640
 That's what I want to know.

534
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,560
 Well, she said she was interviewed about her life, not quite being the Queen.

535
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,680
 By quite a long way not being the Queen, but she's not even in the line of succession

536
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
 frames.

537
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,920
 That's what makes you famous these days not being the Queen.

538
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,920
 Well, she said about the ceremony.

539
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:17,840
 How long have you not been the Queen?

540
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,880
 She said about the ceremonies, "I've never been allowed to sit on the throne in the House

541
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,480
 of Lords for the State opening of Parliament."

542
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,480
 Oh, I see.

543
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,520
 She said, "I have to lurk above it."

544
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,520
 Yeah.

545
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,760
 But she says it's a very strict rule and she does say, "If I'm in a carriage or a car, I

546
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
 will wave."

547
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,640
 Which is very sweet, yeah.

548
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,600
 She was employed over 30 years ago when it was realised that the Queen had the sun in her

549
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,000
 eyes at some event, and so the Queen might have the sun in her eyes, but she was selling

550
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 on a podium.

551
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,560
 And so this woman was sent to check that the sun wouldn't be in her eyes.

552
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
 And now she checks for that.

553
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,880
 So whenever the Queen has to stand up on a sunny day, she goes and checks first that the

554
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,280
 sun won't be in her eyes.

555
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,040
 She checks that she'll be visible over podiums, in case you've made a podium too high.

556
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,760
 In case Peter the Great's desk is brought up.

557
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 Wow.

558
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,440
 And she has her own Queen costume, which she's put together from charity shops.

559
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,680
 So her Queen handbag cost one quid.

560
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
 Yeah.

561
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,400
 And she got fake diamonds from Woolworths for the millennium.

562
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,400
 I just love it.

563
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,400
 I just think it's very nice.

564
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 She's not paid.

565
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
 She refuses to accept any money for the work she does.

566
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
 And she's been doing it for 30 years.

567
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,840
 I think she's one of the great unsung heroes of this country.

568
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,840
 Yeah.

569
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,840
 It's weird that she doesn't accept any payment and she pays for her travel and everything.

570
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
 I mean, I agree.

571
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,160
 Is there a, in a very small way?

572
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
 Yeah.

573
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,160
 Speaking of clothing, there is someone else who sort of does a stand-in job for the Queen as

574
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,160
 well.

575
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,040
 And that is it's someone specifically whose job is to break in the shoes of the Queen that

576
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,000
 are as of yet unworn.

577
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 So that's what they do.

578
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,240
 The people who provide all the clothing for her, her fashion people, the Queen's fashion

579
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
 people.

580
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,240
 They buy new shoes.

581
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,360
 And obviously, when you're wearing new shoes, they're very painful.

582
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,600
 And so someone is hired to just walk around in the new pair of shoes before she has a go

583
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
 at them.

584
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
 That's cool.

585
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,360
 So they must have the same size feet as the Queen, right?

586
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
 Or yes.

587
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,560
 It would be very funny if they did not.

588
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,160
 I just think in that the audition for that job or the job interview would be just like Cinderella

589
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 or something.

590
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,560
 I mean, you just have a load of people sat there, they just need the right size feet.

591
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
 Yeah.

592
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,840
 Because there's no other skill there, is there?

593
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,840
 No.

594
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
 It's probably a quick audition process, are you size eight, no?

595
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 Okay, thank you.

596
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
 Size eight.

597
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 The Queen.

598
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 A massive feet.

599
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 Yeah.

600
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,720
 Wow.

601
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 Size eight is not massive, by the way.

602
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
 What size is it?

603
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 It's supposed to be.

604
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
 It's supposed to be your five foot, too.

605
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 Yeah.

606
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
 Yeah, okay.

607
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,680
 Do you know, so I was looking at sort of the reason this lady, Ella Slack, she called.

608
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
 Yeah.

609
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,080
 Reason she does is it's like to prepare for ceremonial events.

610
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,160
 And the royal family, they have to rehearse all the royal ceremonies quite a lot.

611
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,440
 And in fact, the Queen herself spent weeks rehearsing for her coronation in 1953.

612
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,480
 So she was really nervous about it.

613
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,480
 And she used to play recordings of her father's coronation over and over again.

614
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,480
 Her father was George, you know, who had a stutter and so it's quite difficult for him.

615
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,640
 She used to play recordings of his coronation.

616
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,080
 And she paraded up and down what was called the white drawing room.

617
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,240
 Because that had the same dimensions as the theatre and the abbey where she was going

618
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
 to be coronated.

619
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,040
 And she timed herself doing it to make sure she was going to walk the right, you know,

620
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,720
 distance at the right pace.

621
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,840
 And she got all her ladies and waiting to walk alongside her.

622
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,920
 And she used to wear her bedsheets as a robe, as her queenly robes, which is so cool.

623
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,920
 That is really cool.

624
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,960
 She know in 2012 there was a queen shortage in the UK.

625
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,960
 Sorry?

626
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,880
 There was a queen shortage.

627
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,760
 It was due to all the Jubilee stuff and they needed queen lookalikes.

628
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,520
 And basically there's about, I don't know, there's about a couple of dozen people who can

629
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,960
 do queen lookalikes and they needed them all the time.

630
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,520
 And they said, the main lookalike company, Susan Scott lookalike said, we could have done

631
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,840
 with double or triple the amount of queens.

632
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,840
 That is amazing.

633
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,280
 Imagine when the button was pressed, dispatched the queens.

634
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,560
 They'll come out.

635
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,560
 What do you do?

636
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
 What do you do?

637
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:16,000
 What have room, do you think they've ever all been at the same place at the same time?

638
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720
 I don't know, but I did read an interview with Kate Middleton lookalike and she says that

639
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,320
 one of the queens, or one of the queen lookalikes, is like her honorary granny.

640
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,040
 And the reason is because they all hang out together all these lookalikes.

641
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,040
 Of course she do.

642
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,080
 You would think, because you're all working in the same role.

643
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,440
 The queen lookalikes and the Kate Middleton lookalikes will hang out with you.

644
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,920
 And the Pippa Middleton lookalikes, the Harry Potter lookalikes, the David Beckham lookalikes,

645
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,920
 they all hang out together.

646
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,320
 Why is Harry Potter at that party?

647
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,320
 It's just breaking a wall of some sort.

648
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,320
 Because then that's the only time they can truly be themselves, because outside those circles

649
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
 everyone's always saying, "Oh, you look just like Camilla Parker-Bulls."

650
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,320
 Well, to the Harry Potter lookalike.

651
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,560
 Have you ever thought about changing your lookalike, mate?

652
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,520
 You don't look like Harry Potter.

653
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,600
 They just on that subject, they do often, if they're a couple who are celebrity couples

654
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,560
 in real life, they will fall in love with each other and get married.

655
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,480
 I think there's examples of like a Katie Price and a Peter Andre lookalike when that was

656
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,000
 massive, falling in love because they did so many events together.

657
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 And when that was massive?

658
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 Yeah.

659
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,280
 Did you know by the whole new world album?

660
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:35,480
 So on body doubles, General Montgomery in the Second World War, Monty had an impersonator

661
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,560
 who for spying purposes pretended to be him and would go to different places so that

662
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,480
 German spies would think, "Oh, Monty's over here."

663
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,000
 Actually, Monty wasn't over here.

664
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,920
 Monty was over there defeating the Germans.

665
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:52,880
 So the only problem was that the lookalike had had a finger shot off in the First World

666
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,200
 War.

667
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,760
 So you needed to count the fingers on the fake Monty.

668
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 Really?

669
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,600
 He would have walked gloves or a prosthetic finger or something.

670
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,240
 And the only thing was there was another body double who was called Keith Deema Banwell

671
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,680
 who looked exactly like Montgomery.

672
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,160
 So he was used as a lookalike, the only problem was he was substantially taller than Monty

673
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,680
 so he was never allowed on any account to get out of his car.

674
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
 That's really good.

675
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,920
 Was that Tex Banwell or Clifton James, I think?

676
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:27,520
 Clifton James was the first one with Clifton James, yeah, it was called Operation Copperhead

677
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,640
 and basically it was when we were planning the British Replanning Tax on the Germans and

678
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,120
 it was dispatched people who looked like him to all parts of the world.

679
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,840
 But he was a drunk as well so he was an absolute liability I think.

680
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,960
 It's only funny the idea of dispatching these fake Monty's everywhere.

681
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,640
 Well, we've had intelligence that he's an Antarctica, should be strengths and defenses

682
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,640
 in Antarctica.

683
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,560
 Did you guys read about the Mexican politician who's actually looking for body doubles or he

684
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,520
 was looking for body doubles?

685
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:01,840
 This is a guy called Renato Dronco Gomez and this was in 2015, he's a politician in the

686
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,200
 Mexican Parliament and he put out a call for body doubles because he wants to maintain his

687
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,600
 popularity and he's like, I'm so popular that I need to be in multiple places at once.

688
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,400
 So he's trying to do an ego on the band.

689
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,640
 He said, and he said, I'm not that fussy.

690
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,080
 If you're short then you can wear platform shoes.

691
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,080
 If you're chubby you can lose weight, if you're thin you can gain weight.

692
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
 It's fine.

693
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,520
 If you're tall I'll cut your feet off.

694
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,480
 He said the band from smoking and drinking because he doesn't smoke and drinking has to be realistic.

695
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,120
 Although at any public events he stipulated that they would have to say, I'm the double

696
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,320
 by the way, you're not quite getting the real guy you're getting a look alike.

697
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,260
 And he said, most importantly, they will not be able to live in my home, sleep with my

698
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,040
 wife or go to congress.

699
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,200
 So no shagging as part of the job.

700
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
 Yeah.

701
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,560
 It's any second most important on his list though, wasn't it?

702
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,360
 In order of importance between going to congress and living in my house.

703
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,960
 I can imagine his wife going, wait a minute, you've got no feet.

704
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,200
 Hey, I read a thing guys, which is that, so on the subject of body doubles, a lot of

705
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,760
 in movies there's obviously stunt doubles and body doubles for the biggest actors in

706
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
 the world.

707
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
 They all have them.

708
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,640
 And I started looking into stunt doubles generally for this topic tonight and found this

709
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,200
 thing where there's a lot of anger amongst the Hollywood community of stunt doubles because

710
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,360
 there's no Oscar for stunt doubling or body doubling and that is such a huge part of the

711
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,360
 movies.

712
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,920
 What you see in there is making people believe that you've been blown out of a window or

713
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,200
 they have it for special effects.

714
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,200
 They have a special event, but they think they should have an Oscar for it.

715
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,580
 And I found that there's actually a big petition that's been going on.

716
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,200
 And as far as I could see, as of last year, they stopped pushing it to the public because

717
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,680
 they didn't get the 100,000 votes that they needed.

718
00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:01,660
 So it's on a site where they've managed to get 87,393 supporters and they've not quite

719
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,960
 hit the 100,000 that they need.

720
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,720
 So I'm going to read out the website for this here.

721
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
 It's called thepetitionSite.com.

722
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,680
 You've got to look for a standup for stunts and I reckon if enough people who are listening

723
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,040
 to this podcast can just go to that site very quickly and just give them a petition support

724
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,240
 we could get to 100,000 maybe next year or the year after stunt people can get an Oscar

725
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
 at the main award.

726
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
 How cool would that be?

727
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,440
 But they could upscale through the ceiling and pick up their award.

728
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
 Yes, yes.

729
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,140
 They're so close and the last update was a year ago, so they've given up and that's so

730
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,840
 sad because they're incredible.

731
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,880
 I would love to see the stunt Oscars.

732
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,720
 Everyone's constantly blowing shit up, smashing through the glass.

733
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,720
 That would be incredible.

734
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
 As a member of the audience, you'd be constantly looking for the emergency exit before someone

735
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,960
 said, "No, no, no, it's fine.

736
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
 It's part of it."

737
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,200
 But they are, they're more kind of omnipresent than you think, aren't they?

738
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,000
 So you know that bit in Notting Hill where Judy Roberts talks about people having butt

739
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 doubles.

740
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,040
 I always thought that was a bit that had been scripted in and wasn't true, but they all

741
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,440
 have body doubles.

742
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,000
 And in fact, really trashy piece of celebrity information, but in pretty women, Judy Roberts

743
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,200
 had a body double for that as she was called Shelley Michelle and actually in the really

744
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,280
 iconic poster of pretty women where, you know, she's kind of leaning against something and

745
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,720
 she's got something over her shoulder, she's wearing some short leather skirt or something.

746
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,440
 The whole, the only bit of her that's Judy Roberts is the head.

747
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,680
 The rest of that is a body.

748
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,080
 So it's, I just wonder so weird.

749
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,320
 Someone else is body.

750
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,960
 But there are a lot of monkeys looking at that picture going, "That's not Julia Roberts's

751
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
 ass."

752
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,680
 Guys, we need to move on to our final facts.

753
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,160
 James, you got something before we do?

754
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,400
 So I was looking at Queen's jobs because this is person who's employed to do something

755
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
 for the Queen.

756
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:59,120
 The Queen has a keeper of the Queen's stamps because the Queen doesn't like stamp collecting

757
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,000
 while she has a shitload of stamps.

758
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,640
 And so she implies someone to be her official stamp collector.

759
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
 You're kidding.

760
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
 I am not kidding.

761
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,920
 And does she go and say, "How's my stamp collection doing?"

762
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,920
 I guess so.

763
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,000
 Why doesn't she like, does she not like the, licking the back of her own head?

764
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,760
 If you collect stamps, you don't lick them.

765
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
 What?

766
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,240
 That's surely one of the perks of stamp collecting.

767
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
 It's fun.

768
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,880
 You just can't get your stamp sac, oh, just lick that one again.

769
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,360
 I wouldn't lick the fronts of the stamps.

770
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,760
 That is deranged.

771
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,760
 Now, it's forcing her to collect stamps.

772
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,000
 No, she has a collection that's already there.

773
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,760
 So she needs someone to look after it.

774
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,080
 But this guy does go and get extra stamps for her collection.

775
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
 Yeah.

776
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,640
 So he is basically doing a hobby for her.

777
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,640
 Yeah.

778
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
 It's like having an official jigsaw maker.

779
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
 Yes.

780
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,200
 Oh, but she does collect jigsaws.

781
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
 No, wait.

782
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,720
 The fact is she doesn't collect jigsaws.

783
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,800
 Sorry, it's not, no, hang on.

784
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,720
 It's better than it sounds.

785
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,800
 She doesn't collect jigsaws.

786
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
 She does jigsaws.

787
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
 She loves them.

788
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,720
 But to save buying loads of jigsaws, she gets them out of her jigsaw library.

789
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,040
 You can rent jigsaws?

790
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
 Yeah.

791
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,040
 It's just a library.

792
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
 It's a free library for jigsaws.

793
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
 Sorry.

794
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
 Is she low on cash?

795
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
 God.

796
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
 She is thrifty.

797
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,040
 Well, I think they should put our taxes up.

798
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
 If the queen's on a four jigsaws, I'm not paying enough tax.

799
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,040
 Hey, listen, let's move on to our final factor, the show.

800
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
 And that is Chazinski.

801
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,840
 My fight is that.

802
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:44,560
 The US president, Jimmy Carter, once sent the nuclear launch codes to his dry cleaner.

803
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,600
 And not on purpose.

804
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,160
 This is, I read this article in Timeline, which is one of my favourite websites, timeline.com.

805
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,040
 And it's about the fact that there's been an open secret in Washington since Jimmy Carter

806
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,320
 was president that he lost the nuclear biscuit, as it's known, which is the little kind of

807
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,400
 credit card with the codes on it, because he sent a suit to the dry cleaners.

808
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,560
 And it was in the pocket, because the president has to have it on him at all times.

809
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,760
 And it's just, it's amazing.

810
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,200
 Did it come back sort of slightly blurry and he was like, oh, is that a, is that a six or

811
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
 a five?

812
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
 I'll wing it.

813
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
 I'll wing it.

814
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,800
 But isn't it true that basically all the presidents lose the codes all the time?

815
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,120
 They're very scattered with it.

816
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:30,840
 We can only hope that they lose the codes all the time, from wing at the moment.

817
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,720
 One of the problems that they do have from George W. Bush onwards is that the person carrying

818
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,800
 the football has to be by the president at all times, but the president often forgets that.

819
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,840
 So the president will finish what they're doing, hop in a car, and drive off.

820
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,200
 And then suddenly guy with the nuclear code is going, what do I do?

821
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,000
 And they have to chase after the president and try and get back to him in case he's needed

822
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,160
 I would constantly hide as president.

823
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,320
 You actually would, wouldn't you?

824
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,440
 You'd be deliberately all the time trying to sneak off.

825
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
 Yeah.

826
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,520
 You go even in the same lift as the president.

827
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,400
 I don't know what happens when the president asleep though.

828
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,040
 They sleep in the same bed as them.

829
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
 Do they?

830
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
 Yeah.

831
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,360
 When you found a fact for our book, which is about the fact that if Trump goes to, yes,

832
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,200
 yeah, if he goes to New York, the nuclear button has its own multi-million dollar flat in

833
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,760
 New York, which he didn't, the flat didn't get used for the first eight months of the

834
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,240
 presidency because he didn't go to New York, but they've hired a luxury apartment just

835
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,560
 for the button to sit in.

836
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,520
 But I like the fact that it's for the button and it's also for the people who guard the button

837
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,520
 so it's for his staff.

838
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,840
 But I like the idea that it is mainly for the button, so the button's in the double bed.

839
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:41,880
 And the staff are just standing to attention around the bed.

840
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,200
 Are you comfortable, sir?

841
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,600
 As you say, Clinton lost it.

842
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 Yeah, Clinton lost it.

843
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,840
 He kept it rubber banded to his credit cards in a trouser pocket.

844
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,680
 Imagine that.

845
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,680
 That makes sense.

846
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
 It doesn't make sense.

847
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,440
 It's a very crazy thing to do.

848
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,040
 If you accidentally put in your nuclear button card into the machine at the till, I don't

849
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,360
 think that's how it sets off stuff, I don't think.

850
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:11,240
 This is why they say contactless is a very dangerous technology.

851
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,440
 And they only found out, didn't they, when I think Clinton's aide said, look, could you

852
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,560
 give me the biscuit back because we need to give you an updated version.

853
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,880
 This came out in a autobiography here a while ago, I think that's someone called

854
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
 Patterson.

855
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,400
 And here's, so his aide said, give me the biscuit back because we need to swap it.

856
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,720
 And Clinton said, yeah, yeah, sure, I think his upstairs, I just left it upstairs, I'll go

857
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
 and get it.

858
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,720
 And he's going around for a bit.

859
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,520
 And then eventually he admitted that he hadn't seen it for months and he had no idea where

860
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,520
 he put it.

861
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,520
 Oh, my God.

862
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,120
 But he must have known he hadn't seen it for months and he must have been…

863
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
 Oh, he would have been convocating.

864
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,120
 Absolutely.

865
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
 Shit.

866
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,120
 Yeah.

867
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:52,080
 So there was a lot of worry that a president with this kind of power could launch based

868
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,880
 on, let's say, even in our current climate, you know, you get too angry one day.

869
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,120
 The president might suddenly go, even in the current climate, that might happen.

870
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,800
 Yeah, in the current blissfully calm environment, we're all living in that climate, yeah.

871
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,240
 But he might suddenly, you know, it's a very, it's quite an easy process to do.

872
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,080
 And back in the day, there was a Harvard professor who thought about this and thought, actually,

873
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,560
 we need to make it a bit harder, we need to make it a big decision for the president to

874
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,560
 do.

875
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,560
 So this is what he suggested.

876
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,280
 He said, my suggestion was quite simple.

877
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,000
 Put the code that you needed to launch the nuclear warheads in a little capsule.

878
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,160
 And plant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer.

879
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:33,520
 The volunteer would carry with him a big butcher's knife, as he accompanied the president.

880
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,080
 If the president ever wanted to fire the nuclear weapons, the only way he would do so would

881
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,240
 be with his own hands to kill the person and then to break it out of them in order to

882
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
 do it.

883
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
 Yeah.

884
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,680
 And that wasn't a popular suggestion, in fact, they even went for it with Peter the Grey,

885
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,480
 he would have absolutely loved it.

886
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,440
 It's in here somewhere.

887
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,920
 Although interestingly, this is the carotid.

888
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,080
 I think that's a very impractical suggestion.

889
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:07,240
 It's a guy Roger Fisher, he was a Harvard professor, he published it in the Bulletin of

890
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
 Atomic Science.

891
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,440
 It was a real thing and it was very talked about.

892
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,440
 I don't know.

893
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,320
 The president constantly being company, but his man with a knife.

894
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,840
 This absolutely terrified, lucky man with a knife, is that?

895
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
 How?

896
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,400
 Just to finish that off, because I found that as well.

897
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,160
 They suggested it to the Pentagon, didn't they?

898
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
 Yeah.

899
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,040
 And the Pentagon said, my God, that's terrible.

900
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,960
 Having to kill someone would distort the president's judgment, he might never push the

901
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,960
 button.

902
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,960
 Really?

903
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,960
 Wow.

904
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,960
 Wow.

905
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,240
 So, like you said, there are two things, isn't there?

906
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,280
 There's this card, which is the biscuit.

907
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
 Yeah.

908
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,960
 And then there's the briefcase, which is the football.

909
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,680
 The briefcase is manufactured by a company called Zero Halliburton.

910
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,160
 Okay, and Zero Halliburton, they were Utah firm, and they do this, and the other thing is

911
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,960
 they do aluminium briefcases for Hollywood.

912
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:07,640
 So they've made briefcases for 24, West Wing, Independence Day, and Santa with Muscles.

913
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:10,520
 That's the main ones.

914
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,480
 Santa with Muscles is the 79th worst rated film in the whole of IMDB.

915
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
 Wow.

916
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
 No way.

917
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
 Wow.

918
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,480
 In the whole thing.

919
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
 In the whole thing.

920
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,000
 There must be billions in there.

921
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,480
 Sorry, they make, so they make this, they make, well, they're not fake because they need to

922
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,480
 use them in the movies, but these really are some kind of aluminium briefcases, because

923
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,920
 the guy who invented it realized that briefcases are not so good, and aluminium ones will

924
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
 be better.

925
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,720
 And they're good for carrying nuclear codes.

926
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,840
 The nuclear codes that they have, by the way, are pretty weird, so that it's basically

927
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:51,400
 two lists, and they're pictorial, and one list is places to bomb, and the other one is how

928
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,040
 to bomb them.

929
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,140
 So you basically go down, you go, "Hell, go for this one, Pyongyang, and this one, a big

930
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,140
 fuck off bomb."

931
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,140
 Wow.

932
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,080
 I can't, but, I mean, the one thing keeping the world safe was the idea that Trump would have

933
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,200
 to read more than six words.

934
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,400
 A military aide to Bill Clinton said it was like a Denny's breakfast menu.

935
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
 Yeah.

936
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,240
 He said, "You picked one out of Colomé, and two out of Colomé."

937
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
 But it's bad.

938
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:23,200
 I wonder how seriously, because it obviously scares you to hear that this thing exists generally,

939
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
 I think.

940
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,440
 But I don't know how seriously they took it.

941
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,080
 So the fact is about Jimmy Carter having sent it accidentally the codes to the dry cleaners.

942
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:36,880
 When Jimmy Carter first got the nuclear football, it was given to him by the LBJ presidential

943
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,000
 administration, and when it was brought to him, the guy looked inside the briefcase when

944
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,320
 he first opened it in the companionship of, when he was with Jimmy Carter.

945
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,880
 And inside it, when they opened it, they found that the previous administration was having

946
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,200
 a bit of a joke, because they left inside it an empty beer can and a condom not for humans

947
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,480
 for horses.

948
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,040
 And that was inside the most deadly bag that a president could have next to them.

949
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
 And he didn't tell Jimmy Carter.

950
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
 He closed it.

951
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,040
 He went, "Yup, it's all good."

952
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,640
 And Jimmy Carter never found out about that.

953
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:10,640
 What?

954
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,640
 Yeah.

955
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,640
 The horses have condoms.

956
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,640
 I didn't know that either.

957
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,640
 No.

958
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,640
 Yeah.

959
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,640
 For me is the headline from that story.

960
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,640
 Yeah.

961
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,640
 Yeah.

962
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
 How do they put them on?

963
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,960
 Yeah, I've not even thought about.

964
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
 Nobody knows.

965
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,240
 On the US News, so there is a secretive US agency, and their job is to transport all the

966
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,600
 nuclear material around America, because obviously you've got loads of missile silos, you've

967
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,800
 got loads of nuclear science, and very few people know about this, but they're called

968
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,960
 the Office of Secure Transportation, and their vehicles sound absolutely insane.

969
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,800
 So the defenses, obviously, they've got convoys they go with, but the defenses include

970
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,200
 shock delivering systems, which basically means if you touch it, it electrocutes you.

971
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,480
 They've got axles which explode, so you can't drive them away even if you do manage to

972
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
 take over it.

973
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,760
 And they also have thick walls which ooze immobilizing foam.

974
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
 Wow.

975
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,040
 So if you are wrong and you touch the lorry, it just oozes out at you, and then catches

976
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,520
 you like you're on fly paper.

977
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,600
 It's so weird, because foam isn't that immobilizing.

978
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
 I put in baths.

979
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
 Yeah.

980
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,640
 I think of how difficult it is to get out of the bath.

981
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,640
 Yeah.

982
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,320
 They have special stuff, don't they?

983
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,320
 I think it's special.

984
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
 It's special foam.

985
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
 Yeah.

986
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
 It's a mobilizing foam.

987
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:31,320
 Got it.

988
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
 Not palm or live.

989
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:34,320
 Black or African bubble bath.

990
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,560
 We're going to have to wrap up in a sec, anything before we do, guys.

991
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,360
 I can tell you that we've been talking about American nuclear bombs.

992
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,520
 We have nuclear bombs as well in the UK.

993
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:49,000
 And it is technically legal for Prince Charles to set off a nuclear bomb.

994
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
 No.

995
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
 That's true.

996
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
 It's true.

997
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,560
 It's because he is the Duke of Cornwall.

998
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,560
 And if you're Duke of Cornwall, there's a few laws you technically don't have to follow.

999
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,400
 And one of them is the Nuclear Explosions Act.

1000
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,640
 The other one is the Data Protection Act.

1001
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,360
 And another one is the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

1002
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,760
 So it means, as well as being able to set off nuclear bombs, he can share your email address

1003
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,720
 with third parties.

1004
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:23,200
 And technically, he's allowed to shoot a great-crested newt with a machine gun.

1005
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,520
 That's amazing.

1006
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,320
 OK.

1007
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,320
 That is it.

1008
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
 That is all of our facts.

1009
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,040
 Thank you so much for listening.

1010
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,800

 course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1012
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,760
 I'm on @Sriberland.

1013
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
 Andy.

1014
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
 @AndruhunterM.

1015
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,760
 James.

00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,760
 @JamesHarkin.

1017
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:44,760
 And Jaczynski.

1019
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760

 Or you can go to our group account, which is @nosuchthing.

00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,680
 Or you can go to our website.

1022
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,960
 Nosuchthing is a fish.com where we have all of our previous episodes.

1023
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:59,640
 Also got a link to our book, which we're about to give a copy away to one member of

1024
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,000
 the audience here in Birmingham.

1025
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,520
 We asked you to send in your facts before the show started.

1026
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,040
 And here we go.

1027
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,040
 This is the fact.

1028
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,040
 Andy, what is it?

1029
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,040
 I've got it.

1030
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,040
 I'm just taking the phone off airplane mode.

1031
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,040
 Unbelievable.

1032
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,040
 OK.

1033
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,760
 So this fact was sent in by a man called Steven Conneber.

1034
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:23,040
 And his fact is that the game Cludo was invented by a Pratt from Birmingham.

1035
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
 Sorry.

1036
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,800
 That's a Pratt from Birmingham.

1037
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,000
 And it was called Murder at Tudor Close.

1038
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
 Wow.

1039
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
 Cool.

1040
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
 OK.

1041
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,200
 Well, if you're here, come and grab a book from us at the end.

1042
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,800
 Guys, as I said at the beginning, we're going to be in the back.

1043
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
 We've got books.

1044
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,000
 If you want to get one, we'll be there signing them.

1045
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,200
 Hopefully, I don't know how much time we have, but we'll try and bang through as many

1046
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,200
 of you as possible.

1047
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,200
 And then we'll study on them.

1048
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,200
 I mean, in the correct climate, then.

1049
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,200
 Bad choice of words.

1050
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,600
 Bad choice of words.

1051
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,000
 But Birmingham, this has been awesome.

1052
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,600
 And by the way, just before we wrap up, because again, we're doing these bigger venues, we

1053
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,280
 thought we'd end on something special.

1054
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,800
 We have here tonight, as I said, the singer and songwriter, Emperor Yes, Ash Gardener is

1055
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,800
 here.

1056
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:14,400
 And we're going to go out by playing our theme tune live for you guys tonight as I go.

1057
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
 Yeah.

1058
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,960
 So please welcome to the stage, ladies and gentlemen.

1059
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,000
 It is Ash Gardener.

1060
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,800
 There he is, everybody.

1061
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,800
 And thank you so much, Birmingham.

1062
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:25,800
 That was awesome.

1063
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,800
 Thank you.

1064
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,800
