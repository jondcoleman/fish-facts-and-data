00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,280
 Hello and welcome to another bonus segment. A new format and this is an extra special look

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:25,600
 behind the scenes to a process that happens every single week where the four of us sit down

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,480
 and we choose our favorite facts from each other's selection. It's normally a very

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,360
 dry and business-like conversation that takes three minutes and so, uh, take your watches.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,920
 We're gonna be padding it out. There'll be some fluff. There'll be some extra fluff.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,280
 And so how do we normally start? Normally we say who's got some facts. No, I think what happens is

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,000
 we go round in order and we have three or four facts that we say and then the rest of us decide

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
 which are good and which are not good. Yeah. So is the act of us recording this going to change it

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,360
 like beyond recognition? What do you mean? Well, you know how, isn't that a thing in physics?

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
 Well, you look at something and then it changes. Oh, the observer effect. Yeah. Yeah. So we might

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
 make bad decisions because we're recording it. Exactly. It's almost not we are observing,

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,440
 but we are the ones being observed. It might be that we make better decisions because we feel

14
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,200
 under more pressure. Yeah. Or we might say two honest things about each other's facts that we

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
 might not have... Well, I'm a bit worried. ...for comedic reasons. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah,

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,960
 hurt each other's feelings. I think it's going to be like the Wizard of Oz where you lift up the

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,880
 curtain at the end. He's just a sad old man. That's what you're all going to realise. He's just three

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,960
 sad old men. I was going to say. All right. So James. Sad old man number one. Okay. What's your

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,800
 favourite facts from this week? I'll give you my list. I'll just give you the first one on my

20
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,240
 list. So 804 pineapples were consumed at Robert Louis Stevenson's 44th birthday party. Wow.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
 That's a very good fact. What do you think? Well, they were worth so much back then.

22
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,080
 Not so much to the people on the island where he was, where they were growing all over the place.

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,480
 If they took them back to the UK, they were really, really precious. Fools. Yeah.

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,960
 Wasn't it like Samoa? American Samoa? It was in the South Pacific for sure.

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,920
 Is this the place where he gave away his birthday to a girl? Remember he...

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
 Yes. Have we covered that before? Yeah, I think we have on the show.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,000
 I can't remember why she didn't have a birthday though. Her birthday was either on Christmas

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,440
 Day or New Year's Day, I think, so she didn't like it. I read there was a Roman emperor. I can't

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,280
 remember which one it was and he said that anyone who had a birthday on a Sunday could change it to

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,680
 any other day they wanted. Why? That's quite good. Because you're not allowed to booze up on a Sunday?

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
 I think it was something like that. I think it must have been a later one when Catholicism had taken

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
 over. Yeah. But yeah, it's like on a Sunday you had to go to church or whatever, so he was like,

33
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,160
 "Oh well, maybe you have your birthday on a Tuesday instead." Good guy. But if we covered that stuff

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,160
 before and maybe we could do birthday parties? We could do. I feel like we've done pineapples

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,760
 a lot as well in the territory I was talking about, a sort of hell.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,960
 From Bowman's book. Yeah, you said about pineapple boy who would sleep with the pineapples at night

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,360
 and very painful, isn't it? That's a mafia threat actually. You're going to be sleeping with the

38
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,640
 pineapples. Oh, I thought you meant they leave a dead pineapple in your bed. Just the hair. It's

39
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:25,040
 just that top bit. Yeah. It's great though. It's great depending on how many people came. If

40
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,400
 5,000 people came to the past, it was the whole island basically. It's actually not that many

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
 pineapples per person. I wonder if many of them have fingerprints on that island. You know that

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,960
 thing when you're dealing pineapples a lot, it burns off your fingerprints. Yes. You know what?

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,960
 We said that and I'm pretty sure. Didn't Tom Scott do a video, our friend Tom, who's been on

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,880
 the show? I think he did a video trying to burn off his own fingerprints and it didn't quite work.

45
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,000
 Ah, okay. I just feel like it should work because there are enzymes in there. All I'm going to say

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,360
 is that we've done very little on Robert Louis Devenson actually. Andi has got the spreadsheet

47
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,120
 in front of him. Gone into the archives. 30,000 facts. We've mentioned one headline fact about

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,320
 him, which is that he died halfway through making a batch of mayonnaise. Really? That was five years

49
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,440
 ago. And I think probably the soil has refurbished itself since then. So we could do that. Give

50
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,840
 us another one. Okay. So here's another one. In 2010, Jaguar made a card that sounded like an

51
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:29,680
 actual Jaguar. That's great. Does it actually... It goes... Can it climb trees? With its prey?

52
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,560
 No, but it can run faster than a Jaguar can. I was confusing Jaguars and cheaters then because

53
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,640
 it's cheaters, isn't it? Who go, "Meow." Which would be actually way more impressive for a car.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,480
 No, Jaguar's doing that. "Rar." That's great. Is that designed for when you're at a red light

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,000
 to intimidate the person next year? No, it's just really to show off, I think. And it's because

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,160
 they're called Jaguar. Yeah, and supercars are quite interesting. They're quite sort of cool.

57
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,960
 Is it too... Yeah, because there's a Fiat Panda, isn't there? It's just chomping bamboo.

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,760
 Is it too controversial at the moment, just because people are so angry about Jaguar's new logo,

59
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,440
 and we don't want to be that divisive? I didn't see that. Oh, you're not online enough.

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,080
 They had a... You know my family, what's happened? I don't know. Your family... Yeah, but they are

61
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,640
 known as Jaguar and Jaguar. My mum and my brothers have lost the plot. Okay, well, here's one. Here's

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,960
 one for the lads. Penises are getting bigger, and doctors are very worried about it.

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,400
 Interesting. That's good. Why are they getting bigger? We don't know. That's the problem. That's

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,920
 the worry. They've got lots of details about how long penises have been historically,

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,600
 because we have lots of medical records, and they've noticed that in the last

66
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,840
 20, 30 years, they're a little bit longer than they used to be. Is it like, oh no,

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,960
 is it big underpand? Terrified that these things are just going to bust through.

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,440
 They're not that much bigger. So we're talking fresh children. It's not like the three of us

69
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,800
 sitting here have just slightly... Like, compared to your grandfather, for instance.

70
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,160
 You must have done that comparison when you were younger. You know, all generations of a family

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,200
 line up. You've got the wall chart, which is how tall you are vertically as you age.

72
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:30,320
 The x-axis, yeah. I suppose, are we worried because we're worried that vaginas are not

73
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,360
 proportionally improved in size? Yeah, what's the word? No, you know, classic sexism, they haven't,

74
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,320
 as far as I know, looked at the average death of vaginas, obviously. Well, they can check my

75
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:47,680
 family wall chart. It's a volume thing, though, isn't it? Yeah, it is. It's a vase on the man's

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:59,680
 piece. It's a vase, yes. Like a matrioshka doll. So, the reason that we're worried is because this

77
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,160
 is obviously an issue. If things are changing in genitals on humans, then there could be a problem

78
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,520
 in the future of, you know, where the future generations come from. We don't know why it's

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,120
 happening. And until we work out why it's happening, we don't know if it's a problem or if it isn't a

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,880
 problem. So, something, as of yet, a mysterious thing is making penises longer. It's a good fact.

81
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,600
 It's a good fact. It's a great mystery. It's quite penise, isn't it, as a fact? It is, actually.

82
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,160
 And we do sometimes try to avoid being too penise-y. Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't think so unless

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,560
 there were penises. You have no idea the number of penises I have to swatch. Okay, well, that's

84
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,240
 my three. Are we going to choose them now or should we choose them at the end? No, let's

85
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,480
 check because we'll find out the mix of which ones fit best. Yes. Thank you for your submissions,

86
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,560
 James. Okay, so it's the jaguars, the penises, or the pineapples? Lovely. Lovely. Very good.

87
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,440
 Dan Schreiber, have you got any true facts for us this week? I have three true facts. Yeah. So,

88
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,840
 a Christian marriage is not consummated if contraception is used. That's according to a

89
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,160
 theologian called Fryer Hardon. Right. Again. Again, a bit of penisey. Again. Where? Good, though.

90
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:22,960
 Where? Fryer Hardon. I see now. I get it. Yeah. Fryer Hardon is actually slightly taller than

91
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
 his predecessor at the monastery. Yeah. Actually, that's weird. I've got two facts where I've been

92
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,040
 drawn to the the name being sort of nominative determinism about. Is he a big deal? Well, he's

93
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:42,240
 okay. In what world? He died about a decade, maybe a bit more ago, but they're trying to

94
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,960
 canonize him. They want him to become a saint. Saint Hardon. Saint Hardon. He's got a lot of

95
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,640
 controversies about him. Not him personally, but he sort of helped people who were doing

96
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,760
 bad things. The usual. Yeah, that's so weird because another one of my facts here is when

97
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,320
 Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis was published, it was first condemned for encouraging masturbation,

98
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,160
 and I found that in a paper by a guy called James Seaman. Jesus Christ. Why are you Googling?

99
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,920
 Can you stop using your only found search terms to do your fact-finding?

100
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,600
 But yeah, so that's one of them. They're both very funny.

101
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,640
 They are funny, but do you have anything that's more of a fact? I've got two more. I've got,

102
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,560
 I like this. Some banks provide their super rich customers with a wealth psychologist,

103
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,920
 so they help them to deal with all the guilt that they have because they've got so much

104
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,040
 damn money. They're just like, "I'm breaking down," and they have someone to come in and say,

105
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,040
 "Hey, it's okay being that rich. You're fine. You're good." I wonder how much those psychologists

106
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:48,560
 charge. You'd feel so free about charging. You know how I can assuage your guilt a little bit?

107
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
 They're in-house, so it's while they're having the guilt that they sort of press the intercom

108
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,440
 and say, "Send wealth psychologists." The problem is once you've been working in that industry for

109
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,760
 long enough, then you have to get a psychologist yourself to sort you out with all the money you've

110
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,160
 made. Oh, cool. It's wealth psychologists all the way down. Okay, that's really good.

111
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,440
 Well, it's just a cool job that I didn't know existed, or a weird job, rather, that I didn't

112
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,680
 know existed. I got one last one. Queen Elizabeth I never visited Shakespeare's Globe,

113
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,880
 but she did visit a venue down the road at least six times to watch bears fighting with dogs and

114
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,800
 monkeys. To be fair, more entertaining than a comedy of errors. Yeah. This was a big thing

115
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,080
 back in the day. I got this from my friend, Dr Matthew Green. He wrote a book which my wife

116
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,600
 actually published called London A Traveler's Guide Through Time, and it was in there that

117
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,320
 I read that. Oh, that's a really good book. It's a great book, yeah. It's as if he's a time traveling

118
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,360
 tourist guide walking you through different times in London. Yeah, I got that in there.

119
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,080
 That's very interesting because I didn't know that we knew whether or not Elizabeth had gone to

120
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,560
 Shakespeare's Globe. That's very cool. She liked to bear bait. According to quite a few places,

121
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,720
 I've read she never went to the Globe. If we did that, that's a really fun subject of cruel,

122
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,360
 old animal sports. Well, it's just interesting what was going on parallel to what Shakespeare

123
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,880
 was putting on in the Globe, and was actually weirdly more popular amongst the higher echelons,

124
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,080
 like the Queen herself. Have we done things like bear baiting much before, or, you know,

125
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,600
 fox tossing? I don't think we have done fox tossing because I think we had Ed

126
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,400
 brought kitchen oil, but that's right. I don't think we've done bear baiting. I'm not sure whether

127
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:33,120
 we want to necessarily go into bear baiting. Is it not funny, even if it was 500 years ago?

128
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:42,240
 Anyone who knew those bears is dead now. Yeah. It puts exit pursued by a bear into a new light,

129
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,600
 doesn't it? Yeah. He just nicked that stage direction for the show down the road.

130
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,920
 But I think, yeah, what's happening around Shakespeare's time, the rude names.

131
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,120
 Well, I guess we wouldn't talk about the rude names. We would talk about

132
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,920
 the legal definition of a marriage. Yeah, well, it's interesting because this is a genuine debate

133
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,160
 within, so I picked Frye hard on for obvious reasons, but that is a debate. When is a marriage

134
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:17,200
 consummated? According to one side, it's when semen has been released into another body,

135
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,920
 it's body flesh on flesh, flesh in flesh, whatever. And then the other side says that...

136
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,360
 Do you mean sorry, Barbara Seaman, one of the key women involved in making birth control available?

137
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,920
 Are you kidding? No, I'm not even kidding. It's called Barbara Seaman.

138
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,080
 Well, yeah. Should have saved that, shouldn't you? Yeah.

139
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,880
 Can't in fact do more. Andy's used up as only interesting facts.

140
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:42,240
 Yeah, but I mean, yeah, it's interesting debate on both sides. And then, yeah, like weird jobs

141
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,400
 in banks, I think is an interesting one as well. Yeah. Are we picking now or are we...

142
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,440
 No, no, no, we'll do it. All right. So, hold on, remind us the themes of...

143
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,800
 You've got four. You've got Seaman. Frye hard on. Yeah, Frye hard on.

144
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,280
 I've got bear fighting dog and monkey, and I have banks with wealth psychologists.

145
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,520
 All right. Okay, nice. Andrew Montemari.

146
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,200
 Colonel Sanders was a part-time midwife. Did he get nearly family pockets?

147
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,160
 Well, there was some finger licking going on.

148
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,120
 Well, that's it, isn't it? Okay, well, we've done all the jokes.

149
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,880
 James, you could then say your fact, which I think is the best fact you've ever told me.

150
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
 What was it? About fish smell.

151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,400
 Oh, that's really rude. Oh, no.

152
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,760
 What? You wouldn't say it was rude if it was about penises?

153
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,120
 Yeah. Okay, well, let me just say that there is a chemical in your body

154
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:44,800
 that if you're a woman will make your genital smell fishy. And that same chemical is put into

155
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,680
 vegan fish fingers to give the smell of fish to what otherwise would just smell of bean curd

156
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
 or whatever it is. I can imagine if we put that out, some fish finger maker will actually sue us

157
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,640
 for their sales plummeting. Because I'm never buying them again.

158
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:03,840
 I'm not sure it's all of them, just to save me, save my back. But I think that is true, actually.

159
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:10,160
 But it's not, this is a synthetic chemical that's being used. It is not being harvested.

160
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,520
 They've asked me to volunteer. It's not like captain's bed size.

161
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:26,000
 Quick dip. Below decks on his ship. Since he went veggie, it's all changed. Oh, gosh. Okay.

162
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,680
 Anyway, so I can't remember the original fact now.

163
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,880
 Colonel Sanders. We must have covered him quite a lot. We actually haven't.

164
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,440
 Thank you very much. We've done the biggie where he, we've talked about how he's sold it off and

165
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,000
 he became, he opened up a separate one. We have mentioned something about his tombstone.

166
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,680
 We've mentioned that his autobiography was called Life as I Know It Has Been Finger-Licking Good.

167
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,880
 We've done that KFC is actually not from K, it's from Utah.

168
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,280
 And we've done that he drove around, he traveled a quarter of a million miles visiting KFC Brodges.

169
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,000
 I'm really surprised we haven't done the fact that he sold it, because that's.

170
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,200
 Yeah, I thought we had, we must have cut it. How about they released a novel?

171
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,720
 As well. Remember the romance novel that was released about him? Oh, yeah.

172
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,480
 We did that, I'm sure. Wings of Desire. Yes, we have for that. So anyway, is that one?

173
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,080
 Yeah, great. He's a great character. In Inwardian times, you could order a barrel of

174
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,920
 seawater to your home from the sea, so you could keep on enjoying the sea even after your holiday ended.

175
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,400
 That's nice. You keep getting the smell of the sea. It's basically that.

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,080
 Are you just trying to crowbar that? Facts it again.

177
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,800
 I think that fact has been offered to you guys in the past and you've turned it down.

178
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,440
 Really? I think so. The veggie fish finger one. I feel like it.

179
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,520
 I would have, if it sounds like a third of the thing, I would turn it down.

180
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,240
 I hadn't heard it. I hadn't heard it until you saw it.

181
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
 It's very raucous. I think if we were on Joe Rogan, that would be your fact.

182
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
 Okay, good. What was that? Oh, yeah, seawater. Seawater to your home.

183
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,840
 Is that for health purposes, or you just like the smell of the sea?

184
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
 It's for health purposes. Like taking the waters in a bar or something?

185
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,760
 Taking the waters. This is from a great train-based email

186
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,400
 sub-stack that I've subscribed to. I'm just keen to talk about.

187
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,320
 Yeah, sounds good. It's called Reading on Trains.

188
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,720
 That's about seawater. That's not a train.

189
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
 I'll mostly be talking about Edwardian rail infrastructure.

190
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
 Obviously. As you knew.

191
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,680
 Let's hear another one.

192
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,440
 After Uri Gela did a magic show at Eaton, the student who'd invited him had to apologize to

193
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,240
 the catering staff because all the cutlery was bent out of shape.

194
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,840
 I remember this one. It's very funny. Do we want to give Uri Gela the air time?

195
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,920
 All the cutlery. How many people were there?

196
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,600
 Hundreds of spoons have been bent because if you haven't heard of Uri Gela,

197
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,120
 who's not really in the news march these days, he's a very famous spoon bender from the 90s and

198
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,680
 90s. Please don't sue me, Uri Gela. Sorry, I'm just getting something. He is going to sue me.

199
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,240
 I might as well say it anyway. He used to just bend it against the table, didn't he?

200
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,120
 He would say, "What's that over there?"

201
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,760
 When you look back, the spoon has magically been bent.

202
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,320
 But how did he do that to every single spoon in Eaton?

203
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,440
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

204
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,520
 Yes. This is from an interview with a society magician called Drummond Money Coots.

205
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,480
 Oh, yeah.

206
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
 We've met him. I've met him.

207
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
 You'd bank with him that you don't use money.

208
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,560
 He's your wealth guilt magician.

209
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,920
 Just put all of your money in this pile.

210
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,960
 It's gone to the shrink.

211
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,560
 Yeah, yeah. Interesting.

212
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,280
 Yeah. Okay. Do we want to talk about Uri Gela?

213
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,480
 We could do it.

214
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,320
 Oh, I have so much on Uri Gela.

215
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,880
 Really?

216
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,640
 Yeah, I've read multiple biographies.

217
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,000
 Why do you talk surprise?

218
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,960
 Remind me of your three?

219
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
 Spoon bending.

220
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,000
 Spoon bending.

221
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,920
 Sorry, Uri Gela at Eaton.

222
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,240
 Edwardian Barrel Seawater and Colonel Sanders Big Midwife,

223
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,040
 which he genuinely was.

224
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,120
 He delivered babies in his local area.

225
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,680
 Good stuff.

226
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,800
 Okay. I know. Have you got some?

227
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,400
 Good stuff. Oh, yeah. I need to have some as well.

228
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,880
 Okay. So my fact options this week.

229
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,880
 I really like this one.

230
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,160
 In China, Japan and Korea,

231
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
 clothes traditionally had to be ripped apart

232
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,040
 every time they were washed and sewn back together again afterwards.

233
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
 Oh, that's interesting.

234
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,360
 I like that one.

235
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,640
 I've worn traditional Korean dress in the last two months.

236
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,720
 And do tear it to shreds?

237
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
 Do you not remember when I did the podcast?

238
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,560
 You guys, no one mentioned that.

239
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,840
 I was quite hurt actually.

240
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,640
 Is it called a Habok maybe?

241
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
 Yes, the Habok's were they used to wear all the time.

242
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,160
 Still do. Still do.

243
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,480
 They're still the height of fashion.

244
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,040
 Sorry, they're very fashionable items.

245
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,920
 I think they're often worn more occasionally these days,

246
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
 but back in the day, it would be an every day

247
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,600
 and you had to tear it up, wash it.

248
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,800
 Sometimes you'd have winter clothes

249
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,240
 and they'd have to take all the stuffing out

250
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
 and take it to pieces, wash it and then sew it all back up again.

251
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,240
 If you wear a Habok in Seoul,

252
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,800
 then you get into all the museums for free, which is why I don't know.

253
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,240
 Wow. Is that why you did it?

254
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,480
 Yeah.

255
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,200
 Well, I remember you posting a picture online.

256
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,520
 Yeah. And you open it by saying,

257
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,440
 "Before anyone thinks cultural appropriation is going on here,

258
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,040
 is there a cloakroom that you have put your entire outfit into

259
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,560
 that you wore to get there?"

260
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:20,960
 Actually...

261
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,120
 Someone else walks around James's house at the same time.

262
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,080
 A Korean, a random Korean person has to go to North London.

263
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,360
 That's cool, Anna.

264
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:31,680
 Okay, that's good.

265
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,080
 Yeah.

266
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
 Why do they want to rip them up?

267
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
 Yeah, just so that's how the clothes are made.

268
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,320
 Yeah, okay.

269
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,520
 I'm not regular making clothes back then.

270
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
 I like it. I like it.

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,280
 Okay, also have that.

272
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,680
 The 13th Labor of Hercules was to impregnate 49 out of 50 daughters

273
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,800
 of a king in one night.

274
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,320
 Okay.

275
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,040
 Who knew?

276
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,400
 Did he not fancy the 50th?

277
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,440
 What was the story there?

278
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,960
 That's partly why I want to do it.

279
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,920
 In some versions, they say he did all 50,

280
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,760
 but I prefer the version where the king said,

281
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,720
 "Leave this one alone."

282
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,800
 Does he do that before or after he's cleaned the stables of the million

283
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,560
 horses or whatever it was?

284
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,360
 It was before, so then he could clean up afterwards,

285
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,040
 because it was all in the stables before.

286
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,160
 Oh my God.

287
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,200
 I actually knew this fact because years ago Richard Herring did

288
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,000
 one of his Edinburgh shows as trying to replicate

289
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,920
 all of the labor.

290
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,200
 Yeah, all of Hercules.

291
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,760
 That's very funny.

292
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,120
 Yeah, and that was a real struggle that one.

293
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,440
 Well, 50 pregnant women came away from every single show.

294
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
 He had to work out how to interpret that one.

295
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,560
 You know, what does he do?

296
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,520
 No, no, the show was his adventures out in the wild,

297
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,160
 and then he reports it as his one-hour show.

298
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,240
 I think he went on 50 dates.

299
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,280
 I think that was the plan.

300
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,280
 Wow.

301
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,160
 Something like that.

302
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
 And they were all sisters?

303
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,640
 No.

304
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,840
 So, these all sisters.

305
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,200
 I think he had to bend the rules.

306
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,440
 Yeah.

307
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
 Who's the mum?

308
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,480
 It is mythology.

309
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
 She must have a heck of a vase.

310
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,280
 They might have been most full maths.

311
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:58,400
 It's one of those huge sarcophaguses.

312
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
 Oh dear.

313
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
 Sorry, it's not normally this bawdy.

314
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,000
 I think the observer effect is really kicking in.

315
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

316
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
 I also think for the people listening,

317
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 we've just done a full podcast before this,

318
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,000
 so I think we're a bit giddy.

319
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,960
 Yeah, yeah.

320
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,520
 Yeah, exactly.

321
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,640
 So what else you got?

322
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:14,640
 So, what else you got?

323
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
 So, I'm pregnant with 50 women in one night.

324
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,040
 And then I've got that.

325
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,120
 If you publish a book in Norway,

326
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,200
 the government will buy a thousand copies of it.

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,040
 That's good.

328
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,200
 That's good.

329
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,920
 That's quite cool.

330
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,200
 Is that for libraries?

331
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
 For libraries, exactly.

332
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,320
 Yeah, just encouraging creativity.

333
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:30,960
 That's great.

334
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
 So guys, if only you'd published your books in Norway,

335
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,600
 you would have sold a few more.

336
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,560
 That's good.

337
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,320
 We've done something like that before.

338
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,720
 Was it Iceland where everyone publishes a book?

339
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,560
 Yeah, maybe we've done similar stuff.

340
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,080
 Small countries with loads of writers.

341
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:42,960
 That's really cool though.

342
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
 If any of our books was printed there,

343
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
 would the Norwegian government be interested?

344
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
 Or is it only if you're Norwegian?

345
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,360
 If you're Norwegian, I think.

346
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,840
 Yeah, sorry.

347
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,400
 They don't want to encourage British talent or lack of, you know.

348
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,160
 And I was looking at me when she said lack of.

349
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,280
 I was looking into the distance.

350
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
 That's a great fact.

351
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,120
 I like that.

352
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,840
 Yeah, love that.

353
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,480
 There's that one.

354
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,920
 And then there's that ancient Rome had a secret name.

355
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,160
 And to this day, no one knows what it was.

356
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,640
 Oh, Dan's interesting.

357
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,800
 Why is that?

358
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,680
 Why, what's it called?

359
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,000
 It was some sort of defensive thing.

360
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,320
 It was like, we have to have the secret name.

361
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,640
 And as long as no one finds out what it is, Rome is safe.

362
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,280
 And that's it, I never heard of this.

363
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,600
 Isn't it weird that all roads lead to George?

364
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,080
 You'd be executed for saying that.

365
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,400
 Oh, no.

366
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,880
 That was it.

367
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,800
 As people were, I just never knew this.

368
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
 How many people knew it?

369
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,120
 Hardly any.

370
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,080
 The top, top dogs.

371
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,560
 So a mom, you listen, read this as a dad.

372
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,800
 Oh yeah, very nice.

373
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,320
 I like that.

374
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:40,960
 That's really good.

375
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,840
 I like mysteries.

376
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,040
 It just feels like, you know,

377
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,680
 you think you know everything about Rome after ten years of doing this job?

378
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,480
 Have we done Rome too much?

379
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:46,800
 Question.

380
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,200
 And not really, not really.

381
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,080
 I mean, we've done lots on Rome.

382
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,760
 But like, no, do actually doing Rome as a, no, I don't think.

383
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,600
 What if you said the name accidentally because you didn't know it?

384
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,000
 Oh yeah.

385
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,320
 Like, am I in trouble then?

386
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,920
 If it was out like a zam and you were just,

387
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
 like you just said it earlier.

388
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,160
 Exactly.

389
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,040
 I'm pissing about.

390
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,560
 I don't think you could be executed for that

391
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,000
 unless there's been a misunderstanding.

392
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
 Right.

393
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
 But I don't, I don't know.

394
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
 Because like if you swear in front of a small child,

395
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
 and you don't want them to learn that word and repeat it,

396
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,560
 you then have to just act like you haven't said anything unusual at all.

397
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,760
 You know what I mean?

398
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,040
 Like, I had someone, I accidentally said, I said,

399
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,240
 I said a very rude word.

400
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,120
 I said, really?

401
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,600
 Just say it.

402
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,400
 We're adults.

403
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,800
 Bummer.

404
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
 Bummer.

405
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,920
 I can't remember what I said.

406
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,080
 I swore in front of a child the other day.

407
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,000
 And I just had to carry on.

408
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,120
 Right.

409
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,600
 You know, because if you go, oh, whoops,

410
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,040
 then they'll say, what does it,

411
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,920
 what does fuck stick me?

412
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,360
 I'm going to say, did your wife whisper to you,

413
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
 I think you got away with calling him a motherfucker.

414
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,680
 That's cool.

415
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
 And we don't know what the word is.

416
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,920
 We don't know what the word is.

417
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,760
 Well, we might find out in our research.

418
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,000
 Yeah.

419
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,400
 Yeah.

420
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,720
 Okay.

421
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,400
 If we do, then we've blown like 3000 years of history wide open.

422
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,720
 All right.

423
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
 Should we choose what we're going to choose?

424
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
 Choose our choices.

425
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,840
 Yeah.

426
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:01,840
 Okay.

427
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,040
 Decide our decision.

428
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,440
 Right.

429
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,680
 Okay.

430
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,800
 So I reckon this week, Anna, you have to be the ones to choose.

431
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,840
 So we'll tell you our keywords

432
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,680
 and you decide which ones.

433
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:11,920
 Okay.

434
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,240
 Yeah.

435
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,080
 James remind me of three, three facts.

436
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,640
 So mine were pineapples, penises, jaguars.

437
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
 What was the penis you want to get?

438
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,720
 It's the fact that they're getting bigger.

439
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,120
 Oh yeah.

440
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,840
 Yeah.

441
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:23,920
 Yeah.

442
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,000
 Yeah.

443
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,560
 Yeah.

444
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:24,640
 Yeah.

445
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,680
 It was a long time ago.

446
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,160
 Yeah.

447
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,640
 Andy.

448
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,320
 Colonel Sanders made right.

449
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,200
 Yuri Geller at Eaton.

450
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,320
 And ordering barrels of water, sea water.

451
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,120
 Just on.

452
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,680
 Okay.

453
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,800
 Dan, what were yours?

454
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,320
 Barefighting, wealth psychologist, Friar Hardon.

455
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,120
 Nice.

456
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,960
 And mine were 13th labor of Hercules,

457
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,000
 ripping apart your clothes and secret name for Rome.

458
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,240
 And so I'm going to choose.

459
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,680
 So James's facts going to be...

460
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:07,120
 But we're not going to actually reveal what facts we're going to do.

461
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,360
 Otherwise, you've got no incentive to listen to the show.

462
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,000
 So tune in a few weeks time to find out what we selected.

463
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,600
 Thank you for listening to this behind the scenes thriller

464
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,080
