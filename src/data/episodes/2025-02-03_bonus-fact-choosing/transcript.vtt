 Hello and welcome to another bonus segment. A new format and this is an extra special look

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.600
 behind the scenes to a process that happens every single week where the four of us sit down

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 and we choose our favorite facts from each other's selection. It's normally a very

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.360
 dry and business-like conversation that takes three minutes and so, uh, take your watches.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.920
 We're gonna be padding it out. There'll be some fluff. There'll be some extra fluff.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.280
 And so how do we normally start? Normally we say who's got some facts. No, I think what happens is

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 we go round in order and we have three or four facts that we say and then the rest of us decide

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.120
 which are good and which are not good. Yeah. So is the act of us recording this going to change it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.360
 like beyond recognition? What do you mean? Well, you know how, isn't that a thing in physics?

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.200
 Well, you look at something and then it changes. Oh, the observer effect. Yeah. Yeah. So we might

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.840
 make bad decisions because we're recording it. Exactly. It's almost not we are observing,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.440
 but we are the ones being observed. It might be that we make better decisions because we feel

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.200
 under more pressure. Yeah. Or we might say two honest things about each other's facts that we

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.040
 might not have... Well, I'm a bit worried. ...for comedic reasons. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.960
 hurt each other's feelings. I think it's going to be like the Wizard of Oz where you lift up the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.880
 curtain at the end. He's just a sad old man. That's what you're all going to realise. He's just three

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.960
 sad old men. I was going to say. All right. So James. Sad old man number one. Okay. What's your

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.800
 favourite facts from this week? I'll give you my list. I'll just give you the first one on my

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:54.240
 list. So 804 pineapples were consumed at Robert Louis Stevenson's 44th birthday party. Wow.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 That's a very good fact. What do you think? Well, they were worth so much back then.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.080
 Not so much to the people on the island where he was, where they were growing all over the place.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.480
 If they took them back to the UK, they were really, really precious. Fools. Yeah.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.960
 Wasn't it like Samoa? American Samoa? It was in the South Pacific for sure.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.920
 Is this the place where he gave away his birthday to a girl? Remember he...

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.160
 Yes. Have we covered that before? Yeah, I think we have on the show.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.000
 I can't remember why she didn't have a birthday though. Her birthday was either on Christmas

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.440
 Day or New Year's Day, I think, so she didn't like it. I read there was a Roman emperor. I can't

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.280
 remember which one it was and he said that anyone who had a birthday on a Sunday could change it to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.680
 any other day they wanted. Why? That's quite good. Because you're not allowed to booze up on a Sunday?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.920
 I think it was something like that. I think it must have been a later one when Catholicism had taken

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 over. Yeah. But yeah, it's like on a Sunday you had to go to church or whatever, so he was like,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.160
 "Oh well, maybe you have your birthday on a Tuesday instead." Good guy. But if we covered that stuff

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.160
 before and maybe we could do birthday parties? We could do. I feel like we've done pineapples

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 a lot as well in the territory I was talking about, a sort of hell.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.960
 From Bowman's book. Yeah, you said about pineapple boy who would sleep with the pineapples at night

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.360
 and very painful, isn't it? That's a mafia threat actually. You're going to be sleeping with the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640
 pineapples. Oh, I thought you meant they leave a dead pineapple in your bed. Just the hair. It's

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:25.040
 just that top bit. Yeah. It's great though. It's great depending on how many people came. If

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.400
 5,000 people came to the past, it was the whole island basically. It's actually not that many

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.080
 pineapples per person. I wonder if many of them have fingerprints on that island. You know that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.960
 thing when you're dealing pineapples a lot, it burns off your fingerprints. Yes. You know what?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.960
 We said that and I'm pretty sure. Didn't Tom Scott do a video, our friend Tom, who's been on

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.880
 the show? I think he did a video trying to burn off his own fingerprints and it didn't quite work.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.000
 Ah, okay. I just feel like it should work because there are enzymes in there. All I'm going to say

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.360
 is that we've done very little on Robert Louis Devenson actually. Andi has got the spreadsheet

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.120
 in front of him. Gone into the archives. 30,000 facts. We've mentioned one headline fact about

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.320
 him, which is that he died halfway through making a batch of mayonnaise. Really? That was five years

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.440
 ago. And I think probably the soil has refurbished itself since then. So we could do that. Give

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.840
 us another one. Okay. So here's another one. In 2010, Jaguar made a card that sounded like an

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:29.680
 actual Jaguar. That's great. Does it actually... It goes... Can it climb trees? With its prey?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.560
 No, but it can run faster than a Jaguar can. I was confusing Jaguars and cheaters then because

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.640
 it's cheaters, isn't it? Who go, "Meow." Which would be actually way more impressive for a car.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.480
 No, Jaguar's doing that. "Rar." That's great. Is that designed for when you're at a red light

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.000
 to intimidate the person next year? No, it's just really to show off, I think. And it's because

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.160
 they're called Jaguar. Yeah, and supercars are quite interesting. They're quite sort of cool.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.960
 Is it too... Yeah, because there's a Fiat Panda, isn't there? It's just chomping bamboo.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:11.760
 Is it too controversial at the moment, just because people are so angry about Jaguar's new logo,

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.440
 and we don't want to be that divisive? I didn't see that. Oh, you're not online enough.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.080
 They had a... You know my family, what's happened? I don't know. Your family... Yeah, but they are

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:28.640
 known as Jaguar and Jaguar. My mum and my brothers have lost the plot. Okay, well, here's one. Here's

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.960
 one for the lads. Penises are getting bigger, and doctors are very worried about it.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.400
 Interesting. That's good. Why are they getting bigger? We don't know. That's the problem. That's

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.920
 the worry. They've got lots of details about how long penises have been historically,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.600
 because we have lots of medical records, and they've noticed that in the last

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.840
 20, 30 years, they're a little bit longer than they used to be. Is it like, oh no,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.960
 is it big underpand? Terrified that these things are just going to bust through.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.440
 They're not that much bigger. So we're talking fresh children. It's not like the three of us

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.800
 sitting here have just slightly... Like, compared to your grandfather, for instance.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.160
 You must have done that comparison when you were younger. You know, all generations of a family

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.200
 line up. You've got the wall chart, which is how tall you are vertically as you age.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:30.320
 The x-axis, yeah. I suppose, are we worried because we're worried that vaginas are not

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.360
 proportionally improved in size? Yeah, what's the word? No, you know, classic sexism, they haven't,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.320
 as far as I know, looked at the average death of vaginas, obviously. Well, they can check my

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.680
 family wall chart. It's a volume thing, though, isn't it? Yeah, it is. It's a vase on the man's

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:59.680
 piece. It's a vase, yes. Like a matrioshka doll. So, the reason that we're worried is because this

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.160
 is obviously an issue. If things are changing in genitals on humans, then there could be a problem

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.520
 in the future of, you know, where the future generations come from. We don't know why it's

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.120
 happening. And until we work out why it's happening, we don't know if it's a problem or if it isn't a

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.880
 problem. So, something, as of yet, a mysterious thing is making penises longer. It's a good fact.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.600
 It's a good fact. It's a great mystery. It's quite penise, isn't it, as a fact? It is, actually.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.160
 And we do sometimes try to avoid being too penise-y. Yeah, yeah. You wouldn't think so unless

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.560
 there were penises. You have no idea the number of penises I have to swatch. Okay, well, that's

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.240
 my three. Are we going to choose them now or should we choose them at the end? No, let's

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.480
 check because we'll find out the mix of which ones fit best. Yes. Thank you for your submissions,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:52.560
 James. Okay, so it's the jaguars, the penises, or the pineapples? Lovely. Lovely. Very good.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.440
 Dan Schreiber, have you got any true facts for us this week? I have three true facts. Yeah. So,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:05.840
 a Christian marriage is not consummated if contraception is used. That's according to a

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.160
 theologian called Fryer Hardon. Right. Again. Again, a bit of penisey. Again. Where? Good, though.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:22.960
 Where? Fryer Hardon. I see now. I get it. Yeah. Fryer Hardon is actually slightly taller than

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:28.400
 his predecessor at the monastery. Yeah. Actually, that's weird. I've got two facts where I've been

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.040
 drawn to the the name being sort of nominative determinism about. Is he a big deal? Well, he's

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:42.240
 okay. In what world? He died about a decade, maybe a bit more ago, but they're trying to

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.960
 canonize him. They want him to become a saint. Saint Hardon. Saint Hardon. He's got a lot of

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.640
 controversies about him. Not him personally, but he sort of helped people who were doing

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.760
 bad things. The usual. Yeah, that's so weird because another one of my facts here is when

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.320
 Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis was published, it was first condemned for encouraging masturbation,

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.160
 and I found that in a paper by a guy called James Seaman. Jesus Christ. Why are you Googling?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:13.920
 Can you stop using your only found search terms to do your fact-finding?

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.600
 But yeah, so that's one of them. They're both very funny.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.640
 They are funny, but do you have anything that's more of a fact? I've got two more. I've got,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.560
 I like this. Some banks provide their super rich customers with a wealth psychologist,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.920
 so they help them to deal with all the guilt that they have because they've got so much

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.040
 damn money. They're just like, "I'm breaking down," and they have someone to come in and say,

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.040
 "Hey, it's okay being that rich. You're fine. You're good." I wonder how much those psychologists

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.560
 charge. You'd feel so free about charging. You know how I can assuage your guilt a little bit?

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:53.680
 They're in-house, so it's while they're having the guilt that they sort of press the intercom

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.440
 and say, "Send wealth psychologists." The problem is once you've been working in that industry for

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.760
 long enough, then you have to get a psychologist yourself to sort you out with all the money you've

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.160
 made. Oh, cool. It's wealth psychologists all the way down. Okay, that's really good.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.440
 Well, it's just a cool job that I didn't know existed, or a weird job, rather, that I didn't

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.680
 know existed. I got one last one. Queen Elizabeth I never visited Shakespeare's Globe,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.880
 but she did visit a venue down the road at least six times to watch bears fighting with dogs and

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.800
 monkeys. To be fair, more entertaining than a comedy of errors. Yeah. This was a big thing

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.080
 back in the day. I got this from my friend, Dr Matthew Green. He wrote a book which my wife

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.600
 actually published called London A Traveler's Guide Through Time, and it was in there that

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.320
 I read that. Oh, that's a really good book. It's a great book, yeah. It's as if he's a time traveling

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.360
 tourist guide walking you through different times in London. Yeah, I got that in there.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.080
 That's very interesting because I didn't know that we knew whether or not Elizabeth had gone to

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.560
 Shakespeare's Globe. That's very cool. She liked to bear bait. According to quite a few places,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.720
 I've read she never went to the Globe. If we did that, that's a really fun subject of cruel,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.360
 old animal sports. Well, it's just interesting what was going on parallel to what Shakespeare

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.880
 was putting on in the Globe, and was actually weirdly more popular amongst the higher echelons,

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.080
 like the Queen herself. Have we done things like bear baiting much before, or, you know,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.600
 fox tossing? I don't think we have done fox tossing because I think we had Ed

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:28.400
 brought kitchen oil, but that's right. I don't think we've done bear baiting. I'm not sure whether

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.120
 we want to necessarily go into bear baiting. Is it not funny, even if it was 500 years ago?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:42.240
 Anyone who knew those bears is dead now. Yeah. It puts exit pursued by a bear into a new light,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.600
 doesn't it? Yeah. He just nicked that stage direction for the show down the road.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.920
 But I think, yeah, what's happening around Shakespeare's time, the rude names.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.120
 Well, I guess we wouldn't talk about the rude names. We would talk about

00:11:55.120 --> 00:12:01.920
 the legal definition of a marriage. Yeah, well, it's interesting because this is a genuine debate

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.160
 within, so I picked Frye hard on for obvious reasons, but that is a debate. When is a marriage

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:17.200
 consummated? According to one side, it's when semen has been released into another body,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.920
 it's body flesh on flesh, flesh in flesh, whatever. And then the other side says that...

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.360
 Do you mean sorry, Barbara Seaman, one of the key women involved in making birth control available?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.920
 Are you kidding? No, I'm not even kidding. It's called Barbara Seaman.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.080
 Well, yeah. Should have saved that, shouldn't you? Yeah.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.880
 Can't in fact do more. Andy's used up as only interesting facts.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.240
 Yeah, but I mean, yeah, it's interesting debate on both sides. And then, yeah, like weird jobs

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.400
 in banks, I think is an interesting one as well. Yeah. Are we picking now or are we...

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.440
 No, no, no, we'll do it. All right. So, hold on, remind us the themes of...

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.800
 You've got four. You've got Seaman. Frye hard on. Yeah, Frye hard on.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:59.280
 I've got bear fighting dog and monkey, and I have banks with wealth psychologists.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.520
 All right. Okay, nice. Andrew Montemari.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:09.200
 Colonel Sanders was a part-time midwife. Did he get nearly family pockets?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.160
 Well, there was some finger licking going on.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.120
 Well, that's it, isn't it? Okay, well, we've done all the jokes.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.880
 James, you could then say your fact, which I think is the best fact you've ever told me.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.920
 What was it? About fish smell.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:28.400
 Oh, that's really rude. Oh, no.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.760
 What? You wouldn't say it was rude if it was about penises?

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:35.120
 Yeah. Okay, well, let me just say that there is a chemical in your body

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:44.800
 that if you're a woman will make your genital smell fishy. And that same chemical is put into

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:51.680
 vegan fish fingers to give the smell of fish to what otherwise would just smell of bean curd

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.000
 or whatever it is. I can imagine if we put that out, some fish finger maker will actually sue us

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.640
 for their sales plummeting. Because I'm never buying them again.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.840
 I'm not sure it's all of them, just to save me, save my back. But I think that is true, actually.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.160
 But it's not, this is a synthetic chemical that's being used. It is not being harvested.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.520
 They've asked me to volunteer. It's not like captain's bed size.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:26.000
 Quick dip. Below decks on his ship. Since he went veggie, it's all changed. Oh, gosh. Okay.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.680
 Anyway, so I can't remember the original fact now.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.880
 Colonel Sanders. We must have covered him quite a lot. We actually haven't.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.440
 Thank you very much. We've done the biggie where he, we've talked about how he's sold it off and

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:46.000
 he became, he opened up a separate one. We have mentioned something about his tombstone.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.680
 We've mentioned that his autobiography was called Life as I Know It Has Been Finger-Licking Good.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.880
 We've done that KFC is actually not from K, it's from Utah.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:01.280
 And we've done that he drove around, he traveled a quarter of a million miles visiting KFC Brodges.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.000
 I'm really surprised we haven't done the fact that he sold it, because that's.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.200
 Yeah, I thought we had, we must have cut it. How about they released a novel?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.720
 As well. Remember the romance novel that was released about him? Oh, yeah.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.480
 We did that, I'm sure. Wings of Desire. Yes, we have for that. So anyway, is that one?

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.080
 Yeah, great. He's a great character. In Inwardian times, you could order a barrel of

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.920
 seawater to your home from the sea, so you could keep on enjoying the sea even after your holiday ended.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.400
 That's nice. You keep getting the smell of the sea. It's basically that.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.080
 Are you just trying to crowbar that? Facts it again.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:44.800
 I think that fact has been offered to you guys in the past and you've turned it down.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.440
 Really? I think so. The veggie fish finger one. I feel like it.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.520
 I would have, if it sounds like a third of the thing, I would turn it down.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.240
 I hadn't heard it. I hadn't heard it until you saw it.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.560
 It's very raucous. I think if we were on Joe Rogan, that would be your fact.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:01.040
 Okay, good. What was that? Oh, yeah, seawater. Seawater to your home.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.840
 Is that for health purposes, or you just like the smell of the sea?

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.000
 It's for health purposes. Like taking the waters in a bar or something?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.760
 Taking the waters. This is from a great train-based email

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.400
 sub-stack that I've subscribed to. I'm just keen to talk about.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.320
 Yeah, sounds good. It's called Reading on Trains.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.720
 That's about seawater. That's not a train.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.040
 I'll mostly be talking about Edwardian rail infrastructure.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.800
 Obviously. As you knew.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.680
 Let's hear another one.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.440
 After Uri Gela did a magic show at Eaton, the student who'd invited him had to apologize to

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.240
 the catering staff because all the cutlery was bent out of shape.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.840
 I remember this one. It's very funny. Do we want to give Uri Gela the air time?

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.920
 All the cutlery. How many people were there?

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.600
 Hundreds of spoons have been bent because if you haven't heard of Uri Gela,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.120
 who's not really in the news march these days, he's a very famous spoon bender from the 90s and

00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.680
 90s. Please don't sue me, Uri Gela. Sorry, I'm just getting something. He is going to sue me.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.240
 I might as well say it anyway. He used to just bend it against the table, didn't he?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.120
 He would say, "What's that over there?"

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.760
 When you look back, the spoon has magically been bent.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:14.320
 But how did he do that to every single spoon in Eaton?

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.440
 Yeah, it doesn't make sense.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.520
 Yes. This is from an interview with a society magician called Drummond Money Coots.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.480
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.680
 We've met him. I've met him.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.280
 You'd bank with him that you don't use money.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.560
 He's your wealth guilt magician.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.920
 Just put all of your money in this pile.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.960
 It's gone to the shrink.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.560
 Yeah, yeah. Interesting.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.280
 Yeah. Okay. Do we want to talk about Uri Gela?

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.480
 We could do it.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.320
 Oh, I have so much on Uri Gela.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:44.880
 Really?

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.640
 Yeah, I've read multiple biographies.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.000
 Why do you talk surprise?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.960
 Remind me of your three?

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.280
 Spoon bending.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.000
 Spoon bending.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.920
 Sorry, Uri Gela at Eaton.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:02.240
 Edwardian Barrel Seawater and Colonel Sanders Big Midwife,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.040
 which he genuinely was.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.120
 He delivered babies in his local area.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:05.680
 Good stuff.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.800
 Okay. I know. Have you got some?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.400
 Good stuff. Oh, yeah. I need to have some as well.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.880
 Okay. So my fact options this week.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.880
 I really like this one.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.160
 In China, Japan and Korea,

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.240
 clothes traditionally had to be ripped apart

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.040
 every time they were washed and sewn back together again afterwards.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.640
 Oh, that's interesting.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.360
 I like that one.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.640
 I've worn traditional Korean dress in the last two months.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.720
 And do tear it to shreds?

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.240
 Do you not remember when I did the podcast?

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.560
 You guys, no one mentioned that.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.840
 I was quite hurt actually.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.640
 Is it called a Habok maybe?

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.360
 Yes, the Habok's were they used to wear all the time.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.160
 Still do. Still do.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.480
 They're still the height of fashion.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.040
 Sorry, they're very fashionable items.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.920
 I think they're often worn more occasionally these days,

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.680
 but back in the day, it would be an every day

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.600
 and you had to tear it up, wash it.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.800
 Sometimes you'd have winter clothes

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.240
 and they'd have to take all the stuffing out

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.240
 and take it to pieces, wash it and then sew it all back up again.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.240
 If you wear a Habok in Seoul,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.800
 then you get into all the museums for free, which is why I don't know.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.240
 Wow. Is that why you did it?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.480
 Yeah.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.200
 Well, I remember you posting a picture online.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.520
 Yeah. And you open it by saying,

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.440
 "Before anyone thinks cultural appropriation is going on here,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.040
 is there a cloakroom that you have put your entire outfit into

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.560
 that you wore to get there?"

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:20.960
 Actually...

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.120
 Someone else walks around James's house at the same time.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.080
 A Korean, a random Korean person has to go to North London.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.360
 That's cool, Anna.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:31.680
 Okay, that's good.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.080
 Yeah.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.320
 Why do they want to rip them up?

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.000
 Yeah, just so that's how the clothes are made.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.320
 Yeah, okay.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.520
 I'm not regular making clothes back then.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.480
 I like it. I like it.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.280
 Okay, also have that.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.680
 The 13th Labor of Hercules was to impregnate 49 out of 50 daughters

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.800
 of a king in one night.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.320
 Okay.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.040
 Who knew?

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.400
 Did he not fancy the 50th?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.440
 What was the story there?

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.960
 That's partly why I want to do it.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.920
 In some versions, they say he did all 50,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.760
 but I prefer the version where the king said,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.720
 "Leave this one alone."

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.800
 Does he do that before or after he's cleaned the stables of the million

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.560
 horses or whatever it was?

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.360
 It was before, so then he could clean up afterwards,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.040
 because it was all in the stables before.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.160
 Oh my God.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.200
 I actually knew this fact because years ago Richard Herring did

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.000
 one of his Edinburgh shows as trying to replicate

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.920
 all of the labor.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.200
 Yeah, all of Hercules.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:21.760
 That's very funny.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.120
 Yeah, and that was a real struggle that one.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.440
 Well, 50 pregnant women came away from every single show.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.280
 He had to work out how to interpret that one.

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:28.560
 You know, what does he do?

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.520
 No, no, the show was his adventures out in the wild,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.160
 and then he reports it as his one-hour show.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.240
 I think he went on 50 dates.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.280
 I think that was the plan.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.280
 Wow.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.160
 Something like that.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.360
 And they were all sisters?

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.640
 No.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.840
 So, these all sisters.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.200
 I think he had to bend the rules.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.440
 Yeah.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.440
 Who's the mum?

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.480
 It is mythology.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.760
 She must have a heck of a vase.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.280
 They might have been most full maths.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:58.400
 It's one of those huge sarcophaguses.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.080
 Oh dear.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.080
 Sorry, it's not normally this bawdy.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.000
 I think the observer effect is really kicking in.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.200
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.720
 I also think for the people listening,

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.720
 we've just done a full podcast before this,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.000
 so I think we're a bit giddy.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.960
 Yeah, yeah.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:13.520
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.640
 So what else you got?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:14.640
 So, what else you got?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.880
 So, I'm pregnant with 50 women in one night.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.040
 And then I've got that.

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.120
 If you publish a book in Norway,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.200
 the government will buy a thousand copies of it.

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.040
 That's good.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:25.200
 That's good.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:25.920
 That's quite cool.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.200
 Is that for libraries?

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.480
 For libraries, exactly.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.320
 Yeah, just encouraging creativity.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.960
 That's great.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.280
 So guys, if only you'd published your books in Norway,

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:33.600
 you would have sold a few more.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.560
 That's good.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.320
 We've done something like that before.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.720
 Was it Iceland where everyone publishes a book?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.560
 Yeah, maybe we've done similar stuff.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.080
 Small countries with loads of writers.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:42.960
 That's really cool though.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.880
 If any of our books was printed there,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.240
 would the Norwegian government be interested?

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.000
 Or is it only if you're Norwegian?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.360
 If you're Norwegian, I think.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:49.840
 Yeah, sorry.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.400
 They don't want to encourage British talent or lack of, you know.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.160
 And I was looking at me when she said lack of.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.280
 I was looking into the distance.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.640
 That's a great fact.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.120
 I like that.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:21:59.840
 Yeah, love that.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.480
 There's that one.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.920
 And then there's that ancient Rome had a secret name.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.160
 And to this day, no one knows what it was.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.640
 Oh, Dan's interesting.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.800
 Why is that?

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.680
 Why, what's it called?

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.000
 It was some sort of defensive thing.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.320
 It was like, we have to have the secret name.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.640
 And as long as no one finds out what it is, Rome is safe.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.280
 And that's it, I never heard of this.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.600
 Isn't it weird that all roads lead to George?

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.080
 You'd be executed for saying that.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:28.400
 Oh, no.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:28.880
 That was it.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.800
 As people were, I just never knew this.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.840
 How many people knew it?

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.120
 Hardly any.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.080
 The top, top dogs.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.560
 So a mom, you listen, read this as a dad.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.800
 Oh yeah, very nice.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.320
 I like that.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.960
 That's really good.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.840
 I like mysteries.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.040
 It just feels like, you know,

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.680
 you think you know everything about Rome after ten years of doing this job?

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.480
 Have we done Rome too much?

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:46.800
 Question.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.200
 And not really, not really.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.080
 I mean, we've done lots on Rome.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.760
 But like, no, do actually doing Rome as a, no, I don't think.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.600
 What if you said the name accidentally because you didn't know it?

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.000
 Oh yeah.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.320
 Like, am I in trouble then?

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.920
 If it was out like a zam and you were just,

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.600
 like you just said it earlier.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.160
 Exactly.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.040
 I'm pissing about.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.560
 I don't think you could be executed for that

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.000
 unless there's been a misunderstanding.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.600
 Right.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.640
 But I don't, I don't know.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.640
 Because like if you swear in front of a small child,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.200
 and you don't want them to learn that word and repeat it,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.560
 you then have to just act like you haven't said anything unusual at all.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.760
 You know what I mean?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.040
 Like, I had someone, I accidentally said, I said,

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.240
 I said a very rude word.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.120
 I said, really?

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.600
 Just say it.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.400
 We're adults.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:26.800
 Bummer.

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.000
 Bummer.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.920
 I can't remember what I said.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.080
 I swore in front of a child the other day.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.000
 And I just had to carry on.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.120
 Right.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.600
 You know, because if you go, oh, whoops,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.040
 then they'll say, what does it,

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.920
 what does fuck stick me?

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.360
 I'm going to say, did your wife whisper to you,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.760
 I think you got away with calling him a motherfucker.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.680
 That's cool.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.880
 And we don't know what the word is.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.920
 We don't know what the word is.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.760
 Well, we might find out in our research.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.000
 Yeah.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.400
 Yeah.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:54.720
 Okay.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.400
 If we do, then we've blown like 3000 years of history wide open.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:58.720
 All right.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.640
 Should we choose what we're going to choose?

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.440
 Choose our choices.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.840
 Yeah.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:01.840
 Okay.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.040
 Decide our decision.

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:03.440
 Right.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.680
 Okay.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.800
 So I reckon this week, Anna, you have to be the ones to choose.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.840
 So we'll tell you our keywords

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.680
 and you decide which ones.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:11.920
 Okay.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.240
 Yeah.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.080
 James remind me of three, three facts.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.640
 So mine were pineapples, penises, jaguars.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.760
 What was the penis you want to get?

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.720
 It's the fact that they're getting bigger.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.120
 Oh yeah.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.840
 Yeah.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:23.920
 Yeah.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.000
 Yeah.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:24.560
 Yeah.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:24.640
 Yeah.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.680
 It was a long time ago.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.160
 Yeah.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:26.640
 Andy.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.320
 Colonel Sanders made right.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:33.200
 Yuri Geller at Eaton.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.320
 And ordering barrels of water, sea water.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.120
 Just on.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:37.680
 Okay.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.800
 Dan, what were yours?

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.320
 Barefighting, wealth psychologist, Friar Hardon.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.120
 Nice.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.960
 And mine were 13th labor of Hercules,

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:52.000
 ripping apart your clothes and secret name for Rome.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.240
 And so I'm going to choose.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.680
 So James's facts going to be...

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:07.120
 But we're not going to actually reveal what facts we're going to do.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.360
 Otherwise, you've got no incentive to listen to the show.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.000
 So tune in a few weeks time to find out what we selected.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.600
 Thank you for listening to this behind the scenes thriller

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.080
 that you've just been exposed to yet to be named.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.720
 We'll see you again in a few weeks.
