 [upbeat music]

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,000
 - Hi, Andy. - Hello, Andy.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 How you guys doing?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 - Very good. - Not bad.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 - Welcome to "Drop us a Line." - Oh, no, I feel better.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 - Yes. - Yes.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Welcome to "Drop us a Line."

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Whether you're listening to this,

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 whether you're watching it... - Whether you're performing it.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 - Whether you're performing it. Hello, friends. - Hello.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 - Friends! - Colleagues! Colleagues!

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 - No, it's on tape. It's on video.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 This is the worst case for you.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [laughter]

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 - Thank you for coming today.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 [laughter]

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 - I'm trying to put things back on a professional footing,

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 but caps out of the bag now.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Thanks, guys.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We've had a lot of great correspondence.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 - Yeah. - The inbox has been bulging.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 - Beautiful.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 - And let's open it up

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 and have a fiddle around inside

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 and see what we pull out.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 - Okay, okay.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 - One of the weirder interests I've ever done.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 - You can see the point where you should have stopped.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 - Always. - And then...

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 - You just keep going.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 - Well, it's because I assumed

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 that one of my fellow trapezoartists will catch me.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 - Nope. [laughter]

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 - We're busy loosening the net underneath.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 - I'm just swinging back and forth

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 and talking rubbish for ages.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 - Okay. Well, let's start with some corrections.

41
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 'Cause we've got a few to get through.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 - Actually, let's not.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Let's have some whimsy.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 - It's the new year.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 - Absolutely.

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 - When it goes out.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 - Let's start. Like it's a fresh, exciting start.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 - Yeah.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 - Let's have some whimsy.

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Okay. Well, Matt Bush sends a brilliant fact about Scurvy,

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 which I'm afraid of.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 - Oh, thank God.

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 We're on those whimsical subjects straight away.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 How many millions of people died of Scurvy?

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 And we've mentioned this before, so I'm sorry.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 It's not any use to us.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 But Matt also sends this, which is why I read out his email.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And a side says Matt,

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 "I officially began listening in the mid-200 episodes."

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 - Okay.

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 - "And for the longest time, I thought Andy was Japanese."

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 [laughter]

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 - Okay. That is interesting.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 And does he give any reason to his supposition?

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 - Yes. Can you guess why?

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 - One of the time I think I was Japanese.

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 - Well, you had been to Japan around that time.

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 - Been to Japan.

69
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 - And because I remember there was a time when you sat down

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 near one of the stations and counted how many people

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 were wearing face masks.

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 - Yes, that's right.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 - You talked about working on a writing project out there,

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 which would sort of suggest that maybe you could write

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Japanese as well.

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 - I can't, but that didn't matter,

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 because the sitcom was in Norwegian.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 - Yes.

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 - Which I also cannot speak.

80
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 - Right, okay.

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 - I wrote it in English,

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 then the Norwegian cast translated it every night

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 and then we filmed it in Central Tokyo.

84
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 - So it's not those?

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 - It could have been your burgeoning J-pop career.

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 - Oh, these are all, but none of these are right.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 - None of these are.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 - It's Dan's fault.

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 - Oh.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 - Matt says, "You see, Dan's accent made the pronunciation

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 "andrew" hand to "murei."

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 - Which, and those are the characters there.

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 - Okay, what does that mean in Japanese?

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 - I don't know what it means,

95
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 but they're all, I guess, Japanese sort of syllables.

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 - Oh, okay.

97
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 - And I was even more confused when I finally

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 sort of pictured the group,

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 and he was nowhere to be found.

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 (laughing)

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 - How was he saying, "I pronounced your name?"

102
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 - "Hand to "murei."

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 - Which I don't think.

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 - "Hand to "murei."

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 I think we'd have picked you up on that.

106
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 - I think more than Chazinsky,

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 that would have got people writing it.

108
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 - Anyway.

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 - So if you have a fun theory

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 that's been disproved about us,

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 please do get in touch.

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 podcast@ky.com.

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 - Yeah.

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 - Yeah. - We're off the blocks.

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 - Wow.

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 - Catherine Birch says,

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 "In episode five of Little Fish,

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 "you were wondering how many people on Earth

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 "haven't had the chance to write an escalator.

120
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 "There are only two escalators in Wyoming,

121
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 "or four, depending on how you count escalators."

122
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 - Interesting.

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 - Yeah, as in there's two that go up and down.

124
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 - Two up, two down.

125
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah.

126
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 - And they're both in banks in the city of Casper.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 - Yeah, that is true,

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 and I have long tried to prove that false,

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I think there's probably an escalator somewhere

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 that someone hasn't thought of.

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And I've looked like at all the airpods.

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 There's not many airpods.

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 There's a few airpods there.

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 None of them.

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 They're all one layer.

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 All the different moles that I could think of in Wyoming

137
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 to see if there was another one.

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And I've never been able to find another one.

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 - Interesting.

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Well, Catherine says there hasn't been a new one built since 1979.

141
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 - Yeah, and I think all sorts of the ones in the banks

142
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 are not for the public.

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 I think there might be for people working there.

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I think.

145
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I might wrong about that.

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 - So she says there's probably a significant section of the Wyoming population

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 who have never seen an escalator assuming, of course,

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 that they don't enjoy banks or traveling out of the state.

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 - Also, the population of Wyoming is extremely low.

150
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 - Is it? Yeah.

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 - Right.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 - They will have watched movies.

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 - Yeah, but that's not true.

154
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 - I don't think they've seen one in the flesh.

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 - I know, but they probably don't think of it

156
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 as some sort of futuristic invention that we don't have.

157
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 They know how it functions.

158
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 - Yeah, but if you haven't seen one out close,

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 you've no idea of the majesty.

160
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 - I was in Harris the other day and I went on that first ever.

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Well, I think because it's really a small one that you think

162
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 why an earth is an escalator here.

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 - Yeah.

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 - So it goes from a mezzanine to an actual floor.

165
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 - Yeah, so exactly.

166
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 - So I think it must have been the first one that was put in there

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 where they give everyone some brandy when they came off.

168
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 - Amazing.

169
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 - I've always thought of that as a two-floor stretch.

170
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 - That might be wrong because I didn't Google it or anything,

171
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 but it just happened to be there because I was in town.

172
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 - Yeah, I do.

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 - Are you going to get your milk in Harris, don't you?

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 - I get the cat's water in Harris.

176
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 - Have you seen inside of an escalator when they have to open

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 and up if you're ever on the tubes?

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 It's quite exciting, right?

179
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 - Yeah.

180
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 - And if you've been on the London.

181
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 - I've seen that.

182
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 - Oh, okay.

183
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 So I've seen it a few times on the London Underground

184
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 because they're always fixing some of them.

185
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 - Yes, because he says.

186
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 - Yeah, it should be just down there.

187
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's a book of crouching marks on the same.

188
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 - It is signed, so.

189
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 - Second edition.

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 - It's definitely second or third edition, so I don't want to.

191
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 - I shouldn't have put it in there, but I wanted to see what would happen.

192
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 But I've seen it a few times.

193
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 One thing I hadn't seen until about a week ago was the inside

194
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 of where the bowling balls come out when you're waiting.

195
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 - Oh, that whole contraption where it comes out?

196
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 - Did you fail to let go of the ball?

197
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And so you just got through, flew along.

198
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 - And you ended up in the thing?

199
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 - You did a whole circuit and came back out.

200
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

201
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 - No, I was at a children's party.

202
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 - They come off, don't they?

203
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's like got a little cover that lifts up.

204
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 - Exactly.

205
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 - Can I go enough memory?

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Because all the bowling alleys that I go to,

207
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 they still have pinboys there, so.

208
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 - In Wyoming, they only have pinboys.

209
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 I don't know enough of that Wyoming.

210
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 I've realised.

211
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 - No, me neither.

212
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 - Fascinating.

213
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 - I've been.

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 - It's where the old faithful geezer is and stuff.

215
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Yellow stones in Wyoming.

216
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 - I think.

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Hope I'm not wrong now.

218
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 But it's like extremely empty.

219
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 The whole place is just like, there's hardly anyone there.

220
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 - Wow.

221
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 - It's such an iconic American.

222
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 - Smells of thoughts.

223
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 - Does it?

224
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 - But who's, if there's nobody there, who's doing the thoughts?

225
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 - All right, Confucius.

226
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 - Right, we better.

227
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 - Let's get on, let's get on.

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 - Let's get on, let's get on.

229
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 - Oh boy.

231
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 We've had some corrections about the age of James Bond.

232
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 - Oh, trust me.

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 - All right, my light Arctic quiz.

234
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 - Yes.

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 - Who was the oldest Bond?

236
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 - And who was it in the end, Roger Moore?

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 - For Paul?

238
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 - Yeah.

239
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 - I followed by Daniel Craig.

240
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 - Exactly.

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 - Yes.

242
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 - Ding ding ding, everyone gets it right.

243
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And then I recorded it.

244
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I recorded before that little fish, a separate thing saying,

245
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 look, I know Sean Connery was in a later one when he was old.

246
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But that wasn't an official one.

247
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 - Yeah.

248
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 - Well.

249
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 - Thank you to all the Bond nerds who dropped us a line.

250
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 - Yep.

251
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 - I got a couple of things wrong.

252
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 There is a 1967 version of Cassina Royale,

253
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 which is a spoof where David never--

254
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 - David, never.

255
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 - Place James Bond at the age of 57.

256
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 - Absolutely.

257
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 - Andy McElfresh wrote that in.

258
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Thank you, Andy.

259
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Charlie Tuff makes that point.

260
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 But also says that the second oldest official James Bond actor

261
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 at time of retirement from the role is in fact Toby Stevens, of course.

262
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 - Okay.

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 - James Bond's was 55 when he stepped down from doing the audiobooks.

264
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 - Oh, come on.

265
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 - No, you know, it's official.

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And he's also the only person I think who's played both James Bond

267
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 and a James Bond villain, again, in one of the audiobooks.

268
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 - Okay.

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 - So there you go.

270
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Bit of Bond trivia.

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 - Yeah.

272
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 - That play.

273
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 - That play.

274
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 - I think we put the constraints on it being the movie franchise

275
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 when we did it.

276
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And Cassina Royale was not a part of the official broccoli movie franchise

277
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 until Daniel Craig came along.

278
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Never say never again was not part of that.

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 - Yep.

280
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 - That's all we were doing.

281
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 We were just trying to live our lives.

282
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 - We were just, you know, two escalators or four escalators.

283
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Who knows, you know?

284
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 It's that same problem.

285
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 - I don't understand any of this.

286
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 I only said that you'll Craig because he's the only one I heard of.

287
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 - Oh, we did have someone write to him about George Lazenby.

288
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 - Oh, yeah.

289
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 - Amy Cox.

290
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 - Oh, so in this episode, Andy alluded to an anecdote about George Lazenby,

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 which we never broadcast.

292
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 In fact, you never even said because we were worried that he's still alive.

293
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 - He's a light sewers.

294
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 - Yeah.

295
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But my old painter and decorator thinks he was not a great guy.

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 - Really?

297
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Oh, my gosh.

298
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 - Well, you'll liberator.

299
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 - Look, that really is a club fish park, everyone.

300
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 That is what you get behind that paywall.

301
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 - Absolutely stone-cold celebrity gas.

302
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 - I'm really sorry.

303
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 - That's the worst edit.

304
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 I was saving that one for Graham Norse and I'm so annoyed.

305
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 - Amy Cox writes,

306
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "Talking of Bond, James Bond's, and particularly when Lazenby was mentioned,

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 we will remind it of our own spicy meat Lazenby story."

308
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 - Oh.

309
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 - We attended an event here in Perth, Western Australia.

310
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Brilliant, hello Perth.

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 "Of the night of Bond music performed live, interspersed with a Q&A with Lazenby."

312
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 The link below, I think, says it all.

313
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And I'll just say, we really enjoyed the portion of the event

314
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 with the singers and the musicians performing Bond's songs live.

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 They at least were fantastic.

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 - Oh, no.

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 - Anyway, she's appended a link.

318
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 I'll just read you the key words from the link,

319
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 because I clicked it, I have read it.

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 But former James Bond star, George Lazenby,

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 asked from National Music Tour after homophobic comments.

322
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 - Oh, no.

323
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 - It's not clear.

324
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 It's not clear what exactly Bond said, but I believe an apology was later offered.

325
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 - Right.

326
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 - Yeah.

327
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 - Okay.

328
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 - There you go.

329
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 - Matthias Panzenbach.

330
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 - I do start to wonder, and it's obviously this will be Matthias' name

331
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 and do apologize for that.

332
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 But there will be a stage where people will deliberately put wacky names

333
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 in so that they get read out.

334
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 - Have you been checking in with David Bergaman recently,

335
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 who has also written this week?

336
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 - Yeah.

337
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 - Is that a bad Zoe hamburger?

338
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 - It's not.

339
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 - Oh.

340
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 - Matthias Panzenbach, I think that's a fair point, James.

341
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 - Yeah.

342
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 - I'm doing that's a fair point.

343
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 - I think Panzenbach is a proper name, but--

344
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 - Absolutely.

345
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 - Just not from round the ear.

346
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 - But Matthias writes.

347
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 - All right, George Lazenby.

348
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 - Oh my gosh.

349
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 - Matthias writes, "Because you had a fact about the Mall of America

350
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 being heated with body heat."

351
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 - Oh, yeah.

352
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 - It was something about newly built houses in medieval times

353
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 being dried out by letting poor people live in them.

354
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Of course, once dried, they had to leave.

355
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 I can't find info about it now.

356
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 My Google food is not good about that.

357
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 I'm also not sure if I saw it in English or German.

358
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 - That's a great fact.

359
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 - That's a great truth.

360
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 - Yeah, I know.

361
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I mean, it's 'cause I guess you'd have sort of wet plaster

362
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 on the walls and--

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 - Yeah.

364
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 - And you want to like put the heating on,

365
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 like the cooker I mean.

366
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 - Yeah.

367
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 - And it would make sense that you wouldn't want your

368
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 pusho to do that themselves.

369
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 - Yeah.

370
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 - Is it true that the queen used to have people who would try

371
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 out her shoes before she wore them, like break them in?

372
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 - I can't believe it.

373
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 - I do know something about the queen,

374
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 which is something you guys, as fans of now,

375
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 you see me will enjoy.

376
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 - Queen Elizabeth II.

377
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 - Yeah.

378
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 - Yeah.

379
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 - If you did a contract for her as a magician,

380
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 she would get a lady in waiting to actually take the card.

381
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 - Really?

382
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

383
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 - Why would the queen, why can't she hold the card?

384
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 - Busy.

385
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 (laughing)

386
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 - Rating of us.

387
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 - Yeah, I'm fair enough.

388
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 - Doing important constitutional work.

389
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 - Yeah, yeah.

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 - Probably.

391
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 - Also, those Lizzy hands cut.

392
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 (laughing)

393
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 - Really good grip of the cut.

394
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 (laughing)

395
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 - She just sticks her tongue out.

396
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 (laughing)

397
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 - Sorry.

398
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 - Outrageous.

399
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 - Outrageous.

400
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 - I know.

401
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 - Who's not too soon?

402
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 - No, it's fine.

403
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 - I think we're able to say that, Lizzy.

404
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 - I don't think so.

405
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 No, I was gonna mention that.

406
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Remember, there was a story, and I don't know if it was ever debunked,

407
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 but in history, in ancient Egypt,

408
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 it used to be the idea that the Pharaoh would have someone beside them

409
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 if they were in an area that had lots of flies who was just soaked in honey

410
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 so that the flies would come towards them and never touch the leader.

411
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 - I think that was, it was someone like Pliny writing about it.

412
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I think who said that that happened.

413
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 But yeah, it's definitely attested that it happened,

414
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 whether it did or not.

415
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 - That was amazing.

416
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 - Yeah.

417
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 - All right.

418
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 - Time for a bit of extreme fish.

419
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 - Ah, is this where someone listens from an odd place?

420
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 - Yeah.

421
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 - Okay, cool.

422
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 This is really, this is actually someone doing something that could be life-threatening.

423
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 - To themselves or to someone else?

424
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 - To themselves.

425
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 - It's a killer.

426
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I love killing while listening to fish.

427
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It really gets me through those difficult kills.

428
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 - Oh my god.

429
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 - This is so cool.

430
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 - It's Caleb Cole writing it.

431
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 I've been listening to the podcast for many years.

432
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 You've mentioned several times that people often listen to it to fall asleep.

433
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 I do that.

434
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 As well, however, as I live in Montana, I'll also regularly listen to it

435
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 while I'm on solo hikes to ward off bears.

436
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 - Oh my gosh.

437
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 - As they don't like the sound of your podcast.

438
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 They hate it.

439
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 - What?

440
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 - No, I'm making it up.

441
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 They like off-menu, which they find funny and sometimes talks about salmon.

442
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 No, he doesn't say that. Caleb says they don't like the sound of people talking bears. Yeah, I've heard that. So either you have to constantly Yammer away, but if you're on a solo hike, you either have to talk to yourself for hours now, or you just play a book. So there's a boom box along with him playing the sound. Yes, you're right. It wouldn't work. It was just.

443
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 Why did they eat me?

444
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 Wow, that's amazing. That's incredible. I know. And Caleb adds I mostly use it in place of bear bells, which I didn't know were a thing in high-bear density low foot traffic areas.

445
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I like the multiple people talking excitedly. I on fish as bears are especially wary of groups of people. I'm very close to Wyoming as well.

446
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Montana. I believe they're the neighbors to each other. I went to them both in the same trip. Right.

447
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 And in Montana, I saw the biggest American flag I've ever seen in my entire life. Wow. It was like it was in a hotel, but it's a very tall hotel, lots of escalators. But you know, sometimes in a hotel, like the lobby will go all the way up to the ceiling.

448
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It was a high trim. And they had a flag that went all the way from the top all the way down to the bottom. It was insane. It was like six stories high.

449
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 If you did that in the UK, people would think you're having a breakdown. Yes. It's just a completely different flag attitude that we and they have.

450
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Thank God you didn't go hiking on your own in Montana, because the bears probably really hate us. And they're like, finally, one of them's on their own. Let's get them.

451
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Yeah. Yeah. That would have been bad. Yeah. But they wouldn't have known that it was James's voice. Why not?

452
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 Because you, unless you were talking to yourself, which I regularly do on my walks, do you?

453
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 You would have survived because I'd got up to you and gone, no, he's not Japanese.

454
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 Keep looking.

455
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 So thanks Caleb and stay safe out there. Yeah. Avoid those bears. He adds, I, of course, always carry bear spray as well.

456
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Not hairspray, but bear spray. Pleasing. Very nice. That is just to double down on that. So cool to hear that we're being played out in the mountains of Montana.

457
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 We're playing bears. That's really cool. We listen to the depths of the ocean. We haven't had space yet. But someone must have listened to us on a plane once.

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 We have. Yeah. We were sat next to someone who was listening to us on a plane once.

459
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Do you remember? No. When we flew from, probably from Perth, actually, to somewhere else in Australia, we were chatting. And there was someone sat next to us who was listening to the show on the headphones.

460
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 We were still talking. That must have absolutely broken their mind irretrievably. Do they just have a complete meltdown there and then.

461
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Because you think you were going mad, wouldn't you? I think they worked out quite quickly what was happening when they turned around and thought, well, half of those six efficient and non-Japanese.

462
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Oh, dear. Well, I was in Tokyo, actually, on the trains. You know, they've got the amazing trains.

463
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 I sat next to someone who was watching QI really on his phone. And it was a question I had written or was a script I had written. I was really excited. And I think I told you this before.

464
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 And I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, that's me. I wrote that. I did that. I got off the next stop. It just wasn't interested at all. Okay.

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Wow, that's pretty cool. Jam Rainbird, regular correspondent, says in today's dropper's line, not today's one we're doing now, the previous one or two.

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 You discussed the phenomenon whereby, pedantically correcting someone else's fact puts you most at risk of yourself being corrected.

467
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Down then went on to wonder if this was a variant of Murphy's law and James claimed this new law is his own Harkens law. Yeah. Interestingly, I saw this law mentioned on a TV show recently. They called it Muffery's law, not to be confused with Murphy's law and stated it in the context of spelling, grammar, etc.

468
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 If you correct someone else's, your correction will always contain an error itself. Anyway, you guys should give the show a watch. I think it'd be really up your street. It's called QI.

469
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 If you want to serve, I wrote that. I wrote that. Okay. We need to go. That is episode 12. Oh, wow. Thanks. Jam. You know what? This is an example of Stigler's law of eponomeny or whatever it's called, which is that the law is always named after someone who didn't invent it. Yeah. So that's an example of that. If we call it Harkens law, then we're sticking to Stigler's law. Right. Yelka Ludolfi. I think I've got your first name, right? Yelka.

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Probably with a J. Anyway, Yelka writes with your latest episode. I've been noticing a bit of a pattern. The podcast has really been on a spree of episodes with celebrity names in the title. Oh, apparently so. Well, you do the names, James. Can you think of any we've had?

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 I've got this gracious Bible six. Yeah, really. I can't even think of a single one within the last few weeks. You've had Dwayne Johnson. Oh, yeah, Johnson's hair. Yeah, Gordon Ramsey. Oh, yeah, cookbook. Oh, yeah, some book Lily Allen. Oh, she's a proper friend of the podcast though.

472
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 I don't want Bessie. Training the definition of celebrity. I could have gone runny pickering for that. Yeah. And Chanel. Well, that's not a celebrity. What? With honorary mentioned to the teletubbies.

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 Okay. Yeah. No, I see that. I wonder why I can. Well, Yelka has a theory. Okay. I can only imagine this is part of a strategy to trick the algorithm into hitching your popularity to theirs. Or is there's a way to ingratiate yourself with the Hollywood.

474
00:20:34,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And Yorkshire putting elites for when fish eventually makes the lead to movies and the Andy's dreams cinematic universe. Yeah, I can say. I mean, there is an argument that if we called every single episode, you know, no such thing as Taylor Swift and Sabrina Carpenter's picnic. Yeah, then we probably would go up in the algorithms. Yeah. All right. Time for fish love corner. This is new. Yeah. Very nice.

475
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Peter Teplitsky writes, hello, I have a fun fact for you. During COVID, I send a fact I heard on fish to a girl on a dating app. Yeah. That girl is now my fiance. Wow. Yes. And we guess what the fact is. He can't remember. Oh, it must have been about that woman who faked a prolapse.

476
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 It was probably the pro-laptop spectrum. Probably that's always got me laid that fact. No, I asked Peter and he can't remember exactly what the fact was. And I think he's claimed he claimed he can't find it in the app records anymore because probably he's not even on the app anymore.

477
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I should congratulate you.

478
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Oh, yeah, that's really nice. I remember there was a survey saying that QI was one of the best things you could pretend to watch that people find you more attractive.

479
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 It's like a cultural aphrodisiac. Yeah, like it makes you seem smart, but not that smart. Yeah, you watch comedy panel shows, but you watch a sort of more intellectual.

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Whereas if you say I listened to round Britain quiz, someone's going to think you're insufferable. Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

481
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 Yeah, it's a good good quiz that that was it. Is it? I've never I'm too hard for me. I don't understand it. Yeah. Like in our time already. It's not for people like you. No.

482
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 I'm happy watching a just a stream of colors and shapes appear on the screen.

483
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 I sometimes find the magic roundabout a bit much plot-wise. Have you ever seen boo snoo? No, boo snoo is amazing. It's a little red ball.

484
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 Yeah. It's a seven minute show of a little red ball just rolling and some little things happen in the background. There might be some, you know, weighing scales and it goes on one side and then it weighs up and then it rolls off again or it might go on a seesaw or something.

485
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 But it's literally that's just the whole thing. I love it. It sounds like the advert for cats that we covered a long time ago. Yeah. But it's real like toddlers love it. And also I think it's for people with sensory issues.

486
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Because it really is a lot of like textures and stuff. It's like catnet for kids. Fantastic. But I love watching it because half of it is CGI and half of it's real and trying to work out which bits of real and which bits of CGI.

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Try to be right. I'll check it out. Anyway, it's the new like if you're a student and you're off your face. Yeah. Then it's probably the best thing you can watch right now.

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 If I got boost new for you. But that's really cool. Congratulations Peter. We scare off bears and we find you love. Find you love. Yeah. Yeah. Just brilliant. Matt Underwood writes just listening to little fish.

489
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Read the list of funnily named things which James read out. I have another for you here in Cornwall. There is an animal park called the screech owl sanctuary.

490
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 Perhaps reasonably you would assume this would be a sanctuary for screech owls, but no. It's named for its founder Caroline screech. That's really good. That's very really good. Very funny. Let's have a couple more. Yeah.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 I'd rather like this. We were having a chat recently about the origins of spicy meat. Right. Because James you I think in particular. I don't understand any of it fear and dislike all of this my cool categories for our stuff.

492
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I indulge you, but it's through gritted teeth. Yeah. I'm talking about things like the buffins. Yeah. All the fish love from this week. Yeah. That was new. That won't be coming back. No. Well, actually if you're in a relationship. Thanks to no such things official. Always tell us. Please. Yeah. Especially if there's a good story behind it.

493
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And even if that story is I send a girl a fact and I can't now remember what the fact was, but we're engaged. I think that clears that for me that clears the bar very ably. Yeah. Agreed. Yeah.

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 That couple you got married and had minutes of coal at their wedding. It's good stuff. Anyway, James. Yeah. I've got news for you because air and hung has found that someone around this table was the first to use the phrase spicy meat on no such thing as a fish's drop us a line section.

495
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Oh, okay. What's obviously Harkin? It was James. Does it? I doesn't sound like me. Andy. Anyway, let's get on to the meat of Pete's message. James. Pete's meat. And that sounds like me. Andy, Pete's meat. Here we go. Then we keep going for a bit. And we thank Pete. Dan says and your meat.

496
00:25:49,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 It doesn't hold up quite so well when you read it out like this. I was sure that was very funny when we said it. But as it is, it sounds like three middle age men with no sense of humor.

497
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 This is the court stenographer's version. Yeah. What we do. Andy, okay. I quite like the procedural stuff. There's another procedural question. Oh, yeah. But this is a spicy one. James. Spicy meat. There you go.

498
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 Okay. Well, me a culper, I guess. Absolutely. You later tried to row back and suggested get to the meat. Then Dan, you suggested meat cute. Both of which I love. But no spicy meat was born that way. So thank you Aaron for keeping us honest. Yeah. That was about two years ago. And the two years have flown by. There've been two years of very happy spicy meat for me. Very nice.

499
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Meat cute works for anyone who has fallen in love. It does. So we could bring that in. Have you ever split up with someone over no such thing as a fish?

500
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 You know, that would be good. That'd be great. I thought you had a meat pun connected to that. Nope. No.

501
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 Bye. Is that it? That's it. Well, okay. On that spicy bombshell. It's time to say thank you and goodbye. Thank you to all of you for listening or for watching. Thank you.

502
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 All performing. Thank you to everyone who's contributed in any way to all of this. If you'd like to send us an email about anything we've said. We love reading them. We love reading them out. The email addresses podcast at qi.com.

503
00:27:38,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 But there we go. Down and James. It's goodbye. Say bye. Goodbye. Bye. And we'll be back again in the fortnight with another one of these. And it'll be a bit better run next time. I think we can agree that. Don't make promises you can't keep up.

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 You always look at us when you do these out troves with fear such fear in your eyes. Have you ever seen a dog driving a tractor? I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing.

505
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Someone's going to get hurt real bad because I'm here and in charge. Stop me for my own sake. Stop, Andy. Bye.

506
