00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,400
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Six Things A Fish, where we were joined by one of my actual heroes.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:20,000
 We had one of Andy and Dan's heroes Michael Paylon last week, but this week we have one of my heroes, and that is Adam Chase from Jetlag the game.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
 Now Andy, do you know who Adam is?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,000
 I do, I'm not a bigger fan of Jetlag the game is you, but I quite like that he's got nominative determinism.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Was it all about chasing all over the place, isn't it?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 You're absolutely right, it is absolutely huge in the QI office, all the QI elves watch it.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 It's available on YouTube or also on Nebula, which is like another platform for creators.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 But basically what it does is Adam is with his friends Ben and Sam, and they play board games.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 But instead of on a board, they use the entire world.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And you would love it, it's all about infrastructure.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 It's all about getting on the right train or the right plane, but they do challenges.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 There's so much jeopardy involved in this show every single week.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 It genuinely is my absolute favourite bit of content that comes out in the world.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Wow.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And having Adam on the show was so exciting.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 It's really good. I have actually had a sneak preview. I've already heard the episode.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I can confirm you're in for a treat. He's such a nice guy and yeah, it's a great episode.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Adam has also done a documentary about the world's biggest scavenger hunt. That's called Scav. That's available on Nebula.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But if you want to find out more about him, then go to YouTube and search for jet like the game.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Yes. And the other thing we know is Christmas is coming up.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 If you are looking for a present to give someone, why not give them membership of Club Fish?

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 This is our members club where you can get bonus bits of fish for the fish fan in your life.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 If you want extra shows, you can get amp free shows. If you want to experience even more fish,

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 or give that to someone else who you know who likes the show, then why not do that?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Just go to patreon.com/nosuchthingsaffish.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But in the meantime, really hope you enjoyed this show with Adam Chase from Jet Like The Game.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 On with the podcast. On with the show.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the world.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin and Miller and Adam Chase.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And in no particular order, here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Adam.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 My fact is that every map of China is a little bit wrong.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 And I would like to say that it is not for any of the controversial reasons that people might interpret that statement.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 This does not have to do with any disputed territories.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I'm not delving into that issue at the moment, but nonetheless every map of China is a little bit wrong.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Okay. Why, if not for the first reason. Okay. So basically all of the maps, pretty much all the maps in the world, like the digital maps, right?

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 You know, your Google maps, your Apple maps, your, your whatever. They all use this system called WGS 84, which is a system that was made and you're never going to believe this 1984 world geodesic system, I believe 84 it is.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 And this is, you know, just like a system that is able to store and keep and communicate coordinates of all the different things. So it knows that the post office is at this exact set of coordinates in it, you know, these are how maps work.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Now China does not use this system since 2002, they basically have very tightly controlled the ability to make maps of China only Chinese companies can make maps of China.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 And they have to put it through this system called GCJ zero to instead of WGS 84, which basically takes an accurate data of where everything is in it randomly adjusts it anywhere between 50 to 500 meters in a kind of random direction.

42
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Just to make the map all be a little bit like skewed in various ways, but in random ways that you can't predict because obviously if they moved everything 20 meters left, you would say, okay, great, well, I can fix everything 20 meters, right?

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 What this does is it just sort of like turns it all so that nothing is quite right and you can see this if you go on Google maps and you compare the satellite view to the non satellite view, you'll see there's all kinds of things that don't line up.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You'll see that there are like banks in the middle of a river and they're like, thanks for the edge of the river.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 But Adam, it's why just to mess with us. I looked into this. The one thing I just couldn't understand was why is this the case? Who does this help?

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 So to my understanding, it is a national security thing for the most part.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I can read you the exact wording of article one of this law, which just says it is enacted to strengthen the administration of surveying and mapping undertaking promoted development and ensure it renders service to the development of the national economy, the building up of national defense and progress of the society.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 So the answer is, of course, they're doing it for the national economy, the building up of national defense and the progress of the society. That's obvious.

49
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 That makes sense.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 Kind of a dumb question, because that's an obvious answer.

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Yeah, it's just pretty astonishing. How does anyone get around in China?

52
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Well, one of my favorite things about how they do this is that so on like US Google Maps, we have an accurate satellite image, but an inaccurate, inaccurate data.

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 So the satellite and the data don't line up.

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 If you go to, at least when I did this last, when you go to Google Maps, China, then the satellite and the data do match up.

55
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 So you go, oh, do they just mess it up for like the US versions, but the China Google, it works fine.

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 But it's actually something way crazier, which is that you're not looking at an accurate satellite map within accurate, you know, with accurate data.

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 They've taken the inaccurate data, and then they have made the satellite map also wrong, but in a way that matches the inaccurate data.

58
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 So they have warped the satellite map in the same way that they warped the other stuff so that things do line up, but it still is all wrong.

59
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 So it tracks, but it tracks incorrectly.

60
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Yes, exactly.

61
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 That's very funny.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 So the bank is still in the water, but it's in the water, both on both versions.

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I guess the accurate satellite map is the best way to know that the bank is not there, but...

64
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 I guess there are some things that aren't on the satellite maps either, right?

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Oh, a lot kinds of things. So the world's second largest island that's inside a lake wasn't on any maps until very recently.

66
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 In fact, it's never been on any maps because it currently isn't an island anymore.

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 This is a place called Voz Rajidiyanya, which is in Russia.

68
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And it's mentioned in Call of Duty Black Ops, so some people might know it from that, but basically it's where they had the big smallpox factory in Russia.

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 It was on this huge island in the Aral Sea, but it was on no maps. It was always blurred out when you got there.

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And then before they could put it on any maps, because eventually this factory was closed down.

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 It was stopped being an island anymore because the Aral Sea dried up, and now it's just part of the land.

72
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Well, there's lots of weird national security things that have to be dealt with with maps.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 One of my favorite stories is that... Do you know Strava?

74
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Yeah, the running app.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Yeah, it's like a running app. Strava was accidentally giving away the location of secret US military bases.

76
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 And the exact parameters of their shape, because soldiers would be running with Strava, and they would run along the wall of the base.

77
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Basically, they would make a full loop along the wall to get for their lap to be the longest period that it could be in the space.

78
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And so you could see on Strava, it was literally just outlining.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 Here is the exact shape of this military base. Here's exactly where it is. Here's exactly what it looks like.

80
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 The super secret military base.

81
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 Yes, exactly.

82
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 You know what they should have done? Like in the Second World War, when their bombers were coming over, we made fake cities.

83
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 So they would put like fires and lights and stuff just outside the city so the bombers would go to the wrong place.

84
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So what they could have done is leak out this Strava thing, and then get the soldiers to run maybe 200 meters away from the base.

85
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 But I didn't think about it. You know, your fake World War II cities are a significant plot point in the recent film. Now you see me, now you don't. Has anybody been to the theater to see that one?

86
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 Adam, now you're talking about a friend of the podcast. We've mentioned this on this show recently. How much we unironically love that very much.

87
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 It's the best. It's unbelievable those movies there. I love those movies. I would watch you could I would watch the number of highest movies that I would watch before I got sick of them is unbelievable.

88
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And they're not good, right? They're not.

89
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 My friend, my friend, I started my friend literally last night. He's I mentioned. He asked me if I wanted to see it. I said, oh, I already saw it. He said, is it good? I said, of course not.

90
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 Said, but it's amazing.

91
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 I think I've watched the first one about 20 times in the last few weeks. It's just so morish. I just had it on in the background just while I'm doing research.

92
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 There's a great fact which John Lloyd from QI either mentioned on this show was going to mention on this show, which was as part of Google Earth making all of these amazing maps of the world.

93
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 There was also sort of a lot of unfortunate discoveries for people who were trying to hide things from authorities. And in Athens, they have a thing whereby if you build a pool in your backyard, there's a special tax for the pool.

94
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 So only 324 pools were declared in Athens suburbs. But after Google Maps came around the Google Earth, it was discovered 16,974 pools were in the area.

95
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 Well, do you remember like, I mean, I was a kid when this happened like when Google Earth first started to be a thing. And I remember being like at school on like the computers in the library and someone telling me like, if you put in your address here, it'll show you a picture of your house.

96
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And I remember being like, surely that's illegal. I was like, you're telling me that people could see what my house looks like. I remember it being like, it's just funny how things that are so mundane now like when that first became a thing.

97
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I was, I mean, I was also a child. So maybe I didn't have a lot of perspective on it. But I was like, this is the most crazy outrageous thing I've ever seen in my life.

98
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 I can say as someone who was not just an adult, but quite an old adult when that happened that we also thought it was everyone did.

99
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And also, it did lead to a great game, which was, can you spot yourself standing outside your house? I mean, I wonder Adam with the amount of travel that you've done in different countries.

100
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 If you and your jet lag crew have ever tried to work out who has appeared in most Google Earth images for the street view.

101
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 We are on street view. We are on street view. We know that we're on street view. In season three, we were in France outside. I believe massive palace use station.

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And the Google Street view car came through and we did get on street view.

103
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 It's a weird thing where different portions of that street use street view images from different years.

104
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So you have to be on a really specific part of the street view to see us. Maybe the case that we're not on there anymore, but at least there was a period where you 100% could see us on street view.

105
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's very cool.

106
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Which was very exciting to us.

107
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I happen to know the world record for the most numbers of times a person is on Google Street.

108
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 Really?

109
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Not as high as you would think, but it is high given it was taken on one single dog walk.

110
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Go on. I'm going to say a dozen 12.

111
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Any more bags?

112
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 I'm going to say 48.

113
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And try both.

114
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 Six.

115
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 43.

116
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Wow.

117
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Very close.

118
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Yeah, apparently she has seen us looking quite suspicious because it was crawling really, really, really slowly down the street.

119
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 That's what she says.

120
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 I think it's got her every few minutes.

121
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 That's amazing.

122
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I got a random message the other day from a friend who sent me a picture of a parking fine that he got. And in order to give you your parking fines, they send you two photos of when you entered the place and when you left.

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 And he was like, is this your family?

124
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 And in the shot as my wife and my kids.

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 I was.

126
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Now, now their heads are blurred.

127
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 So you'd think, how would they possibly know that that is my wife and kids?

128
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But he knew because for the last few weeks, my son has refused to get out of his Halloween pumpkin costume.

129
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So he's just been walking the streets dressed as a giant pumpkin and that has appeared in the parking photo.

130
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 That is an incredible bit by your son.

131
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 That's awesome, dude.

132
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 That's so funny.

133
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two.

134
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And that is Anne.

135
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 And my fact is that German train station Tanois are so bad that an idiom for I don't understand in Germany is if for Steyer nor Bonhoff or I only understand train station.

136
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 What does that phrase specifically mean?

137
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 What would you, when would you use that in response?

138
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 So if someone, if you sort of lost a train of thought, you're not following.

139
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 It's kind of like, I'm wary of walking any other country into this, but it's like, you say, oh, that's all a foreign language to me.

140
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 Well, we would say all Greek to me in English, but then different countries say like, I think in Russia, they say it's all Arabic to me.

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Someone said it's all Dutch. We've done it some QIs.

142
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 I've completely lost track of who actually uses them in which country.

143
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 In the US, we would say Greek. We would say it's all Greek to me.

144
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 There is also, there is an alternative explanation that the train station comes from the fact during World War One soldiers just were so fixated on getting home.

145
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 They would say, I'm just thinking about the train station. I only understand train station.

146
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 There's sort of two takes on it, but I only understand train station as in we thought of you and your long suffering times with Dutch fans.

147
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Do you have any, do you have any opinions about the German train network?

148
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Look, here's the thing about the German trains.

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Is that in a lot of our games, you know, there's three competitors. There's me and then my colleagues Ben and Sam.

150
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And when you get into Germany, a fourth competitor enters the game, which is Deutsche Bahn,

151
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 which really is able to impact the game in a way that's much greater than any of the other players can.

152
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 Deutsche Bahn can give and Deutsche Bahn can take.

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Sometimes you'll be able to get on a train much earlier than you thought,

154
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 because you'll be getting on a train that was supposed to leave an hour ago, but that's been delayed an hour.

155
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 In other times, your train will get hugely delayed. And so in a lot of our, you know, the game we've played most in Germany is a tag gamer you're chasing after somebody.

156
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And it's like when you enter Deutsche Bahn territory, I would say that just you enter a world of extraordinary variance, but it's like it's completely observable.

157
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Like it is the case that Deutsche Bahn trains are delayed way, way more than any of their contemporaries.

158
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Like only about 60 ish percent of the high speed Deutsche Bahn trains reach their destinations on time.

159
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 It's crazy, which is defined as being within five or six minutes.

160
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Because you know what? Like we have a stereotype of Germans being very efficient.

161
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Exactly. Yes, it was very strange.

162
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 And like we would have thought if you asked someone who didn't know this, who probably hadn't seen your show or hadn't been to Germany,

163
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 they would expect that the German trains would really run on time, but they absolutely don't.

164
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 And I think the Germans know it as well. There was the professor of transport policy at Berlin. Andreas Kniehr.

165
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 He recently said that the Deutsche Bahn and our failing football team are proved that we aren't making great things anymore.

166
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So I also would have thought they were super reliable. And so when it kept happening on jet lag, I was like, what's going on with these trains?

167
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 And then I was looking into it. And there was a big piece in the Washington Post in August this year about the absolute identity crisis happening in German trains.

168
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 And basically, in particularly bad news for you Adam, it's got, it's basically been getting bad since the 90s.

169
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 And it plummeted since 2020. It just got worse and worse and worse to the point that in April this year, Switzerland actually banned some German trains from coming across.

170
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Because it was so embarrassing. The delays they kept bringing it was just calling knock on chaos onto their trains.

171
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 So they were like, no, we've had enough. What's so sad about it, though, is I'll have lots of people be like, you know,

172
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 don't you hate the German trains? Don't you? Friends will be visiting and they'll be like, well, I know I shouldn't get on a train in Germany.

173
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 And what I always say is like the thing about the trains Germany, the high speed trains is once you're on the train, it's lovely.

174
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 Like the actual trains, the high speeds, at least they're really, really nice.

175
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 The food, as I think some of the best of like European trains, the trains are really, you know, nice. It's just that they're so delayed.

176
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 But the delay flies by and comfort. Once you get on the train, you're doing great.

177
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 I mean, they used to be real leaders in the world of trains. They in 1933 had a train that was called the Flying Hamburger.

178
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 And it was said to be the fastest regular railway connection in the world for its time. But yeah, it sounds like things have gone down.

179
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Interesting. I was looking into what trains were like during the wartime period during World War II.

180
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 And there was a really fascinating thing that the Americans tried to do as part of a propaganda push that involved trains in Germany,

181
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 which was an operation called Operation Cornflakes. And Operation Cornflakes. So on the 5th of February 1945, American bombers attacked a German mail train that was heading towards the Austrian city of Lints.

182
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 And they blew it apart. And minutes, just minutes after that attack, there was a second wave of planes that came over. And they dropped off eight mailbags.

183
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 And the idea is that all the letters that scattered that they dropped would be collected by people coming to see the train wreck. And the idea was that they would then be taken to the houses.

184
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And inside would contain pure propaganda of how Germany was losing the war and how Hitler was not as strong as you thought he was.

185
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And so it wasn't just this one event between February and April of 1945, 320 mailbags with over 96,000 forged letters were dropped during 10 missions over southern Germany and Austria.

186
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Operation Cornflakes, the idea was that you would read these letters while eating your cornflakes in the morning.

187
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 That's really cool. I've never come across that before.

188
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 Yeah. And who were these letters purported to be from about how like the war was going badly?

189
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 I don't think that's overly mattered. I think it was, I think as in some of it might have been just as it were a leaflet talking about propaganda.

190
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Okay. I think in some cases they wrote them as if they were like pen pals from America Germans who happen to get away saying I'm sending you a random letter.

191
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 They could have pretended that they were from Hitler. And Hitler's like, oh, dear Mr. Schmidt, I'm writing to tell you that things aren't going quite as well as I imagined that I'm not as strong as you might think I am.

192
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 I love that idea. Dear Schmidt, Hitler here is and Schmidt going, oh, hey, it's perfectly normal letter from the future.

193
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But can you imagine being like Hitler's teenage pen pals? You just be like, this is taken a real turn.

194
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Yes. Well, there's actually a film that is about this. Well, not if you've seen JoJo Rabbit, which is about a kid.

195
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Yeah. Perhaps not pen pals with Hitler, but is, you know, who is best, his imaginary best friend is Hitler.

196
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Who made that done? Was that taken by T.T.? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, very cool movie.

197
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 One of the issues they found in the end was a lot of these letters couldn't get delivered to the houses they wanted to because the Americans had done such a huge blitz of bombing the areas that most of these houses didn't exist anymore.

198
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And so people had moved on to other places. So going back to Tanais on German trains.

199
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 There was an announcement in one of these newspaper articles about Deutsche Bahn that said the train driver has not yet arrived

200
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 because of another delayed train. Unfortunately, we are currently blocking the track for his train.

201
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 We are curious ourselves to see how this will be resolved.

202
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 But there was a kind of train that existed in Coney Island in 1909.

203
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 This was just like, it was just to try it out to see if it would work.

204
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And what it was, it was a train that had tracks that went over the top of the train.

205
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 So if you ever wanted to overtake it, you could kind of drive over the top of the train ahead of it.

206
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 They never made it, probably because how often are you going to want to overtake a train that you can't just go around it and whatever, but it did exist for a short amount of time in 1909.

207
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Clever idea.

208
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 So you know, this brings up, of course, one of my hobby horses, which is, you know, we're talking a lot of, you know, we're talking a lot of smack about German trains, but I don't really, I'm not really in much of a position to criticize given the state of trains in my country.

209
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Because Amtrak is even worse than Deutsche Bahn in terms of its on time percentage when you look at long distance trains.

210
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 I think that on average, long distance Amtrak trains tend to be delayed by around an hour and a half.

211
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Okay.

212
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 It depends on the route.

213
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 But you know, the reason for this is actually largely not Amtrak's fault, at least not directly.

214
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 It's because for the vast vast majority of rail in the United States, the rail, the actual rail is owned by freight companies.

215
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 So all these long distance trains that are always so delayed, it's because the Amtrak's have to stop and wait for freight rail to pass through.

216
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And even though technically legally as part of like Amtrak's original charter, they are supposed to have the right of way over all of this rail, that law is just pretty much straight up not followed.

217
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Here's a thing from the early days of U.S. rail. There was a thing called snake heads. Can you guess what they are?

218
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 Is it where it goes off in two directions?

219
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Ah, Junction, no. This was something that would be in the train itself.

220
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 Like imagine what a snake does like when it's, it's slither.

221
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 It's slither, but when it's attacking, it goes.

222
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 Is this when a train stops? It's the brackets in between lift up to bring it closer?

223
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 That's pretty close. What it was, it was bits of the iron rails below being jolted up and then coming through the bottom of the train and then sometimes impaling the passengers.

224
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Oh my god. This apparently happened in the south. There was a guy called Henry Whipple who wrote in 1844 that you would just be sitting down in the train and a huge bit of iron would come up and hit people.

225
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Wow.

226
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 And there was actually one occasion where someone actually died from it as well.

227
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 I always think if there was a list to be done of what would be the most surprising deaths to witness sort of in front of you, that surely has to be a top tenor.

228
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 You're just on a train and someone has a bar of iron.

229
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 It's like final destination, isn't it?

230
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Exactly.

231
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 There's a big issue in New York City with P.O. Subway surfing.

232
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Have you heard about this?

233
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 That like kids and teens, they'll ride on the top of the subway car. And it's extremely, yeah, and it's extremely dangerous and like many, it's very tragic.

234
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 Like it's really, you know, it's been, it's been jumping the barrier, but that's way more.

235
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 No, you ride on top of it. And if you ride the New York City subway, especially in certain areas, there are many subway announcements where they've gotten like people who are famous and cool among like young people.

236
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Who like, it's like a celebrity doing like an announcement and they're like, hi, I'm Nigel Sylvester.

237
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Don't subway surf. It's stupid and you shouldn't do it.

238
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Yeah.

239
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 I mean, as famous as Nigel Sylvester is, do you mind just explaining who, with some of us, I don't know who he is, is.

240
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You could have picked any name at him.

241
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 I have to be honest with you.

242
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I mostly know Nigel Sylvester from his role in this awareness campaign, because I am not the target demographic.

243
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 I wasn't subway surfing.

244
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But I can tell you that he is a BMX athlete.

245
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 So I think the idea is that it's like he is like an extreme trick stunt athlete guy.

246
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 And he's telling you don't do this.

247
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 We should say that we all knew who that was. We were just saying it for the listener.

248
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Yeah, yeah.

249
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 I've got a Nigel Sylvester tattoo.

250
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Like, I am a woman, my god.

251
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 Can I tell another train, Tanoi music fact?

252
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Yeah.

253
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 So I share a desk with Joe in the office.

254
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 And he told me that if he listened to David Gilmour's "Rattle That Lock", so he's the guitarist from Pink Floyd.

255
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 He has sampled the beginning of the French train station Tanoi announcement.

256
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Oh really?

257
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And so he's on a loop, it plays through.

258
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And I played it for my friend's husband.

259
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He suddenly went, I know that noise.

260
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 Well, you know, in Billy Eilish's song, "Bad Guy", the thing that sounds like a high hat is actually the sound that is made in Australian walkways when it's telling you to walk.

261
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 That little, and it goes like,

262
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 and then they sampled that.

263
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And that's the thing that sounds like it's the percussion element of that system.

264
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Oh, wow.

265
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 So Adam, in the UK, we have a very brilliant, very impossible quiz show called Only Connect.

266
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 It's familiar, of course.

267
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Oh, brilliant.

268
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 I feel we've got two transport-based musical facts, so we just need like two more.

269
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 And we can slip that over to those guys.

270
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 I've got one more story that I'd love to just shove in here, because it made me laugh.

271
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Which is, it's back to Germany, back to the German rail.

272
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 In 2015, members of Germany's Neo-Nazi National Democratic Party were on their way to Freiburg,

273
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 because they were going to do a protest.

274
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 The police stopped them from getting on.

275
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 There was about 20 of them who were getting on as part of this Neo-Nazi party,

276
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 but it just so happened that that train was full of a far-left ultra-football support group.

277
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 So they went, "Okay, we'll get the next train, actually."

278
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 And so they did get the next train, but, confusingly, that platform just had a train

279
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 going to a completely different place in a completely different direction.

280
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And so they ended up in Mannheim and ended up having to cancel the protest altogether,

281
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 because they just were in a different bit of the country.

282
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I just love that idea of, is there any worse group of people to jump on a train with,

283
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 if you're the opposing side, than a group of ultra-left supporter football fans?

284
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I feel like they would just sort of get together and gel over the state of the Deutsche Bahn.

285
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Yes, and eventually the entire political problem will just disappear.

286
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It's the unifier.

287
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Okay, in his time for fact number three, and that is James.

288
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that female London marathon runners are 20% slower than Boston marathon runners.

289
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 But they urinate 170% quicker.

290
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Okay.

291
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 How did they find this out?

292
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 Well, this is due to the fact.

293
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 First of all, the Boston marathon is overall downhill.

294
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 So it's not even, you can't even use it for world record attempts,

295
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 because it's theoretically slightly easier than they are the marathon.

296
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 And it's all relative, because it's not easy, but like easier than some of the others.

297
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 But the urine thing is due to a company called Pequal, which is a woman's event urinal company.

298
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 They've come up with these new urinals, which are at the London marathon.

299
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 And they basically you go in, shorts down, squat, and then leave.

300
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 And so they're much quicker than using their previous portals that they had, which means people can pee much quicker.

301
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And the great thing about them as well is that they take the urine and they can turn it into fertilizer.

302
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And the 2024 London marathon could theoretically have fertilized enough wheat to bake 3,142 loaves of bread,

303
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 according to this company NPK recovery.

304
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Nice.

305
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 So it's like a great story of urine and saving the planet and running.

306
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 But Adam, are you a runner?

307
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 I was a runner. Certainly I was.

308
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 I have aspirations of running the New York City marathon in 2026.

309
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 But I, I have run much less in recent years.

310
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 I was a very competitive cross country runner in high school.

311
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 The New York one, is that one where you need to have a certain time before you can do it?

312
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 Or can anyone do it?

313
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Well, it's complicated.

314
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 Mostly you have to have raised money for some sort of charitable causes, the way the vast majority of people get into the New York City marathon.

315
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 For enough, like the London marathon, you can either be fast, or you can like run in a suit of armor or dress as big Ben.

316
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 How many slots are there for dressed as big Ben? How many people get in on that one?

317
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 That's actually the majority.

318
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Yeah, yeah, makes sense.

319
00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 You know, Heinz, who make ketchup, yes, they have found that runners have been using ketchup on their runs as like a way to get fast energy.

320
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Because it's mostly sugar, right?

321
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Like, when I was running, I would have Haribos, like candies.

322
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 Right, to get fast energy, but apparently a lot of people have been using ketchup.

323
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 And so they've laid out routes on running gaps, where if you're on the running gap,

324
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 you can see where the nearest places that you can run in and get a ketchup sachet.

325
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 What you'd want to do is you'd want to leave the drive-through McDonald's open purely for marathon runners that day.

326
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 So you just pass the window and they hand them out as you're going along.

327
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 That feels like it would make more sense.

328
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 When I did the Great North run, which is a half marathon in the UK, there was like just kids on the side of the road,

329
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 and they'd just give you candy or they would give you like ice lollies or just also just basically the whole way they would just loads of kids with buckets just handing them out to the runners.

330
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 That's such an opposite of never accept candy from strange children.

331
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 But speaking of that, so this is the only time I've done any long distance running.

332
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 And I won't tell you what my time was, but I recently read that there was a robot that finished a half marathon this year.

333
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It's called Tien Kunga Ultra, and it ran it in Beijing.

334
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 And my question for you is, the time of the robot comes somewhere in this list of half-marathons.

335
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 The World Record Human Half-Marathon, the record-wearing later-hosen, the record dressed as a clown, the record in a straight jacket, my type for the Great North Run, the record for a woman in high heels, the record for someone hula hooping, and the record for someone wearing armour.

336
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 Now where does the robot finish in that list?

337
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 I'm going between straight jacket and you. I'm going to go between James and person in high heels.

338
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 I'm going to go faster than the World Record.

339
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 Just above the hula hooper, above the hula hooper.

340
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 That's right. It's basically not quite as fast as me is the headlight.

341
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 You are faster than all running robots, is what you've taken.

342
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 Yeah, that's what I've said.

343
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 When the robots, if do, may take over, you cannot run them.

344
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Is there a distance of 30 miles? Yeah. That's a good stuff.

345
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Here's something I'd like to, you know, I was about to say, I hope you don't mind me being pedantic, but I feel like I'm on this show, it's probably permitted.

346
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 This occurred to me actually the other day because Mr. Beast did a video about like the fastest running robot and the fastest man on earth, no lie, and they did like a hundred meter race.

347
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 And I thought to myself, well, that's not really the fastest robot at all. Is it the fastest robot would be an F1 car?

348
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Would it not?

349
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Yeah, I feel like we sometimes we have this conception to say, well, a robot, if a robot runs a marathon, does that just mean that it was a robot that was shaped like a person?

350
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Because to me, I'm like the whole thing that makes robots better at stuff than us is that they don't have to be shaped like a person, right?

351
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 Yeah, that's true. This was the bipedal robot, but then on the other hand, you get robots that aren't bipedal like Daleks, and they have their own problems getting around, don't they?

352
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 They can't go up steps. Are you familiar with Dr. Who Adam?

353
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 I'm familiar with Daleks. They're those little trash can guys.

354
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Yeah, you say little, they're massive, mate. You wouldn't fancy your chances against a Dalek. They're huge. What are you talking about?

355
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 No, you're right. And I shouldn't piss them off because they're listening to the podcast.

356
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Exactly.

357
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Yeah, they're the size of putting the actor inside them. That's how big they are, basically.

358
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 Yeah, they're about the size of an actor plus a little bit of leeway.

359
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And my reference point of this is Malcolm in the middle, but there's an episode where the speed walking, like it comes down to the technicality of when your feet leave the ground, if you have them both off the ground at the same time.

360
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 So I feel like with the formula one car, maybe it's feet or wheels are on the ground all the time, maybe it doesn't count as running.

361
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 That's interesting definition of running. That's a very good thing.

362
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Thank you, Malcolm in the middle.

363
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 Adam, I wanted to ask you because you said you were a track runner back in the day.

364
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 I was. I was tracking cross country.

365
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Did you ever do steeple chase events? I did. I never did steeple chase. I always wished I could.

366
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 We didn't have it where I competed, but I love the steeple chase. I love that it just makes no sense at all.

367
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Yeah. I just think it's so great. They're just like, you're going to run. What is it?

368
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 It's like basically a 3,200, right? It's like a 3,000 meter. It's 3,000 meter. Right.

369
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 3,000 meters. So it's like, you're going to run roughly two miles, but just at one point, you have to jump over a big thing.

370
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 And also seemingly from no purpose other than to mess with you, you're going to get your feet all wet.

371
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Yeah. Just because why not?

372
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 It's a little pool on the other side of my job.

373
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 We have we have something where you just run. It's called a regular running.

374
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 And we have a different thing where you have to jump over stuff. It's called the hurdles.

375
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 What I didn't we just just it was a drunken evening. It's so phenomenal. I love this.

376
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Well, there's a great there's a great moment because it's been in the Olympics, basically from the get go modern Olympics.

377
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 And it's a 3,000 meter race except for in 1932 at the summer Olympics, where it was a 3,460 meter race.

378
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 That's the only time they ever did this. And then it returned to 3,000 meters again.

379
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Do you guys know why they did that for that year?

380
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Just for fun because they're fucking with them already with these jumps. They might as well.

381
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 I'm in a guess that it was by accident. It was completely by accident. The guy who was meant to be concentrating and ringing the bell on the final lap was too busy watching a long jump event.

382
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 Didn't notice that they had already passed.

383
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Yeah. And so they just had one more lap that they had to do.

384
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 And as a result, all the finalists had times that came in much worse than all of the qualifiers.

385
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 So yeah, just a total mess up. It was a decathlon part of a decathlon thing going on. He was just distracted.

386
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 You know, in track running, they have the crouched start.

387
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Sure. You know where you're on your haunches at the start.

388
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 That was originally known as the kangaroo start, because we think it started with an Australian athlete called Bobby McDonald.

389
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 And he said that he saw how kangaroos looked and he might try the same thing.

390
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 And do you know why he said that he originally started to do this crouched start? Can you guess?

391
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 So everyone used to start standing up, right? Yeah. Oh, oh, did he drop something?

392
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 He did it. Every time. Jesus.

393
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 He had to tie his shoelaces before he started.

394
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Yeah. No, what it was is he was running not in Australia, but in Europe.

395
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 And it was really cold and windy and rainy. And he said that by crouching down, it meant that he got less wet and less cold.

396
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 That's why he said. So interestingly, it was also an Aussie, at least who was credited, a guy called Charlie Booth,

397
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 who in 1929 invented starter blocks.

398
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And so prior to this, what people used to do is they would dig holes into the ground so that they could put their heels in.

399
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 And this was a problem largely because you're messing up the track for anyone else that's using it. You'd have to fill them in and so on.

400
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 So this guy, Charlie Booth, came up with them and they were adopted, but the very first time that someone used them in a race was a guy called George Simpson.

401
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And in 1930, he ran the 100 yard dash in 9.4 seconds. So the first person to ever do it under 10. Wow.

402
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 And he was disqualified. It was disallowed because they said that is contraband. That is illegal. Yeah, you're using something that is...

403
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 But like catapults in them though that sort of fired him. No, they were just the classic things. But yeah, so the very first use of them in a race got him disqualified.

404
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:12,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show. And that is my fact. My fact this week is that there is a hair that has been missing for 40 years.

405
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
 But I know where it is.

406
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:24,000
 When you say hair, is it like something you find in your soup or what? Yes, this is a rabbit hair.

407
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 And it's not a real rabbit hair. It's a golden rabbit. And when I say I'm the only one who knows, kind of everyone knows now because it's at Sotheby's currently being sold at Diction.

408
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 And it was at Sotheby's the whole time. So this is quite a famous story from back in the late 70s. This is the masquerade hair.

409
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 A lot of people in the UK of a certain age are going to prick their ears up right now and go, "Yes, I remember this. This was massive when it happened."

410
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And what this was is there was a book that was published by an author and illustrator called Kit Williams. It was for kids. And it had a story in it, but not only that, it had a series of codes that would put all the way through it.

411
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 And the idea was that if you could crack this code, it would reveal the location of a golden necklace that was secretly buried somewhere in the world.

412
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 And that was the challenge of the book. It was incredibly hard. And Kit Williams didn't think that this would become a big book, but somehow it broke through. It got to international press.

413
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 The book ended up selling over a million copies. And it sparked a global treasure hunt. Some say the very first major global treasure hunt looking for this hair.

414
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 Well, very excitingly, now that it's been sold, I've been told by the family that own it that I'm allowed to reveal where it has been for the last 40 years.

415
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Oh.

416
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 Now, before we get to that, let me explain why it's been missing for 40 years.

417
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Oh, come on.

418
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Show us the hair, Dan.

419
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 This is quite a complicated story. So let's just jump back a couple of steps here.

420
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:12,000
 Over 30,000 people sent letters to Kit Williams, claiming to have discovered where it had been buried. American Airlines were offering masquerade packages where they would fly you to the UK.

421
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Every passenger would be given a free shovel. So that was live in London. They could start looking for the masquerade hair.

422
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 It was digging up. It's a London in case it was there.

423
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 Exactly. A man from Sweden who thought that the hair was out in Cornwall had to be rescued from the side of a cliff.

424
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
 After he found himself stuck halfway up when the tide came in, it was a huge, huge thing.

425
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:41,000
 And it is said that a few people went quite insane over trying to find it and actually had to go and be put up in hospitals as a result of it.

426
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 So it was eventually found by a guy called Ken Thomas.

427
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 A day later, Kit Williams got a letter from two teachers who also found it.

428
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:59,000
 And they legitimately found it, whereas Ken Thomas got information on where it was from someone who was associated with Kit Williams. So it was a cheat of a find.

429
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
 So it was really unfortunate because the two teachers did genuinely find where it was on their own terms.

430
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 Did they find the location or have to physically dig for it to get that word?

431
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Yeah, exactly. And that location turned out to be Amt Hill, which is in Bedford.

432
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,000
 Wow.

433
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 Yeah. So what ended up happening was this guy, Ken Thomas, he put a new game together,

434
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 which was a video game version, and he hid the masquerade hair again, but it was so hard that no one solved it.

435
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
 And he put so much money into this video game that he went bankrupt basically.

436
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 And so he sold it at Sotheby's.

437
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 And so someone bought it at Sotheby's and then it disappeared.

438
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 And no one saw it for decades.

439
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
 No one knows where it's been except for me.

440
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
 Are you going to tell us?

441
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Well, as I said, the family said that I'm allowed to reveal now that it's being sold where it is.

442
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 That is up until about three hours before we started recording, and they actually changed their mind.

443
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 I can't believe it.

444
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 I can't believe I'm having to do this to you guys.

445
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Give me a breath.

446
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 That is ridiculous.

447
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
 Yeah.

448
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Okay.

449
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
 It's so the mystery, unfortunately, is going to have to remain because it's not my story to tell.

450
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 But it's quite fun having such a fun until the last 30 seconds.

451
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 How do you know where it is?

452
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 I was at a dinner party one night in London.

453
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,000
 And someone who was at the dinner table accidentally drunkenly slipped.

454
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
 That's it was in their possession.

455
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 And so it's someone who eats and drinks.

456
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
 It's been to London.

457
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 So he's dangerous telling James my little details.

458
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
 Hey, who does, who does dad know?

459
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
 Let's go through everything.

460
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,000
 Dad knows everyone.

461
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,000
 Hey, can I just quickly add by the way that just because I met the person in London,

462
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,000
 that doesn't mean that that's where the masquerade hair has been this whole time.

463
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
 I don't want to give any false leads.

464
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
 The only thing I will say is that everyone thought that it was in the Middle East.

465
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
 And that is not the case.

466
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 So either one of the reasons we wanted to talk about this today

467
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
 is because you've just done a documentary about scavenger hunts, right?

468
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 I have, yes.

469
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
 Is that the one about the University of Chicago one?

470
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
 Because that's the critical.

471
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 It is. It's the you Chicago one.

472
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
 This is the one where they have unbelievable things that you have to find.

473
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 Yes.

474
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
 And it's interesting in that it's not exactly all a traditional scavenger hunts.

475
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 So it's not just finding things.

476
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 There's quite a lot of making things as well.

477
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:35,000
 I think the most famous story from it is that one year one of the items was a nuclear reactor.

478
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 And how did that go?

479
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,000
 Well, one team made one, one team made a breeder reactor.

480
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
 It was the North Korean team.

481
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
 Yeah, exactly.

482
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
 No, it was, it was in 1999.

483
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
 And one of the items, basically as a joke, was a nuclear reactor.

484
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
 And a team built a breeder reactor.

485
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:05,000
 And it was very, to my understanding, it was very low.

486
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,000
 There was not any significant radiation that it produced.

487
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
 But there's like a very famous picture of the two students who built it.

488
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,000
 And they're in, you know, like hazmat suits, standing outside the reactor.

489
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
 Wow.

490
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
 And then they didn't win.

491
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
 They didn't win that year.

492
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
 Oh, no.

493
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
 Really?

494
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
 They put, they put, they put all of their time into this one item.

495
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
 And I think they ended up, I think it was third or something that they ended up there.

496
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
 Are you allowed to just build a nuclear reactor?

497
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
 No, I don't think so.

498
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
 Okay.

499
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
 Would you guys know about Fenn's gold?

500
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
 This another, you know, famous real-life treasure hunt?

501
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
 So this is one that still hasn't been found.

502
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
 It's a guy named Forest Fenn.

503
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,000
 And he has hidden supposedly at least $2 million worth of,

504
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
 I believe it's mostly jewels.

505
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,000
 A chest with $2 million worth of, I believe it is mostly jewels.

506
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:11,000
 Somewhere in, like, I think it's generally like the area in the Rockies.

507
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
 Like it's, it's quite a large area.

508
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
 People aren't entirely sure.

509
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,000
 But he left a 24-line cryptic poem, which is the key to unlocking it.

510
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:32,000
 And this has been around for, I believe, I believe it's in 2010 that he put this out.

511
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,000
 And so it's been 15 years into my knowledge no one yet has found the treasure.

512
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
 Or though I suppose maybe someone has and they just haven't told anybody.

513
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 Well, that's the big question.

514
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
 Oh, I reckon if you found that you would tell everyone, right?

515
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
 Wait, you tell Dana aparty at least.

516
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
 Yeah, I know where it is.

517
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
 Have a drink in the evening with the owner.

518
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
 Hey, Dan, come on, actually tell us where it is now.

519
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
 Yeah.

520
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
 You get to tell us?

521
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 No way, I've promised.

522
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
 Can you tell us and then bleep it out of the episode?

523
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
 See, that's the issue is that I, I can't start telling everyone.

524
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,000
 Like, you're telling Adam Chase, he's going to pass it on to Nigel Sylvester.

525
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
 Suddenly everyone's going to hear it.

526
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
 And I will tell Nigel.

527
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
 You're crazy?

528
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
 Is it someone that we would know as well?

529
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
 No.

530
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
 Is it like Mr. Smith or is it like?

531
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
 Who's Mr. Smith?

532
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
 Like, it's like a person that we don't know.

533
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
 It's not like it's like, I don't know.

534
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 Like the rock.

535
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
 It's not.

536
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,000
 You know, it is the rock.

537
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
 You got it.

538
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
 Shoot.

539
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
 You look at it.

540
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
 I'm so sorry.

541
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
 The rock had it.

542
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
 Here's an interesting fact.

543
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
 At the time it was buried, the only other major person who knew about it because they

544
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
 went there to help them bury it is someone completely unexpected.

545
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
 I read this because I had to read it again as I wasn't read that wrong.

546
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
 Bamber a gas coin.

547
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
 Yeah.

548
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
 Was the only other person.

549
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,440
 But the public, the publisher's got to pick who was like the impartialist over and they

550
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,440
 chose Bamber a gas.

551
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,440
 So you know Adam.

552
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,440
 But just for the people at home.

553
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,440
 Yeah.

554
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,440
 I know.

555
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:56,440
 Who I'm done.

556
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,440
 Who's Bamber a gas?

557
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,800
 Well, he was, he was the, he was a TB personality and a quiz host.

558
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,440
 He was the host of university challenge for many years.

559
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,800
 Which is like universities doing very difficult quizzes against each other.

560
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,800
 I'm familiar.

561
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,280
 I'm familiar with university challenge.

562
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:21,080
 But I think I perhaps did not watch far back enough to be familiar with this gentleman.

563
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,680
 I have a feeling you might not have been born when Bamber a gas coin was doing it.

564
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,680
 Yeah.

565
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
 I think that's right.

566
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,240
 There's a wonderful detail, which is when Bamber a gas going went with kit Williams to

567
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:36,560
 bury it, they took such care to make sure that no one could find where it was buried.

568
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,160
 So once they had put it into the ground, they did basic things to make it look as if the

569
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,320
 earth hadn't been touched.

570
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:49,800
 The last thing that they did was to drop some cow pat over the exact spot and kit Williams

571
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,800
 was going to do it.

572
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,280
 But Bamber a gas coin said, no, I should be the person to do it because I happen to know

573
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,000
 the average exact height of a cow's anus and therefore held it at the height and dropped

574
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,280
 it to give it the realism, the accuracy of the splash.

575
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,080
 How did he know that because that question had come up on university challenge the week

576
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,080
 out?

577
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,080
 I assume so.

578
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:15,080
 Yeah.

579
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,080
 Exactly.

580
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:23,680
 I do have to very quickly circle back to our joke that the rock had the hair because I

581
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,480
 do just have to say that there's no way that it could be him because he famously is horrible

582
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,400
 at keeping big secrets.

583
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,280
 I don't know if you guys recall when he announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed like

584
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,640
 15 minutes before Obama did.

585
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:39,640
 Wow.

586
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:44,720
 Did Obama call him and say, hey, Duane, just so you know, we've got a big announcement coming

587
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
 up.

588
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
 But I wanted you to know first.

589
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
 We got it.

590
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,600
 I think he's never revealed exactly how he knew this, but it was some friend or friend

591
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:58,240
 of a friend who was like in the military who told him this and that Obama was going to announce

592
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
 it very shortly.

593
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,760
 And so Duane Johnson waited, you know, like 15 minutes or whatever and then tweeted out.

594
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,440
 Have you never seen that he tweeted out, just got word that will shock the world, land

595
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,680
 of the free home of the brave, damn proud to be an American.

596
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:18,760
 He tweets this out 45 minutes before Obama goes on to announce that Osama bin Laden has

597
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,760
 been killed and Duane Johnson and his telling is like only learns after he has tweeted it.

598
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,760
 It's like, oh, Obama has not announced it yet.

599
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,000
 And then so the news was obliquely, but was broken by Duane Johnson 45 minutes ago.

600
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,640
 That's like the American version of when prove leaf accidentally gave out the winner of

601
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,920
 Great British Bake Off, right, which was equally seismic and British.

602
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:43,920
 Wait.

603
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
 Did that happen?

604
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
 Yeah.

605
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,920
 One of the judges tweeted.

606
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
 It was a big scandal over here.

607
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:48,920
 Oh, no.

608
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,000
 The British Bake Off is a brilliant show.

609
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,640
 I think it's called the Great British Baking Show in the States.

610
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,240
 Oh, I'm familiar with the Great British Bake Off.

611
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,840
 You guys, this whole podcast, you keep naming a popular British show and you go, oh, Adam,

612
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,040
 let me explain the show to you.

613
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,840
 I know your shows.

614
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,280
 Adam Chase does UK pop culture.

615
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,840
 This is the spin-off.

616
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
 No.

617
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,840
 I have had one final thought to add here, which is that.

618
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:23,520
 Imagine if I do one day, you know, pass away suddenly and no one knows where this hair is,

619
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,400
 I should let one person know.

620
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,320
 So I tell you what I'm going to do to end this show on.

621
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:33,640
 I am going to message on WhatsApp right now, live, James Harkin.

622
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,640
 And Adam?

623
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,640
 No, he doesn't trust me.

624
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,640
 Where's my phone?

625
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,640
 I have to keep.

626
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
 I have to keep it.

627
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,600
 And James, you have to promise never to tell anyone this.

628
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:50,680
 I don't know where my phone is, dad.

629
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
 I was sitting on it.

630
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
 He was sitting on it.

631
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:53,680
 Okay.

632
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,240
 Here we go, just for a live reaction.

633
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,640
 James, you swear you will not tell anyone this.

634
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,320
 I swear on Dwayne Johnson's hair that I will not tell anyone.

635
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,000
 I'm breaching major, major promises here.

636
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
 So here we go.

637
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,080
 I'm sending it to James right now.

638
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,080
 This is so exciting.

639
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,600
 My heart says, you and I are going to find the fans gold and we're not telling those guys.

640
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
 We'll split it.

641
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
 Oh.

642
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,600
 Oh.

643
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,600
 Very interesting.

644
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,040
 Well, what am I supposed to do?

645
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
 I can't say.

646
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,360
 You now, you now suffer the same pain that I have, the curse of knowledge.

647
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:32,600
 And I have to tell you, I think that what Dan just texted James was, say, "Ooh, interesting."

648
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,320
 I don't think he told him anything at all.

649
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,640
 I think he just said, "Have a good reaction to this text."

650
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,160
 Adam, I am so annoyed that that's not what I did.

651
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,600
 I'm so annoyed that I genuinely said who it was.

652
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,080
 What an idiot.

653
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,360
 That's a magicians trick.

654
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,040
 I should have, I've seen.

655
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,200
 Now you see me.

656
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,200
 20 times.

657
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,760
 You think I'd learn a simple lesson?

658
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:53,760
 Yeah.

659
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,760
 Alright.

660
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:00,440
 Alright, look, we need to wrap up.

661
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,600
 Okay, that is it.

662
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,120
 That is all of our facts.

663
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,680
 Thank you so much for listening.

664
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,760
 If anyone would like to get in contact with any of us about the things that we've said

665
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,840
 over the course of this show, well, some things that we've said over the course of this show,

666
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,240
 you can get us online on various places.

667
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,640
 I'm on Instagram, on @Streiberland, James.

668
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,320
 My Instagram is no such thing as James Harkin.

669
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
 And?

670
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,320
 My Instagram is @AnMillerBooks.

671
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,160
 Adam, where do you hang out online?

672
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,320
 Yeah, you follow me on Instagram.

673
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,320
 We're doing Instagram.

674
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,800
 It's Adam H. Chase.

675
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,200
 And Adam, where can we catch Jetlag if we want to add your documentary?

676
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:38,480
 Well, Jetlag is on YouTube.

677
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,840
 Jetlag, the game is the channel.

678
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,400
 Or if you want to watch it one week early and add free, then you, of course, could do that

679
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,400
 on Nebula and scab the documentary about the University of Chicago scavenger.

680
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,840
 That is a Nebula exclusive.

681
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,440
 The first episode is on YouTube.

682
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,280
 If you want to check it out and see if you like it, but then the rest of it is only on

683
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,280
 Nebula.

684
00:53:58,280 --> 00:53:59,280
 Great.

685
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,240
 And if you want to get to us as a group podcast at qi.com, you can send us any facts that

686
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,320
 you want to let us know about it.

687
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,640
 You can send us any corrections to things that we've said wrong, whatever you want.

688
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
 And he gets all these emails.

689
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,640
 He goes through the inbox and he cherry picks out the best and they make their way to drop

690
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,720
 us a line, which is our bonus show where we discuss all the behind-the-scenes stuff that

691
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,000
 happens on fish.

692
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,640
 If you want to listen to that, you've just got to join Club Fish.

693
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,920
 That's our super secret members club.

694
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,320
 You can get to that by going to patreon.com/nosuchthingasafish.

695
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,120
 There's quite a few tears there, so check them all out.

696
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,560
 You can also tune into our new show Little Fish every Monday.

697
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,040
 That's where we read out the best of your facts.

698
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,720
 So again, podcast at qi.com, send all your stuff there, and hopefully some of it will make

699
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,880
 it to our shows.

700
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,240
 Otherwise, just come back next week because we will be back with another episode and we

701
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,240
 will see you then.

702
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:47,760
 Goodbye.
