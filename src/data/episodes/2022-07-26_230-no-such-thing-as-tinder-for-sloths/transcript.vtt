00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 this week coming to you from the wilderness festival!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 [Cheering]

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.800
 Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.320
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.160
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with our first

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.560
 fact, this week that's my fact. My fact is, according to a new scientific

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.440
 study, the best way to perform CPR is to do it while humming

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.920
 the Macarena. How cool is that? And I think they recommend humming it because

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.480
 they probably don't believe if you're trying to save someone life and you're

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.400
 going "hamadamba temadamba temamakarena, you're the right person to be doing it."

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.800
 Are they even chalyrics? Are you just dead then?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 Does anyone know the actual lyrics? I think everyone knows the word macarena

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.920
 and know what the word in that song is. Yeah, exactly. But it's what it is about

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.080
 this song is that it has a BPM so every song has a B per minute and this BPM

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.880
 is 103 and as a result, when they're trying to teach people the perfect

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.320
 counts that you need on a chest as you're trying to save someone's life,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.760
 the macarena happens to be the perfect amount. And before that, they used to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.440
 think it was staying alive by the beaches. That's right.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 Because that's about 103 or 104 as well. Yeah. But actually also maybe it's

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.640
 supposed to be about 100 is the best, right? But macarena is good because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.280
 everyone kind of knows the beat of that so it's good to do. But I thought I'd

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.560
 look at some others that are 100 beats per minute. So if anyone's having a

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.120
 heart attack, you should try these ones. Crazy and loved by BeyoncÃ©.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.640
 Yeah. Independent women by Destiny's Child.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 Any of these work. Hips don't lie by Shakira. That's my favourite.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
 Or my chemical romance dead. Yeah. Not a good one.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.680
 That's not a good one. I've found a few more. So Simon and Garfunkel bridge over

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920
 Troubled Water. If it's just a nice mood, you want to chill everyone out with that?

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.320
 Sometimes the situation doesn't need something fun.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.880
 Okay. Sometimes poignancy is needed.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.080
 Well, the way they sing that on the X Factor, which is the slowest song in the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.560
 history of time. Oh, okay. Well, how about this one?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.360
 It doesn't have any beat. It doesn't have any beat. You just, you'd pause on

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.480
 Lacka Bridge. That is how you do slow.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.500
 It gets to the next. It's a good way of multitasking and fair sharing. So Macarena is by lost Del Rio. Yes

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.960
 Okay, and this is very much a one-hit wonder isn't it? They never had any other hits. Oh James

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.820
 I have got at least one of the other hits right here on my paper. What? It's Macarena Christmas

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.760
 It's released about 18 months after Macarena and it is a kiddie not the worst song ever released

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.520
 It's a it's a medley of jingle bells joined to the world rude off the Red Nose reindeer and the Macarena

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.020
 Wow, and they just break off and they do a bit of Macarena

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.900
 I'm at least I think five or six albums. One of them was Macarena non-stop

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.600
 Which the compilation album it only has eight tracks and five of them at the Macarena

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.380
 But you know what's amazing about lost Del Rio this band they got together in

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.400
 1964 I believe it was 62 or 64 the same year that the Rolling Stones got together

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.080
 Okay, they had their hit 32 years into their career

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.480
 That was finally they were like should we give up I'm sure we're gonna hit it one day mates

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.000
 Let's do it and they did and then they must have thought wow

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.640
 We've made it and that was the end of their career. Yeah

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.280
 That's still going that's still performing. But are they I when I'm researching this I read an article from

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.880
 1999 the headline of which was does anyone remember the Macarena? I mean, and that's what was that what a stupid article

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.200
 Everyone remembers the Macarena I watched a video you know you come see these on YouTube where they show teenagers stuff from the 90s

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.560
 Or whatever and see if they know what it is. Yeah, every single one of them knew what the Macarena was

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.560
 Yeah, no one knew the band, but they all knew the song. Yeah, and in 2003 so that's 10 years after the record was released

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.360
 They were still making a quarter of a million dollars a year royalties. Wow

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.560
 And it's extraordinary the original Macarena dance there was an original this that was the second dance

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.600
 It was when they made the video when there was a remix done of the song the first one was an incredibly complicated flamingo dance

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.200
 That was done in clubs. You would have to be an expert in order to do it

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.480
 It had doubled the amount of moves that the original

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.160
 Verse had was invented by a don't like a random aerobic teacher or dance teacher or something. Yeah, me a fire

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, or me a fry. She was in the video clip and so she wanted something that kids could dance to and adults

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.480
 Who have to go to nightclubs, but don't know how to dance could dance to so the four of us bow to her

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.880
 You've saved us actually Macarena. It's about a woman called Macarena

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.420
 But the name Macarena was originally Mac Delayna and it was just a word for like a sensuous woman and it comes from Mary Mac Delayna

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.440
 Then it was a word for any kind of prostitute and then it was a word for a sensuous woman, right?

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.680
 So really it should be hey Mac Delayna hey prostitute

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:55.480
 Well, and it's about a woman who prostitute in the song the lyrics are actually the woman saying

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.760
 Don't worry about my boyfriend. He's gone off to fight

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.240
 You two are his best mates. Do you want to shag and said is that Macarena?

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.680
 It's not a good message to be sending 12 year olds at this goes no

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.000
 This is this is just a little nugget. I enjoyed it went to number one in France

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.920
 It went to number one in a number of countries, but not in the UK not in the UK

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.440
 because because it was the world by

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.120
 TLC no one to be by the spice girls. No

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.680
 Wow, that's bad look wasn't it because it's like the biggest song of all time

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.080
 But yeah, I'm up against there was a big there was a big gospel around the room at that 20-year-old chopped news. Yeah

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.640
 Hey guys and blood be to aces to number one as well

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.680
 How do you think they were probably sad but quietly confident going? It's all right

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.760
 We've got Macarena Christmas in the bag. We'll be

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.600
 We'll be back and then to become one came out they have

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.960
 So in France they went to number one. Do you know what song they knocked off the number one?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.280
 Oh, it's a French song. No, no, it's gonna regret re-en the only French time anyone knows

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.760
 It was the theme tune to the ex files. Oh, yeah

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.480
 That was number one that was number one in France. I think that was the one that you oh it did well in the UK

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.760
 Isn't that tubular bells Mike feel Mike old field did a cover of it later. How weird is that?

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.640
 You're thinking the exorcist. Yeah. Yeah. Should we talk about CPR?

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.640
 Yes

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:35.400
 If you have a problem with CPR as in so a lot of people are quite light and it's you need a lot of pressure to get

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.760
 Someone's just deep enough to get the blood flowing while you wait for the ambulance

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:45.040
 So if you are like a tip is to jump on the person who you're trying to administer you could actually be doing the macarena

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.800
 Well, kind of yes you could

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.240
 Wow, sorry. I say tip and I like there's no medical advice on this stage. I think I was better say yes

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.920
 Don't use this tip. There is a doctor though who does recommend using the feet

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.960
 I think people have said especially if you're a bit older

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.520
 You've lost some of your muscle strength and but also advice now or advice releasing 2010

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:10.000
 It's always changing is don't do the breathing anymore none of the snogging you just do the hands to the heart

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.240
 Don't you just do the heart. So you're doing a bit there isn't so much fun. Yeah, exactly just the jumping up and down

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.400
 The mouth to mouth one is really weird because it kind of was discovered in the 18th century

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.080
 And then it just got forgotten about for about 50 to 100 years and basically no one did it at all

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.560
 And then it came back and the reason they stopped it is because they realized what was coming out of your mouth when you breathe

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:36.640
 And it's carbon dioxide and they were saying well, what's the point of breathing carbon dioxide into someone's lungs because they breathe oxygen

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.040
 Yeah, and you know what the answer is to know why that's not true

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:47.360
 No, it's because when you breathe in and breathe out you actually only absorb about 40% of the oxygen sort of still plenty of oxygen in your breath

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.800
 Any kind of oxygen is better than okay, so how long if we started it?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.840
 So if someone breathed in at the edge of the room here and then they passed the breath around the room

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:06.120
 How long would it be before there was no point in that exercise? I think it's worth a try, isn't it? All right. I feel an experiment coming up. Okay. I think we should start with that topless guy. You're in that old

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.440
 But people that tried all sorts of weird CPR over the ages

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:16.480
 They used to be the barrel type where you there was a big round barrel and you were sort of strapped to it

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:23.120
 Face down with your stomach over the barrel and I don't know how you did this so quickly when someone's obviously dying of a heart attack in front of you

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.200
 And then as the person who's saving them you sort of stood in between their legs and you roll them

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.920
 On and off the barrel, don't you? And it was the idea was that it eventually forced your heart into going in really?

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.480
 Yeah, yeah, it's like one of those did you ever go to playgrounds where you would run on a barrel that span round and round

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.800
 Yeah, but I've seen cartoons where that helped. Right

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.080
 That will that's medical advice from the Victorian age

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:50.120
 Hey, we need to move on to our next fact shortly. Oh, can I just there was so you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth and CPR to animals

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.600
 Weirdly successfully. Yeah, I've no

00:09:54.120 --> 00:10:01.460
 Yeah, you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth to animals. Weirdly successful. There was a guy this you're gonna talk about the guy this year with the

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.960
 Frog there's a guy this year who did it with a frog after the frog happening here. Oh, is this your fact? No, it's not mine

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.520
 Actually mine was the one I was gonna say down. Let's do your effect. You do the frog thing. Let's

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:22.320
 No, this was a this was a deer and it was a deer who was drowning in a swimming pool and an RSP-ZA officer was called and he got the deer out of the pool

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.040
 And he gave it chest compressions and see CPR and mouth to mouth. Give it the kiss of life until it choked

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.960
 He said it properly like in films coughed water into his mouth

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.080
 And then and then he started choking it then had to give him CPR

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.280
 Where does the frog come into this? Yeah

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:45.360
 And you know the deer got up he brushed it down and then he said the deer looked at him and then ran away

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:51.840
 Sweet, yeah, it's a good story, I know, but I just wonder has anything happened with any smaller maybe amphibious?

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.300
 No, it hasn't I think we're moving on interestingly a frog

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:02.000
 This is a great story. There was a I can't wait this guy was walking just

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.480
 Minding his own business when he came across a snake on the ground and the snake was choking

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.920
 And he thought I'm not gonna give CPR to a snake. How could you tell a snake is choking? It was sort of like doing that

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.480
 Okay, yeah, yeah, and suddenly out of its mouth shoots a frog

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.640
 So it swallowed the frog, but the the frog forced its way back out

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:25.200
 Okay, but in the process died the man saw the frog and he gave CPR to the frog and he brought it back to life

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.560
 Yeah, and he brought the rope home. What happens to this snake?

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.200
 He doesn't feature in the rest of the story

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:44.800
 All right, look we need to be about to our next fact it is time for fact number two and that is Chazinsky

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:51.640
 My fact this week is that Donald Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal for himself when he wrote the art of the deal

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:59.940
 This is because a so Tony Schwartz was a guy who ghost wrote the art of the deal with Trump and he gave a talk a while back

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.200
 And he openly said Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal with me. I got a great deal out of it

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:11.520
 He didn't unheard of things so there was an advance of half a million dollars for the art of the deal and Trump gave his

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:15.840
 Ghostwriter 50% of the advance and then 50% of all the royalties

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.360
 So this guy has just been making millions and millions from this book

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:23.640
 This is unheard of in publishing. I think someone who a negotiating professor

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:29.480
 Called Deepak Malhotra said there is not a better deal out there in the world for ghost writing

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:36.080
 And then when the book came out Trump hosted an absolutely massive party then he and Trump tower

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.280
 I think it was there was a big red carpet loads of celebrities came

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.560
 There was a giant cake replica of Trump tower and then he went to his ghost writer and he went well

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.640
 You owe me 50% for the price of this party and the ghost writer went, I don't think so

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:54.320
 And he ended up paying about a thousand pounds just fed the drinks that him and his friends

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:58.440
 Do you know what the inspiration for the book was for the book the art of the deal?

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.260
 No, there was an article all about Trump in GQ and it was a popular article as in that issue of GQ

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.260
 So well because Trump was on the front cover. He was a businessman at the time and then they thought

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.060
 Why don't we see if we can turn this into a book?

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:15.980
 So they tested out what the book would look like they designed a dummy cover and then it had a picture of him

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:20.820
 looking heroic on the front and then they wrapped it around a thick Russian novel and thought what it would look like a

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.380
 thick Russian novel

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:32.800
 Guys the clues were there from the stars. Wow. No, okay. All right. Oh, we go

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:38.520
 What's exciting is you've all heard something that won't be in the actual show and we release it so that's

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:45.420
 He has a bad record of deal-making though, right? He's this was actually an article by Jonathan Frieden

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:52.080
 I think in the Guardian pointed out his deal-making history, but so the apprentice first series extremely successful

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.920
 So he asked for an increase in what he was paid. I think it's per episode. He got 50 grand

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.680
 He asked for an increase to one million dollars

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:05.600
 That's good deal-making, isn't it? That sounds like a deal-making. He ended up with 60 grand

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:12.840
 But no, a lot of people say not a good deal-maker someone else who's done a deal with him said he seems way too keen

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.520
 You've got to seem cool. He sort of paces around the room like he's wearing a sign saying desperate and who said that Vladimir

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520
 What was he called?

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.520
 He chose to remain anonymous

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.800
 Do you know he he released a novel years ago? Yeah called Trump Tower and and then he

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.280
 Effectively unreleased it in that the novel still exists, but he took his name off

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.080
 So it was ghost-ridden by someone else and he had his name though

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:44.080
 It was a Donald Trump book. It was called Trump Tower and it was a it was a book based on an idea for a TV show that he developed

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:49.360
 Which was meant to be Trump Tower done like the TV show Dallas or all those American soaps

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.400
 It was the life of all the people that worked in Trump Tower and they got a pilot

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.560
 But the pilot didn't get made so they ended up doing this book and on the front

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.560
 It said it was the sexiest novel of the decade. Wow. Which decade?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:08.280
 It was 2011 was it was it was old 2011. It's a current. It's he's he's predicted

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:16.080
 We still cannot top the sexiness of this book. Wow. It was an erotic novel, wasn't it? Yeah, that's novel and so I was reading some snippets of it

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.140
 It is this is how erotic it is

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:26.500
 So someone walks into a room a guest in Trump Tower and sees at least six women not wearing tops and says I must be dead

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500
 I've gone to boob heaven

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.900
 That's an actual line in an actual novel

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:37.060
 He's just very quickly. He's also really good for books Donald Trump because anytime he tweets about a book

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.540
 That he doesn't like it does really well

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.620
 So for example fire and fury became massive off the back of him taking it down

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:48.980
 Yeah, and there was a very famous. He's a civil rights icon in America called John Lewis and he wrote a number of books

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:54.500
 And he wrote a tweet saying I don't think he's fit for president and Trump took him down massively as a result

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.820
 The sales increase of his books were over a hundred thousand percent

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:06.340
 And in the weekend of the tweet seven of the top 20 books were attributed to John Lewis all his books just rose to the top

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.100
 Wow, he's actually good for book sales if he hates you

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.060
 The John Lewis Brown is very different in America, isn't it?

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:19.020
 Yes, yeah, I've got a couple of bad deals from history. Okay, I've researched so the fact being that

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.100
 Trump negotiated a bad deal for the order of the deal. I thought this was quite fun

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.980
 There's a in America the NFL. There's a team the Green Bay Packers and they had a player called Mirror

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.060
 MIRER

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:34.180
 Yeah, I never heard of it. Okay. He was he was a big deal back in the day and his contract

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:41.740
 He was so wanted by this team that his agent put a clause in the contract that they eventually the team had to sign and the clause was

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:49.740
 That my mirror would be paid under all conditions, and then this is the clause up to and including the end of the world

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.180
 Including the end of the world

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:56.740
 So if some people survived and he was one of them and they were one of them

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.300
 They would still pay him for all the apocalyptic future that they lived through

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.300
 They were the last two people other

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:13.820
 I've got a bad deal. Oh, yeah, so there's a famous story about the Dutch buying Manhattan Island from the Native Americans for a very small amount of money and

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.780
 Them's thinking oh these Native Americans they don't understand the value of property

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:24.900
 They don't stand the contact of property rights. They absolutely did the problem was the Dutch bought Manhattan from the Canasi Native Americans

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:30.460
 Who happened to live next door in Long Island and did not live in Manhattan?

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.340
 They only use the island of Manhattan to get drunk in

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.860
 The Dutch showed up and they offered to buy the place on these people saying is this your place? Oh great. We'll buy this for it

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.900
 So it's like going to a pub and offering a random man standing outside the pub quite drunk

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.340
 100,000 pounds for this building. I got another sporty one

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.820
 This is a there's a Swedish soccer player called Stefan Schwartz. Do you remember him James?

00:17:51.820 --> 00:18:00.620
 So he was paid a four million pound deal with Sunderland for the English Premier League the condition that he had to sign when he was signing

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:04.380
 Which for him was a bad deal is he was not allowed to go to space

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.540
 That was the oh

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:09.740
 Yeah, he wanted to be a space Taurus. He was obsessed with going to space

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.580
 They were like he's obsessed so much. We just have to say no you've got to play football. Yeah, we're gonna

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.940
 Put that in the contract to me. That's a deal breaker - is it right?

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:26.420
 We need to move on to our next facts. We do that. Okay. It is time for fact number three and that is Andy

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:32.660
 My fact is that on the bio tapestry you can tell how important someone is by the size of their horse's penis

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:39.300
 Um, so there's a professor at the University of Oxford. He's called George Garnett

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.620
 He has gone through the bio tapestry the whole thing rigorously counting the horses and their penises

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.820
 And the human there are the same number of penises as

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:54.700
 Well, it might be some female horses. There are some female horses. I've got they didn't have penises. Yeah

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.860
 I think they all work for full you

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.780
 Um, I think they're written out. I think they might be hidden by a leg or yeah

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.900
 Sometimes someone standing in front of the horse or a musically holding a vase in front of the horse

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.620
 Yeah, or the horse is wearing a pair of novelty trousers

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:16.300
 Or it's a pantomime horse and they famously don't have penis. Well, they have two some of them

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.060
 Oh, my horses. Very good point. Um, so he counted all of these and he points out that

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.860
 King Harold

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:28.820
 Who came second in the Battle of Hastings? He has a horse which has a very large penis

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:33.500
 But there's one larger horse penis and that belongs to William the Conqueror

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.820
 So it's a it's a clear the the man who wins the battle has the largest horse's penis

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.900
 Wow, and this is new right this is a brother. No, no Tubby 66

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:50.180
 This is this is new. This is new research. This is breaking. This is to lot of people in the room

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.020
 This is like this is like the Spice Girls and the Macarena all over again. Yeah

00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.100
 Yeah, so this is very exciting previously neglected research he counted all the human ones as well

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.420
 He did sorry. There are four and a half would you say?

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:14.600
 But I think what happened was a lot of people have kind of paid attention to this in the past because in Victorian times

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.600
 They were all edited out

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:22.700
 Yeah, and there is one guy who had a pair of underpants drawn on him or tapestry on him by the Victorians

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:26.880
 That was in the in the English one, right? There's an English wrap. Yeah, sorry in the replica

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.940
 Yeah, exactly, but this is the first time people have looked at all of them including the horse ones

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:36.080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I can believe the so I don't actually know much about the Bay of Tapestry

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.900
 Not being English myself, so this yeah, and it's a frequent topic of conversation in English hubs of children

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:45.620
 I am so lost at dinner parties every time it comes up. I walk around the festival site here

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.620
 You'll find tools 300 people talking about the buyers

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:51.180
 Actually, it gets a bit boring sometimes, you know

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:58.020
 But I so I literally had no knowledge of it all so it's fascinating to know that this thing was a it was

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.580
 68 70 meters long. Yep, which is incredibly long if you put that into context

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:10.160
 That's about 30 meters less than 100. No, it's like that would take you saying both roughly seven seconds to run

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.820
 Yeah, the fastest man running at the Bayer tapestry

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:19.580
 The the thing is as well as that a turns out it's not a tapestry at all. No, it's embroidery

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:21.860
 So it's got the wrong name

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:29.580
 But also if you read the whole thing up until recently when they when they decided to fix this the final scene is missing

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:36.340
 Imagine reading 70 meters of story and getting to the final scene and someone's ripped the page out as in the

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.240
 Williams coronation isn't it? Yeah, yeah, and they added it so they finished was it 2013?

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.880
 I think yeah, and they did it on an on an island on a channel island

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.100
 There was over a hundred four hundred people that did it and one of the stitches was done by Prince Charles

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:56.080
 So despite the fact it lives over in France made using British royalty

00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:04.260
 And a lot of people think it was made in Britain anyway in Kent and a lot of people think it was made completely by women because of the

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:10.140
 Penises in fact, so historians think that there are there is the occasional erect penis on a dead soldier

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:18.660
 And the theory is that the tapestry or embroidery was therefore stitched by women and the women were ridiculing the men for the fact that they used

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:23.980
 War to show off their manhood, so it was thought to be kind of a satirical thing when we're saying you idiots

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.140
 So the people used to fight with no trousers. Yeah, really. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:36.580
 No, there was a battle wasn't there were the English had terrible dysentery of the area of the trousers

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:40.780
 That was Henry the fifth so it was about as you call it was about a magical

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.860
 Yeah, but so why are they naked people in there if people were trousers the naked people are mostly in the margins

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.900
 Yes, so there's the main bit there's the main strip of the biotapestry

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.420
 Yeah, I think the main story of the battle and then at the top and the bottom there are these margins

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.220
 This is an amazing thing where they're I love the embroidery because you when you see old art you assume

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:03.380
 Oh, it must be done perfect, you know the perspective and everything and there's a couple of moments in the tapestry where they've run out of space

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:10.820
 So there's a there's four people holding a chest on on four sticks or two sticks rather four of them and

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.540
 There's three of them that are nicely done, but they went a bit too high on the tapestry. So the fourth guy's head

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:22.460
 Just making a quick cameo into the tapestry when really it should have been gone

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.420
 My favorite part the biotapestry is the bit where Odo Earl of Kent is

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:33.660
 Whispering to William telling him what to do in the battle and it kind of makes him look like he's really the important person

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.660
 He was the architects of the whole invasion

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:43.420
 But it turns out that it seems like it was him who commissioned the tapestry. I gave himself a massive role in that although and he was

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:48.700
 Quite interesting wasn't he because he was never seen with spears or anything in the tapestry because he was a bishop

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.940
 And bishop's one allowed a shed blood. So instead he's always seen with a massive club

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.420
 So they're allowed to beat people around the head which apparently didn't draw any blood

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.180
 Yeah, have you seen the reviews of the biotapestry?

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.980
 They're great. They're well trip advisor reviews everything in the world

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:13.740
 And as with all things the most funny reviews are the one star ones. So there is a complaint actor. There is actually one star. Isn't the Haley's comic?

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:19.340
 Anyway, I feel like you're going to say something funny. Yeah, well, you know

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.300
 Thunder stolen

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.540
 No, so the reviews are things like so one review says we went on a visit to the biotapestry

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.700
 Big learning curve for some people

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.980
 We were walking along looking at the tapestry not much to see to be honest

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.580
 All of a sudden I see a large phallic object sewn on the tapestry

00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.940
 This attraction is not displayed as containing adult content

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.860
 We have very young children who can see the penis which is an outrage

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.180
 I wanted to learn about medieval battles not medieval penises

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:54.380
 That's one star one star and there's another one star review which just says 9 quid and 40 minutes to see a carpet

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:03.420
 9 quid in seven seconds for who say molasses. It was very blurry

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:12.060
 I like the little touches in the tapestry because people used to add kind of slide digs at people or what they thought of certain figures in it

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:19.340
 So there's one there's one really nice but actually we're herald when herald first went over to see willing the concurrent front

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.780
 Him and his men then got in boats to go back across the channel to Britain

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:28.300
 And there's such a good picture of him and all his men holding up their kind of hose

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.980
 And all their stockings and everything and they've taken their shoes off. They're carrying their shoes

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.780
 And they're carrying their pets and stuff in their arms because they're waiting through the water to get to their boats

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:42.140
 And it's just it's just exactly like you know when you wrote a beach and you sort of wonder what that's

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:48.540
 They brought pets with them one person had a dog under his arm and another person was holding a bird which seems that necessary

00:25:52.700 --> 00:26:00.940
 Maybe a helper war dog or a snipper dog or something. Yeah, you know Nigel Farage was his favorite tie is a Bayer tapestry tie

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.220
 Because it reminds him of the last time Britain was invaded how long is it?

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.580
 It's the same way. Yeah, it's an exact replica to scale. Yeah, right. So it's just constantly

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.580
 Dranging behind him. He has some bridesmaids who carried it all the time

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:19.500
 That's interesting because when I was looking at an old old bishop of Bayer who was the guy who commissioned this

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:25.100
 I went on to the BBC website and they said that he was the least popular figure in Kent's history

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:29.660
 But then I looked up other people from Kent who were unpopular and Nigel Farage

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:35.980
 It's from Kent as well as the most unpopular person Nasty Nick from Big Brother One. Oh

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:40.700
 Don't tell these guys. They didn't even know about the Spice Girls chart history yet

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.340
 Nasty Nick will blow their mind

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.260
 We should move on to our final fact shortly anything before we do yeah should go for it

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:54.940
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James. Okay, and my fact this week is that if you're a slough

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:59.660
 Every time you go for a poo, it's more painful than childbirth

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:08.700
 Is that you impersonating child? I was just trying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that more painful than human childbirth?

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:15.500
 I believe it is because actually slough childbirth is not that painful because baby sloths are super small

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.580
 They're about 14 ounces

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.780
 Whereas slough poo's are at least twice as big maybe more

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:27.900
 And they can lose up to one third of their body weight during death. Oh god

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.460
 They do it once a week

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:38.140
 It's the equivalent of if I did a poo there would be too big to check into a Thompson's flight

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:43.660
 I mean what's the purpose of your visit for a start?

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:50.780
 And the stomachs physically shrink every time they do it

00:27:50.780 --> 00:28:00.780
 But how do we have someone laid a woman mid-labor next to a slow mid-poo and what judge the volume of the screaming?

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.540
 I think how do we know you're right? I mean to be honest there's a bit of you know suposition going on here

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:10.540
 But basically it's the size and this is what we've said this before unlike other animals

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.100
 Sloths they only do this once a week

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.180
 They go down from the bottom of their tree

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:19.500
 And they do this and it can take like up to 50 days for the food to go through the system

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.300
 Because they're trying to get every single bit of nutrient out of it

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.540
 And so by the time it comes out, it's absolutely huge. It's just fibrous mass

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.820
 And it obviously must be extremely painful. Yeah

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.820
 And it's super heavy isn't it?

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:36.700
 So um well obviously like a third of their body weight and the problem with being a sloth is that you're upside down

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.180
 Basically all of your life and so your poo's all gone to the bottom waiting to come out

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:46.940
 And then it would the only thing that stops it all from crushing the rest of their organs is that

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.860
 Their bowels and everything like that literally hooks onto their ribcage

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:56.620
 Yeah, or onto the sides of their body because otherwise you know if it was loose hanging like ours are as soon as the sloth turns upside down

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.060
 This enormous weight of feces would crash all of the rest of its organs

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.140
 So all of its organs are kind of yeah hooked on

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.420
 It's amazing and then it goes down to the bottom of the tree does it's business and goes back up again

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.660
 And traveling back up must feel amazing, wasn't it?

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:10.700
 Oh yeah

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.100
 They do a little dance before they have a poo every time as well

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.860
 And that's unusual for sloths is it?

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:17.340
 Yes

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:21.100
 Why do they have to dig a little hole in the ground?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.700
 And it must the jiggly must help, wasn't it?

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.220
 I'm sure it does yeah yeah

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.900
 And the thing is the reason one of the reasons we think that they do this just once a week

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.700
 Is because it's extremely dangerous for them to go to the toilet

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.420
 Because they're nice and safe in their little tree

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.500
 No one can see them the really well camouflaged

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.260
 They're really slow no one can see them move

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.100
 But of course when they go down to do this they're really kind of vulnerable

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:47.340
 And apparently more than half of sloth fatalities occur when they are doing their business

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:52.860
 Well that's the thing so their main predators are both I think tigers and eagles

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:53.100
 Yeah

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.900
 What a bad luck right?

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.860
 Like imagine that being your predator

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:03.100
 You've got two predators as I, oh so it's like a type of ant and a sausage dog

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.060
 That would be fine

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.260
 An eagle

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.180
 What organism are you possibly thinking of?

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.260
 So this is the weird thing

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.780
 When they're in captivity

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.100
 Sloths have a poo once every day

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.300
 Which suggests that they really really want to have a poo once every day

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.940
 And that in captivity they know they're safe they can do

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.900
 Because when you're in the wild the shame of dying

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.540
 Basically they're all dying like Elvis Presley died aren't they

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.660
 They're half of them dying on the toilet you don't want to risk that

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.580
 And we don't know why they go down to the bottom

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.260
 Well there's a great theory

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.980
 Okay so the theory is they have this algae on them which grows

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.740
 And some of these species of algae are specific to a single species of sloth

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.340
 So it's quite specific stuff

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.220
 But they're in this weird love triangle with some algae and some moths

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.980
 So they go down to the ground

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.060
 There are these moths which live in their fur

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:54.060
 And because sloths move so slowly they can never groom themselves to get rid of the moths

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.780
 Because as soon as they move their claw over to their arm

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.940
 The moths just walks out of the way

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:01.980
 So that's because they can fly moths

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:02.940
 Yeah exactly

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.980
 It's a bit of a kick in the teeth

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.340
 It's a bit walk away from them

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.020
 I know they just stroll off they don't care

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.900
 So the moths lay their eggs in the poo of the sloths

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.620
 Right

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.100
 And then the the moths live

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.140
 They fly up when they hatch into the sloths fur

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.100
 They live there

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.140
 They die

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.100
 That algae that we talked about

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.860
 Grows because of the nutrients released when the moths die

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.580
 So the moth die they release nitrogen and the algae feeds on that

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.980
 And we think that the algae is beneficial to the sloths

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:32.940
 We don't know how

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.940
 But it's either because it camouflages them

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.740
 Or because maybe they groom themselves that they might eat it

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.780
 Although that's a bit controversial

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:44.220
 Also it can apparently contains some agents that kind of work against things like malaria

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:46.220
 Right okay so whatever it's doing

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.820
 It's definitely helping the sloth survive

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:51.340
 Yeah so that's why they need to go down is for the moth life cycle

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.820
 And then the moths feed the algae and the algae help the sloth

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:59.020
 No but I don't risk that just for the sake of nurturing a few moths

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.180
 Who might poo green all over you

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.340
 And maybe camouflage your maybe not

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.460
 No just one

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.740
 Well another theory is that they go down and they do their business

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:11.820
 And that is kind of telling the female sloths where they are

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:15.500
 And there's information in that dung that tells them that they're fit

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.100
 And good people to mate with

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.980
 And so maybe it's like a sloth tinder kind of thing

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.420
 Yeah wow it's like a reproductive system thing where they're going

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.740
 I'm photol I'm ready so actually they go down a lot more

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.220
 Than they usually would when they're ready for a child

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.580
 And as a result they build this mountain of poo going

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.660
 I want babies and that's what they see in the like

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:40.860
 Whoa look how awesome this is and then they go up the tree

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.700
 That is an alarming tip the profile

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.100
 Just huge steaming calls of poo

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.940
 Everything is not tinder it's a different pineapple

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.180
 If you work with sloths you're not allowed to wear perfume

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.780
 Because their hair is so absorbent

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.500
 So they can have algae growing inside their own hair

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.460
 It's very weird it grows on the outside and also on the inside

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.020
 So if you wear perfume it can get into their fur basically

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.460
 And it stays with them for weeks

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.300
 So you're not allowed to wear perfume

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.860
 You're not allowed to wear things like suntan lotion

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.460
 Which is a problem because of where they live

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.100
 And you're not even allowed to wear anti mosquitos spray

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.020
 If you're cuddling sloths we're living

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.940
 And you have to get very good at climbing trees

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.060
 Apparently there's I think the person who's done a lot on sloths recently

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.580
 Who's often in new scientists and stuff

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:24.860
 Is someone called Rebecca Cliff

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.020
 Who took a tree climbing course

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.620
 And still said that it was impossible

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:31.020
 She was outsmarted and outpaced by the sloths

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.860
 Because by the time she got out the tree

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.420
 They'd be on a different tree

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.500
 And she found that she had to get Guatemalan free climbers

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.660
 To go and get the sloths for her when she wanted to study

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.860
 I read one article about sloths in trees

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.780
 And that is that what they do is equivalent

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.660
 You know those gymnasts who do that kind of

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.900
 It's like a crucifix position on the rings

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.100
 They're like oh yeah

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.180
 Which is unbelievably hard for humans to do

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.180
 Apparently sloths just do that really easily

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:59.180
 They can just do it all of them do that all the time

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.820
 Right

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.420
 But they do fall out quite a lot

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:01.980
 Do they?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.580
 This is one thing she said was

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.340
 If you see a sloth fall out of a tree

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.420
 Which happens alarmingly often

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.260
 I mean they seem to just be popping out

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.540
 There was a story that babies would fall out

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.940
 Because they mistake their own limbs for tree branches

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.540
 They're held onto their limbs and fall

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.580
 But I don't know if that's true

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.860
 It's not true unfortunately

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.380
 I mean fortunately but it's

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.940
 No no no it's probably a myth

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.780
 But the babies do fall out quite a bit

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.820
 And if they do fall out

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.980
 The mothers will not go down and get them

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.260
 The babies are dead at that point

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:31.260
 Whereas they will go down to take a poo

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.260
 They will not go down and fetch their baby

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.020
 So infant mortality very high

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.740
 Because

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.580
 So I've read they can be really fast

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:38.780
 They want to be

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.660
 Really what? Sorry

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.020
 Fast I read that the top speed of a sloth

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.180
 Is 15 miles per hour

00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.220
 Oh come on

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:46.940
 Yeah

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.060
 Faster than a pet

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.340
 That's if they're falling out of a tree

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.860
 I can believe that

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:53.500
 But supposedly I read this from a zoologist

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.260
 It's a it's a double bluff basically

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.620
 Their slowness is real

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.700
 It takes them 30 days to digest a leaf

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.220
 They are a slow being

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.820
 But when something is threatening them

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.020
 They're able to be very speedy

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.420
 She said faster than a cat can run

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.380
 On the street

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.180
 No way

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:07.660
 Yeah

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.820
 Probably no, probably no

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.140
 There is a self-help book that came out of the last year or so

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.420
 Called "Be more sloth"

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.460
 It's by Alison Davis

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.620
 And she says that you should be more still

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.140
 You should turn things upside down

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.020
 Be more intentional

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.980
 Be kind to yourselves

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.020
 And be more positive

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.660
 Which apparently these are all things that sloths do

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.140
 And have a very very very high fiber diet

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.940
 Well she says on the front cover

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:36.220
 The winner of the race isn't always the one who comes first

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:37.340
 Incorrect

00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.540
 Yeah

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:41.180
 That's the definition of the winner of the race

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:45.900
 Okay that's it that is all of our facts

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.580
