00:00:12,00:00:16,Hello and welcome to another episode of
00:00:16,00:00:20,"No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:20,00:00:24,this week coming to you from the wilderness festival!
00:00:24,00:00:28,[Cheering]
00:00:28,00:00:33,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James"
00:00:33,00:00:36,Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the
00:00:36,00:00:40,microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:40,00:00:44,"and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with our first"
00:00:44,00:00:48,"fact, this week that's my fact. My fact is, according to a new scientific"
00:00:48,00:00:53,"study, the best way to perform CPR is to do it while humming"
00:00:53,00:00:59,the Macarena. How cool is that? And I think they recommend humming it because
00:00:59,00:01:02,they probably don't believe if you're trying to save someone life and you're
00:01:02,00:01:06,"going ""hamadamba temadamba temamakarena, you're the right person to be doing it."""
00:01:06,00:01:08,Are they even chalyrics? Are you just dead then?
00:01:08,00:01:12,Does anyone know the actual lyrics? I think everyone knows the word macarena
00:01:12,00:01:15,"and know what the word in that song is. Yeah, exactly. But it's what it is about"
00:01:15,00:01:20,this song is that it has a BPM so every song has a B per minute and this BPM
00:01:20,00:01:24,"is 103 and as a result, when they're trying to teach people the perfect"
00:01:24,00:01:28,"counts that you need on a chest as you're trying to save someone's life,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"the macarena happens to be the perfect amount. And before that, they used to"
00:01:31,00:01:35,think it was staying alive by the beaches. That's right.
00:01:35,00:01:40,Because that's about 103 or 104 as well. Yeah. But actually also maybe it's
00:01:40,00:01:44,"supposed to be about 100 is the best, right? But macarena is good because"
00:01:44,00:01:47,everyone kind of knows the beat of that so it's good to do. But I thought I'd
00:01:47,00:01:50,look at some others that are 100 beats per minute. So if anyone's having a
00:01:50,00:01:55,"heart attack, you should try these ones. Crazy and loved by Beyonc√©."
00:01:55,00:01:58,Yeah. Independent women by Destiny's Child.
00:01:58,00:02:03,Any of these work. Hips don't lie by Shakira. That's my favourite.
00:02:03,00:02:07,Or my chemical romance dead. Yeah. Not a good one.
00:02:07,00:02:11,That's not a good one. I've found a few more. So Simon and Garfunkel bridge over
00:02:11,00:02:15,"Troubled Water. If it's just a nice mood, you want to chill everyone out with that?"
00:02:15,00:02:18,Sometimes the situation doesn't need something fun.
00:02:18,00:02:20,Okay. Sometimes poignancy is needed.
00:02:20,00:02:24,"Well, the way they sing that on the X Factor, which is the slowest song in the"
00:02:24,00:02:26,"history of time. Oh, okay. Well, how about this one?"
00:02:26,00:02:29,"It doesn't have any beat. It doesn't have any beat. You just, you'd pause on"
00:02:29,00:02:34,Lacka Bridge. That is how you do slow.
00:02:34,00:03:04,"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da"
00:03:04,00:03:11,It gets to the next. It's a good way of multitasking and fair sharing. So Macarena is by lost Del Rio. Yes
00:03:11,00:03:16,"Okay, and this is very much a one-hit wonder isn't it? They never had any other hits. Oh James"
00:03:16,00:03:23,I have got at least one of the other hits right here on my paper. What? It's Macarena Christmas
00:03:23,00:03:30,It's released about 18 months after Macarena and it is a kiddie not the worst song ever released
00:03:30,00:03:35,It's a it's a medley of jingle bells joined to the world rude off the Red Nose reindeer and the Macarena
00:03:35,00:03:39,"Wow, and they just break off and they do a bit of Macarena"
00:03:39,00:03:43,I'm at least I think five or six albums. One of them was Macarena non-stop
00:03:43,00:03:48,Which the compilation album it only has eight tracks and five of them at the Macarena
00:03:48,00:03:54,But you know what's amazing about lost Del Rio this band they got together in
00:03:54,00:04:00,1964 I believe it was 62 or 64 the same year that the Rolling Stones got together
00:04:00,00:04:04,"Okay, they had their hit 32 years into their career"
00:04:04,00:04:09,That was finally they were like should we give up I'm sure we're gonna hit it one day mates
00:04:09,00:04:12,Let's do it and they did and then they must have thought wow
00:04:12,00:04:14,We've made it and that was the end of their career. Yeah
00:04:14,00:04:20,That's still going that's still performing. But are they I when I'm researching this I read an article from
00:04:20,00:04:26,"1999 the headline of which was does anyone remember the Macarena? I mean, and that's what was that what a stupid article"
00:04:27,00:04:34,Everyone remembers the Macarena I watched a video you know you come see these on YouTube where they show teenagers stuff from the 90s
00:04:34,00:04:38,"Or whatever and see if they know what it is. Yeah, every single one of them knew what the Macarena was"
00:04:38,00:04:45,"Yeah, no one knew the band, but they all knew the song. Yeah, and in 2003 so that's 10 years after the record was released"
00:04:45,00:04:49,They were still making a quarter of a million dollars a year royalties. Wow
00:04:49,00:04:55,And it's extraordinary the original Macarena dance there was an original this that was the second dance
00:04:55,00:05:02,It was when they made the video when there was a remix done of the song the first one was an incredibly complicated flamingo dance
00:05:02,00:05:06,That was done in clubs. You would have to be an expert in order to do it
00:05:06,00:05:08,It had doubled the amount of moves that the original
00:05:08,00:05:15,"Verse had was invented by a don't like a random aerobic teacher or dance teacher or something. Yeah, me a fire"
00:05:15,00:05:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, or me a fry. She was in the video clip and so she wanted something that kids could dance to and adults"
00:05:22,00:05:28,"Who have to go to nightclubs, but don't know how to dance could dance to so the four of us bow to her"
00:05:28,00:05:33,You've saved us actually Macarena. It's about a woman called Macarena
00:05:33,00:05:41,But the name Macarena was originally Mac Delayna and it was just a word for like a sensuous woman and it comes from Mary Mac Delayna
00:05:41,00:05:45,"Then it was a word for any kind of prostitute and then it was a word for a sensuous woman, right?"
00:05:45,00:05:48,So really it should be hey Mac Delayna hey prostitute
00:05:48,00:05:55,"Well, and it's about a woman who prostitute in the song the lyrics are actually the woman saying"
00:05:55,00:05:58,Don't worry about my boyfriend. He's gone off to fight
00:05:58,00:06:03,You two are his best mates. Do you want to shag and said is that Macarena?
00:06:03,00:06:09,It's not a good message to be sending 12 year olds at this goes no
00:06:09,00:06:15,This is this is just a little nugget. I enjoyed it went to number one in France
00:06:15,00:06:18,"It went to number one in a number of countries, but not in the UK not in the UK"
00:06:18,00:06:22,because because it was the world by
00:06:22,00:06:26,TLC no one to be by the spice girls. No
00:06:26,00:06:30,"Wow, that's bad look wasn't it because it's like the biggest song of all time"
00:06:30,00:06:37,"But yeah, I'm up against there was a big there was a big gospel around the room at that 20-year-old chopped news. Yeah"
00:06:37,00:06:41,Hey guys and blood be to aces to number one as well
00:06:43,00:06:48,How do you think they were probably sad but quietly confident going? It's all right
00:06:48,00:06:50,We've got Macarena Christmas in the bag. We'll be
00:06:50,00:06:54,We'll be back and then to become one came out they have
00:06:54,00:06:59,So in France they went to number one. Do you know what song they knocked off the number one?
00:06:59,00:07:05,"Oh, it's a French song. No, no, it's gonna regret re-en the only French time anyone knows"
00:07:05,00:07:09,"It was the theme tune to the ex files. Oh, yeah"
00:07:11,00:07:16,That was number one that was number one in France. I think that was the one that you oh it did well in the UK
00:07:16,00:07:22,Isn't that tubular bells Mike feel Mike old field did a cover of it later. How weird is that?
00:07:22,00:07:26,You're thinking the exorcist. Yeah. Yeah. Should we talk about CPR?
00:07:26,00:07:28,Yes
00:07:28,00:07:35,If you have a problem with CPR as in so a lot of people are quite light and it's you need a lot of pressure to get
00:07:35,00:07:38,Someone's just deep enough to get the blood flowing while you wait for the ambulance
00:07:38,00:07:45,So if you are like a tip is to jump on the person who you're trying to administer you could actually be doing the macarena
00:07:45,00:07:46,"Well, kind of yes you could"
00:07:46,00:07:53,"Wow, sorry. I say tip and I like there's no medical advice on this stage. I think I was better say yes"
00:07:53,00:07:56,Don't use this tip. There is a doctor though who does recommend using the feet
00:07:56,00:07:59,I think people have said especially if you're a bit older
00:07:59,00:08:04,You've lost some of your muscle strength and but also advice now or advice releasing 2010
00:08:04,00:08:10,It's always changing is don't do the breathing anymore none of the snogging you just do the hands to the heart
00:08:10,00:08:15,"Don't you just do the heart. So you're doing a bit there isn't so much fun. Yeah, exactly just the jumping up and down"
00:08:15,00:08:19,The mouth to mouth one is really weird because it kind of was discovered in the 18th century
00:08:19,00:08:24,And then it just got forgotten about for about 50 to 100 years and basically no one did it at all
00:08:24,00:08:30,And then it came back and the reason they stopped it is because they realized what was coming out of your mouth when you breathe
00:08:30,00:08:36,"And it's carbon dioxide and they were saying well, what's the point of breathing carbon dioxide into someone's lungs because they breathe oxygen"
00:08:36,00:08:39,"Yeah, and you know what the answer is to know why that's not true"
00:08:39,00:08:47,"No, it's because when you breathe in and breathe out you actually only absorb about 40% of the oxygen sort of still plenty of oxygen in your breath"
00:08:47,00:08:51,"Any kind of oxygen is better than okay, so how long if we started it?"
00:08:51,00:08:56,So if someone breathed in at the edge of the room here and then they passed the breath around the room
00:08:57,00:09:06,"How long would it be before there was no point in that exercise? I think it's worth a try, isn't it? All right. I feel an experiment coming up. Okay. I think we should start with that topless guy. You're in that old"
00:09:06,00:09:10,But people that tried all sorts of weird CPR over the ages
00:09:10,00:09:16,They used to be the barrel type where you there was a big round barrel and you were sort of strapped to it
00:09:16,00:09:23,Face down with your stomach over the barrel and I don't know how you did this so quickly when someone's obviously dying of a heart attack in front of you
00:09:23,00:09:27,And then as the person who's saving them you sort of stood in between their legs and you roll them
00:09:27,00:09:32,"On and off the barrel, don't you? And it was the idea was that it eventually forced your heart into going in really?"
00:09:32,00:09:37,"Yeah, yeah, it's like one of those did you ever go to playgrounds where you would run on a barrel that span round and round"
00:09:37,00:09:39,"Yeah, but I've seen cartoons where that helped. Right"
00:09:39,00:09:43,That will that's medical advice from the Victorian age
00:09:43,00:09:50,"Hey, we need to move on to our next fact shortly. Oh, can I just there was so you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth and CPR to animals"
00:09:50,00:09:52,"Weirdly successfully. Yeah, I've no"
00:09:54,00:10:01,"Yeah, you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth to animals. Weirdly successful. There was a guy this you're gonna talk about the guy this year with the"
00:10:01,00:10:08,"Frog there's a guy this year who did it with a frog after the frog happening here. Oh, is this your fact? No, it's not mine"
00:10:08,00:10:13,Actually mine was the one I was gonna say down. Let's do your effect. You do the frog thing. Let's
00:10:13,00:10:22,"No, this was a this was a deer and it was a deer who was drowning in a swimming pool and an RSP-ZA officer was called and he got the deer out of the pool"
00:10:22,00:10:28,And he gave it chest compressions and see CPR and mouth to mouth. Give it the kiss of life until it choked
00:10:28,00:10:30,He said it properly like in films coughed water into his mouth
00:10:30,00:10:36,And then and then he started choking it then had to give him CPR
00:10:36,00:10:39,Where does the frog come into this? Yeah
00:10:39,00:10:45,And you know the deer got up he brushed it down and then he said the deer looked at him and then ran away
00:10:45,00:10:51,"Sweet, yeah, it's a good story, I know, but I just wonder has anything happened with any smaller maybe amphibious?"
00:10:51,00:10:55,"No, it hasn't I think we're moving on interestingly a frog"
00:10:55,00:11:02,This is a great story. There was a I can't wait this guy was walking just
00:11:02,00:11:06,Minding his own business when he came across a snake on the ground and the snake was choking
00:11:06,00:11:10,And he thought I'm not gonna give CPR to a snake. How could you tell a snake is choking? It was sort of like doing that
00:11:10,00:11:14,"Okay, yeah, yeah, and suddenly out of its mouth shoots a frog"
00:11:14,00:11:18,"So it swallowed the frog, but the the frog forced its way back out"
00:11:18,00:11:25,"Okay, but in the process died the man saw the frog and he gave CPR to the frog and he brought it back to life"
00:11:25,00:11:28,"Yeah, and he brought the rope home. What happens to this snake?"
00:11:28,00:11:31,He doesn't feature in the rest of the story
00:11:31,00:11:44,"All right, look we need to be about to our next fact it is time for fact number two and that is Chazinsky"
00:11:44,00:11:51,My fact this week is that Donald Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal for himself when he wrote the art of the deal
00:11:51,00:11:59,This is because a so Tony Schwartz was a guy who ghost wrote the art of the deal with Trump and he gave a talk a while back
00:11:59,00:12:05,And he openly said Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal with me. I got a great deal out of it
00:12:05,00:12:11,He didn't unheard of things so there was an advance of half a million dollars for the art of the deal and Trump gave his
00:12:11,00:12:15,Ghostwriter 50% of the advance and then 50% of all the royalties
00:12:15,00:12:19,So this guy has just been making millions and millions from this book
00:12:19,00:12:23,This is unheard of in publishing. I think someone who a negotiating professor
00:12:23,00:12:29,Called Deepak Malhotra said there is not a better deal out there in the world for ghost writing
00:12:29,00:12:36,And then when the book came out Trump hosted an absolutely massive party then he and Trump tower
00:12:36,00:12:39,I think it was there was a big red carpet loads of celebrities came
00:12:39,00:12:44,There was a giant cake replica of Trump tower and then he went to his ghost writer and he went well
00:12:44,00:12:49,"You owe me 50% for the price of this party and the ghost writer went, I don't think so"
00:12:49,00:12:54,And he ended up paying about a thousand pounds just fed the drinks that him and his friends
00:12:54,00:12:58,Do you know what the inspiration for the book was for the book the art of the deal?
00:12:58,00:13:04,"No, there was an article all about Trump in GQ and it was a popular article as in that issue of GQ"
00:13:04,00:13:08,So well because Trump was on the front cover. He was a businessman at the time and then they thought
00:13:08,00:13:10,Why don't we see if we can turn this into a book?
00:13:10,00:13:15,So they tested out what the book would look like they designed a dummy cover and then it had a picture of him
00:13:15,00:13:20,looking heroic on the front and then they wrapped it around a thick Russian novel and thought what it would look like a
00:13:20,00:13:23,thick Russian novel
00:13:23,00:13:32,"Guys the clues were there from the stars. Wow. No, okay. All right. Oh, we go"
00:13:33,00:13:38,What's exciting is you've all heard something that won't be in the actual show and we release it so that's
00:13:38,00:13:45,"He has a bad record of deal-making though, right? He's this was actually an article by Jonathan Frieden"
00:13:45,00:13:52,"I think in the Guardian pointed out his deal-making history, but so the apprentice first series extremely successful"
00:13:52,00:13:57,So he asked for an increase in what he was paid. I think it's per episode. He got 50 grand
00:13:57,00:14:00,He asked for an increase to one million dollars
00:14:01,00:14:05,"That's good deal-making, isn't it? That sounds like a deal-making. He ended up with 60 grand"
00:14:05,00:14:12,"But no, a lot of people say not a good deal-maker someone else who's done a deal with him said he seems way too keen"
00:14:12,00:14:18,You've got to seem cool. He sort of paces around the room like he's wearing a sign saying desperate and who said that Vladimir
00:14:18,00:14:20,What was he called?
00:14:20,00:14:22,He chose to remain anonymous
00:14:23,00:14:29,Do you know he he released a novel years ago? Yeah called Trump Tower and and then he
00:14:29,00:14:34,"Effectively unreleased it in that the novel still exists, but he took his name off"
00:14:34,00:14:38,So it was ghost-ridden by someone else and he had his name though
00:14:38,00:14:44,It was a Donald Trump book. It was called Trump Tower and it was a it was a book based on an idea for a TV show that he developed
00:14:44,00:14:49,Which was meant to be Trump Tower done like the TV show Dallas or all those American soaps
00:14:49,00:14:53,It was the life of all the people that worked in Trump Tower and they got a pilot
00:14:53,00:14:57,But the pilot didn't get made so they ended up doing this book and on the front
00:14:57,00:15:01,It said it was the sexiest novel of the decade. Wow. Which decade?
00:15:01,00:15:08,It was 2011 was it was it was old 2011. It's a current. It's he's he's predicted
00:15:08,00:15:16,"We still cannot top the sexiness of this book. Wow. It was an erotic novel, wasn't it? Yeah, that's novel and so I was reading some snippets of it"
00:15:16,00:15:18,It is this is how erotic it is
00:15:18,00:15:26,So someone walks into a room a guest in Trump Tower and sees at least six women not wearing tops and says I must be dead
00:15:26,00:15:28,I've gone to boob heaven
00:15:28,00:15:30,That's an actual line in an actual novel
00:15:30,00:15:37,He's just very quickly. He's also really good for books Donald Trump because anytime he tweets about a book
00:15:37,00:15:39,That he doesn't like it does really well
00:15:39,00:15:43,So for example fire and fury became massive off the back of him taking it down
00:15:43,00:15:48,"Yeah, and there was a very famous. He's a civil rights icon in America called John Lewis and he wrote a number of books"
00:15:48,00:15:54,And he wrote a tweet saying I don't think he's fit for president and Trump took him down massively as a result
00:15:54,00:15:57,The sales increase of his books were over a hundred thousand percent
00:15:57,00:16:06,And in the weekend of the tweet seven of the top 20 books were attributed to John Lewis all his books just rose to the top
00:16:06,00:16:09,"Wow, he's actually good for book sales if he hates you"
00:16:09,00:16:12,"The John Lewis Brown is very different in America, isn't it?"
00:16:12,00:16:19,"Yes, yeah, I've got a couple of bad deals from history. Okay, I've researched so the fact being that"
00:16:19,00:16:23,Trump negotiated a bad deal for the order of the deal. I thought this was quite fun
00:16:23,00:16:27,There's a in America the NFL. There's a team the Green Bay Packers and they had a player called Mirror
00:16:27,00:16:30,MIRER
00:16:30,00:16:34,"Yeah, I never heard of it. Okay. He was he was a big deal back in the day and his contract"
00:16:34,00:16:41,He was so wanted by this team that his agent put a clause in the contract that they eventually the team had to sign and the clause was
00:16:41,00:16:49,"That my mirror would be paid under all conditions, and then this is the clause up to and including the end of the world"
00:16:49,00:16:53,Including the end of the world
00:16:53,00:16:56,So if some people survived and he was one of them and they were one of them
00:16:56,00:17:01,They would still pay him for all the apocalyptic future that they lived through
00:17:01,00:17:04,They were the last two people other
00:17:05,00:17:13,"I've got a bad deal. Oh, yeah, so there's a famous story about the Dutch buying Manhattan Island from the Native Americans for a very small amount of money and"
00:17:13,00:17:17,Them's thinking oh these Native Americans they don't understand the value of property
00:17:17,00:17:24,They don't stand the contact of property rights. They absolutely did the problem was the Dutch bought Manhattan from the Canasi Native Americans
00:17:24,00:17:30,Who happened to live next door in Long Island and did not live in Manhattan?
00:17:30,00:17:34,They only use the island of Manhattan to get drunk in
00:17:35,00:17:39,The Dutch showed up and they offered to buy the place on these people saying is this your place? Oh great. We'll buy this for it
00:17:39,00:17:43,So it's like going to a pub and offering a random man standing outside the pub quite drunk
00:17:43,00:17:47,"100,000 pounds for this building. I got another sporty one"
00:17:47,00:17:51,This is a there's a Swedish soccer player called Stefan Schwartz. Do you remember him James?
00:17:51,00:18:00,So he was paid a four million pound deal with Sunderland for the English Premier League the condition that he had to sign when he was signing
00:18:00,00:18:04,Which for him was a bad deal is he was not allowed to go to space
00:18:04,00:18:06,That was the oh
00:18:06,00:18:09,"Yeah, he wanted to be a space Taurus. He was obsessed with going to space"
00:18:09,00:18:14,"They were like he's obsessed so much. We just have to say no you've got to play football. Yeah, we're gonna"
00:18:14,00:18:18,Put that in the contract to me. That's a deal breaker - is it right?
00:18:18,00:18:26,We need to move on to our next facts. We do that. Okay. It is time for fact number three and that is Andy
00:18:26,00:18:32,My fact is that on the bio tapestry you can tell how important someone is by the size of their horse's penis
00:18:32,00:18:39,"Um, so there's a professor at the University of Oxford. He's called George Garnett"
00:18:39,00:18:44,He has gone through the bio tapestry the whole thing rigorously counting the horses and their penises
00:18:44,00:18:47,And the human there are the same number of penises as
00:18:47,00:18:54,"Well, it might be some female horses. There are some female horses. I've got they didn't have penises. Yeah"
00:18:54,00:18:56,I think they all work for full you
00:18:58,00:19:03,"Um, I think they're written out. I think they might be hidden by a leg or yeah"
00:19:03,00:19:08,Sometimes someone standing in front of the horse or a musically holding a vase in front of the horse
00:19:08,00:19:11,"Yeah, or the horse is wearing a pair of novelty trousers"
00:19:11,00:19:16,"Or it's a pantomime horse and they famously don't have penis. Well, they have two some of them"
00:19:16,00:19:21,"Oh, my horses. Very good point. Um, so he counted all of these and he points out that"
00:19:21,00:19:22,King Harold
00:19:22,00:19:28,Who came second in the Battle of Hastings? He has a horse which has a very large penis
00:19:28,00:19:33,But there's one larger horse penis and that belongs to William the Conqueror
00:19:33,00:19:38,So it's a it's a clear the the man who wins the battle has the largest horse's penis
00:19:38,00:19:42,"Wow, and this is new right this is a brother. No, no Tubby 66"
00:19:42,00:19:50,This is this is new. This is new research. This is breaking. This is to lot of people in the room
00:19:50,00:19:54,This is like this is like the Spice Girls and the Macarena all over again. Yeah
00:19:54,00:20:00,"Yeah, so this is very exciting previously neglected research he counted all the human ones as well"
00:20:00,00:20:03,He did sorry. There are four and a half would you say?
00:20:03,00:20:14,But I think what happened was a lot of people have kind of paid attention to this in the past because in Victorian times
00:20:14,00:20:15,They were all edited out
00:20:15,00:20:22,"Yeah, and there is one guy who had a pair of underpants drawn on him or tapestry on him by the Victorians"
00:20:22,00:20:26,"That was in the in the English one, right? There's an English wrap. Yeah, sorry in the replica"
00:20:26,00:20:30,"Yeah, exactly, but this is the first time people have looked at all of them including the horse ones"
00:20:30,00:20:36,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I can believe the so I don't actually know much about the Bay of Tapestry"
00:20:36,00:20:41,"Not being English myself, so this yeah, and it's a frequent topic of conversation in English hubs of children"
00:20:41,00:20:45,I am so lost at dinner parties every time it comes up. I walk around the festival site here
00:20:45,00:20:47,You'll find tools 300 people talking about the buyers
00:20:47,00:20:51,"Actually, it gets a bit boring sometimes, you know"
00:20:52,00:20:58,But I so I literally had no knowledge of it all so it's fascinating to know that this thing was a it was
00:20:58,00:21:02,"68 70 meters long. Yep, which is incredibly long if you put that into context"
00:21:02,00:21:10,"That's about 30 meters less than 100. No, it's like that would take you saying both roughly seven seconds to run"
00:21:10,00:21:13,"Yeah, the fastest man running at the Bayer tapestry"
00:21:13,00:21:19,"The the thing is as well as that a turns out it's not a tapestry at all. No, it's embroidery"
00:21:19,00:21:21,So it's got the wrong name
00:21:22,00:21:29,But also if you read the whole thing up until recently when they when they decided to fix this the final scene is missing
00:21:29,00:21:36,Imagine reading 70 meters of story and getting to the final scene and someone's ripped the page out as in the
00:21:36,00:21:42,"Williams coronation isn't it? Yeah, yeah, and they added it so they finished was it 2013?"
00:21:42,00:21:45,"I think yeah, and they did it on an on an island on a channel island"
00:21:45,00:21:50,There was over a hundred four hundred people that did it and one of the stitches was done by Prince Charles
00:21:50,00:21:56,So despite the fact it lives over in France made using British royalty
00:21:56,00:22:04,And a lot of people think it was made in Britain anyway in Kent and a lot of people think it was made completely by women because of the
00:22:04,00:22:10,"Penises in fact, so historians think that there are there is the occasional erect penis on a dead soldier"
00:22:10,00:22:18,And the theory is that the tapestry or embroidery was therefore stitched by women and the women were ridiculing the men for the fact that they used
00:22:18,00:22:23,"War to show off their manhood, so it was thought to be kind of a satirical thing when we're saying you idiots"
00:22:23,00:22:28,"So the people used to fight with no trousers. Yeah, really. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
00:22:28,00:22:36,"No, there was a battle wasn't there were the English had terrible dysentery of the area of the trousers"
00:22:36,00:22:40,That was Henry the fifth so it was about as you call it was about a magical
00:22:40,00:22:45,"Yeah, but so why are they naked people in there if people were trousers the naked people are mostly in the margins"
00:22:45,00:22:48,"Yes, so there's the main bit there's the main strip of the biotapestry"
00:22:48,00:22:52,"Yeah, I think the main story of the battle and then at the top and the bottom there are these margins"
00:22:52,00:22:57,This is an amazing thing where they're I love the embroidery because you when you see old art you assume
00:22:57,00:23:03,"Oh, it must be done perfect, you know the perspective and everything and there's a couple of moments in the tapestry where they've run out of space"
00:23:03,00:23:10,So there's a there's four people holding a chest on on four sticks or two sticks rather four of them and
00:23:11,00:23:16,"There's three of them that are nicely done, but they went a bit too high on the tapestry. So the fourth guy's head"
00:23:16,00:23:22,Just making a quick cameo into the tapestry when really it should have been gone
00:23:22,00:23:27,My favorite part the biotapestry is the bit where Odo Earl of Kent is
00:23:27,00:23:33,Whispering to William telling him what to do in the battle and it kind of makes him look like he's really the important person
00:23:33,00:23:35,He was the architects of the whole invasion
00:23:35,00:23:43,But it turns out that it seems like it was him who commissioned the tapestry. I gave himself a massive role in that although and he was
00:23:43,00:23:48,Quite interesting wasn't he because he was never seen with spears or anything in the tapestry because he was a bishop
00:23:48,00:23:52,And bishop's one allowed a shed blood. So instead he's always seen with a massive club
00:23:52,00:23:57,So they're allowed to beat people around the head which apparently didn't draw any blood
00:23:57,00:24:01,"Yeah, have you seen the reviews of the biotapestry?"
00:24:02,00:24:05,They're great. They're well trip advisor reviews everything in the world
00:24:05,00:24:13,And as with all things the most funny reviews are the one star ones. So there is a complaint actor. There is actually one star. Isn't the Haley's comic?
00:24:13,00:24:19,"Anyway, I feel like you're going to say something funny. Yeah, well, you know"
00:24:19,00:24:22,Thunder stolen
00:24:22,00:24:26,"No, so the reviews are things like so one review says we went on a visit to the biotapestry"
00:24:26,00:24:28,Big learning curve for some people
00:24:28,00:24:31,We were walking along looking at the tapestry not much to see to be honest
00:24:32,00:24:35,All of a sudden I see a large phallic object sewn on the tapestry
00:24:35,00:24:38,This attraction is not displayed as containing adult content
00:24:38,00:24:42,We have very young children who can see the penis which is an outrage
00:24:42,00:24:47,I wanted to learn about medieval battles not medieval penises
00:24:47,00:24:54,That's one star one star and there's another one star review which just says 9 quid and 40 minutes to see a carpet
00:24:58,00:25:03,9 quid in seven seconds for who say molasses. It was very blurry
00:25:03,00:25:12,I like the little touches in the tapestry because people used to add kind of slide digs at people or what they thought of certain figures in it
00:25:12,00:25:19,So there's one there's one really nice but actually we're herald when herald first went over to see willing the concurrent front
00:25:19,00:25:22,Him and his men then got in boats to go back across the channel to Britain
00:25:22,00:25:28,And there's such a good picture of him and all his men holding up their kind of hose
00:25:28,00:25:31,And all their stockings and everything and they've taken their shoes off. They're carrying their shoes
00:25:31,00:25:36,And they're carrying their pets and stuff in their arms because they're waiting through the water to get to their boats
00:25:36,00:25:42,And it's just it's just exactly like you know when you wrote a beach and you sort of wonder what that's
00:25:42,00:25:48,They brought pets with them one person had a dog under his arm and another person was holding a bird which seems that necessary
00:25:52,00:26:00,"Maybe a helper war dog or a snipper dog or something. Yeah, you know Nigel Farage was his favorite tie is a Bayer tapestry tie"
00:26:00,00:26:04,Because it reminds him of the last time Britain was invaded how long is it?
00:26:04,00:26:09,"It's the same way. Yeah, it's an exact replica to scale. Yeah, right. So it's just constantly"
00:26:09,00:26:13,Dranging behind him. He has some bridesmaids who carried it all the time
00:26:13,00:26:19,That's interesting because when I was looking at an old old bishop of Bayer who was the guy who commissioned this
00:26:19,00:26:25,I went on to the BBC website and they said that he was the least popular figure in Kent's history
00:26:25,00:26:29,But then I looked up other people from Kent who were unpopular and Nigel Farage
00:26:29,00:26:35,It's from Kent as well as the most unpopular person Nasty Nick from Big Brother One. Oh
00:26:35,00:26:40,Don't tell these guys. They didn't even know about the Spice Girls chart history yet
00:26:40,00:26:43,Nasty Nick will blow their mind
00:26:43,00:26:47,We should move on to our final fact shortly anything before we do yeah should go for it
00:26:47,00:26:54,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James. Okay, and my fact this week is that if you're a slough"
00:26:54,00:26:59,"Every time you go for a poo, it's more painful than childbirth"
00:26:59,00:27:08,Is that you impersonating child? I was just trying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that more painful than human childbirth?
00:27:08,00:27:15,I believe it is because actually slough childbirth is not that painful because baby sloths are super small
00:27:15,00:27:17,They're about 14 ounces
00:27:17,00:27:22,Whereas slough poo's are at least twice as big maybe more
00:27:22,00:27:27,And they can lose up to one third of their body weight during death. Oh god
00:27:27,00:27:30,They do it once a week
00:27:30,00:27:38,It's the equivalent of if I did a poo there would be too big to check into a Thompson's flight
00:27:38,00:27:43,I mean what's the purpose of your visit for a start?
00:27:44,00:27:50,And the stomachs physically shrink every time they do it
00:27:50,00:28:00,But how do we have someone laid a woman mid-labor next to a slow mid-poo and what judge the volume of the screaming?
00:28:00,00:28:06,I think how do we know you're right? I mean to be honest there's a bit of you know suposition going on here
00:28:06,00:28:10,But basically it's the size and this is what we've said this before unlike other animals
00:28:11,00:28:13,Sloths they only do this once a week
00:28:13,00:28:15,They go down from the bottom of their tree
00:28:15,00:28:19,And they do this and it can take like up to 50 days for the food to go through the system
00:28:19,00:28:22,Because they're trying to get every single bit of nutrient out of it
00:28:22,00:28:26,"And so by the time it comes out, it's absolutely huge. It's just fibrous mass"
00:28:26,00:28:29,And it obviously must be extremely painful. Yeah
00:28:29,00:28:31,And it's super heavy isn't it?
00:28:31,00:28:36,So um well obviously like a third of their body weight and the problem with being a sloth is that you're upside down
00:28:36,00:28:41,Basically all of your life and so your poo's all gone to the bottom waiting to come out
00:28:41,00:28:46,And then it would the only thing that stops it all from crushing the rest of their organs is that
00:28:46,00:28:50,Their bowels and everything like that literally hooks onto their ribcage
00:28:50,00:28:56,"Yeah, or onto the sides of their body because otherwise you know if it was loose hanging like ours are as soon as the sloth turns upside down"
00:28:56,00:29:00,This enormous weight of feces would crash all of the rest of its organs
00:29:00,00:29:02,So all of its organs are kind of yeah hooked on
00:29:02,00:29:07,It's amazing and then it goes down to the bottom of the tree does it's business and goes back up again
00:29:07,00:29:09,"And traveling back up must feel amazing, wasn't it?"
00:29:09,00:29:10,Oh yeah
00:29:10,00:29:15,They do a little dance before they have a poo every time as well
00:29:15,00:29:16,And that's unusual for sloths is it?
00:29:16,00:29:17,Yes
00:29:17,00:29:21,Why do they have to dig a little hole in the ground?
00:29:21,00:29:22,"And it must the jiggly must help, wasn't it?"
00:29:22,00:29:24,I'm sure it does yeah yeah
00:29:24,00:29:27,And the thing is the reason one of the reasons we think that they do this just once a week
00:29:27,00:29:30,Is because it's extremely dangerous for them to go to the toilet
00:29:30,00:29:33,Because they're nice and safe in their little tree
00:29:33,00:29:35,No one can see them the really well camouflaged
00:29:35,00:29:37,They're really slow no one can see them move
00:29:37,00:29:41,But of course when they go down to do this they're really kind of vulnerable
00:29:41,00:29:47,And apparently more than half of sloth fatalities occur when they are doing their business
00:29:47,00:29:52,Well that's the thing so their main predators are both I think tigers and eagles
00:29:52,00:29:53,Yeah
00:29:53,00:29:55,What a bad luck right?
00:29:55,00:29:58,Like imagine that being your predator
00:29:58,00:30:03,"You've got two predators as I, oh so it's like a type of ant and a sausage dog"
00:30:03,00:30:04,That would be fine
00:30:04,00:30:05,An eagle
00:30:05,00:30:07,What organism are you possibly thinking of?
00:30:07,00:30:11,So this is the weird thing
00:30:11,00:30:12,When they're in captivity
00:30:12,00:30:15,Sloths have a poo once every day
00:30:15,00:30:18,Which suggests that they really really want to have a poo once every day
00:30:18,00:30:20,And that in captivity they know they're safe they can do
00:30:20,00:30:23,Because when you're in the wild the shame of dying
00:30:23,00:30:26,Basically they're all dying like Elvis Presley died aren't they
00:30:26,00:30:29,They're half of them dying on the toilet you don't want to risk that
00:30:29,00:30:31,And we don't know why they go down to the bottom
00:30:31,00:30:33,Well there's a great theory
00:30:33,00:30:35,Okay so the theory is they have this algae on them which grows
00:30:35,00:30:39,And some of these species of algae are specific to a single species of sloth
00:30:39,00:30:41,So it's quite specific stuff
00:30:41,00:30:46,But they're in this weird love triangle with some algae and some moths
00:30:46,00:30:47,So they go down to the ground
00:30:47,00:30:50,There are these moths which live in their fur
00:30:50,00:30:54,And because sloths move so slowly they can never groom themselves to get rid of the moths
00:30:54,00:30:56,Because as soon as they move their claw over to their arm
00:30:56,00:30:58,The moths just walks out of the way
00:30:58,00:31:01,So that's because they can fly moths
00:31:01,00:31:02,Yeah exactly
00:31:02,00:31:03,It's a bit of a kick in the teeth
00:31:03,00:31:05,It's a bit walk away from them
00:31:05,00:31:07,I know they just stroll off they don't care
00:31:07,00:31:11,So the moths lay their eggs in the poo of the sloths
00:31:11,00:31:12,Right
00:31:12,00:31:15,And then the the moths live
00:31:15,00:31:18,They fly up when they hatch into the sloths fur
00:31:18,00:31:19,They live there
00:31:19,00:31:20,They die
00:31:20,00:31:23,That algae that we talked about
00:31:23,00:31:26,Grows because of the nutrients released when the moths die
00:31:26,00:31:29,So the moth die they release nitrogen and the algae feeds on that
00:31:29,00:31:31,And we think that the algae is beneficial to the sloths
00:31:31,00:31:32,We don't know how
00:31:32,00:31:34,But it's either because it camouflages them
00:31:34,00:31:37,Or because maybe they groom themselves that they might eat it
00:31:37,00:31:38,Although that's a bit controversial
00:31:38,00:31:44,Also it can apparently contains some agents that kind of work against things like malaria
00:31:44,00:31:46,Right okay so whatever it's doing
00:31:46,00:31:47,It's definitely helping the sloth survive
00:31:47,00:31:51,Yeah so that's why they need to go down is for the moth life cycle
00:31:51,00:31:53,And then the moths feed the algae and the algae help the sloth
00:31:53,00:31:59,No but I don't risk that just for the sake of nurturing a few moths
00:31:59,00:32:01,Who might poo green all over you
00:32:01,00:32:03,And maybe camouflage your maybe not
00:32:03,00:32:04,No just one
00:32:04,00:32:07,Well another theory is that they go down and they do their business
00:32:07,00:32:11,And that is kind of telling the female sloths where they are
00:32:11,00:32:15,And there's information in that dung that tells them that they're fit
00:32:15,00:32:17,And good people to mate with
00:32:17,00:32:19,And so maybe it's like a sloth tinder kind of thing
00:32:19,00:32:23,Yeah wow it's like a reproductive system thing where they're going
00:32:23,00:32:27,I'm photol I'm ready so actually they go down a lot more
00:32:27,00:32:30,Than they usually would when they're ready for a child
00:32:30,00:32:33,And as a result they build this mountain of poo going
00:32:33,00:32:37,I want babies and that's what they see in the like
00:32:37,00:32:40,Whoa look how awesome this is and then they go up the tree
00:32:40,00:32:42,That is an alarming tip the profile
00:32:42,00:32:47,Just huge steaming calls of poo
00:32:47,00:32:50,Everything is not tinder it's a different pineapple
00:32:50,00:32:53,If you work with sloths you're not allowed to wear perfume
00:32:53,00:32:54,Because their hair is so absorbent
00:32:54,00:32:57,So they can have algae growing inside their own hair
00:32:57,00:33:00,It's very weird it grows on the outside and also on the inside
00:33:00,00:33:05,So if you wear perfume it can get into their fur basically
00:33:05,00:33:06,And it stays with them for weeks
00:33:06,00:33:08,So you're not allowed to wear perfume
00:33:08,00:33:10,You're not allowed to wear things like suntan lotion
00:33:10,00:33:12,Which is a problem because of where they live
00:33:12,00:33:15,And you're not even allowed to wear anti mosquitos spray
00:33:15,00:33:17,If you're cuddling sloths we're living
00:33:17,00:33:18,And you have to get very good at climbing trees
00:33:18,00:33:22,Apparently there's I think the person who's done a lot on sloths recently
00:33:22,00:33:23,Who's often in new scientists and stuff
00:33:23,00:33:24,Is someone called Rebecca Cliff
00:33:24,00:33:27,Who took a tree climbing course
00:33:27,00:33:28,And still said that it was impossible
00:33:28,00:33:31,She was outsmarted and outpaced by the sloths
00:33:31,00:33:32,Because by the time she got out the tree
00:33:32,00:33:35,They'd be on a different tree
00:33:35,00:33:39,And she found that she had to get Guatemalan free climbers
00:33:39,00:33:41,To go and get the sloths for her when she wanted to study
00:33:41,00:33:44,I read one article about sloths in trees
00:33:44,00:33:46,And that is that what they do is equivalent
00:33:46,00:33:49,You know those gymnasts who do that kind of
00:33:49,00:33:51,It's like a crucifix position on the rings
00:33:51,00:33:53,They're like oh yeah
00:33:53,00:33:55,Which is unbelievably hard for humans to do
00:33:55,00:33:57,Apparently sloths just do that really easily
00:33:57,00:33:59,They can just do it all of them do that all the time
00:33:59,00:33:59,Right
00:33:59,00:34:01,But they do fall out quite a lot
00:34:01,00:34:01,Do they?
00:34:01,00:34:03,This is one thing she said was
00:34:03,00:34:05,If you see a sloth fall out of a tree
00:34:05,00:34:07,Which happens alarmingly often
00:34:07,00:34:09,I mean they seem to just be popping out
00:34:09,00:34:12,There was a story that babies would fall out
00:34:12,00:34:14,Because they mistake their own limbs for tree branches
00:34:14,00:34:16,They're held onto their limbs and fall
00:34:16,00:34:17,But I don't know if that's true
00:34:17,00:34:18,It's not true unfortunately
00:34:18,00:34:20,I mean fortunately but it's
00:34:20,00:34:22,No no no it's probably a myth
00:34:22,00:34:24,But the babies do fall out quite a bit
00:34:24,00:34:25,And if they do fall out
00:34:25,00:34:27,The mothers will not go down and get them
00:34:27,00:34:29,The babies are dead at that point
00:34:29,00:34:31,Whereas they will go down to take a poo
00:34:31,00:34:33,They will not go down and fetch their baby
00:34:33,00:34:35,So infant mortality very high
00:34:35,00:34:35,Because
00:34:35,00:34:37,So I've read they can be really fast
00:34:37,00:34:38,They want to be
00:34:38,00:34:39,Really what? Sorry
00:34:39,00:34:43,Fast I read that the top speed of a sloth
00:34:43,00:34:45,Is 15 miles per hour
00:34:45,00:34:46,Oh come on
00:34:46,00:34:46,Yeah
00:34:46,00:34:48,Faster than a pet
00:34:48,00:34:49,That's if they're falling out of a tree
00:34:49,00:34:50,I can believe that
00:34:50,00:34:53,But supposedly I read this from a zoologist
00:34:53,00:34:55,It's a it's a double bluff basically
00:34:55,00:34:56,Their slowness is real
00:34:56,00:34:58,It takes them 30 days to digest a leaf
00:34:58,00:35:00,They are a slow being
00:35:00,00:35:01,But when something is threatening them
00:35:01,00:35:03,They're able to be very speedy
00:35:03,00:35:05,She said faster than a cat can run
00:35:05,00:35:06,On the street
00:35:06,00:35:07,No way
00:35:07,00:35:07,Yeah
00:35:07,00:35:09,"Probably no, probably no"
00:35:09,00:35:14,There is a self-help book that came out of the last year or so
00:35:14,00:35:15,"Called ""Be more sloth"""
00:35:15,00:35:18,It's by Alison Davis
00:35:18,00:35:20,And she says that you should be more still
00:35:20,00:35:22,You should turn things upside down
00:35:22,00:35:23,Be more intentional
00:35:23,00:35:23,Be kind to yourselves
00:35:23,00:35:25,And be more positive
00:35:25,00:35:27,Which apparently these are all things that sloths do
00:35:27,00:35:30,And have a very very very high fiber diet
00:35:30,00:35:32,Well she says on the front cover
00:35:32,00:35:36,The winner of the race isn't always the one who comes first
00:35:36,00:35:37,Incorrect
00:35:37,00:35:38,Yeah
00:35:38,00:35:41,That's the definition of the winner of the race
00:35:41,00:35:45,Okay that's it that is all of our facts
