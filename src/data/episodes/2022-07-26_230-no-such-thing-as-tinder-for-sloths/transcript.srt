 Hello and welcome to another episode of

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 this week coming to you from the wilderness festival!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Ani Chazinski, James

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,800
 Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again we have gathered around the

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
 microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
 and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with our first

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,560
 fact, this week that's my fact. My fact is, according to a new scientific

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,440
 study, the best way to perform CPR is to do it while humming

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,920
 the Macarena. How cool is that? And I think they recommend humming it because

18
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
 they probably don't believe if you're trying to save someone life and you're

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,400
 going "hamadamba temadamba temamakarena, you're the right person to be doing it."

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
 Are they even chalyrics? Are you just dead then?

21
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,320
 Does anyone know the actual lyrics? I think everyone knows the word macarena

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,920
 and know what the word in that song is. Yeah, exactly. But it's what it is about

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,080
 this song is that it has a BPM so every song has a B per minute and this BPM

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,880
 is 103 and as a result, when they're trying to teach people the perfect

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
 counts that you need on a chest as you're trying to save someone's life,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,760
 the macarena happens to be the perfect amount. And before that, they used to

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,440
 think it was staying alive by the beaches. That's right.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,400
 Because that's about 103 or 104 as well. Yeah. But actually also maybe it's

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,640
 supposed to be about 100 is the best, right? But macarena is good because

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,280
 everyone kind of knows the beat of that so it's good to do. But I thought I'd

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
 look at some others that are 100 beats per minute. So if anyone's having a

32
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,120
 heart attack, you should try these ones. Crazy and loved by BeyoncÃ©.

33
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,640
 Yeah. Independent women by Destiny's Child.

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
 Any of these work. Hips don't lie by Shakira. That's my favourite.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,760
 Or my chemical romance dead. Yeah. Not a good one.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,680
 That's not a good one. I've found a few more. So Simon and Garfunkel bridge over

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
 Troubled Water. If it's just a nice mood, you want to chill everyone out with that?

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
 Sometimes the situation doesn't need something fun.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,880
 Okay. Sometimes poignancy is needed.

40
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,080
 Well, the way they sing that on the X Factor, which is the slowest song in the

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,560
 history of time. Oh, okay. Well, how about this one?

42
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,360
 It doesn't have any beat. It doesn't have any beat. You just, you'd pause on

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,480
 Lacka Bridge. That is how you do slow.

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da

45
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,500
 It gets to the next. It's a good way of multitasking and fair sharing. So Macarena is by lost Del Rio. Yes

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,960
 Okay, and this is very much a one-hit wonder isn't it? They never had any other hits. Oh James

47
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,820
 I have got at least one of the other hits right here on my paper. What? It's Macarena Christmas

48
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,760
 It's released about 18 months after Macarena and it is a kiddie not the worst song ever released

49
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,520
 It's a it's a medley of jingle bells joined to the world rude off the Red Nose reindeer and the Macarena

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,020
 Wow, and they just break off and they do a bit of Macarena

51
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,900
 I'm at least I think five or six albums. One of them was Macarena non-stop

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,600
 Which the compilation album it only has eight tracks and five of them at the Macarena

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,380
 But you know what's amazing about lost Del Rio this band they got together in

54
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:00,400
 1964 I believe it was 62 or 64 the same year that the Rolling Stones got together

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
 Okay, they had their hit 32 years into their career

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,480
 That was finally they were like should we give up I'm sure we're gonna hit it one day mates

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,000
 Let's do it and they did and then they must have thought wow

58
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,640
 We've made it and that was the end of their career. Yeah

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,280
 That's still going that's still performing. But are they I when I'm researching this I read an article from

60
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,880
 1999 the headline of which was does anyone remember the Macarena? I mean, and that's what was that what a stupid article

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,200
 Everyone remembers the Macarena I watched a video you know you come see these on YouTube where they show teenagers stuff from the 90s

62
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,560
 Or whatever and see if they know what it is. Yeah, every single one of them knew what the Macarena was

63
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,560
 Yeah, no one knew the band, but they all knew the song. Yeah, and in 2003 so that's 10 years after the record was released

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,360
 They were still making a quarter of a million dollars a year royalties. Wow

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,560
 And it's extraordinary the original Macarena dance there was an original this that was the second dance

66
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,600
 It was when they made the video when there was a remix done of the song the first one was an incredibly complicated flamingo dance

67
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,200
 That was done in clubs. You would have to be an expert in order to do it

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,480
 It had doubled the amount of moves that the original

69
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,160
 Verse had was invented by a don't like a random aerobic teacher or dance teacher or something. Yeah, me a fire

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, or me a fry. She was in the video clip and so she wanted something that kids could dance to and adults

71
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,480
 Who have to go to nightclubs, but don't know how to dance could dance to so the four of us bow to her

72
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,880
 You've saved us actually Macarena. It's about a woman called Macarena

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:41,420
 But the name Macarena was originally Mac Delayna and it was just a word for like a sensuous woman and it comes from Mary Mac Delayna

74
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:45,440
 Then it was a word for any kind of prostitute and then it was a word for a sensuous woman, right?

75
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,680
 So really it should be hey Mac Delayna hey prostitute

76
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,480
 Well, and it's about a woman who prostitute in the song the lyrics are actually the woman saying

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,760
 Don't worry about my boyfriend. He's gone off to fight

78
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,240
 You two are his best mates. Do you want to shag and said is that Macarena?

79
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,680
 It's not a good message to be sending 12 year olds at this goes no

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,000
 This is this is just a little nugget. I enjoyed it went to number one in France

81
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,920
 It went to number one in a number of countries, but not in the UK not in the UK

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,440
 because because it was the world by

83
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,120
 TLC no one to be by the spice girls. No

84
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,680
 Wow, that's bad look wasn't it because it's like the biggest song of all time

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,080
 But yeah, I'm up against there was a big there was a big gospel around the room at that 20-year-old chopped news. Yeah

86
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,640
 Hey guys and blood be to aces to number one as well

87
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,680
 How do you think they were probably sad but quietly confident going? It's all right

88
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,760
 We've got Macarena Christmas in the bag. We'll be

89
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,600
 We'll be back and then to become one came out they have

90
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,960
 So in France they went to number one. Do you know what song they knocked off the number one?

91
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,280
 Oh, it's a French song. No, no, it's gonna regret re-en the only French time anyone knows

92
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,760
 It was the theme tune to the ex files. Oh, yeah

93
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,480
 That was number one that was number one in France. I think that was the one that you oh it did well in the UK

94
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,760
 Isn't that tubular bells Mike feel Mike old field did a cover of it later. How weird is that?

95
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,640
 You're thinking the exorcist. Yeah. Yeah. Should we talk about CPR?

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
 Yes

97
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,400
 If you have a problem with CPR as in so a lot of people are quite light and it's you need a lot of pressure to get

98
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,760
 Someone's just deep enough to get the blood flowing while you wait for the ambulance

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:45,040
 So if you are like a tip is to jump on the person who you're trying to administer you could actually be doing the macarena

100
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,800
 Well, kind of yes you could

101
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,240
 Wow, sorry. I say tip and I like there's no medical advice on this stage. I think I was better say yes

102
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,920
 Don't use this tip. There is a doctor though who does recommend using the feet

103
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,960
 I think people have said especially if you're a bit older

104
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,520
 You've lost some of your muscle strength and but also advice now or advice releasing 2010

105
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,000
 It's always changing is don't do the breathing anymore none of the snogging you just do the hands to the heart

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,240
 Don't you just do the heart. So you're doing a bit there isn't so much fun. Yeah, exactly just the jumping up and down

107
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,400
 The mouth to mouth one is really weird because it kind of was discovered in the 18th century

108
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,080
 And then it just got forgotten about for about 50 to 100 years and basically no one did it at all

109
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,560
 And then it came back and the reason they stopped it is because they realized what was coming out of your mouth when you breathe

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,640
 And it's carbon dioxide and they were saying well, what's the point of breathing carbon dioxide into someone's lungs because they breathe oxygen

111
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,040
 Yeah, and you know what the answer is to know why that's not true

112
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:47,360
 No, it's because when you breathe in and breathe out you actually only absorb about 40% of the oxygen sort of still plenty of oxygen in your breath

113
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,800
 Any kind of oxygen is better than okay, so how long if we started it?

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,840
 So if someone breathed in at the edge of the room here and then they passed the breath around the room

115
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:06,120
 How long would it be before there was no point in that exercise? I think it's worth a try, isn't it? All right. I feel an experiment coming up. Okay. I think we should start with that topless guy. You're in that old

116
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,440
 But people that tried all sorts of weird CPR over the ages

117
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:16,480
 They used to be the barrel type where you there was a big round barrel and you were sort of strapped to it

118
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,120
 Face down with your stomach over the barrel and I don't know how you did this so quickly when someone's obviously dying of a heart attack in front of you

119
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,200
 And then as the person who's saving them you sort of stood in between their legs and you roll them

120
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,920
 On and off the barrel, don't you? And it was the idea was that it eventually forced your heart into going in really?

121
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,480
 Yeah, yeah, it's like one of those did you ever go to playgrounds where you would run on a barrel that span round and round

122
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,800
 Yeah, but I've seen cartoons where that helped. Right

123
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,080
 That will that's medical advice from the Victorian age

124
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,120
 Hey, we need to move on to our next fact shortly. Oh, can I just there was so you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth and CPR to animals

125
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,600
 Weirdly successfully. Yeah, I've no

126
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,460
 Yeah, you know how people are always giving mouth to mouth to animals. Weirdly successful. There was a guy this you're gonna talk about the guy this year with the

127
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:08,960
 Frog there's a guy this year who did it with a frog after the frog happening here. Oh, is this your fact? No, it's not mine

128
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,520
 Actually mine was the one I was gonna say down. Let's do your effect. You do the frog thing. Let's

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:22,320
 No, this was a this was a deer and it was a deer who was drowning in a swimming pool and an RSP-ZA officer was called and he got the deer out of the pool

130
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,040
 And he gave it chest compressions and see CPR and mouth to mouth. Give it the kiss of life until it choked

131
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,960
 He said it properly like in films coughed water into his mouth

132
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,080
 And then and then he started choking it then had to give him CPR

133
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,280
 Where does the frog come into this? Yeah

134
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,360
 And you know the deer got up he brushed it down and then he said the deer looked at him and then ran away

135
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,840
 Sweet, yeah, it's a good story, I know, but I just wonder has anything happened with any smaller maybe amphibious?

136
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,300
 No, it hasn't I think we're moving on interestingly a frog

137
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,000
 This is a great story. There was a I can't wait this guy was walking just

138
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,480
 Minding his own business when he came across a snake on the ground and the snake was choking

139
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,920
 And he thought I'm not gonna give CPR to a snake. How could you tell a snake is choking? It was sort of like doing that

140
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,480
 Okay, yeah, yeah, and suddenly out of its mouth shoots a frog

141
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
 So it swallowed the frog, but the the frog forced its way back out

142
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:25,200
 Okay, but in the process died the man saw the frog and he gave CPR to the frog and he brought it back to life

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
 Yeah, and he brought the rope home. What happens to this snake?

144
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,200
 He doesn't feature in the rest of the story

145
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:44,800
 All right, look we need to be about to our next fact it is time for fact number two and that is Chazinsky

146
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:51,640
 My fact this week is that Donald Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal for himself when he wrote the art of the deal

147
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:59,940
 This is because a so Tony Schwartz was a guy who ghost wrote the art of the deal with Trump and he gave a talk a while back

148
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,200
 And he openly said Trump negotiated an extremely bad deal with me. I got a great deal out of it

149
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,520
 He didn't unheard of things so there was an advance of half a million dollars for the art of the deal and Trump gave his

150
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,840
 Ghostwriter 50% of the advance and then 50% of all the royalties

151
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,360
 So this guy has just been making millions and millions from this book

152
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,640
 This is unheard of in publishing. I think someone who a negotiating professor

153
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,480
 Called Deepak Malhotra said there is not a better deal out there in the world for ghost writing

154
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,080
 And then when the book came out Trump hosted an absolutely massive party then he and Trump tower

155
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,280
 I think it was there was a big red carpet loads of celebrities came

156
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,560
 There was a giant cake replica of Trump tower and then he went to his ghost writer and he went well

157
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,640
 You owe me 50% for the price of this party and the ghost writer went, I don't think so

158
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:54,320
 And he ended up paying about a thousand pounds just fed the drinks that him and his friends

159
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,440
 Do you know what the inspiration for the book was for the book the art of the deal?

160
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,260
 No, there was an article all about Trump in GQ and it was a popular article as in that issue of GQ

161
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,260
 So well because Trump was on the front cover. He was a businessman at the time and then they thought

162
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
 Why don't we see if we can turn this into a book?

163
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,980
 So they tested out what the book would look like they designed a dummy cover and then it had a picture of him

164
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,820
 looking heroic on the front and then they wrapped it around a thick Russian novel and thought what it would look like a

165
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,380
 thick Russian novel

166
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:32,800
 Guys the clues were there from the stars. Wow. No, okay. All right. Oh, we go

167
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,520
 What's exciting is you've all heard something that won't be in the actual show and we release it so that's

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:45,420
 He has a bad record of deal-making though, right? He's this was actually an article by Jonathan Frieden

169
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:52,080
 I think in the Guardian pointed out his deal-making history, but so the apprentice first series extremely successful

170
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,920
 So he asked for an increase in what he was paid. I think it's per episode. He got 50 grand

171
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,680
 He asked for an increase to one million dollars

172
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,600
 That's good deal-making, isn't it? That sounds like a deal-making. He ended up with 60 grand

173
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,840
 But no, a lot of people say not a good deal-maker someone else who's done a deal with him said he seems way too keen

174
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:18,520
 You've got to seem cool. He sort of paces around the room like he's wearing a sign saying desperate and who said that Vladimir

175
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
 What was he called?

176
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
 He chose to remain anonymous

177
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,800
 Do you know he he released a novel years ago? Yeah called Trump Tower and and then he

178
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,280
 Effectively unreleased it in that the novel still exists, but he took his name off

179
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,080
 So it was ghost-ridden by someone else and he had his name though

180
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:44,080
 It was a Donald Trump book. It was called Trump Tower and it was a it was a book based on an idea for a TV show that he developed

181
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,360
 Which was meant to be Trump Tower done like the TV show Dallas or all those American soaps

182
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,400
 It was the life of all the people that worked in Trump Tower and they got a pilot

183
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,560
 But the pilot didn't get made so they ended up doing this book and on the front

184
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
 It said it was the sexiest novel of the decade. Wow. Which decade?

185
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,280
 It was 2011 was it was it was old 2011. It's a current. It's he's he's predicted

186
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:16,080
 We still cannot top the sexiness of this book. Wow. It was an erotic novel, wasn't it? Yeah, that's novel and so I was reading some snippets of it

187
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,140
 It is this is how erotic it is

188
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:26,500
 So someone walks into a room a guest in Trump Tower and sees at least six women not wearing tops and says I must be dead

189
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
 I've gone to boob heaven

190
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,900
 That's an actual line in an actual novel

191
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:37,060
 He's just very quickly. He's also really good for books Donald Trump because anytime he tweets about a book

192
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,540
 That he doesn't like it does really well

193
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,620
 So for example fire and fury became massive off the back of him taking it down

194
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,980
 Yeah, and there was a very famous. He's a civil rights icon in America called John Lewis and he wrote a number of books

195
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,500
 And he wrote a tweet saying I don't think he's fit for president and Trump took him down massively as a result

196
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,820
 The sales increase of his books were over a hundred thousand percent

197
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:06,340
 And in the weekend of the tweet seven of the top 20 books were attributed to John Lewis all his books just rose to the top

198
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,100
 Wow, he's actually good for book sales if he hates you

199
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,060
 The John Lewis Brown is very different in America, isn't it?

200
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:19,020
 Yes, yeah, I've got a couple of bad deals from history. Okay, I've researched so the fact being that

201
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,100
 Trump negotiated a bad deal for the order of the deal. I thought this was quite fun

202
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,980
 There's a in America the NFL. There's a team the Green Bay Packers and they had a player called Mirror

203
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,060
 MIRER

204
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,180
 Yeah, I never heard of it. Okay. He was he was a big deal back in the day and his contract

205
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:41,740
 He was so wanted by this team that his agent put a clause in the contract that they eventually the team had to sign and the clause was

206
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,740
 That my mirror would be paid under all conditions, and then this is the clause up to and including the end of the world

207
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,180
 Including the end of the world

208
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,740
 So if some people survived and he was one of them and they were one of them

209
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,300
 They would still pay him for all the apocalyptic future that they lived through

210
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,300
 They were the last two people other

211
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:13,820
 I've got a bad deal. Oh, yeah, so there's a famous story about the Dutch buying Manhattan Island from the Native Americans for a very small amount of money and

212
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,780
 Them's thinking oh these Native Americans they don't understand the value of property

213
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:24,900
 They don't stand the contact of property rights. They absolutely did the problem was the Dutch bought Manhattan from the Canasi Native Americans

214
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,460
 Who happened to live next door in Long Island and did not live in Manhattan?

215
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,340
 They only use the island of Manhattan to get drunk in

216
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,860
 The Dutch showed up and they offered to buy the place on these people saying is this your place? Oh great. We'll buy this for it

217
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,900
 So it's like going to a pub and offering a random man standing outside the pub quite drunk

218
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,340
 100,000 pounds for this building. I got another sporty one

219
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,820
 This is a there's a Swedish soccer player called Stefan Schwartz. Do you remember him James?

220
00:17:51,820 --> 00:18:00,620
 So he was paid a four million pound deal with Sunderland for the English Premier League the condition that he had to sign when he was signing

221
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,380
 Which for him was a bad deal is he was not allowed to go to space

222
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,540
 That was the oh

223
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,740
 Yeah, he wanted to be a space Taurus. He was obsessed with going to space

224
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,580
 They were like he's obsessed so much. We just have to say no you've got to play football. Yeah, we're gonna

225
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,940
 Put that in the contract to me. That's a deal breaker - is it right?

226
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:26,420
 We need to move on to our next facts. We do that. Okay. It is time for fact number three and that is Andy

227
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,660
 My fact is that on the bio tapestry you can tell how important someone is by the size of their horse's penis

228
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:39,300
 Um, so there's a professor at the University of Oxford. He's called George Garnett

229
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,620
 He has gone through the bio tapestry the whole thing rigorously counting the horses and their penises

230
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,820
 And the human there are the same number of penises as

231
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,700
 Well, it might be some female horses. There are some female horses. I've got they didn't have penises. Yeah

232
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,860
 I think they all work for full you

233
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:03,780
 Um, I think they're written out. I think they might be hidden by a leg or yeah

234
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,900
 Sometimes someone standing in front of the horse or a musically holding a vase in front of the horse

235
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,620
 Yeah, or the horse is wearing a pair of novelty trousers

236
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,300
 Or it's a pantomime horse and they famously don't have penis. Well, they have two some of them

237
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:21,060
 Oh, my horses. Very good point. Um, so he counted all of these and he points out that

238
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,860
 King Harold

239
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,820
 Who came second in the Battle of Hastings? He has a horse which has a very large penis

240
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,500
 But there's one larger horse penis and that belongs to William the Conqueror

241
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,820
 So it's a it's a clear the the man who wins the battle has the largest horse's penis

242
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,900
 Wow, and this is new right this is a brother. No, no Tubby 66

243
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:50,180
 This is this is new. This is new research. This is breaking. This is to lot of people in the room

244
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,020
 This is like this is like the Spice Girls and the Macarena all over again. Yeah

245
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,100
 Yeah, so this is very exciting previously neglected research he counted all the human ones as well

246
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,420
 He did sorry. There are four and a half would you say?

247
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:14,600
 But I think what happened was a lot of people have kind of paid attention to this in the past because in Victorian times

248
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
 They were all edited out

249
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,700
 Yeah, and there is one guy who had a pair of underpants drawn on him or tapestry on him by the Victorians

250
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,880
 That was in the in the English one, right? There's an English wrap. Yeah, sorry in the replica

251
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,940
 Yeah, exactly, but this is the first time people have looked at all of them including the horse ones

252
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,080
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, so I can believe the so I don't actually know much about the Bay of Tapestry

253
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,900
 Not being English myself, so this yeah, and it's a frequent topic of conversation in English hubs of children

254
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,620
 I am so lost at dinner parties every time it comes up. I walk around the festival site here

255
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,620
 You'll find tools 300 people talking about the buyers

256
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,180
 Actually, it gets a bit boring sometimes, you know

257
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:58,020
 But I so I literally had no knowledge of it all so it's fascinating to know that this thing was a it was

258
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,580
 68 70 meters long. Yep, which is incredibly long if you put that into context

259
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:10,160
 That's about 30 meters less than 100. No, it's like that would take you saying both roughly seven seconds to run

260
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,820
 Yeah, the fastest man running at the Bayer tapestry

261
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,580
 The the thing is as well as that a turns out it's not a tapestry at all. No, it's embroidery

262
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,860
 So it's got the wrong name

263
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:29,580
 But also if you read the whole thing up until recently when they when they decided to fix this the final scene is missing

264
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,340
 Imagine reading 70 meters of story and getting to the final scene and someone's ripped the page out as in the

265
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,240
 Williams coronation isn't it? Yeah, yeah, and they added it so they finished was it 2013?

266
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,880
 I think yeah, and they did it on an on an island on a channel island

267
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,100
 There was over a hundred four hundred people that did it and one of the stitches was done by Prince Charles

268
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,080
 So despite the fact it lives over in France made using British royalty

269
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,260
 And a lot of people think it was made in Britain anyway in Kent and a lot of people think it was made completely by women because of the

270
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:10,140
 Penises in fact, so historians think that there are there is the occasional erect penis on a dead soldier

271
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:18,660
 And the theory is that the tapestry or embroidery was therefore stitched by women and the women were ridiculing the men for the fact that they used

272
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:23,980
 War to show off their manhood, so it was thought to be kind of a satirical thing when we're saying you idiots

273
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,140
 So the people used to fight with no trousers. Yeah, really. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

274
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:36,580
 No, there was a battle wasn't there were the English had terrible dysentery of the area of the trousers

275
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,780
 That was Henry the fifth so it was about as you call it was about a magical

276
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,860
 Yeah, but so why are they naked people in there if people were trousers the naked people are mostly in the margins

277
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,900
 Yes, so there's the main bit there's the main strip of the biotapestry

278
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,420
 Yeah, I think the main story of the battle and then at the top and the bottom there are these margins

279
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,220
 This is an amazing thing where they're I love the embroidery because you when you see old art you assume

280
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:03,380
 Oh, it must be done perfect, you know the perspective and everything and there's a couple of moments in the tapestry where they've run out of space

281
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,820
 So there's a there's four people holding a chest on on four sticks or two sticks rather four of them and

282
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,540
 There's three of them that are nicely done, but they went a bit too high on the tapestry. So the fourth guy's head

283
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:22,460
 Just making a quick cameo into the tapestry when really it should have been gone

284
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,420
 My favorite part the biotapestry is the bit where Odo Earl of Kent is

285
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,660
 Whispering to William telling him what to do in the battle and it kind of makes him look like he's really the important person

286
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
 He was the architects of the whole invasion

287
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:43,420
 But it turns out that it seems like it was him who commissioned the tapestry. I gave himself a massive role in that although and he was

288
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,700
 Quite interesting wasn't he because he was never seen with spears or anything in the tapestry because he was a bishop

289
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,940
 And bishop's one allowed a shed blood. So instead he's always seen with a massive club

290
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,420
 So they're allowed to beat people around the head which apparently didn't draw any blood

291
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,180
 Yeah, have you seen the reviews of the biotapestry?

292
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,980
 They're great. They're well trip advisor reviews everything in the world

293
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:13,740
 And as with all things the most funny reviews are the one star ones. So there is a complaint actor. There is actually one star. Isn't the Haley's comic?

294
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:19,340
 Anyway, I feel like you're going to say something funny. Yeah, well, you know

295
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,300
 Thunder stolen

296
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,540
 No, so the reviews are things like so one review says we went on a visit to the biotapestry

297
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,700
 Big learning curve for some people

298
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,980
 We were walking along looking at the tapestry not much to see to be honest

299
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,580
 All of a sudden I see a large phallic object sewn on the tapestry

300
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,940
 This attraction is not displayed as containing adult content

301
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,860
 We have very young children who can see the penis which is an outrage

302
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,180
 I wanted to learn about medieval battles not medieval penises

303
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:54,380
 That's one star one star and there's another one star review which just says 9 quid and 40 minutes to see a carpet

304
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,420
 9 quid in seven seconds for who say molasses. It was very blurry

305
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:12,060
 I like the little touches in the tapestry because people used to add kind of slide digs at people or what they thought of certain figures in it

306
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:19,340
 So there's one there's one really nice but actually we're herald when herald first went over to see willing the concurrent front

307
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,780
 Him and his men then got in boats to go back across the channel to Britain

308
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,300
 And there's such a good picture of him and all his men holding up their kind of hose

309
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,980
 And all their stockings and everything and they've taken their shoes off. They're carrying their shoes

310
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,780
 And they're carrying their pets and stuff in their arms because they're waiting through the water to get to their boats

311
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:42,140
 And it's just it's just exactly like you know when you wrote a beach and you sort of wonder what that's

312
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,540
 They brought pets with them one person had a dog under his arm and another person was holding a bird which seems that necessary

313
00:25:52,700 --> 00:26:00,940
 Maybe a helper war dog or a snipper dog or something. Yeah, you know Nigel Farage was his favorite tie is a Bayer tapestry tie

314
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:04,220
 Because it reminds him of the last time Britain was invaded how long is it?

315
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,580
 It's the same way. Yeah, it's an exact replica to scale. Yeah, right. So it's just constantly

316
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,580
 Dranging behind him. He has some bridesmaids who carried it all the time

317
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,500
 That's interesting because when I was looking at an old old bishop of Bayer who was the guy who commissioned this

318
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,100
 I went on to the BBC website and they said that he was the least popular figure in Kent's history

319
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,660
 But then I looked up other people from Kent who were unpopular and Nigel Farage

320
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:35,980
 It's from Kent as well as the most unpopular person Nasty Nick from Big Brother One. Oh

321
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:40,700
 Don't tell these guys. They didn't even know about the Spice Girls chart history yet

322
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,340
 Nasty Nick will blow their mind

323
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,260
 We should move on to our final fact shortly anything before we do yeah should go for it

324
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,940
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is James. Okay, and my fact this week is that if you're a slough

325
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:59,660
 Every time you go for a poo, it's more painful than childbirth

326
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:08,700
 Is that you impersonating child? I was just trying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that more painful than human childbirth?

327
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,500
 I believe it is because actually slough childbirth is not that painful because baby sloths are super small

328
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,580
 They're about 14 ounces

329
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:22,780
 Whereas slough poo's are at least twice as big maybe more

330
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,900
 And they can lose up to one third of their body weight during death. Oh god

331
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,460
 They do it once a week

332
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:38,140
 It's the equivalent of if I did a poo there would be too big to check into a Thompson's flight

333
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,660
 I mean what's the purpose of your visit for a start?

334
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:50,780
 And the stomachs physically shrink every time they do it

335
00:27:50,780 --> 00:28:00,780
 But how do we have someone laid a woman mid-labor next to a slow mid-poo and what judge the volume of the screaming?

336
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:06,540
 I think how do we know you're right? I mean to be honest there's a bit of you know suposition going on here

337
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,540
 But basically it's the size and this is what we've said this before unlike other animals

338
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,100
 Sloths they only do this once a week

339
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,180
 They go down from the bottom of their tree

340
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,500
 And they do this and it can take like up to 50 days for the food to go through the system

341
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,300
 Because they're trying to get every single bit of nutrient out of it

342
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,540
 And so by the time it comes out, it's absolutely huge. It's just fibrous mass

343
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:29,820
 And it obviously must be extremely painful. Yeah

344
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,820
 And it's super heavy isn't it?

345
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,700
 So um well obviously like a third of their body weight and the problem with being a sloth is that you're upside down

346
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:41,180
 Basically all of your life and so your poo's all gone to the bottom waiting to come out

347
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:46,940
 And then it would the only thing that stops it all from crushing the rest of their organs is that

348
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,860
 Their bowels and everything like that literally hooks onto their ribcage

349
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,620
 Yeah, or onto the sides of their body because otherwise you know if it was loose hanging like ours are as soon as the sloth turns upside down

350
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,060
 This enormous weight of feces would crash all of the rest of its organs

351
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,140
 So all of its organs are kind of yeah hooked on

352
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,420
 It's amazing and then it goes down to the bottom of the tree does it's business and goes back up again

353
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,660
 And traveling back up must feel amazing, wasn't it?

354
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,700
 Oh yeah

355
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,100
 They do a little dance before they have a poo every time as well

356
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,860
 And that's unusual for sloths is it?

357
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,340
 Yes

358
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:21,100
 Why do they have to dig a little hole in the ground?

359
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,700
 And it must the jiggly must help, wasn't it?

360
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,220
 I'm sure it does yeah yeah

361
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,900
 And the thing is the reason one of the reasons we think that they do this just once a week

362
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,700
 Is because it's extremely dangerous for them to go to the toilet

363
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,420
 Because they're nice and safe in their little tree

364
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,500
 No one can see them the really well camouflaged

365
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,260
 They're really slow no one can see them move

366
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,100
 But of course when they go down to do this they're really kind of vulnerable

367
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,340
 And apparently more than half of sloth fatalities occur when they are doing their business

368
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:52,860
 Well that's the thing so their main predators are both I think tigers and eagles

369
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,100
 Yeah

370
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,900
 What a bad luck right?

371
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,860
 Like imagine that being your predator

372
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,100
 You've got two predators as I, oh so it's like a type of ant and a sausage dog

373
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,060
 That would be fine

374
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,260
 An eagle

375
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,180
 What organism are you possibly thinking of?

376
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,260
 So this is the weird thing

377
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,780
 When they're in captivity

378
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,100
 Sloths have a poo once every day

379
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,300
 Which suggests that they really really want to have a poo once every day

380
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,940
 And that in captivity they know they're safe they can do

381
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,900
 Because when you're in the wild the shame of dying

382
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,540
 Basically they're all dying like Elvis Presley died aren't they

383
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,660
 They're half of them dying on the toilet you don't want to risk that

384
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,580
 And we don't know why they go down to the bottom

385
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,260
 Well there's a great theory

386
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,980
 Okay so the theory is they have this algae on them which grows

387
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,740
 And some of these species of algae are specific to a single species of sloth

388
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,340
 So it's quite specific stuff

389
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,220
 But they're in this weird love triangle with some algae and some moths

390
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,980
 So they go down to the ground

391
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,060
 There are these moths which live in their fur

392
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,060
 And because sloths move so slowly they can never groom themselves to get rid of the moths

393
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,780
 Because as soon as they move their claw over to their arm

394
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,940
 The moths just walks out of the way

395
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,980
 So that's because they can fly moths

396
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,940
 Yeah exactly

397
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:03,980
 It's a bit of a kick in the teeth

398
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,340
 It's a bit walk away from them

399
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,020
 I know they just stroll off they don't care

400
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,900
 So the moths lay their eggs in the poo of the sloths

401
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,620
 Right

402
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,100
 And then the the moths live

403
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,140
 They fly up when they hatch into the sloths fur

404
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,100
 They live there

405
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,140
 They die

406
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:23,100
 That algae that we talked about

407
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,860
 Grows because of the nutrients released when the moths die

408
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,580
 So the moth die they release nitrogen and the algae feeds on that

409
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,980
 And we think that the algae is beneficial to the sloths

410
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,940
 We don't know how

411
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,940
 But it's either because it camouflages them

412
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:37,740
 Or because maybe they groom themselves that they might eat it

413
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,780
 Although that's a bit controversial

414
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,220
 Also it can apparently contains some agents that kind of work against things like malaria

415
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
 Right okay so whatever it's doing

416
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,820
 It's definitely helping the sloth survive

417
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,340
 Yeah so that's why they need to go down is for the moth life cycle

418
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,820
 And then the moths feed the algae and the algae help the sloth

419
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,020
 No but I don't risk that just for the sake of nurturing a few moths

420
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,180
 Who might poo green all over you

421
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,340
 And maybe camouflage your maybe not

422
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,460
 No just one

423
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,740
 Well another theory is that they go down and they do their business

424
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:11,820
 And that is kind of telling the female sloths where they are

425
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,500
 And there's information in that dung that tells them that they're fit

426
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,100
 And good people to mate with

427
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,980
 And so maybe it's like a sloth tinder kind of thing

428
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,420
 Yeah wow it's like a reproductive system thing where they're going

429
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,740
 I'm photol I'm ready so actually they go down a lot more

430
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,220
 Than they usually would when they're ready for a child

431
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,580
 And as a result they build this mountain of poo going

432
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,660
 I want babies and that's what they see in the like

433
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,860
 Whoa look how awesome this is and then they go up the tree

434
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,700
 That is an alarming tip the profile

435
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,100
 Just huge steaming calls of poo

436
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,940
 Everything is not tinder it's a different pineapple

437
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,180
 If you work with sloths you're not allowed to wear perfume

438
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,780
 Because their hair is so absorbent

439
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,500
 So they can have algae growing inside their own hair

440
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,460
 It's very weird it grows on the outside and also on the inside

441
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,020
 So if you wear perfume it can get into their fur basically

442
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,460
 And it stays with them for weeks

443
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,300
 So you're not allowed to wear perfume

444
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,860
 You're not allowed to wear things like suntan lotion

445
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,460
 Which is a problem because of where they live

446
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,100
 And you're not even allowed to wear anti mosquitos spray

447
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,020
 If you're cuddling sloths we're living

448
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,940
 And you have to get very good at climbing trees

449
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,060
 Apparently there's I think the person who's done a lot on sloths recently

450
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,580
 Who's often in new scientists and stuff

451
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,860
 Is someone called Rebecca Cliff

452
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,020
 Who took a tree climbing course

453
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,620
 And still said that it was impossible

454
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,020
 She was outsmarted and outpaced by the sloths

455
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,860
 Because by the time she got out the tree

456
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,420
 They'd be on a different tree

457
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,500
 And she found that she had to get Guatemalan free climbers

458
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,660
 To go and get the sloths for her when she wanted to study

459
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,860
 I read one article about sloths in trees

460
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,780
 And that is that what they do is equivalent

461
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,660
 You know those gymnasts who do that kind of

462
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,900
 It's like a crucifix position on the rings

463
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,100
 They're like oh yeah

464
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,180
 Which is unbelievably hard for humans to do

465
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,180
 Apparently sloths just do that really easily

466
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,180
 They can just do it all of them do that all the time

467
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,820
 Right

468
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,420
 But they do fall out quite a lot

469
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:01,980
 Do they?

470
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,580
 This is one thing she said was

471
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,340
 If you see a sloth fall out of a tree

472
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,420
 Which happens alarmingly often

473
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,260
 I mean they seem to just be popping out

474
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,540
 There was a story that babies would fall out

475
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,940
 Because they mistake their own limbs for tree branches

476
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,540
 They're held onto their limbs and fall

477
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,580
 But I don't know if that's true

478
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,860
 It's not true unfortunately

479
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,380
 I mean fortunately but it's

480
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,940
 No no no it's probably a myth

481
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,780
 But the babies do fall out quite a bit

482
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,820
 And if they do fall out

483
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,980
 The mothers will not go down and get them

484
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,260
 The babies are dead at that point

485
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
 Whereas they will go down to take a poo

486
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
 They will not go down and fetch their baby

487
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,020
 So infant mortality very high

488
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:35,740
 Because

489
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,580
 So I've read they can be really fast

490
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,780
 They want to be

491
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,660
 Really what? Sorry

492
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:43,020
 Fast I read that the top speed of a sloth

493
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,180
 Is 15 miles per hour

494
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,220
 Oh come on

495
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:46,940
 Yeah

496
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,060
 Faster than a pet

497
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,340
 That's if they're falling out of a tree

498
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,860
 I can believe that

499
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,500
 But supposedly I read this from a zoologist

500
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,260
 It's a it's a double bluff basically

501
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,620
 Their slowness is real

502
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,700
 It takes them 30 days to digest a leaf

503
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,220
 They are a slow being

504
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,820
 But when something is threatening them

505
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,020
 They're able to be very speedy

506
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,420
 She said faster than a cat can run

507
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,380
 On the street

508
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,180
 No way

509
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:07,660
 Yeah

510
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,820
 Probably no, probably no

511
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,140
 There is a self-help book that came out of the last year or so

512
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,420
 Called "Be more sloth"

513
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,460
 It's by Alison Davis

514
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,620
 And she says that you should be more still

515
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,140
 You should turn things upside down

516
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,020
 Be more intentional

517
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,980
 Be kind to yourselves

518
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,020
 And be more positive

519
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,660
 Which apparently these are all things that sloths do

520
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,140
 And have a very very very high fiber diet

521
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,940
 Well she says on the front cover

522
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,220
 The winner of the race isn't always the one who comes first

523
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,340
 Incorrect

524
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,540
 Yeah

525
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:41,180
 That's the definition of the winner of the race

526
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,900
 Okay that's it that is all of our facts

527
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,580
