00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish, which is the first

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.480
 in our run of live summer shows at the Soho Theatre in London.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.560
 We have all sorts of amazing guests lined up for you for the rest of the summer.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.000
 I won't go into that now, because I really don't want to spoil it, especially for the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680
 people who have tickets.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.640
 But what I can tell you is that in this week's show we were joined by Jamie Martin.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.280
 Now you will know Jamie if you listened to No Such Things a Fish before, because he has

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.800
 been on quite a few shows, this is his third appearance, but of course he is most well

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.280
 known for being one third of, let's be honest, the greatest British podcast of all time,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.480
 My Dad Rota Pono.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.040
 Now one important thing to say about that is that the My Dad Rota Pono team have chosen

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.720
 some of their funniest moments from across the six season run, including some unheard

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.000
 gems and they'll be releasing best off episodes once a month, starting on Monday the 31st

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 of June.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.880
 I absolutely can't wait for those best off shows, I'm sure you can't either, but in

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.680
 the meantime, please do enjoy this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish with Jamie

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:25.240
 Martin.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things a Fish, a weekly podcast this

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:38.000
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.880
 Jamie Morton and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.280
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 fact number one and that is Jamie.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.200
 My fact this week, boys, is in 1782 a woman found a drag performance so hilarious that

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.880
 she literally died of laughter.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.400
 Wow.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.560
 Probably not going to happen tonight, but not with me here for sure, but yeah, isn't

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.560
 that mad?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 Yeah, it's insane.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.440
 So this was an act, it was a play called Beggar's Opera and someone called Charles Bannister

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 who was playing a character called Polly Peacham and yeah, to give us a story.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.680
 Yeah, so Mrs Fitzherbert, suspiciously there's no first name, but she was a widow of a North

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 Hampton Shire clergyman, it was quite salacious that she was even at this kind of submersive

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:51.120
 show and she found it so funny that this man came out and he was described as Lantern

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.120
 jawed with five o'clock shadow and a double chin in a lovely pretty dress and she just

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.680
 found it so funny she just didn't stop laughing for three days.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
 Oh wow.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.760
 That's the amazing thing, like she had to leave the theatre didn't she because she was laughing

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.240
 so much but that's not when she died.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240
 No.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.680
 The newspaper report said she couldn't get the figure from her memory so just every morning

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.280
 she'd just wake up and go, "Ah!"

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.840
 I mean what a sheltered fucking life, I'm sorry, like if that makes you laugh that much to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.840
 kill you.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840
 Maybe it was a really good show.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
 Yeah, you know.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 Well the Beggar's Opera.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
 It's a classic.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280
 And the actor Bannister, he was one of the great actors of the day, he was very funny,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280
 he was famous.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.280
 The good name too.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 Charles Bannister.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280
 Charles Bannister.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.360
 Yeah, so John Gay, the Beggar's Opera actually, that was the first play which had songs in

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.320
 it that were part of the narrative of the Beggar's Opera, it's pretty much the first musical

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320
 I would say.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.320
 Yeah.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.880
 So it was more popular, there was a thing called Beggar Mania and so you could go around,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.440
 you could buy matchboxes, fans, fireguards, everything with this show on.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.800
 Oh, it's like no such thing as a fish.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.880
 On your tables there is a merchandise leaflet, I think it's got a QR code but genuinely as

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.880
 I can see it right there.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880
 Go nuts!

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.080
 Get us in with that merch.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.400
 Jamie, please, we rely on this, we rely on the merch, it's all that's keeping us going.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.520
 I was looking at people who had died on stage and I have a weird connection to one of these

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.520
 people.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:29.040
 So MoliÃ¨re, very famous French playwright, actor, he collapsed on stage ironically playing

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.400
 the lead in his final play called The Imaginary Invalid, so he literally died playing a hypochondriac.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400
 Right.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:43.680
 And I have also played the lead in The Imaginary Invalid.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.680
 Really?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 Yes.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.680
 Yes, I know.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.680
 That's cool.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680
 In my youth, it's not that cool.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
 Thank you.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.280
 I sort of said that on autopilot Jamie, I wasn't actually thinking that is really cool, don't

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280
 care at all.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.520
 But back in my youth when I used to tread the boards, I didn't die obviously.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.240
 The thing about him actually is because he was an actor, in those days actors couldn't

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.760
 go to heaven.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.760
 So if you, I'm not sure anyone could, let's not get into that, that's an actual medical

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.760
 matter.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.040
 But like, so the thing was, if you're an actor, it was like, yeah, you had to renounce your

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.080
 acting job before you died.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.560
 So on your death bed, you might say, oh, I was never really an actor or I wasn't a very

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.800
 good one or whatever and then you would be allowed to go to heaven.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.680
 If you've said I'm really more of a playwright, I'm more of a sort of immersive media creator

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.680
 really.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.960
 I facilitated the heathens, I wasn't one of them myself.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.840
 But yeah, and the thing was is that that meant that he was buried without, he wasn't allowed

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.360
 to be buried in the churchyard or anything like that because he died so quickly after

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
 this event.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
 Oh, wow, okay.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.680
 I wanted to see Molly I played a few years ago.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 Starring Jamie Morton?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.680
 Yes.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680
 No.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.680
 How was I?

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.680
 Be kind.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360
 It wasn't one with you in, but I did leave it halfway through.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.360
 Oh really?

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.360
 Yeah.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.440
 In a sense, Molly died a second time that night.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440
 Wow.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.440
 I'd say it's in the translation.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.000
 I think he's a fantastic playwright.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 I'm sure he is.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.160
 There was a school party all around us.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.160
 It is.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
 It was tricky.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.520
 They were not having a good time and neither were we.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.640
 I've got a little quiz for you guys.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.640
 Oh, great.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.640
 All right.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.200
 So this is, I'm going to say a thing, right, an object and you have to say what it's used

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.360
 for by the Royal Shakespeare Company as stage gore.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360
 Okay.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360
 Oh, great.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360
 I love this game.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.360
 In 2010, for example.

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 Shakespeare specifically.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 Yeah.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360
 Okay.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.360
 Right.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.360
 These are all used by the RSC, right?

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.360
 Right.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.720
 So in 2010, the Royal Shakespeare Company, they used three tins of lichies during their

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.220
 summer season.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.220
 Bubos.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.220
 Not buboes.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.220
 Ibls.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.220
 Ibls.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:51.220
 It wasn't actually an everyone play game.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220
 It was.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.220
 No.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220
 That's school parties in again.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.220
 Yeah.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.220
 Please do.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.220
 No.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.160
 Just, wait for a second.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160
 Just let them do it.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160
 Ibls.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 Yeah, that's it.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160
 Yeah.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.160
 We can end that.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.160
 Yeah.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.160
 No.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160
 Well done.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.160
 Well done to the people who knew it and thank you.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
 And yeah.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.160
 Ibls.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160
 Okay.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.160
 That's the cause.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.160
 What scene?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
 Yeah.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160
 Where they blind the Duke of Gloucester.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.160
 Okay.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160
 Yeah.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160
 He actually knew.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.160
 That's very impressive.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.160
 Okay.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.160
 Well, here's another one.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.160
 Yeah.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.160
 Chicken fillets.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.160
 Chicken fillets.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.160
 Bubes for bras.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.160
 To pump up the bras.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.160
 Actual.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160
 Well, that's a real thing.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160
 No, it's not.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160
 No.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160
 Actual chicken fillets.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:38.160
 Well, I've got an Amazon delivery from my wife that she's going to be very confused

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160
 about.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.160
 Flapping skin and muscles.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160
 Oh, nice.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.160
 Yeah.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.160
 No, it's...

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.160
 Anyone?

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160
 Anyone in the audience?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.160
 Ears.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.160
 Ears.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160
 Tongues.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.160
 Tongues.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.160
 And finally, tinned pears.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160
 Tinned pears.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160
 Tinned pears.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160
 Tennis book.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160
 No.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160
 What?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160
 Nothing.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160
 Tennis.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160
 I didn't even say that.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
 I only said half of it and then I pulled back.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160
 Yeah.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.160
 I think testicles is a good call.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160
 Okay, testicles.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160
 All right.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160
 Idiot.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160
 You complete full deck.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160
 No, it's penises.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
 It's penises.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.160
 Tinned pears for penises.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160
 Sorry?

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160
 What?

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.160
 He's serious.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160
 Yeah.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.160
 Don't...

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.160
 Andy.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160
 What?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160
 Sorry, what's the question?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:27.160
 I've either been buying some really odd pears or I need to see a doctor.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.160
 I think they're shaped a little bit, but I think it's the consistency.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.160
 Consistency?

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.160
 Consistency of a tinned pear.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
 Also, what are they doing with these fake penises that they need a good consistency?

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.160
 Yeah.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.160
 I'm not sure I've seen that Shakespeare play where they all get their cocks out.

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:44.160
 What?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160
 Which one is that?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.160
 Yeah.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.160
 Is it measure for measure?

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.160
 That's right.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.160
 Very good.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.160
 I don't actually...

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
 Yeah.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160
 That's amazing.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160
 There we go.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.160
 They're real.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.160
 They have an amazing department.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.160
 Their fake blood is a...

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.160
 Could it be that you put it in your stockings and it gives you a shape, maybe?

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.160
 I think it was for some...

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.160
 There's some horrible...

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160
 Titus Andronicus has lots of terrible torture and gore and all this stuff.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160
 So they do like...

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160
 It's rare.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.160
 It's not across the canon that you need a tinned pear in the department.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160
 But they've got these...

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.160
 A tinned pear?

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.160
 Their fake blood recipe is secret and they've got three different consistencies.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.160
 And there was an interview with Helen Hughes, who's one of their very senior prop and design people.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.160
 And she was being interviewed about fake blood.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
 And the interviewer asked her, like, what kind of...

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 What do you use for your fake blood?

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
 And she said, what kind of blood?

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160
 There's venal blood, arterial blood, newly dry blood, crusty old blood.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.160
 They've got...

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.160
 They can do all of it.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160
 All the bloods.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
 She's an artist.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.160
 She's an artist.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160
 She knows her craft.

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.160
 I know.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
 Yeah.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160
 Helen.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.160
 There was a story which is...

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.160
 Because you got this story from a Giles Brandrith anecdote book, didn't you?

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.160
 Yeah, a theater anecdote book.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.160
 The word fact would be questionable.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.160
 But yes, I did.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160
 But there was...

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.160
 So there was a guy who was called William McCready.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.160
 And it was early 19th century Shakespearean plays that he was in.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.160
 And he forgot basically to put blood on his hand because he was in Macbeth and he needed blood on his hand.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.160
 And he went to the side of the stage and it wasn't there.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.160
 It wasn't on the side and he desperately needed it.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160
 But there happened to be a bystander there.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.160
 So he punched him in the nose.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.160
 And he'll swipe the blood off his nose and ram back on.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.160
 Yeah.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.160
 According to Giles.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.160
 Yeah.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.160
 And that's where it falls down.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.160
 That's incredible.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.160
 But what happens when you die?

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.160
 What do you mean?

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.160
 What would happen to you as a person if you died?

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160
 What would you...

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160
 I think we...

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.160
 What would you become?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.160
 A ghost.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.160
 A ghost.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
 I got so into theater ghosts.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160
 Oh, right.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160
 Researching this.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160
 There are so many.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160
 Some of them are really tragic.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.160
 So actually where this woman died of laughter at the Theatre Royal Jury Lane.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.160
 Yes.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.160
 They're kind of...

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160
 They've got...

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.160
 I think it's the most haunted theatre in the world.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.160
 Or they claim that, you know.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.160
 And their kind of main event, their big star is the...

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 What's his name?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.160
 The man in grey.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160
 Okay.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160
 Who can be seen on like the upper circle, I think.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.160
 And he just like has a big cloak and is very menacing.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.160
 And it's actually founded in truth.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.160
 Because when it was being renovated in the 1800s,

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.160
 they kind of found a bit of a fake bit of the wall.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.160
 And they looked into it and it was a little cubby hole.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.160
 And inside that cubby hole was a skeleton of a man with a dagger through his chest.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.160
 Wow.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:42.160
 And that's the exact place where this ghost has been spotted for centuries.

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160
 Very cool.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160
 Dan believes it.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160
 Dan believes it.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.160
 The theory of everything else.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.160
 I think I feel like that would be retroactively have been inserted into a wall in order to...

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.160
 Really?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.160
 Yeah, I've got very skeptical recently.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.160
 Wow.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.160
 We need to move on, guys, to our next fact.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
 Well, laughter can be very dangerous, right?

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.160
 Yeah.

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.160
 So there was a study from the University of Birmingham.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.160
 It was a meta-analysis, so they looked at loads of papers.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:16.160
 And they found that laughter can cause abdominal hernia, dislocated jaw, incontinence, fainting,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:20.160
 infectious diseases, because when you laugh, you breathe in a lot and you get lots of germs

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.160
 in your mouth.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160
 Yeah?

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.160
 Thanks for coming, everybody.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:30.160
 There's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which is you laugh so much that you rupture

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.160
 your esophagus.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160
 That can happen.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.160
 But despite this, they have laughing contests.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.160
 And this is becoming quite common in America now.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.160
 Basically, you go in and you just try and make each other laugh.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.160
 And there's loads of different types of laugh.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.160
 Best giggle and best knee-slapping laugh and best belly laugh and stuff like that.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:52.160
 And apparently, the woman who won the American Championship last year, she didn't tell anyone

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.160
 until afterwards, but she pissed her pants in the first round.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160
 Oh.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160
 Wow.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:58.160
 Is that an illegal move?

00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160
 I...

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.160
 It feels like it must be, right?

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160
 Yeah.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160
 Wow.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160
 It was only like a couple of years ago.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160
 I pissed myself while laughing.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160
 And it's honestly, it's one of those moments where it's not embarrassing.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.160
 It's great.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.160
 It's a really wonderful feeling.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160
 You feel like you've done laughter next level.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.160
 You feel like you've...

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160
 What was it?

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160
 What was it?

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.160
 It was a late night.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.160
 I was quite drunk.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.160
 Someone said a joke.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160
 And I just laughed so hard that I just...

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160
 And it wasn't even like a little bit of wee.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.160
 It was like...

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.160
 Like, total flood.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.160
 And I...

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160
 Honestly, I did not apologise.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.160
 I was like, "Guys, you will need to try this.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.160
 I think we've forgotten how great this feels."

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.160
 OK, well, we've got three more facts.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:49.160
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.160
 And that is James.

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.160
 My fact this week is that the first modern water bed

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.160
 was filled with jelly rather than water.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.160
 The problem was that it was too heavy to move

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.160
 and started to go rancid after a few weeks.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.160
 Isn't that incredible that it was jelly?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.160
 I find that one of the most astonishing facts.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.160
 Yeah, it makes sense, really, doesn't it?

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.160
 If you want something nice and soft to lie on.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.160
 So was it the bed, like, kind of the mold?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160
 The jelly mold, if you like, and you pour it in

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160
 and then it sets?

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.160
 Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.160
 Yeah, I guess it must have been, really,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.160
 because you'd be weird to just shove in solid jelly.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.160
 I'm not quite sure.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160
 He also used cornstarch as well,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.160
 so cornstarch would be soft,

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.160
 but then it's non-Newtonian,

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.160
 so as you sort of push on it, it would get more solid.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
 But again, that went rancid as well.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:43.160
 What's a liquid that doesn't go rancid?

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:50.160
 But he started it not as a bed, it started as a chair.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160
 Yeah, so Charles Hall this is, right?

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160
 Yeah, Charles Hall.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.160
 So it was called the very first thing he invented.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.160
 It was called the incredibly horrible thing,

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.160
 and it was a chair.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.160
 It weighed 300 pounds, it had liquid starch inside it,

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.160
 and it had a vinyl skin.

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.160
 And the point was that when you sat into it,

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.160
 the chair would creep up around you,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.160
 because you were molding into it like that.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160
 It sits on you?

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160
 Kind of.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.160
 Eventually, yeah.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160
 Okay, so he made that,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.160
 but what he really, really wanted to do

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.160
 was make an entire room that was a water bed/chair.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160
 Oh, wow.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.160
 So it was almost like a bit like a padded cell, I suppose.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.160
 But you would walk in, close the door,

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.160
 and wherever you were, you would just sort of sink into the wall

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.160
 or sink into the floor.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160
 Oh, my God.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160
 But it was only because it was so expensive to make

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160
 that he decided to go for the water bed instead.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160
 Gosh.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.160
 What was expensive,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160
 manufacturing the jelly or the materials?

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.160
 Well, the thing is, if you want to buy a room,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.160
 you kind of need to have to buy a house as well.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160
 Do you know what I mean?

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160
 Yeah, good point.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.160
 Like, renovate your whole house to do that,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
 whereas if you just want to buy a bed or a chair,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160
 you could rent.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.160
 Yes, you could.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
 Oh, but I don't think I'd want to rent a water bed.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.160
 No?

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.160
 No, I mean you could rent a flat

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.160
 and put your water bed in there.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.160
 Yeah, you could do that as well.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.160
 Have any of you ever slept on a water bed?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.160
 Yeah, my parents used to have one.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.160
 I don't think I have.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
 When I was a kid.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
 Really?

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.160
 They're so uncomfortable.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.160
 Yeah.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160
 Oh, are they?

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.160
 They're horrible.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.160
 I've read about them and said they're amazing.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:21.160
 Like, they're the equivalent of pissing yourself while laughing.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.160
 But maybe mine was like, it was a friend's parents' bed

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.160
 when I was a kid.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.160
 And it was like being seasick.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.160
 It would like move.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.160
 It was honestly vile.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.160
 Huh.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.160
 And it was really cold.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.160
 Like, they hadn't heated the water.

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:40.160
 Oh, but you can get those now.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160
 Oh, thank God.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.160
 Okay, well, that's all changed.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160
 No, Charles Hall, these days, who invented this thing,

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:46.160
 what, 50 years ago.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160
 Yeah.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.160
 He now, he has two water beds now.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.160
 No, that doesn't sound very impressive,

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.160
 but he's got, because they come in different,

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.160
 it's different bladders.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.160
 So you can see how many bladders are there in your water bed.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.160
 So he's got one king-size single bladder.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.160
 Oh, wow.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
 But he's also...

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
 If only you had a king-size bladder that night.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.160
 He's also got a, in his guest room,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.160
 he's got a double mattress which has adjacent double bladders,

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.160
 so you can heat one if you want your bed a bit warmer

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160
 than whoever you're sleeping next to.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160
 Oh, really?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160
 Oh, that's excellent.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160
 You can hot water bottle your...

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160
 Yeah.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160
 Your bed is the hot water bottle.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160
 Wow.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160
 Oh, you're actually selling it.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.160
 Maybe we should look at one, guys.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160
 That's incredible.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160
 This first one was...

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
 The one that Hall invented it, I think it was 1968, he invented it.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.160
 He called it the Pleasure Pit.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.160
 And we should probably talk about the slightly...

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.160
 There was a slightly sexy reputation they had.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160
 Yeah.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
 One of the manufacturers in the early days was called Wet Dream.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.160
 There was an advert...

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.160
 I don't know, it's not great advert,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.160
 but it said, "She'll admire you for your car.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.160
 "She'll respect you for your position,

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.160
 "and she'll love you for your water bed."

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.160
 So, it was a kind of...

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.160
 Well, there was lots of...

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.160
 Creepy.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.160
 He had that to begin with, so he had invented it.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.160
 He had patented it, but everyone just did sort of spin-off water beds.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:07.160
 And he said that there was one company he noticed that it was sort of sexy,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160
 because, like, their other products were orgy butter and things like that, right?

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.160
 And then, when you read into it...

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.160
 Orgy butter?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.160
 And I did a lot of Googling.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160
 I'm so sorry.

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.160
 We had to switch to orgy marge because of the cost of living.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.160
 Sorry.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
 So, orgy butter was a thing.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.160
 And then, when you look into, as you say, the sexual connotations

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.160
 about the early sales of the water bed.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:34.160
 So, a lot of it was that it was basically like having a threesome,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.160
 because the bed acted as the third person,

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.160
 because it moulded around you as you...

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.160
 It feels like a third person as part of the...

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.160
 Hang on, buddy.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160
 I'm sorry.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.160
 Just, like, let's just, like, zoom out on this.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:52.160
 Taking this, like, "I'm just telling you about my experiences."

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160
 Well, these are the facts.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160
 Well, you're telling us a lot of stuff.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.160
 Your parents did have one, so you probably conceived in it, were you?

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160
 Probably.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.160
 Are you from a water bed?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160
 Probably.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.160
 Oh, God.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.160
 You're a water baby.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
 That's nice.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160
 'Cause, like, I don't want to be, like, let's not get too graphic,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.160
 but, like, there's got to be a purchase problem.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.160
 Supposedly not.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160
 Like, supposedly not.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 It's a water bed.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.160
 Like, you're, like, sloshing around.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160
 Apparently.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160
 Apparently.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.160
 I mean, they were very popular.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.160
 I know they were popular.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.160
 At one point, I think a fifth of mattresses being sold

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160
 were water bed mattresses.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160
 Yeah, I read that.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.160
 I thought that was...

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.160
 In 1987, which is the year I was born.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.160
 Insane.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.160
 And Hugh Hefner famously bought one for the Playboy Mansion

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:39.160
 that was upholstered in Tasmanian possum hair.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.160
 Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever...

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160
 Also, 'cause they're not...

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.160
 Ever heard.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160
 They're not very big.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.160
 So many Tasmanian possums has.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160
 Yeah.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.160
 Yeah.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.160
 So it had this reputation for being very, kind of,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
 like, asexual aid.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.160
 'Cause, yeah, 'cause another tagline for it was,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.160
 "Two things are better on a water bed

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.160
 than one of them's sleep."

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160
 Mmm.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160
 I know.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.160
 Like, one in five kinky people are just, like,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.160
 getting off, well, your parents, one of them.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.160
 Yeah.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.160
 Two of them.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160
 Two of them, yeah.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.160
 Getting off on water beds.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.160
 And honestly, it must have felt so sick.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.160
 'Cause it's the worst thing to sleep on.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160
 Isn't there a point where you stop...

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.160
 If you stop moving, the bed will eventually stop moving?

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.160
 No. No, it keeps moving.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160
 Oh, OK.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.160
 You're kind of like...

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.160
 You're lost at sea.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160
 It's an extraordinary experience.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160
 I can't...

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.160
 But that's another...

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160
 I could imagine you ringing up the Coast Guard.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160
 Where are you?

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.160
 Away from the sexual side,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.160
 it was also seen as quite therapeutic.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.160
 So, for example, the friends of Charles Hall,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.160
 when he first invented it, said,

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.160
 "Well, you should name it 'The Bed Womb',"

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.160
 because it feels womb-like.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.160
 It feels right to...

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.160
 It's a good line.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.160
 It's a good line.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160
 Get a bed-womb for your bedroom.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.160
 It's a good line.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160
 Oh, call yourself a therapist.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.160
 That's...

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.160
 And then there was, in 1988,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.160
 the American Journal of Disease of Children

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.160
 published an article in which they said that

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.160
 for infants that were born to drug-addicted mothers,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.160
 if you kept them on water beds rather than bassinets,

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160
 that would be better for them.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.160
 This sort of constant, womb-like movement.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.160
 Oh, right.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.160
 Going on as they sleep.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160
 Yeah.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160
 So, it was seen as therapeutic as well.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.160
 Well, the thing is that he did invent the modern water bed,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.160
 but actually there were earlier ones,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160
 and they were used therapeutically.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:21.160
 So, they were used during the war to prevent bed sores.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.160
 These weren't like the ones that we had in the '80s,

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.160
 but they were just kind of like...

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:28.160
 I don't know, like, you know one of those blow-up mattresses

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160
 but with water inside of it?

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160
 Yeah.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160
 Mark Twain wrote about them.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.160
 Elizabeth Gaskell wrote about them.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.160
 Charles Hall couldn't get a patent originally

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 because they'd been described by Robert A. Heinlein.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.160
 Quite a few of his books mentioned them.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.160
 And when he tried to get a patent, they went,

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160
 "Well, it's in all these science fiction books,

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.160
 so you can't have invented it."

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.160
 So, he had to change a few things to get that.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160
 Oh, right.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:51.160
 But when they became quite lame, which was quite quickly,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.160
 so they were, like, massive in the early '80s, right?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.160
 And then by the late '80s, they were really passe,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.160
 like, no one really wanted them anymore.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.160
 And they had all these water beds.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.160
 They didn't know what to do with them.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.160
 And they gave them to dairy farmers,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.160
 and the cows would sit on them.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.160
 Oh, and that's all these films they still do.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
 The Queen's Cows.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.160
 They famously sleep on water beds.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160
 The King's Cows.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
 Well, now the King's Cows, yeah.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.160
 Well, I don't know if he's changed it, though,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160
 but, you know...

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.160
 Sure, okay, all right.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.160
 I've been waiting 70 years to kick those cows off that bed.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.160
 My cows now.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.160
 That's what he was waiting for.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.160
 So, most, if you're...

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.160
 They're so heavy. As you say, they're so heavy.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.160
 Like, a normal...

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.160
 The most impractical thing ever in real life.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.160
 Like, a normal mattress is quite heavy, you know?

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.160
 You fill it with water, you're joking, you know?

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160
 It's like...

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.160
 So, some of them can weigh 900 kilos

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.160
 if you've got a big double or a king's...

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.160
 That's a lot.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.160
 And there's a concern in some buildings,

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160
 if you're in a flat or you're on an upper floor, obviously,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160
 and, you know, they'll all go through the floor.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160
 Yeah.

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.160
 And most New York leases contain a standard clause,

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.160
 which says no water beds.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.160
 Right.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.160
 Probably because of, like, it's a bit...

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160
 You know, maybe it's just bureaucracy, but...

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160
 But in California, on the other coast,

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.160
 the civil code says landlords cannot discriminate

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.160
 against people who own water beds...

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160
 No.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.160
 As long as they have taken out waterbed insurance.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160
 Right.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160
 The responsible thing to do.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160
 It is.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160
 It is.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.160
 Well, I quite like, as well, in 1990,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.160
 speaking of California,

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.160
 the Compton Fire Department,

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.160
 within their fire station,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.160
 changed all of the mattresses to water mattresses.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.160
 Not so that, like, if there was an emergency...

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160
 Just if they needed more water.

00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.160
 No.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.160
 No, no.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.160
 It was the effect on their back, apparently.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.160
 Someone had said, "I sleep better on a water bed,"

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160
 and so they all...

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
 But that's all been disproven,

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.160
 because it doesn't actually help,

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.160
 because there's a lot of things that help, like,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.160
 your posture or, like, your joints.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.160
 That isn't true.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160
 Really?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160
 Okay.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.160
 Yeah.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
 Apparently it's not true.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
 Right.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.160
 I'm just obsessed that there was a waterbed magazine.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.160
 Oh, yeah, I know.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 In the '80s.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.160
 I tried finding it today.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.160
 Yeah, so did I.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.160
 Oh, my God.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160
 No, we need a soapy.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160
 Cool.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.160
 Great.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.160
 Okay.

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.160
 But...

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160
 Brilliant.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.160
 I bought us a lot of orgy butter.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.160
 Oh, great.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.160
 Okay, good.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.160
 Good.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.160
 Can I flip it over?

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.160
 What?

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160
 I mean...

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:11.160
 What other interpretation are you...

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.160
 I was double-checking,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.160
 because I thought I might have heard you say,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.160
 "Flick your mattress," and I wasn't sure.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.160
 How often do you flick your mattress?

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.160
 Twice a night.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.160
 No, how often do you flip it?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.160
 Well, this is what's amazing.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.160
 Not as often as I should, I'm sure.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.160
 And I was planning tomorrow to flip my mattress.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160
 Get out of here.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160
 No, get lost.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.160
 Yeah, absolutely, because both Vanella and I

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.160
 are on the wrong sides at the moment.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160
 It's gone soft on the sides.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
 On the outer edge?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160
 Yeah, on the outer edge.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160
 Why is it not soft on the outer edge?

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160
 That's not going to help, though,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160
 because it's still going to be the outer edge.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160
 I feel...

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.160
 I feel like it's upside down anyway,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.160
 because I noticed recently I've been sleeping on a zip

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.160
 the whole time,

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
 and I'm pretty sure that's the wrong side.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160
 Okay.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160
 Some orgy butter.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.160
 We'll just sort that right out.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.160
 Just rub it in, you'll be fine.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.160
 Anyway, half Americans claim they flip it every six months,

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.160
 and I just think half Americans are liars.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.160
 I think no one possibly does it that much.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.160
 But why should you flip?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.160
 I think...

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.160
 I think it's...

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.160
 So...

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160
 No, it's...

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160
 I can tell you exactly why.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160
 You get soft on the outside,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.160
 and then you fall off the bed.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.160
 That's why we're doing it.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.160
 Is it not to try and air it out

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.160
 a little bit or something?

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.160
 I don't know.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.160
 So it's not the same bit of you

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
 always hitting the same bit of the mattress?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.160
 Right, okay.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.160
 And so it refreshes it a bit,

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.160
 it moves the scene around.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.160
 Because mattresses are disgusting,

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160
 because they're full of, like,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.160
 skin cells, sweat, like, bed bugs.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.160
 So I think this is the way

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160
 of just sort of redistributing

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.160
 the skin cells and sweat.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.160
 You should really get rid...

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.160
 They're so expensive, mattresses.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160
 They're, like, thousands of pounds.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160
 You can't just...

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.160
 Because you should really replace them regularly, I think,

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.160
 but that's why you should get a waterbed.

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.160
 Oh, yeah, because you just changed the water.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.160
 Well, not even, you know.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.160
 Because water doesn't go rancid.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.160
 Unlike jelly.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.160
 Yeah.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.160
 To bring us back to the start of the fact.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.160
 Yeah.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.160
 I need to move us on to our next fact, guys.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.160
 OK, it is time for fact number three,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.160
 and that is my fact.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:04.160
 My fact this week is that there used to be a room

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.160
 in the Pentagon where employees met specifically

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:09.160
 to have Pokemon battles.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.160
 This is a discovery that was made back in 2016.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.160
 Was there a situation room elsewhere in the Pentagon

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.160
 where other officials monitored the progress

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.160
 of those Pokemon battles with big screens?

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.160
 Do you think they have tables where they're pushing a Pikachu along?

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:30.160
 That's the situation room. That's what it's for, yeah.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160
 So this is Pokemon Go.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.160
 There was a huge craze, particularly about...

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.160
 Still is.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.160
 Yeah, but there was a mo...

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160
 Well, James is...

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.160
 What's that T-shirt you're wearing, James?

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.160
 This is, I mean, this fact is up my street

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.160
 because I do like Pokemon and changing regimes

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.160
 in countries that I don't like, so...

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160
 Ah!

00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.160
 James loves...

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:51.160
 Getting a bit political tonight?

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.160
 Yeah.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
 James loves Pokemon Go so much.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.160
 I don't know if we've ever said this.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.160
 He likes it so much that when we went for a meeting,

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.160
 for the first time ever, we were going to have

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.160
 a Book of the Year, no such thing as a fish book,

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160
 and we were going to pitch it.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.160
 We ended up being a bit late to the meeting

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
 because we were following James,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.160
 but it turned out James had spotted a very rare Pokemon

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.160
 down the road from where we were,

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.160
 and we just blindly followed him,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.160
 and then we were like, "Where are we?"

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.160
 And he was like, "Yes! Snuffle off a gussle, whoever it is!"

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.160
 When was that week they did a Sesame Street special,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.160
 wasn't it, of Pokemon Go?

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160
 OK, so here's the thing.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.160
 It's Pokemon Go, and Pokemon Go was the app,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.160
 and you would go and you would collect the Pokemons

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160
 in various different places.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.160
 You had to walk around, didn't you?

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.160
 You would walk around, and yeah.

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.160
 And then what they had as part of the app,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.160
 I've never personally played it,

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.160
 so this is 101 for people that do.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.160
 You have gyms where you can take the Pokemon 2,

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.160
 the Pokemon you have collected,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.160
 and they can train there,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.160
 but they can also battle for dominance of the gym,

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.160
 and those would be plopped all over the world

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.160
 in random spots,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:51.160
 and it just so happened that one was in the Pentagon,

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.160
 and so anyone who was an employee there,

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160
 and it would be specifically employees,

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160
 because if you ever go on a tour of the Pentagon,

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160
 you have to leave your phone,

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.160
 you're not allowed to bring your phone in with you,

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160
 so it was specifically employees

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160
 that were going to a very specific spot,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.160
 and then they'd battle each other for dominance of this gym,

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160
 and this was a huge problem

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.160
 because the Pokemon app can track where people are going,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.160
 so their worry within the Pentagon

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.160
 was that it shows the routes that people are taking,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.160
 so there were secret passages within the Pentagon,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.160
 or even just mapping out the general landscape.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.160
 That's something that the information

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.160
 could possibly be hacked into and retrieved.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.160
 Someone might know that the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 I mean, that would be awful.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.160
 Do you imagine?

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.160
 So they said, "No more Pokemon Go in the Pentagon."

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.160
 Do you know why the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped?

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160
 I think this is amazing.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160
 No.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.160
 It's because they were going to build it

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160
 on a pentagon-shaped piece of land,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.160
 and so they wanted the right shape of building

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160
 for that piece of land,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160
 so it had to be a pentagon,

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.160
 and then they decided to move it somewhere else,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160
 and they thought,

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.160
 "Well, we've gone so far with this shape.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.160
 We might as well keep it."

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.160
 That's literally the only reason.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.160
 I mean, there's lots of good things about it being pentagon-shaped,

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.160
 but the reason is just it was supposed to go on this bit of land.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160
 That's incredible.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.160
 What are some of the good things?

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.160
 Well, a circle is very good

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160
 because you can get from one bit of a circle

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.160
 to another bit of a circle really quickly,

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.160
 and a pentagon is a bit like a circle,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.160
 but it's got straight edges,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.160
 so it's easier to build the circle.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160
 Yeah.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.160
 It's more of a circle than a square.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.160
 Absolutely.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.160
 Yeah.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.160
 Less than a hexagon.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160
 Oh, sure.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.160
 Food for thought tonight on...

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.160
 And in the centre of the kind of circular pentagon

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.160
 is a now-closed hotdog stand.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.160
 Yeah.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.160
 During the Cold War,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:47.160
 the Russians always had at least two missiles

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.160
 that seemed at this hotdog stand

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.160
 because they thought that that was the pentagon's

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.160
 most top-secret meeting place.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.160
 It was just where people got lunch,

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.160
 but they were convinced that it was...

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.160
 Was it because they saw people kind of congregate here?

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.160
 Yeah.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:03.160
 And they'd be like, "That has to be the...

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.160
 That's the heart of the pentagon,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.160
 when actually it was just a hotdog stand."

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160
 I know.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.160
 Was it part of the pentagon, this hotdog stand?

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.160
 Okay. It was inside.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.160
 I still feel like if the missiles hit it,

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.160
 the other bit of pentagon would suffer some damage.

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.160
 Yeah.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.160
 They're not really so specific the missile that it's like...

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160
 No, true.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160
 I mean, you know.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160
 But it's fascinating, I think.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.160
 Did they know that, the hotdog owners at the time?

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.160
 I think they did because everyone used to call it Ground Zero, didn't they?

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.160
 That was the nickname for it.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.160
 The reason being that if the Russians hit,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.160
 it would become Ground Zero and become flattened.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.160
 Blimey.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160
 Right.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.160
 I've read a thing that the pentagon own.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.160
 It's just their cool stuff division.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.160
 They own a laser, which that's not the cool bit,

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.160
 which can analyse who you are based on your heartbeat alone.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.160
 Really?

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.160
 So they'll...

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:50.160
 You know, you have it...

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.160
 All of our hearts have their unique cardiac signature,

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160
 how our hearts beat.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.160
 Yeah.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.160
 And they can point that laser at you from 200 metres away

00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.160
 and say, "There's Dan."

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.160
 Or whatever it might be.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.160
 What if I've just gone up a flight of stairs or something?

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.160
 Would it change my heartbeat or...?

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.160
 It would change, wouldn't it?

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.160
 But maybe it changes with the same...

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160
 But it's still recognisably you.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.160
 Yeah, they go, "That's James."

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.160
 And he's very unfair.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160
 There's a few flaws to this thing, though.

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160
 It's called Jetson, which is what they've developed.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.160
 And the flaws consist of the fact that,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.160
 A, we don't really have that bigger database

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.160
 of people's unique heartbeats.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.160
 So when everyone's coming, they can go,

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.160
 "Ah, no, no, I didn't do that. That's right."

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.160
 And then the second flaw, and this is, you know,

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.160
 200 metres away we can do this, is their claim.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.160
 The other problem is, yes, they can do it

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.160
 if you're wearing a T-shirt, but if you're wearing a coat,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.160
 they can't get you.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.160
 Yeah, so it's half-useful.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.160
 Yeah, it's not as good as the fingerprint yet,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.160
 or the eyeball.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.160
 The lychee?

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.160
 The lychee.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.160
 Thank you.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160
 Yeah.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.160
 I was reading about the Pentagon generally,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.160
 about tour guides, because you can go there.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.160
 I imagine, Jamie, that's somewhere that you might have gone,

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.160
 but maybe not yet.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.160
 I haven't.

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160
 But you love this kind of stuff, right?

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.160
 Yeah, I actually have a friend that works at the Pentagon.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.160
 He didn't reply to my emails about fun facts about the Pentagon.

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.160
 So the security is really high, guys.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.160
 We're safe, you know.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.160
 But one of the things is, there's stats

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.160
 that you get told about the tour guides that work there,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.160
 and one of it is that they walk two to three miles per day,

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.160
 but entirely backwards,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.160
 because when they're doing their tours,

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.160
 they never turn around to lead,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.160
 because they always need eyes on the people

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.160
 that they're taking on the tour guide.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.160
 So they guide themselves...

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.160
 What?

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:37.160
 Yeah, they guide themselves by landmarks.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.160
 So as they're walking back the go, there's the fire extinguisher.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.160
 That means, you know, ten steps until you get to the next corner,

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.160
 then I can round it like that.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.160
 And so, yeah, every day, two to three miles of backward walking

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.160
 is what they get.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.160
 And there's loads of ramps.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.160
 That's really quite impressive to walk down a ramp backwards.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.160
 You know, there's like no lift to the Pentagon.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160
 It was built with one lift.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160
 Yes.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160
 Because it was built during...

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.160
 Because it was made of concrete.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.160
 Yeah, it was made of concrete.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.160
 In fact, it's nicknamed the Concrete Cobweb, which is cool.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.160
 And it had one lift for 33,000 people in the early days,

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.160
 because you can't make lifts out of concrete, I suppose.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.160
 Right.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.160
 And they were saving steel for the war efforts.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.160
 They didn't want to...

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.160
 But they've now put some more in.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.160
 They've now got dozens and dozens.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.160
 I love the idea of you repeatedly emailing your friend,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.160
 who's in the middle of looking at a screen,

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.160
 and there's like a bomb counter on it.

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.160
 I know.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.160
 It's somewhere in Ulaanbaatar, but I don't know where.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.160
 Just ping, ping.

00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.160
 Hi, just wondering if you saw my previous...

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:33.160
 I was like, fun fact, request email.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.160
 Is it true that they used to have office chair races down the ramps

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160
 in the Pentagon?

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.160
 That's all I wanted to know.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.160
 I think what he's really going is,

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.160
 "God damn it, snuffle-uffagus, come on, win this Pokemon battle!"

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.160
 No, we can't, because they've banned the Pokemon.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160
 Oh, yeah, of course.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160
 They also banned...

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160
 Yeah, well, that was the whole thing,

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160
 that you aren't allowed it anymore, right?

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160
 Yeah, it's out, it's out.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.160
 Because they're banning things left and right at the Pentagon,

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.160
 like TikTok's now banned at the Pentagon.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.160
 But they also banned Furbies.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:00.160
 In 1999.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.160
 Because they record what you say?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.160
 Well, they don't, but they kind of marketed themselves as that...

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.160
 It's like the thinking toy or the chatty toy or something.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160
 I don't know.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.160
 And they were, like, concerned that it would be a security risk

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.160
 that they would, like, yeah, record what you were saying

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.160
 and then say it back to you.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.160
 That's so funny.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.160
 I think it's fair enough to ask people not to bring Furbies in.

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.160
 It's a petty aspect or the spying thing.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.160
 It's weird having to bring your toy to work at the Pentagon.

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160
 Well, you say that.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.160
 The Pokemon Go is just as kind of...

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160
 Yeah?

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.160
 ...maybe childish, I don't want to, you know.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.160
 But the...

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.160
 I think we say "for all ages", rather than...

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160
 Sure, sure.

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.160
 I'm glad you made three in the end.

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:37.160
 Three episodes of "No such thing as they say it".

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160
 Yeah.

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160
 Going on behind.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.160
 I know that Furbies was really interesting, wasn't it?

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160
 Because they...

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.160
 The way they worked is they had a stock number of English words they had.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:50.160
 And they had a stock number of Furbies words.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.160
 They were just like...

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160
 All that kind of stuff.

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160
 Yeah.

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.160
 And it started off, they could just say the Furbie words.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:58.160
 And then as you owned it for longer and longer,

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.160
 it kind of put more and more of the English words into the vocabulary.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.160
 And so people thought that they were picking up words that you were saying to them.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.160
 But actually it was just programmed to do that.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.160
 But that's a bit like how it is with children, isn't it?

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160
 Yeah.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160
 Like they start off talking complete nonsense,

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.160
 and then by the end of their saying, like, "Nah, nah, or dog, or whatever."

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.160
 Oh, no.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160
 So that's kind of...

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.160
 Maybe that's why they made the Furbie like that.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160
 Yeah, I guess so.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:23.160
 Or maybe all children are actually fake.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:26.160
 Prove me wrong.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160
 Which is more likely, Andy, I don't know.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.160
 But yeah, like the CEO of the company that made Furbies had to come out and say,

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160
 "This isn't true.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.160
 "Our Furbies actually aren't as clever as we've been lying about."

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160
 Wow.

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.160
 And he also said, you know, there was a rumor that they could send...

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.160
 They had enough technologies to send something into space.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.160
 And they said that one woman...

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.160
 Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160
 Yeah.

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.160
 Just break that down a bit.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.160
 Wait, what are the...

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.160
 Somebody thought the Furbies had so much power

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.160
 that they could send a rocket into space.

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.160
 Are we talking about a complete Cape Canaveral setup?

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.160
 Yes.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.160
 We can entirely start my Furbie.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.160
 I don't know, Furbies are all the deaths.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.160
 There's a Furbie in it with the briefcase going on to the ship.

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:10.160
 Actually, if Elon Musk zips down his jacket,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.160
 it's just Furbies all the way up.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.160
 He is a Furbie.

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.160
 What does that mean?

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.160
 They could send a rocket to space.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.160
 It's the AI worry of its day, I guess, right?

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160
 Yeah, it wasn't true.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 That's what he was saying.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.160
 'Cause he also said that there was a woman who was absolutely insistent

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.160
 that her Furbie was singing Italian operas.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160
 That also wasn't true.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.160
 Oh, my God.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160
 But she was hearing...

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.160
 She was convinced that she taught this Furbie an aria,

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:36.160
 and she's like, 'My Furbie's really good at opera.'

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.160
 And he's like, 'They literally don't have that capability.'

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.160
 So they kind of had to backtrack on all of their marketing campaign.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160
 Wow.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.160
 These were like, yeah, clever toys,

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.160
 but they were actually all pre-programmed.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160
 Oh, my God.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160
 Scam, wasn't it?

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
 It could be a haunted Furbie.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:52.160
 And that's a ghost, I will believe it.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:54.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.160
 Imagine the next, like, crude moon mission

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.160
 that gets there and finds they have built their own society.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160
 Without us noticing.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160
 The Furbies beat us to it.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160
 Damn it.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.160
 The dark side of the moon is entirely Furbie.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.160
 Owned and operated now.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.160
 Have you heard of Tia Pikachu?

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:16.160
 So she is a Chilean schoolteacher,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:20.160
 and they've had a load of protests in Chile against the government,

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.160
 and she decided to go dressed as a giant Pikachu.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.160
 The reason being that her seven-year-old son

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.160
 had maxed out her husband's credit card

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.160
 buying Detective Pikachu merchandise.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.160
 They managed to send loads of it back,

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.160
 but some of it they couldn't send back,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.160
 and this giant sort of inflatable Pikachu

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.160
 they couldn't send back.

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.160
 Okay, so then they have some protests in Chile,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.160
 and she decides, 'Well, I'm just going to go dressed as a Pikachu,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.160
 because why not, it's a protest.'

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.160
 And she just became really, really, really famous,

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.160
 because there was video of her being water,

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.160
 like, fired with water.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.160
 Cannon?

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160
 Water cannon, yeah,

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.160
 in a big Pikachu costume being forced back.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.160
 She was shot with rubber bullets,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.160
 dressed as Pikachu.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.160
 It's absolutely amazing,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.160
 but because she became so famous,

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.160
 she is part of the team

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.160
 who are writing the New Chilean Constitution.

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:16.160
 So after the protest,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.160
 they decided that they were going to write a new constitution.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160
 So every five clauses, it's just going to say,

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.160
 'Pika, pika, pika!'

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:31.160
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.160
 and that is Andy.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.160
 My fact is that in 1972,

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.160
 a family who had survived a shipwreck

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.160
 kept themselves alive

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.160
 by giving each other turtle blood enemas.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.160
 Guys, it's a light-hearted and funny fact.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:48.160
 I just imagine, like,

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.160
 that family seeing each other at Christmas.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160
 Yeah.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.160
 You know, they haven't said, 'Shall we talk about it?'

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:54.160
 No, let's never talk about that again.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.160
 Never talk about it again.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160
 No, go on.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.160
 Give us the context.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.160
 This comes from an amazing piece

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.160
 that was in The Financial Times

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.160
 by a writer called Kitty Drake,

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.160
 and she was interviewing people

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:05.160
 who had real knowledge of shipwreck

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.160
 and being cast away.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.160
 And she spoke to a man called Douglas Robertson,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.160
 who was sailing around the world with his family,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.160
 his siblings and his parents.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160
 He was 18 years old,

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.160
 and their yacht was attacked by killer whales.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.160
 So they were halfway across the Pacific.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.160
 They completely battered the yacht.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.160
 The family all abandoned ship into a small dinghy

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.160
 that was, I think there were seven people,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.160
 six or seven people in this dinghy

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.160
 that was designed for one fewer

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.160
 than the number of people who ended up in it.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160
 They were 200 miles from the Galapagos,

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.160
 and the wind was going in the wrong direction.

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.160
 So they were really in trouble.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.160
 They spent 38 days stranded in the Pacific,

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.160
 and they were sailing towards the doldrums.

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.160
 They were trying to get weirdly to the doldrums

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.160
 because there was a better chance of being spotted

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.160
 and detected where they were heading to.

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.160
 So the doldrums is where there's not as much wind or...

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.160
 Exactly. Sorry.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.160
 Yeah, the region where there's no wind.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.160
 But it does get lots of rain.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.160
 So anyway, so they're in big trouble.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:02.160
 They did manage to get some turtles on board,

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.160
 and they had to hunt the turtles that approached them,

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.160
 and they used their blood as soup.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.160
 So that's a good thing.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.160
 Then, unfortunately, the water ran very low,

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.160
 and they only had the old fish-polluted rainwater

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160
 in the bottom of their dinghy.

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.160
 And it wasn't safe to drink.

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.160
 But the mother of the family, Lynn, was a nurse,

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.160
 and she realised you could absorb it safely

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.160
 through your bottom.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.160
 And so everyone in the family got a rain...

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.160
 Guys, this is funnier than we're...

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.160
 I feel like there's tension in the room.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.160
 They all make it. They all made it, and they got picked up.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160
 It was all right.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.160
 Oh, spoiler alert. Sorry.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.160
 They were all right.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.160
 Anyway, she worked out brilliant, an intuition,

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160
 that you could absorb it through your bottom.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.160
 So everyone in the family got a rain and turtle blood enema,

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.160
 and it gets into your system,

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.160
 but it doesn't go through your digestive system.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.160
 I'm getting confused when you say the enema bits.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.160
 What do you mean?

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.160
 Up the bum. Squirt it up the bum.

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.160
 Oh! What have you been researching?

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.160
 What because I read? I read...

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.160
 Oh!

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:01.160
 Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:03.160
 Just where does the orgy butter go?

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.160
 Think in those terms.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.160
 That's way more disgusting than what I thought.

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.160
 Yeah, it's horrible.

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.160
 Cos that's the thing, like, it's not just turtle blood.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.160
 Anyways, it's disgusting.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160
 Rain water, it's like infected fish guts.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.160
 Water, like, it's foul.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.160
 So the point is... But genius.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.160
 Yeah, it's genius. I mean, amazing.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:26.160
 If you drink this stuff, it's got all sorts of horrible things in it,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.160
 and it can make you really, really sick.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.160
 Now, if you go the other way... Yeah, yeah.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.160
 ...then there's a way for the water to go into your body

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.160
 through your rectum. Yeah.

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:38.160
 But because you're already getting disgusting things

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.160
 going down there anyway, your body is protected

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.160
 against those disgusting things. Exactly.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.160
 So you can still get the water,

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.160
 but it won't get the bacteria and all that.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.160
 So here's what I thought.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.160
 I thought they were removing the rectal membrane from the turtles

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.160
 and using that as a bag to collect the water.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.160
 Genuinely, that's what I thought.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.160
 A bag to collect the water?

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.160
 Well, you need to collect water to drink it through your fucking mouth.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.160
 It's your fucking mouth, right?

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.160
 How much water are you collecting?

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.160
 It's your fucking shell on it.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.160
 If you want to keep water...

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.160
 If you ever get a turtle and you want to keep water,

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.160
 don't take the little bag out of it, Tainus.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.160
 Just turn it upside down.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.160
 We've got to get to its asshole.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:20.160
 Jesus Christ. Wow.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.160
 Turns out it's Dan's last appearance on "Nose & Sins & Fish" as well.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:29.160
 I'd love to see you on, like, one of those reality shit-making shows.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.160
 Meanwhile, on Dan's Island,

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.160
 I think it's up to God for a bad to worse.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:37.160
 Cool, that makes you...

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.160
 Weirdly, I still think your one makes less sense.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160
 Feeding water up your butt.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.160
 Incredibly clever.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.160
 Incredibly clever, and it is the thing that saved their lives.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.160
 They were really on the struggling.

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.160
 And they all just trusted Lynn when she said that?

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.160
 She's a nurse.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.160
 I get that, but how often are you...?

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.160
 She's a nurse, though.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.160
 That's an off-common knowledge, I would say.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.160
 I don't know. Wow.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.160
 What's amazing is that there was the group...

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.160
 There was the husband and the wife,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.160
 and I think they had...

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.160
 Was it three or four kids?

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.160
 It was three. There were four, but one of them got off

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.160
 before this leg of the journey.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.160
 That was lucky. Fuck that.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.160
 It's cool. I'll die. I'll just die.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.160
 Someone up. So, in this family

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.160
 of everyone putting stuff up their ass,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.160
 there was one guy who'd only just met them.

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.160
 Did you read his name?

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.160
 He was called Robin Williams, weirdly.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.160
 And he'd just taken a job on the boat

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.160
 in return for his birth, and, you know, just...

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160
 Yeah.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:38.160
 It sounds like such a tough journey.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.160
 Oh, God. They had to spend six hours a day

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.160
 just blowing the dinghy up, you know,

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.160
 just because it was constantly losing air.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.160
 What have they got to do, to be fair?

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.160
 Well, you know, pass of the time.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.160
 And they eventually got back, didn't they?

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160
 They did. And then the husband and wife

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.160
 just immediately divorced. No.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.160
 Really? Yeah, I'm afraid so.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.160
 So, the guy who was kind of

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.160
 took them on this trip, Douglas,

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.160
 he wrote a book

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.160
 and went to live in the med.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.160
 And his wife became a farmer.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.160
 Oh, wow. Oh, because they were farmers before they said that.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.160
 They were, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:14.160
 So, they completely, they split up, yeah.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:16.160
 Gosh. Oh, that's sad.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.160
 That is sad. Yeah, yeah.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.160
 Did you hear, there was a recent

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.160
 someone stranded out in the ocean

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.160
 and having to get by with what materials they had.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:26.160
 There was a guy called Elvis,

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.160
 and he was found

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.160
 120 nautical miles northwest

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.160
 of Columbia's

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.160
 Poreto Boliva. I don't know how to pronounce that.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.160
 Lovely. Yeah. And he survived.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.160
 He wrote help on the hull

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.160
 of his sailboat, and so someone saw that.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.160
 But he was stuck out there for a long time.

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.160
 And he was 24 days, I think,

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.160
 he was out there and he survived almost

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:48.160
 exclusively on tomato ketchup

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.160
 from Heinz. Wow.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:52.160
 And so that became the story when he got back.

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.160
 He found him after being missing all this time.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.160
 And then Heinz decided that they wanted

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:58.160
 to give him a new boat because they thought this was amazing.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.160
 I thought you were about to say,

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.160
 "Give him some more ketchup." Yeah, yeah.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.160
 No, that's a much better,

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.160
 that's good PR by Heinz, yeah, yeah.

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:08.160
 So, they've done it. They've done that.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.160
 Well, for ages, they couldn't find him.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.160
 So, he disappeared again, but just into his normal life

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.160
 because he was, you know, he didn't make a big fuss of it.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.160
 So, there was a huge campaign to find

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:18.160
 the missing boat guy who then,

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.160
 and they found Elvis, basically.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:22.160
 Yeah, a hard hashtag to use,

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.160
 but they found him

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.160
 and he's now got his boat. That's great.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.160
 Tomato ketchup is exclusively, yeah,

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.160
 what he was surviving on. Gosh.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.160
 You can, just a tip

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.160
 for any of us who get shipwrecked,

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.160
 do have a plastic bag if you can.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.160
 If you don't have a turtle to have.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.160
 Yes.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.160
 Why would that be? Well,

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:44.160
 you use a bag of water.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.160
 What are you using this bag of water for, guys?

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.160
 Drinking out of? Making fire.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.160
 You can make fire with a bag of water.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.160
 Oh, like a lens.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.160
 Like a lens. If it's a clear bag,

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.160
 do make sure it's a clear bag.

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.160
 Lot of caveats on this.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.160
 Not a bag for life.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.160
 Ironically, a bag for life wouldn't work.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.160
 That is.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.160
 And you'd be kicking yourself, wouldn't you?

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.160
 Pay 30 papers.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:14.160
 No, a bog standard, like a clear plastic bag.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.160
 If you can make it into a round shape,

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.160
 you can use that to focus the rays of the sun

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.160
 onto your tinder.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.160
 And then, and it makes fire.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.160
 And if you don't have a plastic bag,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.160
 you can use a light bulb.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:28.160
 If you don't have a light bulb.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.160
 Just have an idea.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.160
 Excuse my ignorance.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.160
 Like, would it not

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.160
 melt the plastic?

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.160
 Or is that a stupid thing to ask?

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.160
 It's not a stupid question, but I don't think it would.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.160
 I don't know why.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.160
 Oh, the point at which the rays focus

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:46.160
 the hottest point, which is not on the surface of the bag.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.160
 It's on whatever you're pointing at.

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.160
 Interesting.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.160
 I was reading some advice from a guy called Paul Hart,

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.160
 who is the Royal Navy's...

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.160
 He's a Lieutenant Commander for the Royal Navy.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.160
 And he was asked, if you get shipped wrecked on an island,

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.160
 what should you be doing in order to survive?

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:02.160
 So, he wrote this big list of stuff.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.160
 And so, here's the quiz-like

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.160
 moment here.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.160
 So, your boat

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.160
 has crashed on the shore,

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.160
 or your airplane has crashed into

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.160
 the ocean, and you've made it to shore.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.160
 What is the first thing

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.160
 that you should be collecting in order to survive?

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.160
 From the aircraft?

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.160
 You're on an island, yeah. So, the food.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:24.160
 OK, so food would be a good...

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.160
 Well, I would say the eight

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.160
 single CDs that I carry

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:30.160
 with me everywhere I go.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.160
 A copy of the Bible that you always have.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.160
 A copy of the Bible. And what would your luxury be?

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.160
 A lovely bottle of Tabasco sauce.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.160
 Oh, lovely!

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:40.160
 So, the answer is, he says...

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.160
 No, no, no. A lifetime supplier of Marmite.

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:44.160
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, OK.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.160
 Get that right, yeah.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.160
 Orgy butter if that's not available, yeah.

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.160
 One of the same to him.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.160
 Life jacket. Life jacket, no.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.160
 The seats can be used as floatation devices.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.160
 I'm trying to remember what they've said to me.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.160
 Things that you're going to take from your wreckage,

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:00.160
 or things that are on the island?

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.160
 No, things that you take from the wreckage.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.160
 Something to... The radio from the...

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.160
 A knife, no. Well, knife is, yes, it's up there.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.160
 But he says... A clear bag.

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.160
 A clear plastic bag.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.160
 That's it, that's it.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.160
 He says Wellington boots.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.160
 Oh, OK. What? Sorry, when do you get on a plane?

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.160
 Do they just hand you some Wellington boots?

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:20.160
 He's saying any kind of...

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160
 A very strong footwear that you can have.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.160
 Right, OK. Because you're going to be going into the ocean a lot

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.160
 in order to get food.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.160
 You're going to be travelling, and injury is the thing you need to avoid.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.160
 Most of all, and your feet are most likely to be getting injured.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.160
 That's really interesting. Because actually, on that Ryanair thing,

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.160
 it tells you to take off your high heels

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.160
 before you jump on the slide, doesn't it?

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:38.160
 Yes. And you're saying...

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.160
 You're saying keep them on?

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.160
 Is that...?

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.160
 No, so that's the biggest thing.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.160
 That's interesting, yeah.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.160
 Wellies, it is quite a niche thing,

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.160
 as James just said, to have on that.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes sense.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.160
 I would personally get a knife.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.160
 Because then you can fashion some sort of, like...

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.160
 Fashion... Make some... Oh, come on, babe.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:00.160
 Not Wellies! Come on!

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160
 But you could, like, get, like...

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.160
 Either you're going to carve your own...

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.160
 Or you could cut your own way.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.160
 Do you know what I mean? Like, a knife surely is the most important thing,

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.160
 because that can... That's very important.

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.160
 Actually, you can use the, like, shoes to yourself.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.160
 You can tap the rubber tree, and then...

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.160
 With a simple mould fashion from Bach...

00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.160
 LAUGHTER

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.160
 You've got your own Wellie factory, then.

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.160
 Look!

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.160
 You could trade the knife for some Wellies

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.160
 if there's some local Wellie owners.

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.160
 There are local Wellie owners.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.160
 I don't think you need the Wellies.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.160
 You can just leave.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.160
 You're probably...

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.160
 You're in North Devon.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.160
 LAUGHTER

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.160
 Oh, my God. That's so funny.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.160
 I read the US Army Survival Manual.

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.160
 Oh, yeah. Oh, of course you do.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.160
 To see if enemas were part of their...

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.160
 Yeah. ...suggestion.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.160
 There is one mention of enemas

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.160
 in the whole Survival Manual,

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.160
 and the idea is to use warm water enemas

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.160
 as a way to treat hypothermia.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.160
 Oh, OK. Yeah, apparently.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.160
 It's good because it warms you up from the inside,

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:02.160
 if you think about that. Oh, right.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.160
 The thing that they said to drink

00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:06.160
 is the aqueous fluid

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.160
 found along the spine and the eyes

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:10.160
 of large fish. Right.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.160
 Oh, gosh. Is that interesting?

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.160
 Is that because it's less salty than...?

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.160
 Yeah, so everything else that's in the fish,

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.160
 all the other Wellie fluids,

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.160
 have got lots of protein, lots of fat,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.160
 so it's going to make you more thirsty.

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:24.160
 But just the water around the eyes

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.160
 and the water around the spinal fluid,

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.160
 that stuff is just perfect.

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:30.160
 I'm going to mention this guy, because one of the other things

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.160
 at this Paul Hart that I was talking about,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.160
 the guy who said that Wellington boots

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.160
 are what you need it. Oh, yeah.

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.160
 One of the things that he said that was really important

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160
 was having positive mentality.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.160
 That's the main thing.

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.160
 As soon as you crash, you go,

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:46.160
 "Fantastic! This is great!"

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.160
 And if you can keep that mindset, then you're going to be fine.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:50.160
 And that really kind of is...

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:52.160
 That comes into play when you read about the story

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.160
 of Jose Salvador Alvorenga,

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.160
 who was a guy who was out at sea

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.160
 with one other person for 438 days.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.160
 They were lost out at sea,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.160
 and it was a positive mentality that kept him going.

00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:04.160
 And when he was interviewed by a journalist

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.160
 who wrote a book about it, he said,

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:08.160
 "What's the thing that you remember most about it?"

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.160
 And he said, "My imagination.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.160
 I imagine good food, and

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.160
 I have the best sex in my life."

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.160
 And he used to... So they used to...

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.160
 The two guys used to see the planes that would fly over,

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.160
 that would never see them,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.160
 and they would go, "What do you think they're eating up there?"

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.160
 And they would picture the food that they were...

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.160
 No, they never... They...

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.160
 They both would then have...

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.160
 Also, the best food of their lives on a plane.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.160
 Has he been on a plane?

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.160
 Bit of stale bread, and something in a little

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.160
 reheated tray. Yeah, great.

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:40.160
 Better than whatever they were eating up

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.160
 their assholes at that time.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.160
 It was that smell. They're on a dinghy.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:46.160
 And so... And yeah.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.160
 Diggy food is terrible, you know.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.160
 What's that all about? Yeah.

00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:52.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:54.160
 They used to... Both of them would do this.

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.160
 They would sit, but him particularly,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.160
 he'd sit there every day, he'd close his eyes,

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.160
 he'd imagine that they'd actually crashed onto a beach,

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.160
 and there was a beautiful woman walking towards him,

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.160
 and they would have sex, and he said every day

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.160
 he just had amazing sex in his head,

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.160
 and that kept him positive. Wow.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:10.160
 Yeah. The other guy died, right?

00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:12.160
 Did he? I think so, yeah.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.160
 He wasn't positive enough.

00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:18.160
 God's sake.

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.160
 Unbelievable.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.160
 He was more positive

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.160
 as he's throwing him off the edge of this dinghy.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.160
 I was going to ask, actually, who...

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:32.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.160
 No, just quickly. Who out of...

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.160
 Say the three of you got shipwrecked.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.160
 I'd die first. Who would you think would survive?

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.160
 I would die first. The first.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.160
 Like, like... I'd die within 30 seconds.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.160
 Do you think... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.160
 I would start another day. I would start another day.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:48.160
 We're going to have to eat him. We're going to have to eat him.

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.160
 There's a guy selling willing to do something.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:52.160
 No, no!

 Oh, God.

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.160
 And Dan's probably the most positive, so I guess you win.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dan will be having fantastic sex.

00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.160
 (LAUGHTER)

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.160
 And eating delicious plain food.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.160
 Oh, God. What a treat.
