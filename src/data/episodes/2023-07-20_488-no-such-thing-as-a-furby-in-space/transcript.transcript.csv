00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish, which is the first"
00:00:04,00:00:10,in our run of live summer shows at the Soho Theatre in London.
00:00:10,00:00:14,We have all sorts of amazing guests lined up for you for the rest of the summer.
00:00:14,00:00:18,"I won't go into that now, because I really don't want to spoil it, especially for the"
00:00:18,00:00:19,people who have tickets.
00:00:19,00:00:24,But what I can tell you is that in this week's show we were joined by Jamie Martin.
00:00:24,00:00:28,"Now you will know Jamie if you listened to No Such Things a Fish before, because he has"
00:00:28,00:00:32,"been on quite a few shows, this is his third appearance, but of course he is most well"
00:00:32,00:00:39,"known for being one third of, let's be honest, the greatest British podcast of all time,"
00:00:39,00:00:41,My Dad Rota Pono.
00:00:41,00:00:46,Now one important thing to say about that is that the My Dad Rota Pono team have chosen
00:00:46,00:00:50,"some of their funniest moments from across the six season run, including some unheard"
00:00:50,00:00:57,"gems and they'll be releasing best off episodes once a month, starting on Monday the 31st"
00:00:57,00:00:58,of June.
00:00:58,00:01:01,"I absolutely can't wait for those best off shows, I'm sure you can't either, but in"
00:01:01,00:01:06,"the meantime, please do enjoy this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish with Jamie"
00:01:06,00:01:25,Martin.
00:01:25,00:01:31,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things a Fish, a weekly podcast this"
00:01:31,00:01:38,week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.
00:01:38,00:01:43,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and"
00:01:43,00:01:47,Jamie Morton and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite
00:01:47,00:01:53,"facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with"
00:01:53,00:01:56,fact number one and that is Jamie.
00:01:56,00:02:05,"My fact this week, boys, is in 1782 a woman found a drag performance so hilarious that"
00:02:05,00:02:07,she literally died of laughter.
00:02:07,00:02:09,Wow.
00:02:09,00:02:15,"Probably not going to happen tonight, but not with me here for sure, but yeah, isn't"
00:02:15,00:02:16,that mad?
00:02:16,00:02:17,"Yeah, it's insane."
00:02:17,00:02:23,"So this was an act, it was a play called Beggar's Opera and someone called Charles Bannister"
00:02:23,00:02:28,"who was playing a character called Polly Peacham and yeah, to give us a story."
00:02:28,00:02:36,"Yeah, so Mrs Fitzherbert, suspiciously there's no first name, but she was a widow of a North"
00:02:36,00:02:43,"Hampton Shire clergyman, it was quite salacious that she was even at this kind of submersive"
00:02:43,00:02:51,show and she found it so funny that this man came out and he was described as Lantern
00:02:51,00:02:57,jawed with five o'clock shadow and a double chin in a lovely pretty dress and she just
00:02:57,00:03:00,found it so funny she just didn't stop laughing for three days.
00:03:00,00:03:01,Oh wow.
00:03:01,00:03:05,"That's the amazing thing, like she had to leave the theatre didn't she because she was laughing"
00:03:05,00:03:08,so much but that's not when she died.
00:03:08,00:03:09,No.
00:03:09,00:03:14,The newspaper report said she couldn't get the figure from her memory so just every morning
00:03:14,00:03:17,"she'd just wake up and go, ""Ah!"""
00:03:17,00:03:21,"I mean what a sheltered fucking life, I'm sorry, like if that makes you laugh that much to"
00:03:21,00:03:22,kill you.
00:03:22,00:03:23,Maybe it was a really good show.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"Yeah, you know."
00:03:24,00:03:25,Well the Beggar's Opera.
00:03:25,00:03:26,It's a classic.
00:03:26,00:03:30,"And the actor Bannister, he was one of the great actors of the day, he was very funny,"
00:03:30,00:03:31,he was famous.
00:03:31,00:03:32,The good name too.
00:03:32,00:03:33,Charles Bannister.
00:03:33,00:03:34,Charles Bannister.
00:03:34,00:03:39,"Yeah, so John Gay, the Beggar's Opera actually, that was the first play which had songs in"
00:03:39,00:03:44,"it that were part of the narrative of the Beggar's Opera, it's pretty much the first musical"
00:03:44,00:03:45,I would say.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Yeah.
00:03:46,00:03:49,"So it was more popular, there was a thing called Beggar Mania and so you could go around,"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"you could buy matchboxes, fans, fireguards, everything with this show on."
00:03:54,00:03:56,"Oh, it's like no such thing as a fish."
00:03:56,00:04:04,"On your tables there is a merchandise leaflet, I think it's got a QR code but genuinely as"
00:04:04,00:04:05,I can see it right there.
00:04:05,00:04:06,Go nuts!
00:04:06,00:04:08,Get us in with that merch.
00:04:08,00:04:13,"Jamie, please, we rely on this, we rely on the merch, it's all that's keeping us going."
00:04:13,00:04:19,I was looking at people who had died on stage and I have a weird connection to one of these
00:04:19,00:04:20,people.
00:04:20,00:04:29,"So Moli√®re, very famous French playwright, actor, he collapsed on stage ironically playing"
00:04:29,00:04:36,"the lead in his final play called The Imaginary Invalid, so he literally died playing a hypochondriac."
00:04:36,00:04:37,Right.
00:04:37,00:04:43,And I have also played the lead in The Imaginary Invalid.
00:04:43,00:04:44,Really?
00:04:44,00:04:45,Yes.
00:04:45,00:04:46,"Yes, I know."
00:04:46,00:04:47,That's cool.
00:04:47,00:04:48,"In my youth, it's not that cool."
00:04:48,00:04:49,Thank you.
00:04:49,00:04:54,"I sort of said that on autopilot Jamie, I wasn't actually thinking that is really cool, don't"
00:04:54,00:04:55,care at all.
00:04:55,00:05:01,"But back in my youth when I used to tread the boards, I didn't die obviously."
00:05:01,00:05:05,"The thing about him actually is because he was an actor, in those days actors couldn't"
00:05:05,00:05:06,go to heaven.
00:05:06,00:05:13,"So if you, I'm not sure anyone could, let's not get into that, that's an actual medical"
00:05:13,00:05:14,matter.
00:05:14,00:05:21,"But like, so the thing was, if you're an actor, it was like, yeah, you had to renounce your"
00:05:21,00:05:24,acting job before you died.
00:05:24,00:05:28,"So on your death bed, you might say, oh, I was never really an actor or I wasn't a very"
00:05:28,00:05:31,good one or whatever and then you would be allowed to go to heaven.
00:05:31,00:05:36,"If you've said I'm really more of a playwright, I'm more of a sort of immersive media creator"
00:05:36,00:05:37,really.
00:05:37,00:05:40,"I facilitated the heathens, I wasn't one of them myself."
00:05:40,00:05:45,"But yeah, and the thing was is that that meant that he was buried without, he wasn't allowed"
00:05:45,00:05:49,to be buried in the churchyard or anything like that because he died so quickly after
00:05:49,00:05:50,this event.
00:05:50,00:05:51,"Oh, wow, okay."
00:05:51,00:05:53,I wanted to see Molly I played a few years ago.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Starring Jamie Morton?
00:05:54,00:05:55,Yes.
00:05:55,00:05:56,No.
00:05:56,00:05:57,How was I?
00:05:57,00:05:58,Be kind.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"It wasn't one with you in, but I did leave it halfway through."
00:06:02,00:06:03,Oh really?
00:06:03,00:06:04,Yeah.
00:06:04,00:06:08,"In a sense, Molly died a second time that night."
00:06:08,00:06:09,Wow.
00:06:09,00:06:10,I'd say it's in the translation.
00:06:10,00:06:12,I think he's a fantastic playwright.
00:06:12,00:06:13,I'm sure he is.
00:06:13,00:06:14,There was a school party all around us.
00:06:14,00:06:15,It is.
00:06:15,00:06:16,It was tricky.
00:06:16,00:06:19,They were not having a good time and neither were we.
00:06:19,00:06:20,I've got a little quiz for you guys.
00:06:20,00:06:21,"Oh, great."
00:06:21,00:06:22,All right.
00:06:22,00:06:27,"So this is, I'm going to say a thing, right, an object and you have to say what it's used"
00:06:27,00:06:31,for by the Royal Shakespeare Company as stage gore.
00:06:31,00:06:32,Okay.
00:06:32,00:06:33,"Oh, great."
00:06:33,00:06:34,I love this game.
00:06:34,00:06:35,"In 2010, for example."
00:06:35,00:06:36,Shakespeare specifically.
00:06:36,00:06:37,Yeah.
00:06:37,00:06:38,Okay.
00:06:38,00:06:39,Right.
00:06:39,00:06:40,"These are all used by the RSC, right?"
00:06:40,00:06:41,Right.
00:06:41,00:06:44,"So in 2010, the Royal Shakespeare Company, they used three tins of lichies during their"
00:06:44,00:06:46,summer season.
00:06:46,00:06:47,Bubos.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Not buboes.
00:06:48,00:06:49,Ibls.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Ibls.
00:06:50,00:06:51,It wasn't actually an everyone play game.
00:06:51,00:06:52,It was.
00:06:52,00:06:53,No.
00:06:53,00:06:54,That's school parties in again.
00:06:54,00:06:55,Yeah.
00:06:55,00:06:56,Please do.
00:06:56,00:06:57,No.
00:06:57,00:06:59,"Just, wait for a second."
00:06:59,00:07:00,Just let them do it.
00:07:00,00:07:01,Ibls.
00:07:01,00:07:02,"Yeah, that's it."
00:07:02,00:07:03,Yeah.
00:07:03,00:07:04,We can end that.
00:07:04,00:07:05,Yeah.
00:07:05,00:07:06,No.
00:07:06,00:07:07,Well done.
00:07:07,00:07:08,Well done to the people who knew it and thank you.
00:07:08,00:07:09,And yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:10,Ibls.
00:07:10,00:07:11,Okay.
00:07:11,00:07:12,That's the cause.
00:07:12,00:07:13,What scene?
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Where they blind the Duke of Gloucester.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Okay.
00:07:16,00:07:17,Yeah.
00:07:17,00:07:18,He actually knew.
00:07:18,00:07:19,That's very impressive.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:20,00:07:21,Okay.
00:07:21,00:07:22,"Well, here's another one."
00:07:22,00:07:23,Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,Chicken fillets.
00:07:24,00:07:25,Chicken fillets.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Bubes for bras.
00:07:26,00:07:27,To pump up the bras.
00:07:27,00:07:28,Actual.
00:07:28,00:07:29,"Well, that's a real thing."
00:07:29,00:07:30,"No, it's not."
00:07:30,00:07:31,No.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Actual chicken fillets.
00:07:32,00:07:38,"Well, I've got an Amazon delivery from my wife that she's going to be very confused"
00:07:38,00:07:39,about.
00:07:39,00:07:42,Flapping skin and muscles.
00:07:42,00:07:43,"Oh, nice."
00:07:43,00:07:44,Yeah.
00:07:44,00:07:45,"No, it's..."
00:07:45,00:07:46,Anyone?
00:07:46,00:07:47,Anyone in the audience?
00:07:47,00:07:48,Ears.
00:07:48,00:07:49,Ears.
00:07:49,00:07:50,Tongues.
00:07:50,00:07:51,Tongues.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"And finally, tinned pears."
00:07:52,00:07:53,Tinned pears.
00:07:53,00:07:54,Tinned pears.
00:07:54,00:07:55,Tennis book.
00:07:55,00:07:56,No.
00:07:56,00:07:57,What?
00:07:57,00:07:58,Nothing.
00:07:58,00:07:59,Tennis.
00:07:59,00:08:00,I didn't even say that.
00:08:00,00:08:02,I only said half of it and then I pulled back.
00:08:02,00:08:03,Yeah.
00:08:03,00:08:05,I think testicles is a good call.
00:08:05,00:08:06,"Okay, testicles."
00:08:06,00:08:07,All right.
00:08:07,00:08:08,Idiot.
00:08:08,00:08:11,You complete full deck.
00:08:11,00:08:12,"No, it's penises."
00:08:12,00:08:13,It's penises.
00:08:13,00:08:14,Tinned pears for penises.
00:08:14,00:08:15,Sorry?
00:08:15,00:08:16,What?
00:08:16,00:08:17,He's serious.
00:08:17,00:08:18,Yeah.
00:08:18,00:08:19,Don't...
00:08:19,00:08:20,Andy.
00:08:20,00:08:21,What?
00:08:21,00:08:22,"Sorry, what's the question?"
00:08:22,00:08:27,I've either been buying some really odd pears or I need to see a doctor.
00:08:27,00:08:31,"I think they're shaped a little bit, but I think it's the consistency."
00:08:31,00:08:32,Consistency?
00:08:32,00:08:34,Consistency of a tinned pear.
00:08:34,00:08:39,"Also, what are they doing with these fake penises that they need a good consistency?"
00:08:39,00:08:40,Yeah.
00:08:40,00:08:43,I'm not sure I've seen that Shakespeare play where they all get their cocks out.
00:08:43,00:08:44,What?
00:08:44,00:08:45,Which one is that?
00:08:45,00:08:46,Yeah.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Is it measure for measure?
00:08:47,00:08:48,That's right.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Very good.
00:08:49,00:08:55,I don't actually...
00:08:55,00:08:56,Yeah.
00:08:56,00:08:57,That's amazing.
00:08:57,00:08:58,There we go.
00:08:58,00:08:59,They're real.
00:08:59,00:09:00,They have an amazing department.
00:09:00,00:09:02,Their fake blood is a...
00:09:02,00:09:08,"Could it be that you put it in your stockings and it gives you a shape, maybe?"
00:09:08,00:09:10,I think it was for some...
00:09:10,00:09:11,There's some horrible...
00:09:11,00:09:14,Titus Andronicus has lots of terrible torture and gore and all this stuff.
00:09:14,00:09:15,So they do like...
00:09:15,00:09:16,It's rare.
00:09:16,00:09:19,It's not across the canon that you need a tinned pear in the department.
00:09:19,00:09:20,But they've got these...
00:09:20,00:09:22,A tinned pear?
00:09:22,00:09:25,Their fake blood recipe is secret and they've got three different consistencies.
00:09:25,00:09:30,"And there was an interview with Helen Hughes, who's one of their very senior prop and design people."
00:09:30,00:09:32,And she was being interviewed about fake blood.
00:09:32,00:09:34,"And the interviewer asked her, like, what kind of..."
00:09:34,00:09:35,What do you use for your fake blood?
00:09:35,00:09:37,"And she said, what kind of blood?"
00:09:37,00:09:41,"There's venal blood, arterial blood, newly dry blood, crusty old blood."
00:09:41,00:09:42,They've got...
00:09:42,00:09:43,They can do all of it.
00:09:43,00:09:44,All the bloods.
00:09:44,00:09:45,She's an artist.
00:09:45,00:09:46,She's an artist.
00:09:46,00:09:47,She knows her craft.
00:09:47,00:09:48,I know.
00:09:48,00:09:49,Yeah.
00:09:49,00:09:50,Helen.
00:09:50,00:09:51,There was a story which is...
00:09:51,00:09:55,"Because you got this story from a Giles Brandrith anecdote book, didn't you?"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"Yeah, a theater anecdote book."
00:09:57,00:09:59,The word fact would be questionable.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"But yes, I did."
00:10:01,00:10:02,But there was...
00:10:02,00:10:04,So there was a guy who was called William McCready.
00:10:04,00:10:09,And it was early 19th century Shakespearean plays that he was in.
00:10:09,00:10:14,And he forgot basically to put blood on his hand because he was in Macbeth and he needed blood on his hand.
00:10:14,00:10:16,And he went to the side of the stage and it wasn't there.
00:10:16,00:10:19,It wasn't on the side and he desperately needed it.
00:10:19,00:10:20,But there happened to be a bystander there.
00:10:20,00:10:22,So he punched him in the nose.
00:10:22,00:10:28,And he'll swipe the blood off his nose and ram back on.
00:10:28,00:10:29,Yeah.
00:10:29,00:10:30,According to Giles.
00:10:30,00:10:31,Yeah.
00:10:31,00:10:33,And that's where it falls down.
00:10:33,00:10:35,That's incredible.
00:10:35,00:10:37,But what happens when you die?
00:10:37,00:10:38,What do you mean?
00:10:38,00:10:40,What would happen to you as a person if you died?
00:10:40,00:10:41,What would you...
00:10:41,00:10:42,I think we...
00:10:42,00:10:44,What would you become?
00:10:44,00:10:45,A ghost.
00:10:45,00:10:46,A ghost.
00:10:46,00:10:48,I got so into theater ghosts.
00:10:48,00:10:49,"Oh, right."
00:10:49,00:10:50,Researching this.
00:10:50,00:10:51,There are so many.
00:10:51,00:10:52,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:52,00:10:53,Some of them are really tragic.
00:10:53,00:10:58,So actually where this woman died of laughter at the Theatre Royal Jury Lane.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Yes.
00:10:59,00:11:00,They're kind of...
00:11:00,00:11:01,They've got...
00:11:01,00:11:03,I think it's the most haunted theatre in the world.
00:11:03,00:11:05,"Or they claim that, you know."
00:11:05,00:11:08,"And their kind of main event, their big star is the..."
00:11:08,00:11:09,What's his name?
00:11:09,00:11:11,The man in grey.
00:11:11,00:11:12,Okay.
00:11:12,00:11:14,"Who can be seen on like the upper circle, I think."
00:11:14,00:11:18,And he just like has a big cloak and is very menacing.
00:11:18,00:11:21,And it's actually founded in truth.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"Because when it was being renovated in the 1800s,"
00:11:23,00:11:26,they kind of found a bit of a fake bit of the wall.
00:11:26,00:11:29,And they looked into it and it was a little cubby hole.
00:11:29,00:11:35,And inside that cubby hole was a skeleton of a man with a dagger through his chest.
00:11:35,00:11:36,Wow.
00:11:36,00:11:42,And that's the exact place where this ghost has been spotted for centuries.
00:11:42,00:11:43,Very cool.
00:11:43,00:11:44,Dan believes it.
00:11:44,00:11:45,Dan believes it.
00:11:45,00:11:47,The theory of everything else.
00:11:47,00:11:53,I think I feel like that would be retroactively have been inserted into a wall in order to...
00:11:53,00:11:54,Really?
00:11:54,00:11:56,"Yeah, I've got very skeptical recently."
00:11:56,00:11:57,Wow.
00:11:57,00:12:00,"We need to move on, guys, to our next fact."
00:12:00,00:12:02,"Well, laughter can be very dangerous, right?"
00:12:02,00:12:03,Yeah.
00:12:03,00:12:05,So there was a study from the University of Birmingham.
00:12:05,00:12:08,"It was a meta-analysis, so they looked at loads of papers."
00:12:08,00:12:16,"And they found that laughter can cause abdominal hernia, dislocated jaw, incontinence, fainting,"
00:12:16,00:12:20,"infectious diseases, because when you laugh, you breathe in a lot and you get lots of germs"
00:12:20,00:12:21,in your mouth.
00:12:21,00:12:22,Yeah?
00:12:22,00:12:25,"Thanks for coming, everybody."
00:12:25,00:12:30,"There's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which is you laugh so much that you rupture"
00:12:30,00:12:31,your esophagus.
00:12:31,00:12:32,That can happen.
00:12:32,00:12:34,"But despite this, they have laughing contests."
00:12:34,00:12:37,And this is becoming quite common in America now.
00:12:37,00:12:40,"Basically, you go in and you just try and make each other laugh."
00:12:40,00:12:42,And there's loads of different types of laugh.
00:12:42,00:12:47,Best giggle and best knee-slapping laugh and best belly laugh and stuff like that.
00:12:47,00:12:52,"And apparently, the woman who won the American Championship last year, she didn't tell anyone"
00:12:52,00:12:55,"until afterwards, but she pissed her pants in the first round."
00:12:55,00:12:56,Oh.
00:12:56,00:12:57,Wow.
00:12:57,00:12:58,Is that an illegal move?
00:12:58,00:12:59,I...
00:12:59,00:13:02,"It feels like it must be, right?"
00:13:02,00:13:03,Yeah.
00:13:03,00:13:04,Wow.
00:13:04,00:13:05,It was only like a couple of years ago.
00:13:05,00:13:06,I pissed myself while laughing.
00:13:06,00:13:10,"And it's honestly, it's one of those moments where it's not embarrassing."
00:13:10,00:13:11,It's great.
00:13:11,00:13:12,It's a really wonderful feeling.
00:13:12,00:13:15,You feel like you've done laughter next level.
00:13:15,00:13:16,You feel like you've...
00:13:16,00:13:17,What was it?
00:13:17,00:13:18,What was it?
00:13:18,00:13:19,It was a late night.
00:13:19,00:13:20,I was quite drunk.
00:13:20,00:13:21,Someone said a joke.
00:13:21,00:13:22,And I just laughed so hard that I just...
00:13:22,00:13:24,And it wasn't even like a little bit of wee.
00:13:24,00:13:25,It was like...
00:13:25,00:13:27,"Like, total flood."
00:13:27,00:13:28,And I...
00:13:28,00:13:29,"Honestly, I did not apologise."
00:13:29,00:13:32,"I was like, ""Guys, you will need to try this."
00:13:32,00:13:34,"I think we've forgotten how great this feels."""
00:13:34,00:13:38,"OK, well, we've got three more facts."
00:13:38,00:13:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:13:40,00:13:49,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:13:49,00:13:51,And that is James.
00:13:51,00:13:54,My fact this week is that the first modern water bed
00:13:54,00:13:57,was filled with jelly rather than water.
00:13:57,00:13:59,The problem was that it was too heavy to move
00:13:59,00:14:03,and started to go rancid after a few weeks.
00:14:03,00:14:05,Isn't that incredible that it was jelly?
00:14:05,00:14:07,I find that one of the most astonishing facts.
00:14:07,00:14:09,"Yeah, it makes sense, really, doesn't it?"
00:14:09,00:14:12,If you want something nice and soft to lie on.
00:14:12,00:14:15,"So was it the bed, like, kind of the mold?"
00:14:15,00:14:17,"The jelly mold, if you like, and you pour it in"
00:14:17,00:14:18,and then it sets?
00:14:18,00:14:20,"Oh, I see what you're saying."
00:14:20,00:14:22,"Yeah, I guess it must have been, really,"
00:14:22,00:14:25,because you'd be weird to just shove in solid jelly.
00:14:25,00:14:27,I'm not quite sure.
00:14:27,00:14:29,"He also used cornstarch as well,"
00:14:29,00:14:31,"so cornstarch would be soft,"
00:14:31,00:14:33,"but then it's non-Newtonian,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,"so as you sort of push on it, it would get more solid."
00:14:36,00:14:39,"But again, that went rancid as well."
00:14:39,00:14:43,What's a liquid that doesn't go rancid?
00:14:43,00:14:50,"But he started it not as a bed, it started as a chair."
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Yeah, so Charles Hall this is, right?"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Yeah, Charles Hall."
00:14:53,00:14:56,So it was called the very first thing he invented.
00:14:56,00:14:58,"It was called the incredibly horrible thing,"
00:14:58,00:15:01,and it was a chair.
00:15:01,00:15:04,"It weighed 300 pounds, it had liquid starch inside it,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,and it had a vinyl skin.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"And the point was that when you sat into it,"
00:15:08,00:15:10,"the chair would creep up around you,"
00:15:10,00:15:12,because you were molding into it like that.
00:15:12,00:15:13,It sits on you?
00:15:13,00:15:14,Kind of.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"Eventually, yeah."
00:15:15,00:15:17,"Okay, so he made that,"
00:15:17,00:15:19,"but what he really, really wanted to do"
00:15:19,00:15:23,was make an entire room that was a water bed/chair.
00:15:23,00:15:24,"Oh, wow."
00:15:24,00:15:27,"So it was almost like a bit like a padded cell, I suppose."
00:15:27,00:15:29,"But you would walk in, close the door,"
00:15:29,00:15:32,"and wherever you were, you would just sort of sink into the wall"
00:15:32,00:15:33,or sink into the floor.
00:15:33,00:15:34,"Oh, my God."
00:15:34,00:15:36,But it was only because it was so expensive to make
00:15:36,00:15:38,that he decided to go for the water bed instead.
00:15:38,00:15:39,Gosh.
00:15:39,00:15:40,"What was expensive,"
00:15:40,00:15:42,manufacturing the jelly or the materials?
00:15:42,00:15:44,"Well, the thing is, if you want to buy a room,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,you kind of need to have to buy a house as well.
00:15:47,00:15:48,Do you know what I mean?
00:15:48,00:15:49,"Yeah, good point."
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Like, renovate your whole house to do that,"
00:15:51,00:15:53,"whereas if you just want to buy a bed or a chair,"
00:15:53,00:15:54,you could rent.
00:15:54,00:15:55,"Yes, you could."
00:15:55,00:15:57,"Oh, but I don't think I'd want to rent a water bed."
00:15:57,00:15:58,No?
00:15:58,00:16:00,"No, I mean you could rent a flat"
00:16:00,00:16:02,and put your water bed in there.
00:16:02,00:16:04,"Yeah, you could do that as well."
00:16:04,00:16:06,Have any of you ever slept on a water bed?
00:16:06,00:16:08,"Yeah, my parents used to have one."
00:16:08,00:16:09,I don't think I have.
00:16:09,00:16:10,When I was a kid.
00:16:10,00:16:11,Really?
00:16:11,00:16:12,They're so uncomfortable.
00:16:12,00:16:13,Yeah.
00:16:13,00:16:14,"Oh, are they?"
00:16:14,00:16:15,They're horrible.
00:16:15,00:16:17,I've read about them and said they're amazing.
00:16:17,00:16:21,"Like, they're the equivalent of pissing yourself while laughing."
00:16:21,00:16:26,"But maybe mine was like, it was a friend's parents' bed"
00:16:26,00:16:27,when I was a kid.
00:16:27,00:16:30,And it was like being seasick.
00:16:30,00:16:31,It would like move.
00:16:31,00:16:33,It was honestly vile.
00:16:33,00:16:34,Huh.
00:16:34,00:16:36,And it was really cold.
00:16:36,00:16:38,"Like, they hadn't heated the water."
00:16:38,00:16:40,"Oh, but you can get those now."
00:16:40,00:16:41,"Oh, thank God."
00:16:41,00:16:43,"Okay, well, that's all changed."
00:16:43,00:16:45,"No, Charles Hall, these days, who invented this thing,"
00:16:45,00:16:46,"what, 50 years ago."
00:16:46,00:16:47,Yeah.
00:16:47,00:16:49,"He now, he has two water beds now."
00:16:49,00:16:51,"No, that doesn't sound very impressive,"
00:16:51,00:16:54,"but he's got, because they come in different,"
00:16:54,00:16:56,it's different bladders.
00:16:56,00:16:58,So you can see how many bladders are there in your water bed.
00:16:58,00:17:00,So he's got one king-size single bladder.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"Oh, wow."
00:17:01,00:17:02,But he's also...
00:17:02,00:17:04,If only you had a king-size bladder that night.
00:17:04,00:17:08,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:08,00:17:10,"He's also got a, in his guest room,"
00:17:10,00:17:13,"he's got a double mattress which has adjacent double bladders,"
00:17:13,00:17:15,so you can heat one if you want your bed a bit warmer
00:17:15,00:17:17,than whoever you're sleeping next to.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"Oh, really?"
00:17:18,00:17:19,"Oh, that's excellent."
00:17:19,00:17:20,You can hot water bottle your...
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:22,Your bed is the hot water bottle.
00:17:22,00:17:23,Wow.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"Oh, you're actually selling it."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Maybe we should look at one, guys."
00:17:25,00:17:26,That's incredible.
00:17:26,00:17:27,This first one was...
00:17:27,00:17:29,"The one that Hall invented it, I think it was 1968, he invented it."
00:17:29,00:17:31,He called it the Pleasure Pit.
00:17:31,00:17:34,And we should probably talk about the slightly...
00:17:34,00:17:36,There was a slightly sexy reputation they had.
00:17:36,00:17:37,Yeah.
00:17:37,00:17:38,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:38,00:17:40,One of the manufacturers in the early days was called Wet Dream.
00:17:40,00:17:42,(LAUGHTER)
00:17:42,00:17:44,There was an advert...
00:17:44,00:17:46,"I don't know, it's not great advert,"
00:17:46,00:17:49,"but it said, ""She'll admire you for your car."
00:17:49,00:17:51,"""She'll respect you for your position,"
00:17:51,00:17:53,"""and she'll love you for your water bed."""
00:17:53,00:17:55,"So, it was a kind of..."
00:17:55,00:17:56,"Well, there was lots of..."
00:17:56,00:17:57,Creepy.
00:17:57,00:17:59,"He had that to begin with, so he had invented it."
00:17:59,00:18:03,"He had patented it, but everyone just did sort of spin-off water beds."
00:18:03,00:18:07,"And he said that there was one company he noticed that it was sort of sexy,"
00:18:07,00:18:11,"because, like, their other products were orgy butter and things like that, right?"
00:18:11,00:18:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:12,00:18:14,"And then, when you read into it..."
00:18:14,00:18:15,Orgy butter?
00:18:15,00:18:17,And I did a lot of Googling.
00:18:17,00:18:18,I'm so sorry.
00:18:18,00:18:19,(LAUGHTER)
00:18:19,00:18:22,We had to switch to orgy marge because of the cost of living.
00:18:22,00:18:23,Sorry.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"So, orgy butter was a thing."
00:18:25,00:18:27,"And then, when you look into, as you say, the sexual connotations"
00:18:27,00:18:29,about the early sales of the water bed.
00:18:29,00:18:34,"So, a lot of it was that it was basically like having a threesome,"
00:18:34,00:18:36,"because the bed acted as the third person,"
00:18:36,00:18:39,because it moulded around you as you...
00:18:39,00:18:42,It feels like a third person as part of the...
00:18:42,00:18:44,"Hang on, buddy."
00:18:44,00:18:45,I'm sorry.
00:18:45,00:18:48,"Just, like, let's just, like, zoom out on this."
00:18:48,00:18:52,"Taking this, like, ""I'm just telling you about my experiences."""
00:18:52,00:18:53,"Well, these are the facts."
00:18:53,00:18:54,"Well, you're telling us a lot of stuff."
00:18:54,00:18:57,"Your parents did have one, so you probably conceived in it, were you?"
00:18:57,00:18:58,Probably.
00:18:58,00:18:59,Are you from a water bed?
00:18:59,00:19:00,Probably.
00:19:00,00:19:01,"Oh, God."
00:19:01,00:19:02,You're a water baby.
00:19:02,00:19:03,That's nice.
00:19:03,00:19:04,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:04,00:19:06,"'Cause, like, I don't want to be, like, let's not get too graphic,"
00:19:06,00:19:09,"but, like, there's got to be a purchase problem."
00:19:09,00:19:10,Supposedly not.
00:19:10,00:19:11,"Like, supposedly not."
00:19:11,00:19:12,It's a water bed.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"Like, you're, like, sloshing around."
00:19:14,00:19:15,Apparently.
00:19:15,00:19:16,Apparently.
00:19:16,00:19:18,"I mean, they were very popular."
00:19:18,00:19:19,I know they were popular.
00:19:19,00:19:22,"At one point, I think a fifth of mattresses being sold"
00:19:22,00:19:23,were water bed mattresses.
00:19:23,00:19:24,"Yeah, I read that."
00:19:24,00:19:25,I thought that was...
00:19:25,00:19:27,"In 1987, which is the year I was born."
00:19:27,00:19:28,Insane.
00:19:28,00:19:30,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:30,00:19:34,And Hugh Hefner famously bought one for the Playboy Mansion
00:19:34,00:19:39,that was upholstered in Tasmanian possum hair.
00:19:39,00:19:40,(LAUGHTER)
00:19:40,00:19:42,Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever...
00:19:42,00:19:43,"Also, 'cause they're not..."
00:19:43,00:19:44,Ever heard.
00:19:44,00:19:45,They're not very big.
00:19:45,00:19:47,So many Tasmanian possums has.
00:19:47,00:19:48,Yeah.
00:19:48,00:19:49,Yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:51,"So it had this reputation for being very, kind of,"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"like, asexual aid."
00:19:53,00:19:56,"'Cause, yeah, 'cause another tagline for it was,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,"""Two things are better on a water bed"
00:19:58,00:20:00,"than one of them's sleep."""
00:20:00,00:20:01,Mmm.
00:20:01,00:20:02,I know.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"Like, one in five kinky people are just, like,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,"getting off, well, your parents, one of them."
00:20:07,00:20:08,Yeah.
00:20:08,00:20:09,Two of them.
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Two of them, yeah."
00:20:10,00:20:11,Getting off on water beds.
00:20:11,00:20:13,"And honestly, it must have felt so sick."
00:20:13,00:20:15,'Cause it's the worst thing to sleep on.
00:20:15,00:20:17,Isn't there a point where you stop...
00:20:17,00:20:19,"If you stop moving, the bed will eventually stop moving?"
00:20:19,00:20:20,"No. No, it keeps moving."
00:20:20,00:20:21,"Oh, OK."
00:20:21,00:20:22,You're kind of like...
00:20:22,00:20:24,You're lost at sea.
00:20:24,00:20:26,It's an extraordinary experience.
00:20:26,00:20:27,I can't...
00:20:27,00:20:28,But that's another...
00:20:28,00:20:30,I could imagine you ringing up the Coast Guard.
00:20:30,00:20:31,(LAUGHTER)
00:20:31,00:20:33,Where are you?
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Away from the sexual side,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,it was also seen as quite therapeutic.
00:20:36,00:20:39,"So, for example, the friends of Charles Hall,"
00:20:39,00:20:41,"when he first invented it, said,"
00:20:41,00:20:43,"""Well, you should name it 'The Bed Womb',"""
00:20:43,00:20:45,because it feels womb-like.
00:20:45,00:20:46,It feels right to...
00:20:46,00:20:47,It's a good line.
00:20:47,00:20:48,It's a good line.
00:20:48,00:20:49,Get a bed-womb for your bedroom.
00:20:49,00:20:50,It's a good line.
00:20:50,00:20:51,"Oh, call yourself a therapist."
00:20:51,00:20:52,That's...
00:20:52,00:20:54,"And then there was, in 1988,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,the American Journal of Disease of Children
00:20:56,00:20:58,published an article in which they said that
00:20:58,00:21:01,"for infants that were born to drug-addicted mothers,"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"if you kept them on water beds rather than bassinets,"
00:21:03,00:21:04,that would be better for them.
00:21:04,00:21:06,"This sort of constant, womb-like movement."
00:21:06,00:21:07,"Oh, right."
00:21:07,00:21:08,Going on as they sleep.
00:21:08,00:21:09,Yeah.
00:21:09,00:21:10,"So, it was seen as therapeutic as well."
00:21:10,00:21:13,"Well, the thing is that he did invent the modern water bed,"
00:21:13,00:21:15,"but actually there were earlier ones,"
00:21:15,00:21:17,and they were used therapeutically.
00:21:17,00:21:21,"So, they were used during the war to prevent bed sores."
00:21:21,00:21:24,"These weren't like the ones that we had in the '80s,"
00:21:24,00:21:25,but they were just kind of like...
00:21:25,00:21:28,"I don't know, like, you know one of those blow-up mattresses"
00:21:28,00:21:29,but with water inside of it?
00:21:29,00:21:30,Yeah.
00:21:30,00:21:31,Mark Twain wrote about them.
00:21:31,00:21:33,Elizabeth Gaskell wrote about them.
00:21:33,00:21:35,Charles Hall couldn't get a patent originally
00:21:35,00:21:38,because they'd been described by Robert A. Heinlein.
00:21:38,00:21:40,Quite a few of his books mentioned them.
00:21:40,00:21:42,"And when he tried to get a patent, they went,"
00:21:42,00:21:43,"""Well, it's in all these science fiction books,"
00:21:43,00:21:44,"so you can't have invented it."""
00:21:44,00:21:46,"So, he had to change a few things to get that."
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Oh, right."
00:21:47,00:21:51,"But when they became quite lame, which was quite quickly,"
00:21:51,00:21:53,"so they were, like, massive in the early '80s, right?"
00:21:53,00:21:56,"And then by the late '80s, they were really passe,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"like, no one really wanted them anymore."
00:21:58,00:21:59,And they had all these water beds.
00:21:59,00:22:00,They didn't know what to do with them.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"And they gave them to dairy farmers,"
00:22:02,00:22:04,and the cows would sit on them.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"Oh, and that's all these films they still do."
00:22:06,00:22:08,The Queen's Cows.
00:22:08,00:22:11,They famously sleep on water beds.
00:22:11,00:22:12,The King's Cows.
00:22:12,00:22:14,"Well, now the King's Cows, yeah."
00:22:14,00:22:16,"Well, I don't know if he's changed it, though,"
00:22:16,00:22:17,"but, you know..."
00:22:17,00:22:18,"Sure, okay, all right."
00:22:18,00:22:21,I've been waiting 70 years to kick those cows off that bed.
00:22:21,00:22:24,My cows now.
00:22:24,00:22:26,That's what he was waiting for.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"So, most, if you're..."
00:22:28,00:22:30,"They're so heavy. As you say, they're so heavy."
00:22:30,00:22:31,"Like, a normal..."
00:22:31,00:22:33,The most impractical thing ever in real life.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Like, a normal mattress is quite heavy, you know?"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"You fill it with water, you're joking, you know?"
00:22:37,00:22:38,It's like...
00:22:38,00:22:40,"So, some of them can weigh 900 kilos"
00:22:40,00:22:41,if you've got a big double or a king's...
00:22:41,00:22:42,That's a lot.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"And there's a concern in some buildings,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,"if you're in a flat or you're on an upper floor, obviously,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"and, you know, they'll all go through the floor."
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:51,"And most New York leases contain a standard clause,"
00:22:51,00:22:53,which says no water beds.
00:22:53,00:22:54,Right.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Probably because of, like, it's a bit..."
00:22:56,00:22:58,"You know, maybe it's just bureaucracy, but..."
00:22:58,00:23:00,"But in California, on the other coast,"
00:23:00,00:23:02,the civil code says landlords cannot discriminate
00:23:02,00:23:04,against people who own water beds...
00:23:04,00:23:05,No.
00:23:05,00:23:08,As long as they have taken out waterbed insurance.
00:23:08,00:23:09,Right.
00:23:09,00:23:10,The responsible thing to do.
00:23:10,00:23:11,It is.
00:23:11,00:23:12,It is.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"Well, I quite like, as well, in 1990,"
00:23:13,00:23:14,"speaking of California,"
00:23:14,00:23:16,"the Compton Fire Department,"
00:23:16,00:23:18,"within their fire station,"
00:23:18,00:23:21,changed all of the mattresses to water mattresses.
00:23:21,00:23:23,"Not so that, like, if there was an emergency..."
00:23:23,00:23:24,Just if they needed more water.
00:23:24,00:23:25,No.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"No, no."
00:23:26,00:23:28,"It was the effect on their back, apparently."
00:23:28,00:23:30,"Someone had said, ""I sleep better on a water bed,"""
00:23:30,00:23:31,and so they all...
00:23:31,00:23:33,"But that's all been disproven,"
00:23:33,00:23:35,"because it doesn't actually help,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,"because there's a lot of things that help, like,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"your posture or, like, your joints."
00:23:39,00:23:40,That isn't true.
00:23:40,00:23:41,Really?
00:23:41,00:23:42,Okay.
00:23:42,00:23:43,Yeah.
00:23:43,00:23:44,Apparently it's not true.
00:23:44,00:23:45,Right.
00:23:45,00:23:47,I'm just obsessed that there was a waterbed magazine.
00:23:47,00:23:48,"Oh, yeah, I know."
00:23:48,00:23:49,In the '80s.
00:23:49,00:23:50,I tried finding it today.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"Yeah, so did I."
00:23:51,00:23:52,"Oh, my God."
00:23:52,00:23:53,"No, we need a soapy."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Cool.
00:23:54,00:23:55,Great.
00:23:55,00:23:56,Okay.
00:23:56,00:23:57,But...
00:23:57,00:23:58,Brilliant.
00:23:58,00:23:59,I bought us a lot of orgy butter.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"Oh, great."
00:24:00,00:24:01,"Okay, good."
00:24:01,00:24:02,Good.
00:24:02,00:24:03,Can I flip it over?
00:24:03,00:24:04,What?
00:24:04,00:24:05,I mean...
00:24:05,00:24:11,What other interpretation are you...
00:24:11,00:24:13,"I was double-checking,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,"because I thought I might have heard you say,"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"""Flick your mattress,"" and I wasn't sure."
00:24:17,00:24:19,How often do you flick your mattress?
00:24:19,00:24:20,Twice a night.
00:24:20,00:24:22,"No, how often do you flip it?"
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Well, this is what's amazing."
00:24:23,00:24:25,"Not as often as I should, I'm sure."
00:24:25,00:24:27,And I was planning tomorrow to flip my mattress.
00:24:27,00:24:28,Get out of here.
00:24:28,00:24:29,"No, get lost."
00:24:29,00:24:31,"Yeah, absolutely, because both Vanella and I"
00:24:31,00:24:33,are on the wrong sides at the moment.
00:24:33,00:24:34,It's gone soft on the sides.
00:24:34,00:24:35,On the outer edge?
00:24:35,00:24:36,"Yeah, on the outer edge."
00:24:36,00:24:37,Why is it not soft on the outer edge?
00:24:37,00:24:38,"That's not going to help, though,"
00:24:38,00:24:39,because it's still going to be the outer edge.
00:24:39,00:24:40,I feel...
00:24:40,00:24:42,"I feel like it's upside down anyway,"
00:24:42,00:24:44,because I noticed recently I've been sleeping on a zip
00:24:44,00:24:45,"the whole time,"
00:24:45,00:24:48,and I'm pretty sure that's the wrong side.
00:24:48,00:24:49,Okay.
00:24:49,00:24:50,Some orgy butter.
00:24:50,00:24:51,We'll just sort that right out.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Just rub it in, you'll be fine."
00:24:53,00:24:56,"Anyway, half Americans claim they flip it every six months,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,and I just think half Americans are liars.
00:24:57,00:24:59,I think no one possibly does it that much.
00:24:59,00:25:00,But why should you flip?
00:25:00,00:25:01,I think...
00:25:01,00:25:03,I think it's...
00:25:03,00:25:05,So...
00:25:05,00:25:06,"No, it's..."
00:25:06,00:25:07,I can tell you exactly why.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"You get soft on the outside,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,and then you fall off the bed.
00:25:10,00:25:11,That's why we're doing it.
00:25:11,00:25:13,Is it not to try and air it out
00:25:13,00:25:14,a little bit or something?
00:25:14,00:25:15,I don't know.
00:25:15,00:25:16,So it's not the same bit of you
00:25:16,00:25:17,always hitting the same bit of the mattress?
00:25:17,00:25:18,"Right, okay."
00:25:18,00:25:19,"And so it refreshes it a bit,"
00:25:19,00:25:20,it moves the scene around.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"Because mattresses are disgusting,"
00:25:22,00:25:23,"because they're full of, like,"
00:25:23,00:25:26,"skin cells, sweat, like, bed bugs."
00:25:26,00:25:27,So I think this is the way
00:25:27,00:25:28,of just sort of redistributing
00:25:28,00:25:29,the skin cells and sweat.
00:25:29,00:25:30,You should really get rid...
00:25:30,00:25:32,"They're so expensive, mattresses."
00:25:32,00:25:33,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:33,00:25:34,"They're, like, thousands of pounds."
00:25:34,00:25:35,You can't just...
00:25:35,00:25:37,"Because you should really replace them regularly, I think,"
00:25:37,00:25:40,but that's why you should get a waterbed.
00:25:40,00:25:42,"Oh, yeah, because you just changed the water."
00:25:42,00:25:44,"Well, not even, you know."
00:25:44,00:25:46,Because water doesn't go rancid.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Unlike jelly.
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:50,To bring us back to the start of the fact.
00:25:50,00:25:51,Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:53,"I need to move us on to our next fact, guys."
00:25:58,00:26:00,"OK, it is time for fact number three,"
00:26:00,00:26:01,and that is my fact.
00:26:01,00:26:04,My fact this week is that there used to be a room
00:26:04,00:26:07,in the Pentagon where employees met specifically
00:26:07,00:26:09,to have Pokemon battles.
00:26:09,00:26:10,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:10,00:26:15,This is a discovery that was made back in 2016.
00:26:15,00:26:18,Was there a situation room elsewhere in the Pentagon
00:26:18,00:26:20,where other officials monitored the progress
00:26:20,00:26:23,of those Pokemon battles with big screens?
00:26:23,00:26:26,Do you think they have tables where they're pushing a Pikachu along?
00:26:26,00:26:27,"Yeah, exactly, yeah."
00:26:27,00:26:28,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:28,00:26:30,"That's the situation room. That's what it's for, yeah."
00:26:30,00:26:32,So this is Pokemon Go.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"There was a huge craze, particularly about..."
00:26:35,00:26:36,Still is.
00:26:36,00:26:37,"Yeah, but there was a mo..."
00:26:37,00:26:38,"Well, James is..."
00:26:38,00:26:40,"What's that T-shirt you're wearing, James?"
00:26:40,00:26:42,"This is, I mean, this fact is up my street"
00:26:42,00:26:45,because I do like Pokemon and changing regimes
00:26:45,00:26:47,"in countries that I don't like, so..."
00:26:47,00:26:48,Ah!
00:26:48,00:26:49,(LAUGHTER)
00:26:49,00:26:50,James loves...
00:26:50,00:26:51,Getting a bit political tonight?
00:26:51,00:26:52,Yeah.
00:26:52,00:26:53,James loves Pokemon Go so much.
00:26:53,00:26:55,I don't know if we've ever said this.
00:26:55,00:26:57,"He likes it so much that when we went for a meeting,"
00:26:57,00:26:59,"for the first time ever, we were going to have"
00:26:59,00:27:01,"a Book of the Year, no such thing as a fish book,"
00:27:01,00:27:02,and we were going to pitch it.
00:27:02,00:27:04,We ended up being a bit late to the meeting
00:27:04,00:27:05,"because we were following James,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,but it turned out James had spotted a very rare Pokemon
00:27:08,00:27:10,"down the road from where we were,"
00:27:10,00:27:11,"and we just blindly followed him,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,"and then we were like, ""Where are we?"""
00:27:13,00:27:16,"And he was like, ""Yes! Snuffle off a gussle, whoever it is!"""
00:27:16,00:27:19,(LAUGHTER)
00:27:19,00:27:21,"When was that week they did a Sesame Street special,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"wasn't it, of Pokemon Go?"
00:27:23,00:27:24,"OK, so here's the thing."
00:27:24,00:27:26,"It's Pokemon Go, and Pokemon Go was the app,"
00:27:26,00:27:28,and you would go and you would collect the Pokemons
00:27:28,00:27:29,in various different places.
00:27:29,00:27:30,"You had to walk around, didn't you?"
00:27:30,00:27:31,"You would walk around, and yeah."
00:27:31,00:27:33,"And then what they had as part of the app,"
00:27:33,00:27:34,"I've never personally played it,"
00:27:34,00:27:37,so this is 101 for people that do.
00:27:37,00:27:40,"You have gyms where you can take the Pokemon 2,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"the Pokemon you have collected,"
00:27:42,00:27:43,"and they can train there,"
00:27:43,00:27:45,"but they can also battle for dominance of the gym,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,and those would be plopped all over the world
00:27:47,00:27:48,"in random spots,"
00:27:48,00:27:51,"and it just so happened that one was in the Pentagon,"
00:27:51,00:27:54,"and so anyone who was an employee there,"
00:27:54,00:27:55,"and it would be specifically employees,"
00:27:55,00:27:57,"because if you ever go on a tour of the Pentagon,"
00:27:57,00:27:58,"you have to leave your phone,"
00:27:58,00:28:00,"you're not allowed to bring your phone in with you,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,so it was specifically employees
00:28:02,00:28:04,"that were going to a very specific spot,"
00:28:04,00:28:07,"and then they'd battle each other for dominance of this gym,"
00:28:07,00:28:08,and this was a huge problem
00:28:08,00:28:11,"because the Pokemon app can track where people are going,"
00:28:11,00:28:14,so their worry within the Pentagon
00:28:14,00:28:17,"was that it shows the routes that people are taking,"
00:28:17,00:28:20,"so there were secret passages within the Pentagon,"
00:28:20,00:28:23,or even just mapping out the general landscape.
00:28:23,00:28:25,That's something that the information
00:28:25,00:28:28,could possibly be hacked into and retrieved.
00:28:28,00:28:30,Someone might know that the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped.
00:28:30,00:28:31,"I mean, that would be awful."
00:28:31,00:28:33,Do you imagine?
00:28:33,00:28:36,"So they said, ""No more Pokemon Go in the Pentagon."""
00:28:36,00:28:38,Do you know why the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped?
00:28:38,00:28:39,I think this is amazing.
00:28:39,00:28:40,No.
00:28:40,00:28:42,It's because they were going to build it
00:28:42,00:28:44,"on a pentagon-shaped piece of land,"
00:28:44,00:28:47,and so they wanted the right shape of building
00:28:47,00:28:48,"for that piece of land,"
00:28:48,00:28:49,"so it had to be a pentagon,"
00:28:49,00:28:52,"and then they decided to move it somewhere else,"
00:28:52,00:28:53,"and they thought,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,"""Well, we've gone so far with this shape."
00:28:55,00:28:56,"We might as well keep it."""
00:28:56,00:28:58,That's literally the only reason.
00:28:58,00:29:00,"I mean, there's lots of good things about it being pentagon-shaped,"
00:29:00,00:29:03,but the reason is just it was supposed to go on this bit of land.
00:29:03,00:29:04,That's incredible.
00:29:04,00:29:06,What are some of the good things?
00:29:06,00:29:07,"Well, a circle is very good"
00:29:07,00:29:09,because you can get from one bit of a circle
00:29:09,00:29:11,"to another bit of a circle really quickly,"
00:29:11,00:29:14,"and a pentagon is a bit like a circle,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"but it's got straight edges,"
00:29:16,00:29:18,so it's easier to build the circle.
00:29:18,00:29:19,Yeah.
00:29:19,00:29:21,It's more of a circle than a square.
00:29:21,00:29:22,Absolutely.
00:29:22,00:29:23,Yeah.
00:29:23,00:29:24,Less than a hexagon.
00:29:24,00:29:25,"Oh, sure."
00:29:25,00:29:30,Food for thought tonight on...
00:29:30,00:29:35,And in the centre of the kind of circular pentagon
00:29:35,00:29:39,is a now-closed hotdog stand.
00:29:39,00:29:40,"Oh, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:41,Yeah.
00:29:41,00:29:43,"During the Cold War,"
00:29:43,00:29:47,the Russians always had at least two missiles
00:29:47,00:29:49,that seemed at this hotdog stand
00:29:49,00:29:51,because they thought that that was the pentagon's
00:29:51,00:29:54,most top-secret meeting place.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"It was just where people got lunch,"
00:29:56,00:29:58,but they were convinced that it was...
00:29:58,00:30:00,Was it because they saw people kind of congregate here?
00:30:00,00:30:01,Yeah.
00:30:01,00:30:03,"And they'd be like, ""That has to be the..."
00:30:03,00:30:05,"That's the heart of the pentagon,"
00:30:05,00:30:07,"when actually it was just a hotdog stand."""
00:30:07,00:30:08,I know.
00:30:08,00:30:10,"Was it part of the pentagon, this hotdog stand?"
00:30:10,00:30:11,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Okay. It was inside.
00:30:12,00:30:14,"I still feel like if the missiles hit it,"
00:30:14,00:30:16,the other bit of pentagon would suffer some damage.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Yeah.
00:30:17,00:30:20,They're not really so specific the missile that it's like...
00:30:20,00:30:21,"No, true."
00:30:21,00:30:22,"I mean, you know."
00:30:22,00:30:23,"But it's fascinating, I think."
00:30:23,00:30:25,"Did they know that, the hotdog owners at the time?"
00:30:25,00:30:28,"I think they did because everyone used to call it Ground Zero, didn't they?"
00:30:28,00:30:30,That was the nickname for it.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"The reason being that if the Russians hit,"
00:30:32,00:30:35,it would become Ground Zero and become flattened.
00:30:35,00:30:36,Blimey.
00:30:36,00:30:37,Right.
00:30:37,00:30:39,I've read a thing that the pentagon own.
00:30:39,00:30:41,It's just their cool stuff division.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"They own a laser, which that's not the cool bit,"
00:30:43,00:30:47,which can analyse who you are based on your heartbeat alone.
00:30:47,00:30:48,Really?
00:30:48,00:30:49,So they'll...
00:30:49,00:30:50,"You know, you have it..."
00:30:50,00:30:53,"All of our hearts have their unique cardiac signature,"
00:30:53,00:30:54,how our hearts beat.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Yeah.
00:30:55,00:30:57,And they can point that laser at you from 200 metres away
00:30:57,00:30:59,"and say, ""There's Dan."""
00:30:59,00:31:00,Or whatever it might be.
00:31:00,00:31:03,What if I've just gone up a flight of stairs or something?
00:31:03,00:31:06,Would it change my heartbeat or...?
00:31:06,00:31:07,"It would change, wouldn't it?"
00:31:07,00:31:09,But maybe it changes with the same...
00:31:09,00:31:10,But it's still recognisably you.
00:31:10,00:31:12,"Yeah, they go, ""That's James."""
00:31:12,00:31:14,And he's very unfair.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"There's a few flaws to this thing, though."
00:31:16,00:31:18,"It's called Jetson, which is what they've developed."
00:31:18,00:31:21,"And the flaws consist of the fact that,"
00:31:21,00:31:24,"A, we don't really have that bigger database"
00:31:24,00:31:26,of people's unique heartbeats.
00:31:26,00:31:28,"So when everyone's coming, they can go,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,"""Ah, no, no, I didn't do that. That's right."""
00:31:31,00:31:33,"And then the second flaw, and this is, you know,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"200 metres away we can do this, is their claim."
00:31:36,00:31:38,"The other problem is, yes, they can do it"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"if you're wearing a T-shirt, but if you're wearing a coat,"
00:31:41,00:31:43,they can't get you.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"Yeah, so it's half-useful."
00:31:45,00:31:47,"Yeah, it's not as good as the fingerprint yet,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,or the eyeball.
00:31:49,00:31:50,The lychee?
00:31:50,00:31:51,The lychee.
00:31:51,00:31:52,Thank you.
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:55,"I was reading about the Pentagon generally,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,"about tour guides, because you can go there."
00:31:57,00:32:00,"I imagine, Jamie, that's somewhere that you might have gone,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,but maybe not yet.
00:32:01,00:32:02,I haven't.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"But you love this kind of stuff, right?"
00:32:04,00:32:07,"Yeah, I actually have a friend that works at the Pentagon."
00:32:07,00:32:10,He didn't reply to my emails about fun facts about the Pentagon.
00:32:10,00:32:13,"So the security is really high, guys."
00:32:13,00:32:15,"We're safe, you know."
00:32:15,00:32:17,"But one of the things is, there's stats"
00:32:17,00:32:19,"that you get told about the tour guides that work there,"
00:32:19,00:32:23,"and one of it is that they walk two to three miles per day,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,"but entirely backwards,"
00:32:25,00:32:27,"because when they're doing their tours,"
00:32:27,00:32:29,"they never turn around to lead,"
00:32:29,00:32:31,because they always need eyes on the people
00:32:31,00:32:33,that they're taking on the tour guide.
00:32:33,00:32:34,So they guide themselves...
00:32:34,00:32:35,What?
00:32:35,00:32:37,"Yeah, they guide themselves by landmarks."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"So as they're walking back the go, there's the fire extinguisher."
00:32:39,00:32:42,"That means, you know, ten steps until you get to the next corner,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,then I can round it like that.
00:32:44,00:32:47,"And so, yeah, every day, two to three miles of backward walking"
00:32:47,00:32:48,is what they get.
00:32:48,00:32:50,And there's loads of ramps.
00:32:50,00:32:53,That's really quite impressive to walk down a ramp backwards.
00:32:53,00:32:55,"You know, there's like no lift to the Pentagon."
00:32:55,00:32:56,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:56,00:32:57,It was built with one lift.
00:32:57,00:32:58,Yes.
00:32:58,00:32:59,Because it was built during...
00:32:59,00:33:01,Because it was made of concrete.
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Yeah, it was made of concrete."
00:33:03,00:33:05,"In fact, it's nicknamed the Concrete Cobweb, which is cool."
00:33:05,00:33:08,"And it had one lift for 33,000 people in the early days,"
00:33:08,00:33:11,"because you can't make lifts out of concrete, I suppose."
00:33:11,00:33:12,Right.
00:33:12,00:33:14,And they were saving steel for the war efforts.
00:33:14,00:33:15,They didn't want to...
00:33:15,00:33:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:17,But they've now put some more in.
00:33:17,00:33:19,They've now got dozens and dozens.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"I love the idea of you repeatedly emailing your friend,"
00:33:21,00:33:23,"who's in the middle of looking at a screen,"
00:33:23,00:33:25,and there's like a bomb counter on it.
00:33:25,00:33:26,I know.
00:33:26,00:33:28,"It's somewhere in Ulaanbaatar, but I don't know where."
00:33:28,00:33:29,"Just ping, ping."
00:33:29,00:33:31,"Hi, just wondering if you saw my previous..."
00:33:31,00:33:33,"I was like, fun fact, request email."
00:33:33,00:33:36,Is it true that they used to have office chair races down the ramps
00:33:36,00:33:37,in the Pentagon?
00:33:37,00:33:38,That's all I wanted to know.
00:33:38,00:33:40,"I think what he's really going is,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"""God damn it, snuffle-uffagus, come on, win this Pokemon battle!"""
00:33:43,00:33:45,"No, we can't, because they've banned the Pokemon."
00:33:45,00:33:46,"Oh, yeah, of course."
00:33:46,00:33:47,They also banned...
00:33:47,00:33:48,"Yeah, well, that was the whole thing,"
00:33:48,00:33:49,"that you aren't allowed it anymore, right?"
00:33:49,00:33:50,"Yeah, it's out, it's out."
00:33:50,00:33:53,"Because they're banning things left and right at the Pentagon,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,like TikTok's now banned at the Pentagon.
00:33:55,00:33:58,But they also banned Furbies.
00:33:58,00:33:59,"Oh, yeah."
00:33:59,00:34:00,In 1999.
00:34:00,00:34:02,Because they record what you say?
00:34:02,00:34:05,"Well, they don't, but they kind of marketed themselves as that..."
00:34:05,00:34:08,It's like the thinking toy or the chatty toy or something.
00:34:08,00:34:09,I don't know.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"And they were, like, concerned that it would be a security risk"
00:34:11,00:34:13,"that they would, like, yeah, record what you were saying"
00:34:13,00:34:15,and then say it back to you.
00:34:15,00:34:16,That's so funny.
00:34:16,00:34:19,I think it's fair enough to ask people not to bring Furbies in.
00:34:19,00:34:21,It's a petty aspect or the spying thing.
00:34:21,00:34:23,It's weird having to bring your toy to work at the Pentagon.
00:34:23,00:34:24,"Well, you say that."
00:34:24,00:34:26,The Pokemon Go is just as kind of...
00:34:26,00:34:27,Yeah?
00:34:27,00:34:29,"...maybe childish, I don't want to, you know."
00:34:29,00:34:30,But the...
00:34:30,00:34:32,"I think we say ""for all ages"", rather than..."
00:34:32,00:34:33,"Sure, sure."
00:34:33,00:34:35,I'm glad you made three in the end.
00:34:35,00:34:37,"Three episodes of ""No such thing as they say it""."
00:34:37,00:34:38,Yeah.
00:34:38,00:34:39,Going on behind.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"I know that Furbies was really interesting, wasn't it?"
00:34:41,00:34:42,Because they...
00:34:42,00:34:47,The way they worked is they had a stock number of English words they had.
00:34:47,00:34:50,And they had a stock number of Furbies words.
00:34:50,00:34:51,They were just like...
00:34:51,00:34:52,All that kind of stuff.
00:34:52,00:34:53,Yeah.
00:34:53,00:34:56,"And it started off, they could just say the Furbie words."
00:34:56,00:34:58,"And then as you owned it for longer and longer,"
00:34:58,00:35:02,it kind of put more and more of the English words into the vocabulary.
00:35:02,00:35:06,And so people thought that they were picking up words that you were saying to them.
00:35:06,00:35:08,But actually it was just programmed to do that.
00:35:08,00:35:11,"But that's a bit like how it is with children, isn't it?"
00:35:11,00:35:12,Yeah.
00:35:12,00:35:13,"Like they start off talking complete nonsense,"
00:35:13,00:35:16,"and then by the end of their saying, like, ""Nah, nah, or dog, or whatever."""
00:35:16,00:35:17,"Oh, no."
00:35:17,00:35:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:35:18,00:35:19,So that's kind of...
00:35:19,00:35:20,Maybe that's why they made the Furbie like that.
00:35:20,00:35:21,"Yeah, I guess so."
00:35:21,00:35:23,Or maybe all children are actually fake.
00:35:23,00:35:26,Prove me wrong.
00:35:26,00:35:28,"Which is more likely, Andy, I don't know."
00:35:28,00:35:33,"But yeah, like the CEO of the company that made Furbies had to come out and say,"
00:35:33,00:35:34,"""This isn't true."
00:35:34,00:35:38,"""Our Furbies actually aren't as clever as we've been lying about."""
00:35:38,00:35:39,Wow.
00:35:39,00:35:42,"And he also said, you know, there was a rumor that they could send..."
00:35:42,00:35:45,They had enough technologies to send something into space.
00:35:45,00:35:47,And they said that one woman...
00:35:47,00:35:48,"Wait, wait, wait, sorry."
00:35:48,00:35:49,Yeah.
00:35:49,00:35:50,Just break that down a bit.
00:35:50,00:35:51,"Wait, what are the..."
00:35:51,00:35:54,Somebody thought the Furbies had so much power
00:35:54,00:35:57,that they could send a rocket into space.
00:35:57,00:35:59,Are we talking about a complete Cape Canaveral setup?
00:35:59,00:36:00,Yes.
00:36:00,00:36:01,We can entirely start my Furbie.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"I don't know, Furbies are all the deaths."
00:36:03,00:36:06,There's a Furbie in it with the briefcase going on to the ship.
00:36:06,00:36:10,"Actually, if Elon Musk zips down his jacket,"
00:36:10,00:36:12,it's just Furbies all the way up.
00:36:12,00:36:13,He is a Furbie.
00:36:13,00:36:16,What does that mean?
00:36:16,00:36:18,They could send a rocket to space.
00:36:18,00:36:20,"It's the AI worry of its day, I guess, right?"
00:36:20,00:36:21,"Yeah, it wasn't true."
00:36:21,00:36:22,That's what he was saying.
00:36:22,00:36:25,'Cause he also said that there was a woman who was absolutely insistent
00:36:25,00:36:27,that her Furbie was singing Italian operas.
00:36:27,00:36:28,That also wasn't true.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"Oh, my God."
00:36:29,00:36:30,But she was hearing...
00:36:30,00:36:33,"She was convinced that she taught this Furbie an aria,"
00:36:33,00:36:36,"and she's like, 'My Furbie's really good at opera.'"
00:36:36,00:36:39,"And he's like, 'They literally don't have that capability.'"
00:36:39,00:36:42,So they kind of had to backtrack on all of their marketing campaign.
00:36:42,00:36:43,Wow.
00:36:43,00:36:45,"These were like, yeah, clever toys,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,but they were actually all pre-programmed.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"Oh, my God."
00:36:48,00:36:49,"Scam, wasn't it?"
00:36:49,00:36:50,It could be a haunted Furbie.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"And that's a ghost, I will believe it."
00:36:52,00:36:53,"Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:53,00:36:54,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:54,00:36:57,"Imagine the next, like, crude moon mission"
00:36:57,00:37:00,that gets there and finds they have built their own society.
00:37:00,00:37:01,Without us noticing.
00:37:01,00:37:02,The Furbies beat us to it.
00:37:02,00:37:03,Damn it.
00:37:03,00:37:05,The dark side of the moon is entirely Furbie.
00:37:05,00:37:07,Owned and operated now.
00:37:07,00:37:11,Have you heard of Tia Pikachu?
00:37:11,00:37:16,"So she is a Chilean schoolteacher,"
00:37:16,00:37:20,"and they've had a load of protests in Chile against the government,"
00:37:20,00:37:24,and she decided to go dressed as a giant Pikachu.
00:37:24,00:37:27,The reason being that her seven-year-old son
00:37:27,00:37:30,had maxed out her husband's credit card
00:37:30,00:37:33,buying Detective Pikachu merchandise.
00:37:33,00:37:35,"They managed to send loads of it back,"
00:37:35,00:37:37,"but some of it they couldn't send back,"
00:37:37,00:37:39,and this giant sort of inflatable Pikachu
00:37:39,00:37:41,they couldn't send back.
00:37:41,00:37:44,"Okay, so then they have some protests in Chile,"
00:37:44,00:37:47,"and she decides, 'Well, I'm just going to go dressed as a Pikachu,"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"because why not, it's a protest.'"
00:37:49,00:37:52,"And she just became really, really, really famous,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"because there was video of her being water,"
00:37:55,00:37:57,"like, fired with water."
00:37:57,00:37:58,Cannon?
00:37:58,00:37:59,"Water cannon, yeah,"
00:37:59,00:38:02,in a big Pikachu costume being forced back.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"She was shot with rubber bullets,"
00:38:04,00:38:06,dressed as Pikachu.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"It's absolutely amazing,"
00:38:07,00:38:10,"but because she became so famous,"
00:38:10,00:38:12,she is part of the team
00:38:12,00:38:15,who are writing the New Chilean Constitution.
00:38:15,00:38:16,"So after the protest,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,they decided that they were going to write a new constitution.
00:38:18,00:38:20,"So every five clauses, it's just going to say,"
00:38:20,00:38:22,"'Pika, pika, pika!'"
00:38:22,00:38:31,"It is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,and that is Andy.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"My fact is that in 1972,"
00:38:35,00:38:37,a family who had survived a shipwreck
00:38:37,00:38:39,kept themselves alive
00:38:39,00:38:42,by giving each other turtle blood enemas.
00:38:42,00:38:45,"Guys, it's a light-hearted and funny fact."
00:38:45,00:38:48,"I just imagine, like,"
00:38:48,00:38:50,that family seeing each other at Christmas.
00:38:50,00:38:51,Yeah.
00:38:51,00:38:53,"You know, they haven't said, 'Shall we talk about it?'"
00:38:53,00:38:54,"No, let's never talk about that again."
00:38:54,00:38:55,Never talk about it again.
00:38:55,00:38:56,"No, go on."
00:38:56,00:38:57,Give us the context.
00:38:57,00:38:58,This comes from an amazing piece
00:38:58,00:38:59,that was in The Financial Times
00:38:59,00:39:00,"by a writer called Kitty Drake,"
00:39:00,00:39:01,and she was interviewing people
00:39:01,00:39:05,who had real knowledge of shipwreck
00:39:05,00:39:07,and being cast away.
00:39:07,00:39:10,"And she spoke to a man called Douglas Robertson,"
00:39:10,00:39:13,"who was sailing around the world with his family,"
00:39:13,00:39:15,his siblings and his parents.
00:39:15,00:39:16,"He was 18 years old,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,and their yacht was attacked by killer whales.
00:39:19,00:39:21,So they were halfway across the Pacific.
00:39:21,00:39:23,They completely battered the yacht.
00:39:23,00:39:26,The family all abandoned ship into a small dinghy
00:39:26,00:39:28,"that was, I think there were seven people,"
00:39:28,00:39:30,six or seven people in this dinghy
00:39:30,00:39:31,that was designed for one fewer
00:39:31,00:39:33,than the number of people who ended up in it.
00:39:33,00:39:34,"They were 200 miles from the Galapagos,"
00:39:34,00:39:36,and the wind was going in the wrong direction.
00:39:36,00:39:38,So they were really in trouble.
00:39:38,00:39:41,"They spent 38 days stranded in the Pacific,"
00:39:41,00:39:43,and they were sailing towards the doldrums.
00:39:43,00:39:45,They were trying to get weirdly to the doldrums
00:39:45,00:39:47,because there was a better chance of being spotted
00:39:47,00:39:49,and detected where they were heading to.
00:39:49,00:39:51,So the doldrums is where there's not as much wind or...
00:39:51,00:39:52,Exactly. Sorry.
00:39:52,00:39:54,"Yeah, the region where there's no wind."
00:39:54,00:39:56,But it does get lots of rain.
00:39:56,00:39:58,"So anyway, so they're in big trouble."
00:39:58,00:40:02,"They did manage to get some turtles on board,"
00:40:02,00:40:04,"and they had to hunt the turtles that approached them,"
00:40:04,00:40:06,and they used their blood as soup.
00:40:06,00:40:08,So that's a good thing.
00:40:08,00:40:10,"Then, unfortunately, the water ran very low,"
00:40:10,00:40:12,and they only had the old fish-polluted rainwater
00:40:12,00:40:14,in the bottom of their dinghy.
00:40:14,00:40:16,And it wasn't safe to drink.
00:40:16,00:40:18,"But the mother of the family, Lynn, was a nurse,"
00:40:18,00:40:21,and she realised you could absorb it safely
00:40:21,00:40:23,through your bottom.
00:40:23,00:40:26,And so everyone in the family got a rain...
00:40:26,00:40:29,"Guys, this is funnier than we're..."
00:40:29,00:40:31,I feel like there's tension in the room.
00:40:31,00:40:34,"They all make it. They all made it, and they got picked up."
00:40:34,00:40:35,It was all right.
00:40:35,00:40:37,"Oh, spoiler alert. Sorry."
00:40:37,00:40:38,They were all right.
00:40:38,00:40:40,"Anyway, she worked out brilliant, an intuition,"
00:40:40,00:40:42,that you could absorb it through your bottom.
00:40:42,00:40:44,"So everyone in the family got a rain and turtle blood enema,"
00:40:44,00:40:46,"and it gets into your system,"
00:40:46,00:40:48,but it doesn't go through your digestive system.
00:40:48,00:40:50,I'm getting confused when you say the enema bits.
00:40:50,00:40:51,What do you mean?
00:40:51,00:40:53,Up the bum. Squirt it up the bum.
00:40:53,00:40:55,Oh! What have you been researching?
00:40:55,00:40:57,What because I read? I read...
00:40:57,00:40:59,Oh!
00:40:59,00:41:01,"Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan."
00:41:01,00:41:03,Just where does the orgy butter go?
00:41:03,00:41:06,Think in those terms.
00:41:06,00:41:08,That's way more disgusting than what I thought.
00:41:08,00:41:10,"Yeah, it's horrible."
00:41:10,00:41:13,"Cos that's the thing, like, it's not just turtle blood."
00:41:13,00:41:15,"Anyways, it's disgusting."
00:41:15,00:41:17,"Rain water, it's like infected fish guts."
00:41:17,00:41:19,"Water, like, it's foul."
00:41:19,00:41:21,So the point is... But genius.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"Yeah, it's genius. I mean, amazing."
00:41:23,00:41:26,"If you drink this stuff, it's got all sorts of horrible things in it,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"and it can make you really, really sick."
00:41:28,00:41:30,"Now, if you go the other way... Yeah, yeah."
00:41:30,00:41:33,...then there's a way for the water to go into your body
00:41:33,00:41:35,through your rectum. Yeah.
00:41:35,00:41:38,But because you're already getting disgusting things
00:41:38,00:41:40,"going down there anyway, your body is protected"
00:41:40,00:41:42,against those disgusting things. Exactly.
00:41:42,00:41:44,"So you can still get the water,"
00:41:44,00:41:46,but it won't get the bacteria and all that.
00:41:46,00:41:48,So here's what I thought.
00:41:48,00:41:50,I thought they were removing the rectal membrane from the turtles
00:41:50,00:41:53,and using that as a bag to collect the water.
00:41:53,00:41:55,"Genuinely, that's what I thought."
00:41:55,00:41:57,A bag to collect the water?
00:41:57,00:41:59,"Well, you need to collect water to drink it through your fucking mouth."
00:41:59,00:42:01,"It's your fucking mouth, right?"
00:42:01,00:42:03,How much water are you collecting?
00:42:03,00:42:05,It's your fucking shell on it.
00:42:05,00:42:07,If you want to keep water...
00:42:07,00:42:10,"If you ever get a turtle and you want to keep water,"
00:42:10,00:42:12,"don't take the little bag out of it, Tainus."
00:42:12,00:42:14,Just turn it upside down.
00:42:14,00:42:16,We've got to get to its asshole.
00:42:16,00:42:20,Jesus Christ. Wow.
00:42:20,00:42:23,"Turns out it's Dan's last appearance on ""Nose & Sins & Fish"" as well."
00:42:23,00:42:29,"I'd love to see you on, like, one of those reality shit-making shows."
00:42:29,00:42:31,"Meanwhile, on Dan's Island,"
00:42:31,00:42:33,I think it's up to God for a bad to worse.
00:42:33,00:42:37,"Cool, that makes you..."
00:42:37,00:42:40,"Weirdly, I still think your one makes less sense."
00:42:40,00:42:42,Feeding water up your butt.
00:42:42,00:42:44,Incredibly clever.
00:42:44,00:42:46,"Incredibly clever, and it is the thing that saved their lives."
00:42:46,00:42:48,They were really on the struggling.
00:42:48,00:42:50,And they all just trusted Lynn when she said that?
00:42:50,00:42:52,She's a nurse.
00:42:52,00:42:54,"I get that, but how often are you...?"
00:42:54,00:42:56,"She's a nurse, though."
00:42:56,00:42:58,"That's an off-common knowledge, I would say."
00:42:58,00:43:00,I don't know. Wow.
00:43:00,00:43:02,What's amazing is that there was the group...
00:43:02,00:43:04,"There was the husband and the wife,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,and I think they had...
00:43:06,00:43:08,Was it three or four kids?
00:43:08,00:43:10,"It was three. There were four, but one of them got off"
00:43:10,00:43:12,before this leg of the journey.
00:43:12,00:43:14,That was lucky. Fuck that.
00:43:14,00:43:16,It's cool. I'll die. I'll just die.
00:43:16,00:43:18,"Someone up. So, in this family"
00:43:18,00:43:20,"of everyone putting stuff up their ass,"
00:43:20,00:43:22,there was one guy who'd only just met them.
00:43:22,00:43:26,Did you read his name?
00:43:26,00:43:28,"He was called Robin Williams, weirdly."
00:43:28,00:43:30,And he'd just taken a job on the boat
00:43:30,00:43:32,"in return for his birth, and, you know, just..."
00:43:32,00:43:34,Yeah.
00:43:34,00:43:38,It sounds like such a tough journey.
00:43:38,00:43:40,"Oh, God. They had to spend six hours a day"
00:43:40,00:43:42,"just blowing the dinghy up, you know,"
00:43:42,00:43:44,just because it was constantly losing air.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:46,00:43:48,"What have they got to do, to be fair?"
00:43:48,00:43:50,"Well, you know, pass of the time."
00:43:50,00:43:52,"And they eventually got back, didn't they?"
00:43:52,00:43:54,They did. And then the husband and wife
00:43:54,00:43:56,just immediately divorced. No.
00:43:56,00:43:58,"Really? Yeah, I'm afraid so."
00:43:58,00:44:00,"So, the guy who was kind of"
00:44:00,00:44:02,"took them on this trip, Douglas,"
00:44:02,00:44:04,he wrote a book
00:44:04,00:44:06,and went to live in the med.
00:44:06,00:44:08,And his wife became a farmer.
00:44:08,00:44:10,"Oh, wow. Oh, because they were farmers before they said that."
00:44:10,00:44:12,"They were, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:12,00:44:14,"So, they completely, they split up, yeah."
00:44:14,00:44:16,"Gosh. Oh, that's sad."
00:44:16,00:44:18,"That is sad. Yeah, yeah."
00:44:18,00:44:20,"Did you hear, there was a recent"
00:44:20,00:44:22,someone stranded out in the ocean
00:44:22,00:44:24,and having to get by with what materials they had.
00:44:24,00:44:26,"There was a guy called Elvis,"
00:44:26,00:44:28,and he was found
00:44:28,00:44:30,120 nautical miles northwest
00:44:30,00:44:32,of Columbia's
00:44:32,00:44:34,Poreto Boliva. I don't know how to pronounce that.
00:44:34,00:44:36,Lovely. Yeah. And he survived.
00:44:36,00:44:38,He wrote help on the hull
00:44:38,00:44:40,"of his sailboat, and so someone saw that."
00:44:40,00:44:42,But he was stuck out there for a long time.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And he was 24 days, I think,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,he was out there and he survived almost
00:44:46,00:44:48,exclusively on tomato ketchup
00:44:48,00:44:50,from Heinz. Wow.
00:44:50,00:44:52,And so that became the story when he got back.
00:44:52,00:44:54,He found him after being missing all this time.
00:44:54,00:44:56,And then Heinz decided that they wanted
00:44:56,00:44:58,to give him a new boat because they thought this was amazing.
00:44:58,00:45:00,"I thought you were about to say,"
00:45:00,00:45:02,"""Give him some more ketchup."" Yeah, yeah."
00:45:02,00:45:04,"No, that's a much better,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,"that's good PR by Heinz, yeah, yeah."
00:45:06,00:45:08,"So, they've done it. They've done that."
00:45:08,00:45:10,"Well, for ages, they couldn't find him."
00:45:10,00:45:12,"So, he disappeared again, but just into his normal life"
00:45:12,00:45:14,"because he was, you know, he didn't make a big fuss of it."
00:45:14,00:45:16,"So, there was a huge campaign to find"
00:45:16,00:45:18,"the missing boat guy who then,"
00:45:18,00:45:20,"and they found Elvis, basically."
00:45:20,00:45:22,"Yeah, a hard hashtag to use,"
00:45:22,00:45:24,but they found him
00:45:24,00:45:26,and he's now got his boat. That's great.
00:45:26,00:45:28,"Tomato ketchup is exclusively, yeah,"
00:45:28,00:45:30,what he was surviving on. Gosh.
00:45:30,00:45:32,"You can, just a tip"
00:45:32,00:45:34,"for any of us who get shipwrecked,"
00:45:34,00:45:36,do have a plastic bag if you can.
00:45:36,00:45:38,If you don't have a turtle to have.
00:45:38,00:45:40,Yes.
00:45:40,00:45:42,"Why would that be? Well,"
00:45:42,00:45:44,you use a bag of water.
00:45:44,00:45:46,"What are you using this bag of water for, guys?"
00:45:46,00:45:48,Drinking out of? Making fire.
00:45:48,00:45:50,You can make fire with a bag of water.
00:45:50,00:45:52,"Oh, like a lens."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"Like a lens. If it's a clear bag,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,do make sure it's a clear bag.
00:45:56,00:45:58,Lot of caveats on this.
00:45:58,00:46:00,Not a bag for life.
00:46:00,00:46:02,"Ironically, a bag for life wouldn't work."
00:46:02,00:46:04,That is.
00:46:04,00:46:06,"And you'd be kicking yourself, wouldn't you?"
00:46:06,00:46:08,Pay 30 papers.
00:46:08,00:46:14,"No, a bog standard, like a clear plastic bag."
00:46:14,00:46:16,"If you can make it into a round shape,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,you can use that to focus the rays of the sun
00:46:18,00:46:20,onto your tinder.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"And then, and it makes fire."
00:46:22,00:46:24,"And if you don't have a plastic bag,"
00:46:24,00:46:26,you can use a light bulb.
00:46:26,00:46:28,If you don't have a light bulb.
00:46:28,00:46:30,Just have an idea.
00:46:30,00:46:32,Excuse my ignorance.
00:46:32,00:46:34,"Like, would it not"
00:46:34,00:46:36,melt the plastic?
00:46:36,00:46:38,Or is that a stupid thing to ask?
00:46:38,00:46:40,"It's not a stupid question, but I don't think it would."
00:46:40,00:46:42,I don't know why.
00:46:42,00:46:44,"Oh, the point at which the rays focus"
00:46:44,00:46:46,"the hottest point, which is not on the surface of the bag."
00:46:46,00:46:48,It's on whatever you're pointing at.
00:46:48,00:46:50,Interesting.
00:46:50,00:46:52,"I was reading some advice from a guy called Paul Hart,"
00:46:52,00:46:54,who is the Royal Navy's...
00:46:54,00:46:56,He's a Lieutenant Commander for the Royal Navy.
00:46:56,00:46:58,"And he was asked, if you get shipped wrecked on an island,"
00:46:58,00:47:00,what should you be doing in order to survive?
00:47:00,00:47:02,"So, he wrote this big list of stuff."
00:47:02,00:47:04,"And so, here's the quiz-like"
00:47:04,00:47:06,moment here.
00:47:06,00:47:08,"So, your boat"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"has crashed on the shore,"
00:47:10,00:47:12,or your airplane has crashed into
00:47:12,00:47:14,"the ocean, and you've made it to shore."
00:47:14,00:47:16,What is the first thing
00:47:16,00:47:18,that you should be collecting in order to survive?
00:47:18,00:47:20,From the aircraft?
00:47:20,00:47:22,"You're on an island, yeah. So, the food."
00:47:22,00:47:24,"OK, so food would be a good..."
00:47:24,00:47:26,"Well, I would say the eight"
00:47:26,00:47:28,single CDs that I carry
00:47:28,00:47:30,with me everywhere I go.
00:47:30,00:47:32,A copy of the Bible that you always have.
00:47:32,00:47:34,A copy of the Bible. And what would your luxury be?
00:47:34,00:47:36,A lovely bottle of Tabasco sauce.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"Oh, lovely!"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"So, the answer is, he says..."
00:47:40,00:47:42,"No, no, no. A lifetime supplier of Marmite."
00:47:42,00:47:44,"Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, OK."
00:47:44,00:47:46,"Get that right, yeah."
00:47:46,00:47:48,"Orgy butter if that's not available, yeah."
00:47:48,00:47:50,One of the same to him.
00:47:50,00:47:52,"Life jacket. Life jacket, no."
00:47:52,00:47:54,The seats can be used as floatation devices.
00:47:54,00:47:56,I'm trying to remember what they've said to me.
00:47:56,00:47:58,"Things that you're going to take from your wreckage,"
00:47:58,00:48:00,or things that are on the island?
00:48:00,00:48:02,"No, things that you take from the wreckage."
00:48:02,00:48:04,Something to... The radio from the...
00:48:04,00:48:06,"A knife, no. Well, knife is, yes, it's up there."
00:48:06,00:48:08,But he says... A clear bag.
00:48:08,00:48:10,A clear plastic bag.
00:48:10,00:48:12,"That's it, that's it."
00:48:12,00:48:14,He says Wellington boots.
00:48:14,00:48:16,"Oh, OK. What? Sorry, when do you get on a plane?"
00:48:16,00:48:18,Do they just hand you some Wellington boots?
00:48:18,00:48:20,He's saying any kind of...
00:48:20,00:48:22,A very strong footwear that you can have.
00:48:22,00:48:24,"Right, OK. Because you're going to be going into the ocean a lot"
00:48:24,00:48:26,in order to get food.
00:48:26,00:48:28,"You're going to be travelling, and injury is the thing you need to avoid."
00:48:28,00:48:30,"Most of all, and your feet are most likely to be getting injured."
00:48:30,00:48:32,"That's really interesting. Because actually, on that Ryanair thing,"
00:48:32,00:48:34,it tells you to take off your high heels
00:48:34,00:48:36,"before you jump on the slide, doesn't it?"
00:48:36,00:48:38,Yes. And you're saying...
00:48:38,00:48:40,You're saying keep them on?
00:48:40,00:48:42,Is that...?
00:48:42,00:48:44,"No, so that's the biggest thing."
00:48:44,00:48:46,"That's interesting, yeah."
00:48:46,00:48:48,"Wellies, it is quite a niche thing,"
00:48:48,00:48:50,"as James just said, to have on that."
00:48:50,00:48:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes sense."
00:48:52,00:48:54,I would personally get a knife.
00:48:54,00:48:56,"Because then you can fashion some sort of, like..."
00:48:56,00:48:58,"Fashion... Make some... Oh, come on, babe."
00:48:58,00:49:00,Not Wellies! Come on!
00:49:00,00:49:02,"But you could, like, get, like..."
00:49:02,00:49:04,Either you're going to carve your own...
00:49:04,00:49:06,Or you could cut your own way.
00:49:06,00:49:08,"Do you know what I mean? Like, a knife surely is the most important thing,"
00:49:08,00:49:10,because that can... That's very important.
00:49:10,00:49:12,"Actually, you can use the, like, shoes to yourself."
00:49:12,00:49:14,"You can tap the rubber tree, and then..."
00:49:14,00:49:16,With a simple mould fashion from Bach...
00:49:16,00:49:18,LAUGHTER
00:49:18,00:49:20,"You've got your own Wellie factory, then."
00:49:20,00:49:22,Look!
00:49:22,00:49:24,You could trade the knife for some Wellies
00:49:24,00:49:26,if there's some local Wellie owners.
00:49:26,00:49:28,There are local Wellie owners.
00:49:28,00:49:30,I don't think you need the Wellies.
00:49:30,00:49:32,You can just leave.
00:49:32,00:49:34,You're probably...
00:49:34,00:49:36,You're in North Devon.
00:49:36,00:49:38,LAUGHTER
00:49:38,00:49:40,"Oh, my God. That's so funny."
00:49:40,00:49:42,I read the US Army Survival Manual.
00:49:42,00:49:44,"Oh, yeah. Oh, of course you do."
00:49:44,00:49:46,To see if enemas were part of their...
00:49:46,00:49:48,Yeah. ...suggestion.
00:49:48,00:49:50,There is one mention of enemas
00:49:50,00:49:52,"in the whole Survival Manual,"
00:49:52,00:49:54,and the idea is to use warm water enemas
00:49:54,00:49:56,as a way to treat hypothermia.
00:49:56,00:49:58,"Oh, OK. Yeah, apparently."
00:49:58,00:50:00,"It's good because it warms you up from the inside,"
00:50:00,00:50:02,"if you think about that. Oh, right."
00:50:02,00:50:04,The thing that they said to drink
00:50:04,00:50:06,is the aqueous fluid
00:50:06,00:50:08,found along the spine and the eyes
00:50:08,00:50:10,of large fish. Right.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"Oh, gosh. Is that interesting?"
00:50:12,00:50:14,Is that because it's less salty than...?
00:50:14,00:50:16,"Yeah, so everything else that's in the fish,"
00:50:16,00:50:18,"all the other Wellie fluids,"
00:50:18,00:50:20,"have got lots of protein, lots of fat,"
00:50:20,00:50:22,so it's going to make you more thirsty.
00:50:22,00:50:24,But just the water around the eyes
00:50:24,00:50:26,"and the water around the spinal fluid,"
00:50:26,00:50:28,that stuff is just perfect.
00:50:28,00:50:30,"I'm going to mention this guy, because one of the other things"
00:50:30,00:50:32,"at this Paul Hart that I was talking about,"
00:50:32,00:50:34,the guy who said that Wellington boots
00:50:34,00:50:36,"are what you need it. Oh, yeah."
00:50:36,00:50:38,One of the things that he said that was really important
00:50:38,00:50:40,was having positive mentality.
00:50:40,00:50:42,That's the main thing.
00:50:42,00:50:44,"As soon as you crash, you go,"
00:50:44,00:50:46,"""Fantastic! This is great!"""
00:50:46,00:50:48,"And if you can keep that mindset, then you're going to be fine."
00:50:48,00:50:50,And that really kind of is...
00:50:50,00:50:52,That comes into play when you read about the story
00:50:52,00:50:54,"of Jose Salvador Alvorenga,"
00:50:54,00:50:56,who was a guy who was out at sea
00:50:56,00:50:58,with one other person for 438 days.
00:50:58,00:51:00,"They were lost out at sea,"
00:51:00,00:51:02,and it was a positive mentality that kept him going.
00:51:02,00:51:04,And when he was interviewed by a journalist
00:51:04,00:51:06,"who wrote a book about it, he said,"
00:51:06,00:51:08,"""What's the thing that you remember most about it?"""
00:51:08,00:51:10,"And he said, ""My imagination."
00:51:10,00:51:12,"I imagine good food, and"
00:51:12,00:51:14,"I have the best sex in my life."""
00:51:14,00:51:16,And he used to... So they used to...
00:51:16,00:51:18,"The two guys used to see the planes that would fly over,"
00:51:18,00:51:20,"that would never see them,"
00:51:20,00:51:22,"and they would go, ""What do you think they're eating up there?"""
00:51:22,00:51:24,And they would picture the food that they were...
00:51:24,00:51:26,"No, they never... They..."
00:51:26,00:51:28,They both would then have...
00:51:28,00:51:30,"Also, the best food of their lives on a plane."
00:51:30,00:51:32,Has he been on a plane?
00:51:32,00:51:34,(LAUGHTER)
00:51:34,00:51:36,"Bit of stale bread, and something in a little"
00:51:36,00:51:38,"reheated tray. Yeah, great."
00:51:38,00:51:40,Better than whatever they were eating up
00:51:40,00:51:42,their assholes at that time.
00:51:42,00:51:44,It was that smell. They're on a dinghy.
00:51:44,00:51:46,And so... And yeah.
00:51:46,00:51:48,"Diggy food is terrible, you know."
00:51:48,00:51:50,What's that all about? Yeah.
00:51:50,00:51:52,(LAUGHTER)
00:51:52,00:51:54,They used to... Both of them would do this.
00:51:54,00:51:56,"They would sit, but him particularly,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,"he'd sit there every day, he'd close his eyes,"
00:51:58,00:52:00,"he'd imagine that they'd actually crashed onto a beach,"
00:52:00,00:52:02,"and there was a beautiful woman walking towards him,"
00:52:02,00:52:04,"and they would have sex, and he said every day"
00:52:04,00:52:06,"he just had amazing sex in his head,"
00:52:06,00:52:08,and that kept him positive. Wow.
00:52:08,00:52:10,"Yeah. The other guy died, right?"
00:52:10,00:52:12,"Did he? I think so, yeah."
00:52:12,00:52:14,(LAUGHTER)
00:52:14,00:52:16,He wasn't positive enough.
00:52:16,00:52:18,God's sake.
00:52:18,00:52:20,Unbelievable.
00:52:20,00:52:22,He was more positive
00:52:22,00:52:24,as he's throwing him off the edge of this dinghy.
00:52:24,00:52:26,(LAUGHTER)
00:52:26,00:52:30,"I was going to ask, actually, who..."
00:52:30,00:52:32,(LAUGHTER)
00:52:32,00:52:34,"No, just quickly. Who out of..."
00:52:34,00:52:36,Say the three of you got shipwrecked.
00:52:36,00:52:38,I'd die first. Who would you think would survive?
00:52:38,00:52:40,I would die first. The first.
00:52:40,00:52:42,"Like, like... I'd die within 30 seconds."
00:52:42,00:52:44,"Do you think... Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:44,00:52:46,I would start another day. I would start another day.
00:52:46,00:52:48,We're going to have to eat him. We're going to have to eat him.
00:52:48,00:52:50,There's a guy selling willing to do something.
00:52:50,00:52:52,"No, no!"
00:52:52,00:52:54,Cannibalism returned
00:52:54,00:52:56,to North Devon today.
00:52:56,00:52:58,(LAUGHTER)
00:52:58,00:53:00,"Oh, God."
00:53:00,00:53:02,"And Dan's probably the most positive, so I guess you win."
00:53:02,00:53:04,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dan will be having fantastic sex."
00:53:04,00:53:06,(LAUGHTER)
00:53:06,00:53:08,And eating delicious plain food.
00:53:08,00:53:10,"Oh, God. What a treat."
00:53:10,00:53:12,(LAUGHTER)
00:53:12,00:53:14,(UPBEAT MUSIC)
