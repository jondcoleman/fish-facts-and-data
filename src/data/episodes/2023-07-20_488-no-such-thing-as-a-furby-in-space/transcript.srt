00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish, which is the first

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,480
 in our run of live summer shows at the Soho Theatre in London.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,560
 We have all sorts of amazing guests lined up for you for the rest of the summer.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,000
 I won't go into that now, because I really don't want to spoil it, especially for the

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,680
 people who have tickets.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,640
 But what I can tell you is that in this week's show we were joined by Jamie Martin.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,280
 Now you will know Jamie if you listened to No Such Things a Fish before, because he has

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,800
 been on quite a few shows, this is his third appearance, but of course he is most well

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,280
 known for being one third of, let's be honest, the greatest British podcast of all time,

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,480
 My Dad Rota Pono.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,040
 Now one important thing to say about that is that the My Dad Rota Pono team have chosen

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,720
 some of their funniest moments from across the six season run, including some unheard

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,000
 gems and they'll be releasing best off episodes once a month, starting on Monday the 31st

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 of June.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,880
 I absolutely can't wait for those best off shows, I'm sure you can't either, but in

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,680
 the meantime, please do enjoy this week's episode of No Such Things a Fish with Jamie

17
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:25,240
 Martin.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Things a Fish, a weekly podcast this

19
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,000
 week coming to you live from the Soho Theater in London.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,400
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin and

21
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,880
 Jamie Morton and once again we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite

22
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,280
 facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here we go, starting with

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
 fact number one and that is Jamie.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:05,200
 My fact this week, boys, is in 1782 a woman found a drag performance so hilarious that

25
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,880
 she literally died of laughter.

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,400
 Wow.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,560
 Probably not going to happen tonight, but not with me here for sure, but yeah, isn't

28
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 that mad?

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
 Yeah, it's insane.

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,440
 So this was an act, it was a play called Beggar's Opera and someone called Charles Bannister

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,920
 who was playing a character called Polly Peacham and yeah, to give us a story.

32
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:36,680
 Yeah, so Mrs Fitzherbert, suspiciously there's no first name, but she was a widow of a North

33
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,840
 Hampton Shire clergyman, it was quite salacious that she was even at this kind of submersive

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,120
 show and she found it so funny that this man came out and he was described as Lantern

35
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,120
 jawed with five o'clock shadow and a double chin in a lovely pretty dress and she just

36
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,680
 found it so funny she just didn't stop laughing for three days.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
 Oh wow.

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
 That's the amazing thing, like she had to leave the theatre didn't she because she was laughing

39
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,240
 so much but that's not when she died.

40
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
 No.

41
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,680
 The newspaper report said she couldn't get the figure from her memory so just every morning

42
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,280
 she'd just wake up and go, "Ah!"

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
 I mean what a sheltered fucking life, I'm sorry, like if that makes you laugh that much to

44
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 kill you.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,840
 Maybe it was a really good show.

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
 Yeah, you know.

47
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
 Well the Beggar's Opera.

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,840
 It's a classic.

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,280
 And the actor Bannister, he was one of the great actors of the day, he was very funny,

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,280
 he was famous.

51
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
 The good name too.

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
 Charles Bannister.

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
 Charles Bannister.

54
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,360
 Yeah, so John Gay, the Beggar's Opera actually, that was the first play which had songs in

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,320
 it that were part of the narrative of the Beggar's Opera, it's pretty much the first musical

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
 I would say.

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
 Yeah.

58
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,880
 So it was more popular, there was a thing called Beggar Mania and so you could go around,

59
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:54,440
 you could buy matchboxes, fans, fireguards, everything with this show on.

60
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,800
 Oh, it's like no such thing as a fish.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:04,880
 On your tables there is a merchandise leaflet, I think it's got a QR code but genuinely as

62
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
 I can see it right there.

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
 Go nuts!

64
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,080
 Get us in with that merch.

65
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,400
 Jamie, please, we rely on this, we rely on the merch, it's all that's keeping us going.

66
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,520
 I was looking at people who had died on stage and I have a weird connection to one of these

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
 people.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:29,040
 So MoliÃ¨re, very famous French playwright, actor, he collapsed on stage ironically playing

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,400
 the lead in his final play called The Imaginary Invalid, so he literally died playing a hypochondriac.

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 Right.

71
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,680
 And I have also played the lead in The Imaginary Invalid.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
 Really?

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
 Yes.

74
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
 Yes, I know.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
 That's cool.

76
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
 In my youth, it's not that cool.

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
 Thank you.

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,280
 I sort of said that on autopilot Jamie, I wasn't actually thinking that is really cool, don't

79
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
 care at all.

80
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,520
 But back in my youth when I used to tread the boards, I didn't die obviously.

81
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,240
 The thing about him actually is because he was an actor, in those days actors couldn't

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,760
 go to heaven.

83
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,760
 So if you, I'm not sure anyone could, let's not get into that, that's an actual medical

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
 matter.

85
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:21,040
 But like, so the thing was, if you're an actor, it was like, yeah, you had to renounce your

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,080
 acting job before you died.

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,560
 So on your death bed, you might say, oh, I was never really an actor or I wasn't a very

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,800
 good one or whatever and then you would be allowed to go to heaven.

89
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,680
 If you've said I'm really more of a playwright, I'm more of a sort of immersive media creator

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
 really.

91
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
 I facilitated the heathens, I wasn't one of them myself.

92
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,840
 But yeah, and the thing was is that that meant that he was buried without, he wasn't allowed

93
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,360
 to be buried in the churchyard or anything like that because he died so quickly after

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
 this event.

95
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,360
 Oh, wow, okay.

96
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,680
 I wanted to see Molly I played a few years ago.

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 Starring Jamie Morton?

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
 Yes.

99
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
 No.

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
 How was I?

101
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
 Be kind.

102
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,360
 It wasn't one with you in, but I did leave it halfway through.

103
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
 Oh really?

104
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
 Yeah.

105
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,440
 In a sense, Molly died a second time that night.

106
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
 Wow.

107
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
 I'd say it's in the translation.

108
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,000
 I think he's a fantastic playwright.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 I'm sure he is.

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,160
 There was a school party all around us.

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
 It is.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 It was tricky.

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
 They were not having a good time and neither were we.

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,640
 I've got a little quiz for you guys.

115
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
 Oh, great.

116
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
 All right.

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,200
 So this is, I'm going to say a thing, right, an object and you have to say what it's used

118
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,360
 for by the Royal Shakespeare Company as stage gore.

119
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
 Okay.

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
 Oh, great.

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
 I love this game.

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
 In 2010, for example.

123
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
 Shakespeare specifically.

124
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
 Yeah.

125
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,360
 Okay.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 Right.

127
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
 These are all used by the RSC, right?

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
 Right.

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,720
 So in 2010, the Royal Shakespeare Company, they used three tins of lichies during their

130
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,220
 summer season.

131
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,220
 Bubos.

132
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,220
 Not buboes.

133
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,220
 Ibls.

134
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,220
 Ibls.

135
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,220
 It wasn't actually an everyone play game.

136
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,220
 It was.

137
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,220
 No.

138
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,220
 That's school parties in again.

139
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
 Yeah.

140
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,220
 Please do.

141
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
 No.

142
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,160
 Just, wait for a second.

143
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 Just let them do it.

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,160
 Ibls.

145
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
 Yeah, that's it.

146
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
 Yeah.

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
 We can end that.

148
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
 Yeah.

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
 No.

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
 Well done.

151
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
 Well done to the people who knew it and thank you.

152
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
 And yeah.

153
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
 Ibls.

154
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
 Okay.

155
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
 That's the cause.

156
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
 What scene?

157
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
 Yeah.

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
 Where they blind the Duke of Gloucester.

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
 Okay.

160
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
 Yeah.

161
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
 He actually knew.

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
 That's very impressive.

163
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
 Oh, yeah.

164
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
 Okay.

165
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
 Well, here's another one.

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
 Yeah.

167
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
 Chicken fillets.

168
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
 Chicken fillets.

169
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
 Bubes for bras.

170
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
 To pump up the bras.

171
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
 Actual.

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
 Well, that's a real thing.

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
 No, it's not.

174
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
 No.

175
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
 Actual chicken fillets.

176
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,160
 Well, I've got an Amazon delivery from my wife that she's going to be very confused

177
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
 about.

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,160
 Flapping skin and muscles.

179
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,160
 Oh, nice.

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
 Yeah.

181
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,160
 No, it's...

182
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,160
 Anyone?

183
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,160
 Anyone in the audience?

184
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
 Ears.

185
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
 Ears.

186
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
 Tongues.

187
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,160
 Tongues.

188
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 And finally, tinned pears.

189
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,160
 Tinned pears.

190
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
 Tinned pears.

191
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
 Tennis book.

192
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
 No.

193
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
 What?

194
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
 Nothing.

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,160
 Tennis.

196
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
 I didn't even say that.

197
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 I only said half of it and then I pulled back.

198
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
 Yeah.

199
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
 I think testicles is a good call.

200
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 Okay, testicles.

201
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
 All right.

202
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 Idiot.

203
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
 You complete full deck.

204
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,160
 No, it's penises.

205
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
 It's penises.

206
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
 Tinned pears for penises.

207
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
 Sorry?

208
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
 What?

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
 He's serious.

210
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
 Yeah.

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
 Don't...

212
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
 Andy.

213
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,160
 What?

214
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
 Sorry, what's the question?

215
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,160
 I've either been buying some really odd pears or I need to see a doctor.

216
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,160
 I think they're shaped a little bit, but I think it's the consistency.

217
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
 Consistency?

218
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 Consistency of a tinned pear.

219
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
 Also, what are they doing with these fake penises that they need a good consistency?

220
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,160
 Yeah.

221
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,160
 I'm not sure I've seen that Shakespeare play where they all get their cocks out.

222
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,160
 What?

223
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
 Which one is that?

224
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
 Yeah.

225
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
 Is it measure for measure?

226
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
 That's right.

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
 Very good.

228
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,160
 I don't actually...

229
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
 Yeah.

230
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
 That's amazing.

231
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
 There we go.

232
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
 They're real.

233
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 They have an amazing department.

234
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
 Their fake blood is a...

235
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,160
 Could it be that you put it in your stockings and it gives you a shape, maybe?

236
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
 I think it was for some...

237
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,160
 There's some horrible...

238
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,160
 Titus Andronicus has lots of terrible torture and gore and all this stuff.

239
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,160
 So they do like...

240
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
 It's rare.

241
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,160
 It's not across the canon that you need a tinned pear in the department.

242
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,160
 But they've got these...

243
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
 A tinned pear?

244
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,160
 Their fake blood recipe is secret and they've got three different consistencies.

245
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,160
 And there was an interview with Helen Hughes, who's one of their very senior prop and design people.

246
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
 And she was being interviewed about fake blood.

247
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
 And the interviewer asked her, like, what kind of...

248
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
 What do you use for your fake blood?

249
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
 And she said, what kind of blood?

250
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,160
 There's venal blood, arterial blood, newly dry blood, crusty old blood.

251
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
 They've got...

252
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,160
 They can do all of it.

253
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
 All the bloods.

254
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
 She's an artist.

255
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
 She's an artist.

256
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
 She knows her craft.

257
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
 I know.

258
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
 Yeah.

259
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
 Helen.

260
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
 There was a story which is...

261
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,160
 Because you got this story from a Giles Brandrith anecdote book, didn't you?

262
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
 Yeah, a theater anecdote book.

263
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
 The word fact would be questionable.

264
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
 But yes, I did.

265
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
 But there was...

266
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
 So there was a guy who was called William McCready.

267
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,160
 And it was early 19th century Shakespearean plays that he was in.

268
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,160
 And he forgot basically to put blood on his hand because he was in Macbeth and he needed blood on his hand.

269
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
 And he went to the side of the stage and it wasn't there.

270
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
 It wasn't on the side and he desperately needed it.

271
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
 But there happened to be a bystander there.

272
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
 So he punched him in the nose.

273
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,160
 And he'll swipe the blood off his nose and ram back on.

274
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
 Yeah.

275
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 According to Giles.

276
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
 Yeah.

277
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
 And that's where it falls down.

278
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
 That's incredible.

279
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,160
 But what happens when you die?

280
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
 What do you mean?

281
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
 What would happen to you as a person if you died?

282
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
 What would you...

283
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
 I think we...

284
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,160
 What would you become?

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
 A ghost.

286
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
 A ghost.

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
 I got so into theater ghosts.

288
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
 Oh, right.

289
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
 Researching this.

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 There are so many.

291
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
 Yeah, yeah.

292
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
 Some of them are really tragic.

293
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,160
 So actually where this woman died of laughter at the Theatre Royal Jury Lane.

294
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
 Yes.

295
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
 They're kind of...

296
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
 They've got...

297
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,160
 I think it's the most haunted theatre in the world.

298
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,160
 Or they claim that, you know.

299
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,160
 And their kind of main event, their big star is the...

300
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
 What's his name?

301
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
 The man in grey.

302
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
 Okay.

303
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
 Who can be seen on like the upper circle, I think.

304
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
 And he just like has a big cloak and is very menacing.

305
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,160
 And it's actually founded in truth.

306
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
 Because when it was being renovated in the 1800s,

307
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,160
 they kind of found a bit of a fake bit of the wall.

308
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,160
 And they looked into it and it was a little cubby hole.

309
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,160
 And inside that cubby hole was a skeleton of a man with a dagger through his chest.

310
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,160
 Wow.

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:42,160
 And that's the exact place where this ghost has been spotted for centuries.

312
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
 Very cool.

313
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
 Dan believes it.

314
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
 Dan believes it.

315
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
 The theory of everything else.

316
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,160
 I think I feel like that would be retroactively have been inserted into a wall in order to...

317
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
 Really?

318
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
 Yeah, I've got very skeptical recently.

319
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
 Wow.

320
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,160
 We need to move on, guys, to our next fact.

321
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
 Well, laughter can be very dangerous, right?

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
 Yeah.

323
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
 So there was a study from the University of Birmingham.

324
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,160
 It was a meta-analysis, so they looked at loads of papers.

325
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,160
 And they found that laughter can cause abdominal hernia, dislocated jaw, incontinence, fainting,

326
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 infectious diseases, because when you laugh, you breathe in a lot and you get lots of germs

327
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
 in your mouth.

328
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
 Yeah?

329
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,160
 Thanks for coming, everybody.

330
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,160
 There's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which is you laugh so much that you rupture

331
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
 your esophagus.

332
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
 That can happen.

333
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,160
 But despite this, they have laughing contests.

334
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,160
 And this is becoming quite common in America now.

335
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,160
 Basically, you go in and you just try and make each other laugh.

336
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
 And there's loads of different types of laugh.

337
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,160
 Best giggle and best knee-slapping laugh and best belly laugh and stuff like that.

338
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,160
 And apparently, the woman who won the American Championship last year, she didn't tell anyone

339
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
 until afterwards, but she pissed her pants in the first round.

340
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,160
 Oh.

341
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
 Wow.

342
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
 Is that an illegal move?

343
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
 I...

344
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,160
 It feels like it must be, right?

345
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 Yeah.

346
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
 Wow.

347
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
 It was only like a couple of years ago.

348
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
 I pissed myself while laughing.

349
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
 And it's honestly, it's one of those moments where it's not embarrassing.

350
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
 It's great.

351
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
 It's a really wonderful feeling.

352
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
 You feel like you've done laughter next level.

353
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
 You feel like you've...

354
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,160
 What was it?

355
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
 What was it?

356
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
 It was a late night.

357
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,160
 I was quite drunk.

358
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,160
 Someone said a joke.

359
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
 And I just laughed so hard that I just...

360
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
 And it wasn't even like a little bit of wee.

361
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
 It was like...

362
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,160
 Like, total flood.

363
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
 And I...

364
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
 Honestly, I did not apologise.

365
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,160
 I was like, "Guys, you will need to try this.

366
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
 I think we've forgotten how great this feels."

367
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,160
 OK, well, we've got three more facts.

368
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
 (LAUGHTER)

369
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:49,160
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

370
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
 And that is James.

371
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,160
 My fact this week is that the first modern water bed

372
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,160
 was filled with jelly rather than water.

373
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,160
 The problem was that it was too heavy to move

374
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,160
 and started to go rancid after a few weeks.

375
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
 Isn't that incredible that it was jelly?

376
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
 I find that one of the most astonishing facts.

377
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
 Yeah, it makes sense, really, doesn't it?

378
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,160
 If you want something nice and soft to lie on.

379
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,160
 So was it the bed, like, kind of the mold?

380
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
 The jelly mold, if you like, and you pour it in

381
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
 and then it sets?

382
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 Oh, I see what you're saying.

383
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
 Yeah, I guess it must have been, really,

384
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,160
 because you'd be weird to just shove in solid jelly.

385
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
 I'm not quite sure.

386
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
 He also used cornstarch as well,

387
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,160
 so cornstarch would be soft,

388
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
 but then it's non-Newtonian,

389
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
 so as you sort of push on it, it would get more solid.

390
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,160
 But again, that went rancid as well.

391
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,160
 What's a liquid that doesn't go rancid?

392
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,160
 But he started it not as a bed, it started as a chair.

393
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
 Yeah, so Charles Hall this is, right?

394
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
 Yeah, Charles Hall.

395
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 So it was called the very first thing he invented.

396
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
 It was called the incredibly horrible thing,

397
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
 and it was a chair.

398
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,160
 It weighed 300 pounds, it had liquid starch inside it,

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
 and it had a vinyl skin.

400
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
 And the point was that when you sat into it,

401
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
 the chair would creep up around you,

402
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
 because you were molding into it like that.

403
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
 It sits on you?

404
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
 Kind of.

405
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
 Eventually, yeah.

406
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
 Okay, so he made that,

407
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
 but what he really, really wanted to do

408
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,160
 was make an entire room that was a water bed/chair.

409
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
 Oh, wow.

410
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,160
 So it was almost like a bit like a padded cell, I suppose.

411
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,160
 But you would walk in, close the door,

412
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,160
 and wherever you were, you would just sort of sink into the wall

413
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
 or sink into the floor.

414
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
 Oh, my God.

415
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 But it was only because it was so expensive to make

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
 that he decided to go for the water bed instead.

417
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
 Gosh.

418
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
 What was expensive,

419
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,160
 manufacturing the jelly or the materials?

420
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
 Well, the thing is, if you want to buy a room,

421
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,160
 you kind of need to have to buy a house as well.

422
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 Do you know what I mean?

423
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,160
 Yeah, good point.

424
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
 Like, renovate your whole house to do that,

425
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
 whereas if you just want to buy a bed or a chair,

426
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
 you could rent.

427
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
 Yes, you could.

428
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
 Oh, but I don't think I'd want to rent a water bed.

429
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
 No?

430
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
 No, I mean you could rent a flat

431
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
 and put your water bed in there.

432
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
 Yeah, you could do that as well.

433
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,160
 Have any of you ever slept on a water bed?

434
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
 Yeah, my parents used to have one.

435
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
 I don't think I have.

436
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
 When I was a kid.

437
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
 Really?

438
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
 They're so uncomfortable.

439
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,160
 Yeah.

440
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
 Oh, are they?

441
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,160
 They're horrible.

442
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,160
 I've read about them and said they're amazing.

443
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,160
 Like, they're the equivalent of pissing yourself while laughing.

444
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,160
 But maybe mine was like, it was a friend's parents' bed

445
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
 when I was a kid.

446
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,160
 And it was like being seasick.

447
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
 It would like move.

448
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
 It was honestly vile.

449
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
 Huh.

450
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
 And it was really cold.

451
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
 Like, they hadn't heated the water.

452
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,160
 Oh, but you can get those now.

453
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
 Oh, thank God.

454
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
 Okay, well, that's all changed.

455
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,160
 No, Charles Hall, these days, who invented this thing,

456
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
 what, 50 years ago.

457
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
 Yeah.

458
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,160
 He now, he has two water beds now.

459
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
 No, that doesn't sound very impressive,

460
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,160
 but he's got, because they come in different,

461
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
 it's different bladders.

462
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
 So you can see how many bladders are there in your water bed.

463
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
 So he's got one king-size single bladder.

464
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
 Oh, wow.

465
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 But he's also...

466
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
 If only you had a king-size bladder that night.

467
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,160
 (LAUGHTER)

468
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
 He's also got a, in his guest room,

469
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,160
 he's got a double mattress which has adjacent double bladders,

470
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,160
 so you can heat one if you want your bed a bit warmer

471
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
 than whoever you're sleeping next to.

472
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
 Oh, really?

473
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
 Oh, that's excellent.

474
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
 You can hot water bottle your...

475
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
 Yeah.

476
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
 Your bed is the hot water bottle.

477
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
 Wow.

478
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
 Oh, you're actually selling it.

479
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
 Maybe we should look at one, guys.

480
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
 That's incredible.

481
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
 This first one was...

482
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
 The one that Hall invented it, I think it was 1968, he invented it.

483
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
 He called it the Pleasure Pit.

484
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
 And we should probably talk about the slightly...

485
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
 There was a slightly sexy reputation they had.

486
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
 Yeah.

487
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 Oh, yeah.

488
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 One of the manufacturers in the early days was called Wet Dream.

489
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
 (LAUGHTER)

490
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
 There was an advert...

491
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
 I don't know, it's not great advert,

492
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,160
 but it said, "She'll admire you for your car.

493
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
 "She'll respect you for your position,

494
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
 "and she'll love you for your water bed."

495
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 So, it was a kind of...

496
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
 Well, there was lots of...

497
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
 Creepy.

498
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
 He had that to begin with, so he had invented it.

499
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
 He had patented it, but everyone just did sort of spin-off water beds.

500
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,160
 And he said that there was one company he noticed that it was sort of sexy,

501
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,160
 because, like, their other products were orgy butter and things like that, right?

502
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
 (LAUGHTER)

503
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
 And then, when you read into it...

504
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
 Orgy butter?

505
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,160
 And I did a lot of Googling.

506
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
 I'm so sorry.

507
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
 (LAUGHTER)

508
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,160
 We had to switch to orgy marge because of the cost of living.

509
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,160
 Sorry.

510
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 So, orgy butter was a thing.

511
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
 And then, when you look into, as you say, the sexual connotations

512
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
 about the early sales of the water bed.

513
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,160
 So, a lot of it was that it was basically like having a threesome,

514
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
 because the bed acted as the third person,

515
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
 because it moulded around you as you...

516
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
 It feels like a third person as part of the...

517
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
 Hang on, buddy.

518
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 I'm sorry.

519
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,160
 Just, like, let's just, like, zoom out on this.

520
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,160
 Taking this, like, "I'm just telling you about my experiences."

521
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
 Well, these are the facts.

522
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
 Well, you're telling us a lot of stuff.

523
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,160
 Your parents did have one, so you probably conceived in it, were you?

524
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
 Probably.

525
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
 Are you from a water bed?

526
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
 Probably.

527
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
 Oh, God.

528
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
 You're a water baby.

529
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
 That's nice.

530
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
 (LAUGHTER)

531
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
 'Cause, like, I don't want to be, like, let's not get too graphic,

532
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 but, like, there's got to be a purchase problem.

533
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
 Supposedly not.

534
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 Like, supposedly not.

535
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 It's a water bed.

536
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,160
 Like, you're, like, sloshing around.

537
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
 Apparently.

538
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
 Apparently.

539
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
 I mean, they were very popular.

540
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
 I know they were popular.

541
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,160
 At one point, I think a fifth of mattresses being sold

542
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,160
 were water bed mattresses.

543
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
 Yeah, I read that.

544
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
 I thought that was...

545
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,160
 In 1987, which is the year I was born.

546
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
 Insane.

547
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,160
 (LAUGHTER)

548
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,160
 And Hugh Hefner famously bought one for the Playboy Mansion

549
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 that was upholstered in Tasmanian possum hair.

550
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
 (LAUGHTER)

551
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,160
 Isn't that the most disgusting thing you've ever...

552
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
 Also, 'cause they're not...

553
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,160
 Ever heard.

554
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
 They're not very big.

555
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
 So many Tasmanian possums has.

556
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
 Yeah.

557
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
 Yeah.

558
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
 So it had this reputation for being very, kind of,

559
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
 like, asexual aid.

560
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,160
 'Cause, yeah, 'cause another tagline for it was,

561
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
 "Two things are better on a water bed

562
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
 than one of them's sleep."

563
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
 Mmm.

564
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
 I know.

565
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,160
 Like, one in five kinky people are just, like,

566
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
 getting off, well, your parents, one of them.

567
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
 Yeah.

568
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
 Two of them.

569
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
 Two of them, yeah.

570
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
 Getting off on water beds.

571
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
 And honestly, it must have felt so sick.

572
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
 'Cause it's the worst thing to sleep on.

573
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
 Isn't there a point where you stop...

574
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 If you stop moving, the bed will eventually stop moving?

575
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
 No. No, it keeps moving.

576
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 Oh, OK.

577
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,160
 You're kind of like...

578
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
 You're lost at sea.

579
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 It's an extraordinary experience.

580
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
 I can't...

581
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,160
 But that's another...

582
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
 I could imagine you ringing up the Coast Guard.

583
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
 (LAUGHTER)

584
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
 Where are you?

585
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
 Away from the sexual side,

586
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
 it was also seen as quite therapeutic.

587
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,160
 So, for example, the friends of Charles Hall,

588
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,160
 when he first invented it, said,

589
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
 "Well, you should name it 'The Bed Womb',"

590
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
 because it feels womb-like.

591
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
 It feels right to...

592
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
 It's a good line.

593
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
 It's a good line.

594
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
 Get a bed-womb for your bedroom.

595
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
 It's a good line.

596
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
 Oh, call yourself a therapist.

597
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
 That's...

598
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
 And then there was, in 1988,

599
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,160
 the American Journal of Disease of Children

600
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
 published an article in which they said that

601
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,160
 for infants that were born to drug-addicted mothers,

602
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,160
 if you kept them on water beds rather than bassinets,

603
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
 that would be better for them.

604
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,160
 This sort of constant, womb-like movement.

605
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
 Oh, right.

606
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,160
 Going on as they sleep.

607
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,160
 Yeah.

608
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
 So, it was seen as therapeutic as well.

609
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,160
 Well, the thing is that he did invent the modern water bed,

610
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,160
 but actually there were earlier ones,

611
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
 and they were used therapeutically.

612
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,160
 So, they were used during the war to prevent bed sores.

613
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
 These weren't like the ones that we had in the '80s,

614
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
 but they were just kind of like...

615
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,160
 I don't know, like, you know one of those blow-up mattresses

616
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
 but with water inside of it?

617
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
 Yeah.

618
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
 Mark Twain wrote about them.

619
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
 Elizabeth Gaskell wrote about them.

620
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
 Charles Hall couldn't get a patent originally

621
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,160
 because they'd been described by Robert A. Heinlein.

622
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,160
 Quite a few of his books mentioned them.

623
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,160
 And when he tried to get a patent, they went,

624
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,160
 "Well, it's in all these science fiction books,

625
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
 so you can't have invented it."

626
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,160
 So, he had to change a few things to get that.

627
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
 Oh, right.

628
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,160
 But when they became quite lame, which was quite quickly,

629
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
 so they were, like, massive in the early '80s, right?

630
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,160
 And then by the late '80s, they were really passe,

631
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
 like, no one really wanted them anymore.

632
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
 And they had all these water beds.

633
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
 They didn't know what to do with them.

634
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,160
 And they gave them to dairy farmers,

635
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
 and the cows would sit on them.

636
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
 Oh, and that's all these films they still do.

637
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
 The Queen's Cows.

638
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,160
 They famously sleep on water beds.

639
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
 The King's Cows.

640
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,160
 Well, now the King's Cows, yeah.

641
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
 Well, I don't know if he's changed it, though,

642
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
 but, you know...

643
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
 Sure, okay, all right.

644
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,160
 I've been waiting 70 years to kick those cows off that bed.

645
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
 My cows now.

646
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
 That's what he was waiting for.

647
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
 So, most, if you're...

648
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
 They're so heavy. As you say, they're so heavy.

649
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,160
 Like, a normal...

650
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
 The most impractical thing ever in real life.

651
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
 Like, a normal mattress is quite heavy, you know?

652
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
 You fill it with water, you're joking, you know?

653
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
 It's like...

654
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
 So, some of them can weigh 900 kilos

655
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
 if you've got a big double or a king's...

656
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
 That's a lot.

657
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
 And there's a concern in some buildings,

658
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
 if you're in a flat or you're on an upper floor, obviously,

659
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
 and, you know, they'll all go through the floor.

660
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
 Yeah.

661
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
 And most New York leases contain a standard clause,

662
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
 which says no water beds.

663
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,160
 Right.

664
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
 Probably because of, like, it's a bit...

665
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
 You know, maybe it's just bureaucracy, but...

666
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
 But in California, on the other coast,

667
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
 the civil code says landlords cannot discriminate

668
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 against people who own water beds...

669
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,160
 No.

670
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,160
 As long as they have taken out waterbed insurance.

671
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
 Right.

672
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,160
 The responsible thing to do.

673
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
 It is.

674
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
 It is.

675
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
 Well, I quite like, as well, in 1990,

676
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
 speaking of California,

677
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
 the Compton Fire Department,

678
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
 within their fire station,

679
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
 changed all of the mattresses to water mattresses.

680
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,160
 Not so that, like, if there was an emergency...

681
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
 Just if they needed more water.

682
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 No.

683
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
 No, no.

684
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
 It was the effect on their back, apparently.

685
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
 Someone had said, "I sleep better on a water bed,"

686
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
 and so they all...

687
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
 But that's all been disproven,

688
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
 because it doesn't actually help,

689
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
 because there's a lot of things that help, like,

690
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
 your posture or, like, your joints.

691
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,160
 That isn't true.

692
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
 Really?

693
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
 Okay.

694
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
 Yeah.

695
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
 Apparently it's not true.

696
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
 Right.

697
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
 I'm just obsessed that there was a waterbed magazine.

698
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,160
 Oh, yeah, I know.

699
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 In the '80s.

700
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
 I tried finding it today.

701
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,160
 Yeah, so did I.

702
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
 Oh, my God.

703
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
 No, we need a soapy.

704
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
 Cool.

705
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
 Great.

706
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,160
 Okay.

707
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,160
 But...

708
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
 Brilliant.

709
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
 I bought us a lot of orgy butter.

710
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
 Oh, great.

711
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
 Okay, good.

712
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,160
 Good.

713
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,160
 Can I flip it over?

714
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,160
 What?

715
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,160
 I mean...

716
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 What other interpretation are you...

717
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,160
 I was double-checking,

718
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
 because I thought I might have heard you say,

719
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,160
 "Flick your mattress," and I wasn't sure.

720
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
 How often do you flick your mattress?

721
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
 Twice a night.

722
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 No, how often do you flip it?

723
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
 Well, this is what's amazing.

724
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
 Not as often as I should, I'm sure.

725
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
 And I was planning tomorrow to flip my mattress.

726
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
 Get out of here.

727
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
 No, get lost.

728
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
 Yeah, absolutely, because both Vanella and I

729
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
 are on the wrong sides at the moment.

730
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,160
 It's gone soft on the sides.

731
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,160
 On the outer edge?

732
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
 Yeah, on the outer edge.

733
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
 Why is it not soft on the outer edge?

734
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
 That's not going to help, though,

735
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 because it's still going to be the outer edge.

736
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
 I feel...

737
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,160
 I feel like it's upside down anyway,

738
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,160
 because I noticed recently I've been sleeping on a zip

739
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
 the whole time,

740
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,160
 and I'm pretty sure that's the wrong side.

741
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,160
 Okay.

742
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
 Some orgy butter.

743
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,160
 We'll just sort that right out.

744
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,160
 Just rub it in, you'll be fine.

745
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
 Anyway, half Americans claim they flip it every six months,

746
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
 and I just think half Americans are liars.

747
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,160
 I think no one possibly does it that much.

748
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
 But why should you flip?

749
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
 I think...

750
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
 I think it's...

751
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
 So...

752
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
 No, it's...

753
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
 I can tell you exactly why.

754
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,160
 You get soft on the outside,

755
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
 and then you fall off the bed.

756
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
 That's why we're doing it.

757
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
 Is it not to try and air it out

758
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,160
 a little bit or something?

759
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,160
 I don't know.

760
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
 So it's not the same bit of you

761
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
 always hitting the same bit of the mattress?

762
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
 Right, okay.

763
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
 And so it refreshes it a bit,

764
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
 it moves the scene around.

765
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
 Because mattresses are disgusting,

766
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
 because they're full of, like,

767
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,160
 skin cells, sweat, like, bed bugs.

768
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
 So I think this is the way

769
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
 of just sort of redistributing

770
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
 the skin cells and sweat.

771
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
 You should really get rid...

772
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
 They're so expensive, mattresses.

773
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

774
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
 They're, like, thousands of pounds.

775
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,160
 You can't just...

776
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,160
 Because you should really replace them regularly, I think,

777
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,160
 but that's why you should get a waterbed.

778
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
 Oh, yeah, because you just changed the water.

779
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
 Well, not even, you know.

780
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
 Because water doesn't go rancid.

781
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
 Unlike jelly.

782
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
 Yeah.

783
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
 To bring us back to the start of the fact.

784
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,160
 Yeah.

785
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
 I need to move us on to our next fact, guys.

786
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,160
 OK, it is time for fact number three,

787
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
 and that is my fact.

788
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,160
 My fact this week is that there used to be a room

789
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,160
 in the Pentagon where employees met specifically

790
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,160
 to have Pokemon battles.

791
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
 (LAUGHTER)

792
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,160
 This is a discovery that was made back in 2016.

793
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,160
 Was there a situation room elsewhere in the Pentagon

794
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
 where other officials monitored the progress

795
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,160
 of those Pokemon battles with big screens?

796
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,160
 Do you think they have tables where they're pushing a Pikachu along?

797
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
 Yeah, exactly, yeah.

798
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
 (LAUGHTER)

799
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
 That's the situation room. That's what it's for, yeah.

800
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
 So this is Pokemon Go.

801
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,160
 There was a huge craze, particularly about...

802
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
 Still is.

803
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,160
 Yeah, but there was a mo...

804
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
 Well, James is...

805
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
 What's that T-shirt you're wearing, James?

806
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
 This is, I mean, this fact is up my street

807
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,160
 because I do like Pokemon and changing regimes

808
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
 in countries that I don't like, so...

809
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
 Ah!

810
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
 (LAUGHTER)

811
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
 James loves...

812
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,160
 Getting a bit political tonight?

813
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
 Yeah.

814
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 James loves Pokemon Go so much.

815
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 I don't know if we've ever said this.

816
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,160
 He likes it so much that when we went for a meeting,

817
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,160
 for the first time ever, we were going to have

818
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,160
 a Book of the Year, no such thing as a fish book,

819
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
 and we were going to pitch it.

820
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
 We ended up being a bit late to the meeting

821
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
 because we were following James,

822
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,160
 but it turned out James had spotted a very rare Pokemon

823
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
 down the road from where we were,

824
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,160
 and we just blindly followed him,

825
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,160
 and then we were like, "Where are we?"

826
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,160
 And he was like, "Yes! Snuffle off a gussle, whoever it is!"

827
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,160
 (LAUGHTER)

828
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
 When was that week they did a Sesame Street special,

829
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,160
 wasn't it, of Pokemon Go?

830
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
 OK, so here's the thing.

831
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
 It's Pokemon Go, and Pokemon Go was the app,

832
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
 and you would go and you would collect the Pokemons

833
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
 in various different places.

834
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
 You had to walk around, didn't you?

835
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
 You would walk around, and yeah.

836
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,160
 And then what they had as part of the app,

837
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
 I've never personally played it,

838
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,160
 so this is 101 for people that do.

839
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,160
 You have gyms where you can take the Pokemon 2,

840
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,160
 the Pokemon you have collected,

841
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,160
 and they can train there,

842
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
 but they can also battle for dominance of the gym,

843
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
 and those would be plopped all over the world

844
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
 in random spots,

845
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,160
 and it just so happened that one was in the Pentagon,

846
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,160
 and so anyone who was an employee there,

847
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,160
 and it would be specifically employees,

848
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,160
 because if you ever go on a tour of the Pentagon,

849
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
 you have to leave your phone,

850
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
 you're not allowed to bring your phone in with you,

851
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
 so it was specifically employees

852
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
 that were going to a very specific spot,

853
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,160
 and then they'd battle each other for dominance of this gym,

854
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
 and this was a huge problem

855
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,160
 because the Pokemon app can track where people are going,

856
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,160
 so their worry within the Pentagon

857
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,160
 was that it shows the routes that people are taking,

858
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,160
 so there were secret passages within the Pentagon,

859
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,160
 or even just mapping out the general landscape.

860
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
 That's something that the information

861
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 could possibly be hacked into and retrieved.

862
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
 Someone might know that the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped.

863
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,160
 I mean, that would be awful.

864
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
 Do you imagine?

865
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,160
 So they said, "No more Pokemon Go in the Pentagon."

866
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
 Do you know why the Pentagon is pentagon-shaped?

867
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,160
 I think this is amazing.

868
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,160
 No.

869
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,160
 It's because they were going to build it

870
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,160
 on a pentagon-shaped piece of land,

871
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
 and so they wanted the right shape of building

872
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
 for that piece of land,

873
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
 so it had to be a pentagon,

874
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,160
 and then they decided to move it somewhere else,

875
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
 and they thought,

876
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
 "Well, we've gone so far with this shape.

877
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
 We might as well keep it."

878
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
 That's literally the only reason.

879
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
 I mean, there's lots of good things about it being pentagon-shaped,

880
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,160
 but the reason is just it was supposed to go on this bit of land.

881
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
 That's incredible.

882
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
 What are some of the good things?

883
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
 Well, a circle is very good

884
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,160
 because you can get from one bit of a circle

885
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
 to another bit of a circle really quickly,

886
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,160
 and a pentagon is a bit like a circle,

887
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
 but it's got straight edges,

888
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
 so it's easier to build the circle.

889
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,160
 Yeah.

890
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,160
 It's more of a circle than a square.

891
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
 Absolutely.

892
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
 Yeah.

893
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
 Less than a hexagon.

894
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
 Oh, sure.

895
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,160
 Food for thought tonight on...

896
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,160
 And in the centre of the kind of circular pentagon

897
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,160
 is a now-closed hotdog stand.

898
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
 Oh, yeah.

899
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
 Yeah.

900
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
 During the Cold War,

901
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 the Russians always had at least two missiles

902
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
 that seemed at this hotdog stand

903
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
 because they thought that that was the pentagon's

904
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,160
 most top-secret meeting place.

905
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 It was just where people got lunch,

906
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
 but they were convinced that it was...

907
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
 Was it because they saw people kind of congregate here?

908
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
 Yeah.

909
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,160
 And they'd be like, "That has to be the...

910
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
 That's the heart of the pentagon,

911
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
 when actually it was just a hotdog stand."

912
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
 I know.

913
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
 Was it part of the pentagon, this hotdog stand?

914
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

915
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
 Okay. It was inside.

916
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
 I still feel like if the missiles hit it,

917
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 the other bit of pentagon would suffer some damage.

918
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
 Yeah.

919
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,160
 They're not really so specific the missile that it's like...

920
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
 No, true.

921
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
 I mean, you know.

922
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
 But it's fascinating, I think.

923
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
 Did they know that, the hotdog owners at the time?

924
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,160
 I think they did because everyone used to call it Ground Zero, didn't they?

925
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
 That was the nickname for it.

926
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
 The reason being that if the Russians hit,

927
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,160
 it would become Ground Zero and become flattened.

928
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
 Blimey.

929
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,160
 Right.

930
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
 I've read a thing that the pentagon own.

931
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
 It's just their cool stuff division.

932
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
 They own a laser, which that's not the cool bit,

933
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,160
 which can analyse who you are based on your heartbeat alone.

934
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,160
 Really?

935
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
 So they'll...

936
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,160
 You know, you have it...

937
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,160
 All of our hearts have their unique cardiac signature,

938
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,160
 how our hearts beat.

939
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
 Yeah.

940
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
 And they can point that laser at you from 200 metres away

941
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,160
 and say, "There's Dan."

942
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,160
 Or whatever it might be.

943
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,160
 What if I've just gone up a flight of stairs or something?

944
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,160
 Would it change my heartbeat or...?

945
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,160
 It would change, wouldn't it?

946
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,160
 But maybe it changes with the same...

947
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
 But it's still recognisably you.

948
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
 Yeah, they go, "That's James."

949
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
 And he's very unfair.

950
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
 There's a few flaws to this thing, though.

951
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
 It's called Jetson, which is what they've developed.

952
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,160
 And the flaws consist of the fact that,

953
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,160
 A, we don't really have that bigger database

954
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
 of people's unique heartbeats.

955
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
 So when everyone's coming, they can go,

956
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,160
 "Ah, no, no, I didn't do that. That's right."

957
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160
 And then the second flaw, and this is, you know,

958
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,160
 200 metres away we can do this, is their claim.

959
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
 The other problem is, yes, they can do it

960
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,160
 if you're wearing a T-shirt, but if you're wearing a coat,

961
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,160
 they can't get you.

962
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,160
 Yeah, so it's half-useful.

963
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,160
 Yeah, it's not as good as the fingerprint yet,

964
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,160
 or the eyeball.

965
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
 The lychee?

966
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
 The lychee.

967
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,160
 Thank you.

968
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,160
 Yeah.

969
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,160
 I was reading about the Pentagon generally,

970
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,160
 about tour guides, because you can go there.

971
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,160
 I imagine, Jamie, that's somewhere that you might have gone,

972
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
 but maybe not yet.

973
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,160
 I haven't.

974
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,160
 But you love this kind of stuff, right?

975
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,160
 Yeah, I actually have a friend that works at the Pentagon.

976
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,160
 He didn't reply to my emails about fun facts about the Pentagon.

977
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,160
 So the security is really high, guys.

978
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,160
 We're safe, you know.

979
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,160
 But one of the things is, there's stats

980
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,160
 that you get told about the tour guides that work there,

981
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,160
 and one of it is that they walk two to three miles per day,

982
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
 but entirely backwards,

983
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,160
 because when they're doing their tours,

984
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,160
 they never turn around to lead,

985
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,160
 because they always need eyes on the people

986
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,160
 that they're taking on the tour guide.

987
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
 So they guide themselves...

988
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
 What?

989
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
 Yeah, they guide themselves by landmarks.

990
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,160
 So as they're walking back the go, there's the fire extinguisher.

991
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,160
 That means, you know, ten steps until you get to the next corner,

992
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,160
 then I can round it like that.

993
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
 And so, yeah, every day, two to three miles of backward walking

994
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
 is what they get.

995
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
 And there's loads of ramps.

996
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,160
 That's really quite impressive to walk down a ramp backwards.

997
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
 You know, there's like no lift to the Pentagon.

998
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

999
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
 It was built with one lift.

1000
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
 Yes.

1001
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
 Because it was built during...

1002
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
 Because it was made of concrete.

1003
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
 Yeah, it was made of concrete.

1004
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,160
 In fact, it's nicknamed the Concrete Cobweb, which is cool.

1005
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,160
 And it had one lift for 33,000 people in the early days,

1006
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,160
 because you can't make lifts out of concrete, I suppose.

1007
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
 Right.

1008
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,160
 And they were saving steel for the war efforts.

1009
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
 They didn't want to...

1010
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
 Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,160
 But they've now put some more in.

1012
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,160
 They've now got dozens and dozens.

1013
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,160
 I love the idea of you repeatedly emailing your friend,

1014
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
 who's in the middle of looking at a screen,

1015
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,160
 and there's like a bomb counter on it.

1016
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,160
 I know.

1017
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,160
 It's somewhere in Ulaanbaatar, but I don't know where.

1018
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,160
 Just ping, ping.

1019
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,160
 Hi, just wondering if you saw my previous...

1020
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,160
 I was like, fun fact, request email.

1021
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:36,160
 Is it true that they used to have office chair races down the ramps

1022
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
 in the Pentagon?

1023
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
 That's all I wanted to know.

1024
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
 I think what he's really going is,

1025
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,160
 "God damn it, snuffle-uffagus, come on, win this Pokemon battle!"

1026
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
 No, we can't, because they've banned the Pokemon.

1027
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
 Oh, yeah, of course.

1028
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
 They also banned...

1029
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
 Yeah, well, that was the whole thing,

1030
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
 that you aren't allowed it anymore, right?

1031
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
 Yeah, it's out, it's out.

1032
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,160
 Because they're banning things left and right at the Pentagon,

1033
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,160
 like TikTok's now banned at the Pentagon.

1034
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,160
 But they also banned Furbies.

1035
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
 Oh, yeah.

1036
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,160
 In 1999.

1037
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
 Because they record what you say?

1038
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,160
 Well, they don't, but they kind of marketed themselves as that...

1039
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,160
 It's like the thinking toy or the chatty toy or something.

1040
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
 I don't know.

1041
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
 And they were, like, concerned that it would be a security risk

1042
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,160
 that they would, like, yeah, record what you were saying

1043
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,160
 and then say it back to you.

1044
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
 That's so funny.

1045
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,160
 I think it's fair enough to ask people not to bring Furbies in.

1046
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
 It's a petty aspect or the spying thing.

1047
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
 It's weird having to bring your toy to work at the Pentagon.

1048
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,160
 Well, you say that.

1049
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
 The Pokemon Go is just as kind of...

1050
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,160
 Yeah?

1051
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
 ...maybe childish, I don't want to, you know.

1052
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 But the...

1053
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
 I think we say "for all ages", rather than...

1054
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,160
 Sure, sure.

1055
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,160
 I'm glad you made three in the end.

1056
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,160
 Three episodes of "No such thing as they say it".

1057
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,160
 Yeah.

1058
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
 Going on behind.

1059
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,160
 I know that Furbies was really interesting, wasn't it?

1060
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,160
 Because they...

1061
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:47,160
 The way they worked is they had a stock number of English words they had.

1062
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,160
 And they had a stock number of Furbies words.

1063
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160
 They were just like...

1064
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,160
 All that kind of stuff.

1065
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
 Yeah.

1066
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:56,160
 And it started off, they could just say the Furbie words.

1067
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
 And then as you owned it for longer and longer,

1068
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,160
 it kind of put more and more of the English words into the vocabulary.

1069
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,160
 And so people thought that they were picking up words that you were saying to them.

1070
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
 But actually it was just programmed to do that.

1071
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,160
 But that's a bit like how it is with children, isn't it?

1072
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
 Yeah.

1073
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
 Like they start off talking complete nonsense,

1074
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,160
 and then by the end of their saying, like, "Nah, nah, or dog, or whatever."

1075
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,160
 Oh, no.

1076
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1077
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
 So that's kind of...

1078
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,160
 Maybe that's why they made the Furbie like that.

1079
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,160
 Yeah, I guess so.

1080
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
 Or maybe all children are actually fake.

1081
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,160
 Prove me wrong.

1082
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
 Which is more likely, Andy, I don't know.

1083
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,160
 But yeah, like the CEO of the company that made Furbies had to come out and say,

1084
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
 "This isn't true.

1085
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,160
 "Our Furbies actually aren't as clever as we've been lying about."

1086
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
 Wow.

1087
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
 And he also said, you know, there was a rumor that they could send...

1088
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
 They had enough technologies to send something into space.

1089
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
 And they said that one woman...

1090
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
 Wait, wait, wait, sorry.

1091
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,160
 Yeah.

1092
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
 Just break that down a bit.

1093
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
 Wait, what are the...

1094
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,160
 Somebody thought the Furbies had so much power

1095
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,160
 that they could send a rocket into space.

1096
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
 Are we talking about a complete Cape Canaveral setup?

1097
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,160
 Yes.

1098
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
 We can entirely start my Furbie.

1099
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,160
 I don't know, Furbies are all the deaths.

1100
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
 There's a Furbie in it with the briefcase going on to the ship.

1101
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,160
 Actually, if Elon Musk zips down his jacket,

1102
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
 it's just Furbies all the way up.

1103
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,160
 He is a Furbie.

1104
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,160
 What does that mean?

1105
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
 They could send a rocket to space.

1106
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,160
 It's the AI worry of its day, I guess, right?

1107
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 Yeah, it wasn't true.

1108
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
 That's what he was saying.

1109
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,160
 'Cause he also said that there was a woman who was absolutely insistent

1110
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,160
 that her Furbie was singing Italian operas.

1111
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,160
 That also wasn't true.

1112
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
 Oh, my God.

1113
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
 But she was hearing...

1114
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,160
 She was convinced that she taught this Furbie an aria,

1115
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,160
 and she's like, 'My Furbie's really good at opera.'

1116
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,160
 And he's like, 'They literally don't have that capability.'

1117
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
 So they kind of had to backtrack on all of their marketing campaign.

1118
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
 Wow.

1119
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,160
 These were like, yeah, clever toys,

1120
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,160
 but they were actually all pre-programmed.

1121
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
 Oh, my God.

1122
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
 Scam, wasn't it?

1123
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
 It could be a haunted Furbie.

1124
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
 And that's a ghost, I will believe it.

1125
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,160
 Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1127
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,160
 Imagine the next, like, crude moon mission

1128
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,160
 that gets there and finds they have built their own society.

1129
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,160
 Without us noticing.

1130
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
 The Furbies beat us to it.

1131
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
 Damn it.

1132
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,160
 The dark side of the moon is entirely Furbie.

1133
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,160
 Owned and operated now.

1134
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,160
 Have you heard of Tia Pikachu?

1135
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,160
 So she is a Chilean schoolteacher,

1136
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
 and they've had a load of protests in Chile against the government,

1137
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,160
 and she decided to go dressed as a giant Pikachu.

1138
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
 The reason being that her seven-year-old son

1139
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,160
 had maxed out her husband's credit card

1140
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,160
 buying Detective Pikachu merchandise.

1141
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,160
 They managed to send loads of it back,

1142
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
 but some of it they couldn't send back,

1143
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,160
 and this giant sort of inflatable Pikachu

1144
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
 they couldn't send back.

1145
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,160
 Okay, so then they have some protests in Chile,

1146
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
 and she decides, 'Well, I'm just going to go dressed as a Pikachu,

1147
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,160
 because why not, it's a protest.'

1148
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,160
 And she just became really, really, really famous,

1149
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
 because there was video of her being water,

1150
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
 like, fired with water.

1151
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
 Cannon?

1152
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
 Water cannon, yeah,

1153
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
 in a big Pikachu costume being forced back.

1154
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
 She was shot with rubber bullets,

1155
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
 dressed as Pikachu.

1156
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,160
 It's absolutely amazing,

1157
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,160
 but because she became so famous,

1158
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
 she is part of the team

1159
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,160
 who are writing the New Chilean Constitution.

1160
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
 So after the protest,

1161
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
 they decided that they were going to write a new constitution.

1162
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
 So every five clauses, it's just going to say,

1163
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
 'Pika, pika, pika!'

1164
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:31,160
 It is time for our final fact of the show,

1165
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,160
 and that is Andy.

1166
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,160
 My fact is that in 1972,

1167
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,160
 a family who had survived a shipwreck

1168
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
 kept themselves alive

1169
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,160
 by giving each other turtle blood enemas.

1170
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,160
 Guys, it's a light-hearted and funny fact.

1171
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,160
 I just imagine, like,

1172
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
 that family seeing each other at Christmas.

1173
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
 Yeah.

1174
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
 You know, they haven't said, 'Shall we talk about it?'

1175
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,160
 No, let's never talk about that again.

1176
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,160
 Never talk about it again.

1177
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,160
 No, go on.

1178
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,160
 Give us the context.

1179
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
 This comes from an amazing piece

1180
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,160
 that was in The Financial Times

1181
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
 by a writer called Kitty Drake,

1182
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
 and she was interviewing people

1183
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,160
 who had real knowledge of shipwreck

1184
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
 and being cast away.

1185
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,160
 And she spoke to a man called Douglas Robertson,

1186
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,160
 who was sailing around the world with his family,

1187
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,160
 his siblings and his parents.

1188
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,160
 He was 18 years old,

1189
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,160
 and their yacht was attacked by killer whales.

1190
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
 So they were halfway across the Pacific.

1191
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
 They completely battered the yacht.

1192
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,160
 The family all abandoned ship into a small dinghy

1193
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
 that was, I think there were seven people,

1194
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
 six or seven people in this dinghy

1195
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
 that was designed for one fewer

1196
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,160
 than the number of people who ended up in it.

1197
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,160
 They were 200 miles from the Galapagos,

1198
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,160
 and the wind was going in the wrong direction.

1199
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,160
 So they were really in trouble.

1200
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,160
 They spent 38 days stranded in the Pacific,

1201
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
 and they were sailing towards the doldrums.

1202
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
 They were trying to get weirdly to the doldrums

1203
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,160
 because there was a better chance of being spotted

1204
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,160
 and detected where they were heading to.

1205
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
 So the doldrums is where there's not as much wind or...

1206
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,160
 Exactly. Sorry.

1207
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
 Yeah, the region where there's no wind.

1208
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
 But it does get lots of rain.

1209
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
 So anyway, so they're in big trouble.

1210
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,160
 They did manage to get some turtles on board,

1211
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
 and they had to hunt the turtles that approached them,

1212
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
 and they used their blood as soup.

1213
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
 So that's a good thing.

1214
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
 Then, unfortunately, the water ran very low,

1215
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
 and they only had the old fish-polluted rainwater

1216
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
 in the bottom of their dinghy.

1217
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
 And it wasn't safe to drink.

1218
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
 But the mother of the family, Lynn, was a nurse,

1219
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,160
 and she realised you could absorb it safely

1220
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
 through your bottom.

1221
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,160
 And so everyone in the family got a rain...

1222
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,160
 Guys, this is funnier than we're...

1223
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
 I feel like there's tension in the room.

1224
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,160
 They all make it. They all made it, and they got picked up.

1225
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,160
 It was all right.

1226
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,160
 Oh, spoiler alert. Sorry.

1227
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
 They were all right.

1228
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
 Anyway, she worked out brilliant, an intuition,

1229
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
 that you could absorb it through your bottom.

1230
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
 So everyone in the family got a rain and turtle blood enema,

1231
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
 and it gets into your system,

1232
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
 but it doesn't go through your digestive system.

1233
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
 I'm getting confused when you say the enema bits.

1234
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,160
 What do you mean?

1235
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,160
 Up the bum. Squirt it up the bum.

1236
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
 Oh! What have you been researching?

1237
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
 What because I read? I read...

1238
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
 Oh!

1239
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,160
 Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.

1240
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
 Just where does the orgy butter go?

1241
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,160
 Think in those terms.

1242
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
 That's way more disgusting than what I thought.

1243
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
 Yeah, it's horrible.

1244
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,160
 Cos that's the thing, like, it's not just turtle blood.

1245
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,160
 Anyways, it's disgusting.

1246
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
 Rain water, it's like infected fish guts.

1247
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
 Water, like, it's foul.

1248
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,160
 So the point is... But genius.

1249
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
 Yeah, it's genius. I mean, amazing.

1250
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,160
 If you drink this stuff, it's got all sorts of horrible things in it,

1251
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
 and it can make you really, really sick.

1252
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
 Now, if you go the other way... Yeah, yeah.

1253
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,160
 ...then there's a way for the water to go into your body

1254
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,160
 through your rectum. Yeah.

1255
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,160
 But because you're already getting disgusting things

1256
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,160
 going down there anyway, your body is protected

1257
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
 against those disgusting things. Exactly.

1258
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
 So you can still get the water,

1259
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
 but it won't get the bacteria and all that.

1260
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
 So here's what I thought.

1261
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
 I thought they were removing the rectal membrane from the turtles

1262
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,160
 and using that as a bag to collect the water.

1263
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
 Genuinely, that's what I thought.

1264
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
 A bag to collect the water?

1265
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
 Well, you need to collect water to drink it through your fucking mouth.

1266
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,160
 It's your fucking mouth, right?

1267
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
 How much water are you collecting?

1268
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,160
 It's your fucking shell on it.

1269
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
 If you want to keep water...

1270
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:10,160
 If you ever get a turtle and you want to keep water,

1271
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
 don't take the little bag out of it, Tainus.

1272
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
 Just turn it upside down.

1273
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
 We've got to get to its asshole.

1274
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,160
 Jesus Christ. Wow.

1275
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,160
 Turns out it's Dan's last appearance on "Nose & Sins & Fish" as well.

1276
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,160
 I'd love to see you on, like, one of those reality shit-making shows.

1277
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,160
 Meanwhile, on Dan's Island,

1278
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
 I think it's up to God for a bad to worse.

1279
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,160
 Cool, that makes you...

1280
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,160
 Weirdly, I still think your one makes less sense.

1281
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,160
 Feeding water up your butt.

1282
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
 Incredibly clever.

1283
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
 Incredibly clever, and it is the thing that saved their lives.

1284
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
 They were really on the struggling.

1285
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
 And they all just trusted Lynn when she said that?

1286
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
 She's a nurse.

1287
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
 I get that, but how often are you...?

1288
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
 She's a nurse, though.

1289
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
 That's an off-common knowledge, I would say.

1290
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
 I don't know. Wow.

1291
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
 What's amazing is that there was the group...

1292
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
 There was the husband and the wife,

1293
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
 and I think they had...

1294
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,160
 Was it three or four kids?

1295
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
 It was three. There were four, but one of them got off

1296
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
 before this leg of the journey.

1297
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
 That was lucky. Fuck that.

1298
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
 It's cool. I'll die. I'll just die.

1299
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
 Someone up. So, in this family

1300
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
 of everyone putting stuff up their ass,

1301
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
 there was one guy who'd only just met them.

1302
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,160
 Did you read his name?

1303
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
 He was called Robin Williams, weirdly.

1304
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
 And he'd just taken a job on the boat

1305
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,160
 in return for his birth, and, you know, just...

1306
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
 Yeah.

1307
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:38,160
 It sounds like such a tough journey.

1308
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
 Oh, God. They had to spend six hours a day

1309
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,160
 just blowing the dinghy up, you know,

1310
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,160
 just because it was constantly losing air.

1311
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1312
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,160
 What have they got to do, to be fair?

1313
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,160
 Well, you know, pass of the time.

1314
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,160
 And they eventually got back, didn't they?

1315
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,160
 They did. And then the husband and wife

1316
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,160
 just immediately divorced. No.

1317
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
 Really? Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1318
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
 So, the guy who was kind of

1319
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
 took them on this trip, Douglas,

1320
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
 he wrote a book

1321
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
 and went to live in the med.

1322
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
 And his wife became a farmer.

1323
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
 Oh, wow. Oh, because they were farmers before they said that.

1324
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,160
 They were, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1325
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
 So, they completely, they split up, yeah.

1326
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,160
 Gosh. Oh, that's sad.

1327
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
 That is sad. Yeah, yeah.

1328
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
 Did you hear, there was a recent

1329
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
 someone stranded out in the ocean

1330
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
 and having to get by with what materials they had.

1331
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
 There was a guy called Elvis,

1332
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
 and he was found

1333
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
 120 nautical miles northwest

1334
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
 of Columbia's

1335
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
 Poreto Boliva. I don't know how to pronounce that.

1336
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
 Lovely. Yeah. And he survived.

1337
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
 He wrote help on the hull

1338
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
 of his sailboat, and so someone saw that.

1339
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
 But he was stuck out there for a long time.

1340
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
 And he was 24 days, I think,

1341
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
 he was out there and he survived almost

1342
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
 exclusively on tomato ketchup

1343
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
 from Heinz. Wow.

1344
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
 And so that became the story when he got back.

1345
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
 He found him after being missing all this time.

1346
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
 And then Heinz decided that they wanted

1347
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
 to give him a new boat because they thought this was amazing.

1348
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
 I thought you were about to say,

1349
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
 "Give him some more ketchup." Yeah, yeah.

1350
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,160
 No, that's a much better,

1351
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
 that's good PR by Heinz, yeah, yeah.

1352
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
 So, they've done it. They've done that.

1353
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
 Well, for ages, they couldn't find him.

1354
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
 So, he disappeared again, but just into his normal life

1355
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
 because he was, you know, he didn't make a big fuss of it.

1356
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
 So, there was a huge campaign to find

1357
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,160
 the missing boat guy who then,

1358
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,160
 and they found Elvis, basically.

1359
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,160
 Yeah, a hard hashtag to use,

1360
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,160
 but they found him

1361
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,160
 and he's now got his boat. That's great.

1362
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
 Tomato ketchup is exclusively, yeah,

1363
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
 what he was surviving on. Gosh.

1364
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,160
 You can, just a tip

1365
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,160
 for any of us who get shipwrecked,

1366
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
 do have a plastic bag if you can.

1367
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
 If you don't have a turtle to have.

1368
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
 Yes.

1369
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,160
 Why would that be? Well,

1370
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
 you use a bag of water.

1371
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,160
 What are you using this bag of water for, guys?

1372
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,160
 Drinking out of? Making fire.

1373
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
 You can make fire with a bag of water.

1374
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
 Oh, like a lens.

1375
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
 Like a lens. If it's a clear bag,

1376
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
 do make sure it's a clear bag.

1377
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
 Lot of caveats on this.

1378
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,160
 Not a bag for life.

1379
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
 Ironically, a bag for life wouldn't work.

1380
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
 That is.

1381
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
 And you'd be kicking yourself, wouldn't you?

1382
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,160
 Pay 30 papers.

1383
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:14,160
 No, a bog standard, like a clear plastic bag.

1384
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,160
 If you can make it into a round shape,

1385
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,160
 you can use that to focus the rays of the sun

1386
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,160
 onto your tinder.

1387
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
 And then, and it makes fire.

1388
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
 And if you don't have a plastic bag,

1389
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
 you can use a light bulb.

1390
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
 If you don't have a light bulb.

1391
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,160
 Just have an idea.

1392
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,160
 Excuse my ignorance.

1393
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,160
 Like, would it not

1394
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,160
 melt the plastic?

1395
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,160
 Or is that a stupid thing to ask?

1396
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,160
 It's not a stupid question, but I don't think it would.

1397
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,160
 I don't know why.

1398
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,160
 Oh, the point at which the rays focus

1399
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
 the hottest point, which is not on the surface of the bag.

1400
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,160
 It's on whatever you're pointing at.

1401
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,160
 Interesting.

1402
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,160
 I was reading some advice from a guy called Paul Hart,

1403
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
 who is the Royal Navy's...

1404
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,160
 He's a Lieutenant Commander for the Royal Navy.

1405
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
 And he was asked, if you get shipped wrecked on an island,

1406
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,160
 what should you be doing in order to survive?

1407
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,160
 So, he wrote this big list of stuff.

1408
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,160
 And so, here's the quiz-like

1409
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,160
 moment here.

1410
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,160
 So, your boat

1411
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,160
 has crashed on the shore,

1412
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,160
 or your airplane has crashed into

1413
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,160
 the ocean, and you've made it to shore.

1414
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
 What is the first thing

1415
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,160
 that you should be collecting in order to survive?

1416
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
 From the aircraft?

1417
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,160
 You're on an island, yeah. So, the food.

1418
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
 OK, so food would be a good...

1419
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,160
 Well, I would say the eight

1420
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,160
 single CDs that I carry

1421
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,160
 with me everywhere I go.

1422
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,160
 A copy of the Bible that you always have.

1423
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,160
 A copy of the Bible. And what would your luxury be?

1424
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,160
 A lovely bottle of Tabasco sauce.

1425
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,160
 Oh, lovely!

1426
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,160
 So, the answer is, he says...

1427
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,160
 No, no, no. A lifetime supplier of Marmite.

1428
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,160
 Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, OK.

1429
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,160
 Get that right, yeah.

1430
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
 Orgy butter if that's not available, yeah.

1431
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,160
 One of the same to him.

1432
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,160
 Life jacket. Life jacket, no.

1433
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,160
 The seats can be used as floatation devices.

1434
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:56,160
 I'm trying to remember what they've said to me.

1435
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,160
 Things that you're going to take from your wreckage,

1436
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,160
 or things that are on the island?

1437
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,160
 No, things that you take from the wreckage.

1438
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,160
 Something to... The radio from the...

1439
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
 A knife, no. Well, knife is, yes, it's up there.

1440
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,160
 But he says... A clear bag.

1441
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,160
 A clear plastic bag.

1442
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,160
 That's it, that's it.

1443
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
 He says Wellington boots.

1444
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
 Oh, OK. What? Sorry, when do you get on a plane?

1445
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,160
 Do they just hand you some Wellington boots?

1446
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,160
 He's saying any kind of...

1447
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,160
 A very strong footwear that you can have.

1448
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,160
 Right, OK. Because you're going to be going into the ocean a lot

1449
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
 in order to get food.

1450
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
 You're going to be travelling, and injury is the thing you need to avoid.

1451
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:30,160
 Most of all, and your feet are most likely to be getting injured.

1452
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
 That's really interesting. Because actually, on that Ryanair thing,

1453
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
 it tells you to take off your high heels

1454
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,160
 before you jump on the slide, doesn't it?

1455
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,160
 Yes. And you're saying...

1456
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
 You're saying keep them on?

1457
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
 Is that...?

1458
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,160
 No, so that's the biggest thing.

1459
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
 That's interesting, yeah.

1460
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,160
 Wellies, it is quite a niche thing,

1461
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,160
 as James just said, to have on that.

1462
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah. It makes sense.

1463
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,160
 I would personally get a knife.

1464
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,160
 Because then you can fashion some sort of, like...

1465
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,160
 Fashion... Make some... Oh, come on, babe.

1466
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,160
 Not Wellies! Come on!

1467
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,160
 But you could, like, get, like...

1468
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
 Either you're going to carve your own...

1469
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
 Or you could cut your own way.

1470
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
 Do you know what I mean? Like, a knife surely is the most important thing,

1471
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,160
 because that can... That's very important.

1472
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
 Actually, you can use the, like, shoes to yourself.

1473
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,160
 You can tap the rubber tree, and then...

1474
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,160
 With a simple mould fashion from Bach...

1475
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
 LAUGHTER

1476
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,160
 You've got your own Wellie factory, then.

1477
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,160
 Look!

1478
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,160
 You could trade the knife for some Wellies

1479
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,160
 if there's some local Wellie owners.

1480
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,160
 There are local Wellie owners.

1481
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,160
 I don't think you need the Wellies.

1482
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,160
 You can just leave.

1483
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
 You're probably...

1484
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,160
 You're in North Devon.

1485
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,160
 LAUGHTER

1486
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,160
 Oh, my God. That's so funny.

1487
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
 I read the US Army Survival Manual.

1488
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,160
 Oh, yeah. Oh, of course you do.

1489
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,160
 To see if enemas were part of their...

1490
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
 Yeah. ...suggestion.

1491
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
 There is one mention of enemas

1492
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,160
 in the whole Survival Manual,

1493
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,160
 and the idea is to use warm water enemas

1494
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,160
 as a way to treat hypothermia.

1495
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
 Oh, OK. Yeah, apparently.

1496
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,160
 It's good because it warms you up from the inside,

1497
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,160
 if you think about that. Oh, right.

1498
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,160
 The thing that they said to drink

1499
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,160
 is the aqueous fluid

1500
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,160
 found along the spine and the eyes

1501
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,160
 of large fish. Right.

1502
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,160
 Oh, gosh. Is that interesting?

1503
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,160
 Is that because it's less salty than...?

1504
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,160
 Yeah, so everything else that's in the fish,

1505
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
 all the other Wellie fluids,

1506
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,160
 have got lots of protein, lots of fat,

1507
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,160
 so it's going to make you more thirsty.

1508
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,160
 But just the water around the eyes

1509
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,160
 and the water around the spinal fluid,

1510
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,160
 that stuff is just perfect.

1511
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,160
 I'm going to mention this guy, because one of the other things

1512
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,160
 at this Paul Hart that I was talking about,

1513
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,160
 the guy who said that Wellington boots

1514
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,160
 are what you need it. Oh, yeah.

1515
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,160
 One of the things that he said that was really important

1516
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,160
 was having positive mentality.

1517
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,160
 That's the main thing.

1518
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
 As soon as you crash, you go,

1519
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,160
 "Fantastic! This is great!"

1520
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,160
 And if you can keep that mindset, then you're going to be fine.

1521
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,160
 And that really kind of is...

1522
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,160
 That comes into play when you read about the story

1523
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,160
 of Jose Salvador Alvorenga,

1524
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,160
 who was a guy who was out at sea

1525
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
 with one other person for 438 days.

1526
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,160
 They were lost out at sea,

1527
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,160
 and it was a positive mentality that kept him going.

1528
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,160
 And when he was interviewed by a journalist

1529
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,160
 who wrote a book about it, he said,

1530
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,160
 "What's the thing that you remember most about it?"

1531
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,160
 And he said, "My imagination.

1532
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,160
 I imagine good food, and

1533
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,160
 I have the best sex in my life."

1534
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,160
 And he used to... So they used to...

1535
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,160
 The two guys used to see the planes that would fly over,

1536
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,160
 that would never see them,

1537
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,160
 and they would go, "What do you think they're eating up there?"

1538
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,160
 And they would picture the food that they were...

1539
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,160
 No, they never... They...

1540
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,160
 They both would then have...

1541
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
 Also, the best food of their lives on a plane.

1542
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,160
 Has he been on a plane?

1543
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1544
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,160
 Bit of stale bread, and something in a little

1545
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,160
 reheated tray. Yeah, great.

1546
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,160
 Better than whatever they were eating up

1547
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
 their assholes at that time.

1548
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,160
 It was that smell. They're on a dinghy.

1549
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,160
 And so... And yeah.

1550
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,160
 Diggy food is terrible, you know.

1551
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,160
 What's that all about? Yeah.

1552
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1553
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,160
 They used to... Both of them would do this.

1554
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,160
 They would sit, but him particularly,

1555
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,160
 he'd sit there every day, he'd close his eyes,

1556
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,160
 he'd imagine that they'd actually crashed onto a beach,

1557
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
 and there was a beautiful woman walking towards him,

1558
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,160
 and they would have sex, and he said every day

1559
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,160
 he just had amazing sex in his head,

1560
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,160
 and that kept him positive. Wow.

1561
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,160
 Yeah. The other guy died, right?

1562
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,160
 Did he? I think so, yeah.

1563
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1564
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,160
 He wasn't positive enough.

1565
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,160
 God's sake.

1566
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,160
 Unbelievable.

1567
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:22,160
 He was more positive

1568
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,160
 as he's throwing him off the edge of this dinghy.

1569
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1570
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,160
 I was going to ask, actually, who...

1571
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1572
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,160
 No, just quickly. Who out of...

1573
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,160
 Say the three of you got shipwrecked.

1574
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
 I'd die first. Who would you think would survive?

1575
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,160
 I would die first. The first.

1576
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
 Like, like... I'd die within 30 seconds.

1577
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,160
 Do you think... Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1578
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,160
 I would start another day. I would start another day.

1579
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,160
 We're going to have to eat him. We're going to have to eat him.

1580
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,160
 There's a guy selling willing to do something.

1581
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,160
 No, no!

1582
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
 Cannibalism returned

1583
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
 to North Devon today.

1584

 (LAUGHTER)

1585
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,160
 Oh, God.

1586
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,160
 And Dan's probably the most positive, so I guess you win.

1587
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dan will be having fantastic sex.

1588
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,160
 (LAUGHTER)

1589
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
 And eating delicious plain food.

1590
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,160
 Oh, God. What a treat.

1591
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160

 (UPBEAT MUSIC)

1593
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,160
 All right, we need to wrap up.

1594

 That is it. That is all of our facts.
