 But as far as today's podcast is concerned

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.240
 It is a live show and it was one that we did at the British library with the incredible

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.240
 comedy actor and genius that is Sally Phillips. We did this show for the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.640
 Fantastic Beasts exhibition at the British library. They wanted us to do a show all about animals and

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 I'll be honest. We stretched that a fair bit from time to time, but we had so much fun

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.760
 I really hope you enjoy this show. I'm sure you will and I guess what else is there to say apart from on with a podcast

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:32.640
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the British library

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.200
 My name is Dan Shriver

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.920
 I am sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Sally Phillips and once again

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.440
 We yes and once again

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.880
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.840
 We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.480
 My fact this week is that the British library's fantastic beasts collection

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.880
 Originally included accounts of a nine-foot dragon terrorizing Essex

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.240
 And an army of horses that teleported to rural Wales

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:21.320
 And it was donated by the founder of the British Museum, Sir Han Sloan. Wow. So he was a nutcase

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.320
 So here's the thing right he's a Han Sloan if you don't know who he is

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.040
 He was one of the founders of the British Museum an incredible guy

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.160
 He was a doctor and at the top of being a doctor. He was obsessed with collecting he collected everything

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.200
 And that's what became the basis of the British Museum's collection. He was a hoarder. He was a hoarder. Yeah

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.720
 I mean he was a serious hoarder. He had he had like a separate apartment to hoard in because it got too much in his own

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.700
 Yeah, and how did he die? Did it all collapse on him exactly a museum pillar took him out?

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.260
 No, he he was quite old. I think when he died. I think he was in his 90s 93

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.120
 Is this the bringer of chocolate the man? I know is the bringer of the hot chocolate

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800
 Controversial

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.520
 He was and I think I think it's been claimed that

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.080
 That was something he nicked. It was ready in place. Yeah, I think he was in Jamaica, maybe

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:20.020
 Yeah, okay, and then it was a practice they sort of a grated cocoa with milk and cinnamon and stuff

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.360
 But I think sorry to shit on him in his own home

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.240
 Teleporting horses better anyway, it's way better, isn't it? Yeah

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.640
 So this is what I was about to say was is all the collections that got handed over after he passed away in his will to be the

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.640
 Basis of the British Museum's collection

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.520
 Eventually became the British Library's collection as well and there was lots of papers

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.360
 There's lots of physical objects and a part of it was a collection of things called strange news

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 He was obsessed with strange news stories that would come out from France and Scotland and Wales of odd things that you know like

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.160
 Well like dragons

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.400
 Appearing horses and it was the artifact version of no such thing as a fish. Yes. Well. He's the yeah

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 He's the old me I guess

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.200
 You have fewer links to the slave trade we should say dad

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:15.680
 Yeah, so this this big dragon that arrived in Essex

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.460
 It was in a place called Hennem, which is just north of Stanstead. It's about two miles north of Stanstead

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 And so what I like to imagine is actually there was like a time-travel portal that came in and it was actually an easy jet flight

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:37.680
 Maybe I don't know but there's loads of other things that he he claimed and the thing is he went out to collect things from around the

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.040
 World but the reason he did that is because he thought it would help people to better understand God's design of the world and

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.800
 So when he was finding this strange news a lot of things he didn't believe in but there were some things that he did

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.720
 So he found a story from France where fist-sized

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.320
 Hailstones came down and kind of battered everything and hurt a lot of people and killed a lot of crops

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.160
 But the only thing that was saved was a Protestant church

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.320
 Yeah, I thought that this was proof that you know God was saving them. Yeah, this this one's amazing

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.200
 There was a story this is from Scotland

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:12.840
 There was a guy who died and he was in his home. They would laid him to in state is in state. What is it when you lay someone?

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.720
 Sure. Yeah, sure. So he's laid in the house. He's in a coffin for people to come and see like an open coffin like a way

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.040
 Yeah, yeah, it's state is pretty fancy. It's pretty Queen ish, isn't it? Yeah

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.760
 Yeah, you just said this guy was this

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.080
 How long was the queue is what?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.960
 It was just a guy and

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.240
 It was a town of Dumfries. Okay. Yeah. So apparently

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.280
 People went to visit him and then it came the time where okay

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.720
 Let's bury him now and they tried to lift him and no one could lift him

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.400
 He was really heavy. They just they tried everything so they brought cattle in and they tied ropes around him and tried to pull him

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:56.120
 And he didn't move and then the house burnt down and he remained as the only thing that was still there

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.480
 He's like Arthur's sword in the stone. He's he's the guy in the house the corpse in the house

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.560
 Sorry, so he he collected this story if you didn't collect the guy

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.560
 No, you can't collect the guy is the point of the story

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:17.480
 So he had straight with these kept in diary form or like what kind of evidence were they these were like weird pamphlets

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.360
 That used to get produced and so people would go and buy them on the street

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.360
 And it would just say strange news from Scotland. So he's 1660s. Yeah. Yes. He was really early. Oh, yeah

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.840
 Yeah, yeah, we should we should say that I know we don't we don't need to say none of the stuff is true that we're

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.760
 described as in we keep we keep saying apparently

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.880
 Describing things which people thought it was some people thought it was. Yeah, that's true

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:47.960
 I'm just saying if in like 400 years they're discussing a copy of the Daily Star and saying apparently there was a there is an infinitely heavy man

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.240
 I think I remember that headline

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.640
 I did I actually weirdly I found a star headline in the course of because I was researching animals which are not proven to exist

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 Yes, and there was a headline in the Daily Star in 2008 Loch Ness monster dies aged three million

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440
 Oh

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:16.680
 Global warming very sad. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting the whole thing of fictional fictional creatures cryptids

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:25.160
 I did Italian Dante. There were a lot of fictional creatures the phoenixes in in Dante at only incense and cardamom pods

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.200
 In heaven cardamom pods. What's that? It's that bit of a curry that you see and you're like, oh

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:36.280
 They've left it in. Oh, wow. No, it's the thing in the in the in the jazz version of a cinnamon bun, right?

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:42.040
 Yeah, there were three types of phoenixes three types of yeti's

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.640
 Yeah, you found a yeti that i've never heard of which is what was it called? It was yeah, there's three types

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.040
 The nyelmo which is black has black fur and is the largest in the fetus

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.680
 Which is 15 foot tall the tuti which is eight feet tall and lives eight thousand to ten thousand feet above sea level

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.920
 And the rangshin bombo

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.880
 Which is only three to five feet tall and I think must have been just the mistaken

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:12.680
 It's an orangutan or some kind of a boon. Yeah, the first one sounds like a gorilla rangshin bombo. Yeah, it does it does a bit

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.280
 Yeah, yeah, the first one you described because it's black fur quite tall

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:23.320
 Yeah, it's interesting the the abominable snowman. I mean they had some fur didn't they they kept they various times over history

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:28.440
 They would analyze the dna of yeah, and occasionally find it to be a horse or yeah or

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.720
 Or a bear or a they now think it is a kind of bear hybrid thing, don't they?

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:40.440
 How do they I think say that's interesting. Yeah. Also, um, I I've studied this a lot actually Sally

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.440
 And um, I'm trying to find the thing you haven't studied a lot

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.480
 I that's everything else

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.080
 I can't believe we've hit on the one thing I've studied

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.920
 This is the dream come true, but um brine blessed who is a very um yeti

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 It is

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.520
 That's what he would say he would go for the yeti looking for the yeti and then the locals that he would meet in the himalayas would say

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.640
 Oh, it's a yeti and he realized that all the stories are him

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:15.000
 I read about uh quite recently in Nepal they had like these um

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.880
 I think they were models or badges or some kind of publicity of the of the yeti

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.800
 And they sent them out and then all the locals were like well the yeti looks nothing like that

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.640
 What are you doing because you didn't have any fur on and the guy who did it said well

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.480
 No one knows what it looks like anyway. So that's one thing and number two fur is actually really difficult to draw

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:39.160
 So king kong for example, yeah, not a cryptid. I know a fictional

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:46.840
 Character character. Yeah a crowbar is what you know, we're talking about large hairy. Okay. Yeah

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:53.400
 Fellas and king kong is is all of these three things. Um, but king kong was originally based on a lizard

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.680
 Was it? Oh godzilla. No, I think godzilla's a bit later king kong was based on the komodo dragon

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.440
 Really? Yeah, there was a so the filmmaker behind king kong was uh, maryon maryon c cooper

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.560
 And he was friends with an explorer called william burton who

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:14.760
 Had had got permission to collect some komodo dragons from the dutch east indies as they were then now indonesia and um until

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.400
 1910 nobody nobody from the west had seen a komodo dragon. So they were cryptids

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.000
 They weren't believed in they had not been cited spotted hunted brought back or no specimens

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.560
 And uh, one was brought back by william burton to the usa and in the course of the expedition his wife was nearly

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.720
 Eaton by eaten by a komodo dragon. What really and and yeah, she she was she'd finished sort of setting a

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.480
 You know a photography, you know, like a photo trap up or something for it

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.760
 And was going back and came face to face with one and you know had a lucky escape

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:52.760
 And so that image of this kind of glamorous woman faced with a terrifying beast when william burton brought back the

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.880
 sample that he got of a komodo dragon maryon c cooper saw it and thought one of it was a monkey and

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:04.280
 And I mean because gorillas were also new in the usa at the time. How old was how old was his wife?

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:09.320
 Because there is a thing when you sort of hit menopause your your maternal instinct goes really

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:13.960
 Into overdrive and you start wanting to mother beautiful

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.560
 Primates and yeah, lots of women get into trouble that way

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:23.400
 Animals and and show business as a marriage made in hell

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 We had an animal agent who came on to smack the pony quite a lot

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.400
 Jackie she had quite a lot of represented a lot of animals that would come occasionally with need

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.880
 And she had a vietnamese potbellied pig on her business card. I went. Oh, he's so cute

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.760
 You know perimenopause starting so cute

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.920
 And um, do you still have him sure? No, he won't bring in any work. So we hurt him

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.200
 Wow

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.000
 I hope she said that in ear shots of all the other animals

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.800
 You better do your job

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.200
 Yeah, it was terrible

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:00.520
 Apparently the hardest animals to train are owls. They just don't get it apparently

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.160
 So it's really interesting that you think that an owl would be smart. Yeah, no dumb

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.160
 I cannot repeat ravens are the dogs of the of the sky penguins are aggressive a bit of a nightmare

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.360
 And they have explosive poo. Do you know this?

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.480
 Penguins who explodes

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:24.200
 So very difficult to well, no, no, no, no as you mean the poo shoots out. It doesn't they don't lay it and then

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.720
 Imagine if dogs did that

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.200
 Yeah, every time you've been walking through the park it'll be like walking through world war one, wouldn't it?

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.880
 Be like the end of black. Don't take your foot off it. Don't take your foot off it

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:45.480
 Yeah, they have lots of animals obviously playing each part the um, the kestrel in cares was played

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:50.760
 Do you know this you prudy he played by three different kestrels called freeman hardy and willis after

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:57.640
 After the shoe shop, that's amazing. Yeah, I presented the palm dog award for best. Hey my

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:04.440
 The palm dog palm dog. There is you know in can the can film festival. Yeah. Yeah some british journalist

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:11.320
 22 years ago now set up the palm dog rather than the palm door for the best canine performance

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.720
 And I was lucky enough

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:19.800
 To present the award with runny and kona to quentin tarantino on behalf of

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.720
 The dog in once upon a time in hollywood. Oh, it's played by three three dogs two

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.440
 male dogs and

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.240
 So the dogs don't get to come to the ceremony or

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.960
 Well, they didn't the the dog didn't come to the no

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:42.680
 They found a similar breed and they brought that dog in dog didn't know what was happening. Oh god. They ate the first dog, didn't they?

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.800
 Quentin urinated on the carpet

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.800
 It was it was fine. But yeah, yeah, so you have you have several and they use different animals

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.480
 So he was saying quent my quentin

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.840
 quent quenti quent

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.320
 tar

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.680
 My brother tried to license his image to be on lunchboxes. I don't know why but anyway, well hang on

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:11.560
 But he said they have three different dogs one girl and two boys

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.600
 Then on the day he thought the two male dogs were better

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:19.800
 But then turned out the female dog was actually when he got into the edit he realized she was a much better actress

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.960
 Sorry, can we get back to your brother? Yeah tried to

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:28.920
 Tried to license quentin tarantino's image famously a man who makes 18 certificate films

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.080
 Yes, for lunchboxes

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:38.840
 What was he thinking the market? I I didn't ask it was only like a long time after he told me that that I realized that that was mad

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:46.120
 Tarantino's up there. He's accepting an award as a dog that image of him like the shaguevara tarantino picture

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:51.640
 I think they were putting that on stuff. Oh, okay. Oh, is that a famous picture the shaguevara tarantino?

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.960
 Do you know the one I mean that because I don't you okay? So I feel like there's a very sort of known

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.800
 I don't know if you remember Dan knows everything about yeti's and nothing about anything else

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:06.200
 Do you know just just going back to mythological creatures a second the um speaking of penguins exploding

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.760
 Um poo out their buns. There's a mythological creature called smooth. By the way smooth. Thank you

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.480
 There's a thing called the bonacan

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.840
 You heard of the bonacan?

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.280
 Bonacan's like a it's it's like this beast which is like a half horse

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:23.080
 It's got curved horns and the way that it would if it was being hunted by humans

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:28.520
 The way that it would deter the humans is to fire poisonous shit out of its bum, right?

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.640
 But it can it can make a distance and this is what's most impressive about this thing that doesn't exist

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.400
 Is it can shoot at three acres

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:47.400
 That's um a unit of area area not distance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So does he cover the entire like one and a half football pictures?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:54.360
 I think it does cover three. I've also read about the bonacan. Interestingly, brian blessed told me he could do that

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.000
 He could do that when he was on Everest four acres. Yeah

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.480
 He said when he said he had a bout of diarrhea on Everest and the poo

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.160
 Shot out and it he said his thing he often says is don't camp under the french

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:12.520
 Because the fuckers will shit on you. That's that's his like that's like a t-shirt quote from him

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.680
 But again, who's buying these?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.840
 Obscene t-shirts and lunchboxes. Yeah, I need to meet your brother actually

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:25.960
 Um, so anyway the bonacan the bonacan is a is a terrifying creature with three acre

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.840
 Poisonous poo shoots and everyone that's depicted trying to hunt it all faces the other way

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.400
 Basically facing as as ready to run

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:39.560
 Because they want to escape the fire. Poisonous poo. Yeah, it's like fighting Medusa. Have you come across?

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.880
 I'm sure you have the fictitious creatures of lumberjack culture

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:48.200
 No, it sounds amazing. No guys settle in

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:57.560
 There are a number of books called things like fearsome critters about fictional creatures in lumberjack law

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.360
 And they're things like

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:06.920
 Well, my favorite one. Let me take my favorite one. There's a splinter cat. It's a regular cat, but with no logic

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.720
 Who's an indiscriminate destroyer of hollow trees? Which was their explanation for um

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:20.120
 For lightning strikes, but there is a it was one that was uh, the lumberjack hunter

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:26.760
 That hides behind trees so you can't see it, but um, can only be deterred by loads of alcohol

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.120
 The lumberjacks must be drunk

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:37.560
 To keep safe. That's good. That's good logic. We're gonna have to move on. We've we've run way over

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.680
 Oh, no, I was reading some stuff by alien

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.560
 The roman writer and orator

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:49.240
 What alien alien alien i'm gonna call him alien alien alien alien

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:55.320
 And he's got loads of amazing creatures. He has the buprestis which he believed existed

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.120
 Which is a creature which if swallowed by a cow causes the cow to swell and burst

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.480
 He had a smooth lobster

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:09.880
 Where if you saw it on the beach and then you marked where it was and you drove it to anywhere in the world

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.520
 When you got back to where it was it would be back there. Whoa

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.160
 He sure wasn't teleporting

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:21.240
 And he said also that um if a snake is eating something that's a little bit too big for it to swallow

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.960
 And it kind of gets it into the mouth and can't go any further

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:30.200
 It'll stand straight on its tail and jiggle itself. So the food will go down into his stomach

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:36.280
 Have you seen those videos of people hunting anacondas? No, no, they put a

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:43.000
 Leather trouser on and stick their entire leg into the snake's hole. Yeah, they get swallowed

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.080
 Why would you do that? And then they have a low to catch a snake to I guess eat it

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.400
 You're the worm for fishing

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.200
 And then they put they haul you out

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.080
 And then and then kill the snake and the other thing is so that the snake doesn't digest

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.320
 So all the juices doesn't digest the meat and maybe the teeth can't go through it or something

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.880
 Yeah, I think that is just there was a guy. Did you see the guy? I I think this is right

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.480
 He was attempting to be swallowed by a snake as well. Um, and it was going to be like a world record

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.560
 But what's the what?

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.640
 I think I'm right in saying this again. This don't even accept, you know, heaviest cat anymore

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:25.240
 I think unfortunately, no, they found an infinitely heavy one in Dumfries today

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:32.360
 But this guy who this was big it was bigger set up. It was like with a like a nat geo kind of thing. Um

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.440
 The snake started swallowing on the wrong end. So he went head first

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:42.520
 And he wasn't ready for it. And so they had to pull him out and cancel. Did you not did you not have his big leather hat?

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.480
 They do it. I mean they catch fish like that sometimes in America, don't they it's catfish

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:53.960
 And they'll get the cat to grab hold of their fist and then when it's bitten they pull it out. It's called catfisting

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.040
 Is it this yeah

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.920
 I'd rather be catfished

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:09.160
 It is time for fact number two and that is

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:16.520
 James. Okay. My fact this week is that in real life the very hungry caterpillar would have gone around headbutting his mates

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:22.760
 So these days, you know, all of these children's books are getting rewritten aren't they like

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:30.040
 Charlie of the chocolate factory and whatever and I'm calling for the very hungry caterpillar to be rewritten to be more factually accurate

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.440
 Um, because according to the people at florida atlantic university

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.200
 Whenever caterpillars get really really hungry and they don't have enough food

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.800
 They'll go around looking for other caterpillars and then they'll attack them knock them off where they're eating

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.640
 And then they'll go in and eat their leaf. No way. Yeah, and so that's what eric carl really should have been writing about

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:55.240
 It's a tougher. Yeah, they don't eat ice cream. They don't eat lollipops. They don't eat salami

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.840
 They tend to only eat one kind of leaf any caterpillar whatever caterpillar you get. This is going to sell big jokes

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:09.320
 On monday, you got him one fight and he ate one of the same kind of leaf that he's going to eat for the rest of the week

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:15.080
 They do occasionally they occasionally get a species which will eat fruit

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.320
 So you might get one that would eat an apple

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.440
 But it would only eat apple and it would only eat the same apple and it would live inside the apple

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.160
 It was eating until it was ready. I actually really enjoy that book

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.800
 My partner ian pointed out on the way here that eric carl was conscripted

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:38.520
 Into yeah, he fought on the siegfried line. I think it was so yeah, he was an american born

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:43.640
 Yeah, age 15 who's conscripted and he had to dig the trenches

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.080
 In my head. That's a bit like a caterpillar to cat was dig

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.520
 That's what gave him the idea

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:55.080
 He was born in Germany the family moved to america really soon or he was he his early years were in america

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.520
 Certainly then the family moved back to germany in 1935

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.840
 Right when he was about six years old. So at the end of the war he was conscripted to dig trenches and he was fired at

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.520
 He was 15 as well. 15 years old. Yeah, and then and then after the war obviously had a horrible time

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.680
 His father was in a prison camp and and had an awful time

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.520
 Then the family moved he certainly moved back to america

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.000
 And then he was conscripted a second time

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.600
 To go to to join the u.s. Army and to go back to germany again where he was involved in filling in the holes that he dug

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.600
 I actually feel quite bad that i'm shitting on his buck now

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.880
 Well, I mean, is it any wonder that the follow-up book was called the very grumpy lady bird

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:45.400
 And there's something called polar bear. What do you hear? I think he read a lot. What do you see?

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.600
 What do you hear? Yeah, because yes, it's a great artist and yeah

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.680
 Also an amazing scheme off the back of this book because there was an eric carl museum that you can go to in america

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.840
 And in the museum

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.640
 Everything everything has a hole in it. Oh, sorry. Well, no, not everything's edible. That would be amazing

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.680
 Yeah, no every so like if you go to the canteen you buy a cookie and the cookie has a massive hole in it

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.800
 Like brilliant

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:14.120
 So this guy is saving so much money in his like there was I remember reading that the new york times when they removed the

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.880
 Dot at the end of new york times that little on the headline

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.520
 They were saving six hundred dollars a year that little bit of ink cost them so much

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.560
 Imagine how much that bit of cookie that's missing is what do they do with those little bits of cookie though?

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.600
 Do they they smell they sell they sell their cookies. Yeah

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:35.320
 But imagine how you could ruin that museum by having eric carl's experience of warfare

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:41.080
 Like a room. That's yeah, that's not the good way to go in. Yeah trench digging and trench room

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.160
 Yeah, so I went on to his website because there is another problem in this book

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.400
 That is that to us the end the caterpillar goes into a cocoon

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.640
 And it becomes a butterfly but butterflies don't go into cocoons

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:02.200
 Butterflies go into chrysalises or caterpillars caterpillars butterflies don't go into anything. No, they come from chrysalises. Yeah

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.640
 Um, and so some kids have written into him and said well, why have you got a cocoon in your book?

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.240
 And he replied saying well, there is a rare genus

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.560
 That lives in Siberia, North Korea and the northern islands of japan

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:19.480
 Um called panacean which does pupate in a cocoon

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.720
 So he's he was hugely relieved when he found out

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.280
 I said that doesn't work the difference. Sorry. What's the difference between a christmas and a cocoon?

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.360
 So a cocoon is made out of silk

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.440
 Uh, and the chrysalis isn't

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.560
 chrysalis is made out of nylon

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:44.120
 But you get quite a lot of moths that make cocoons. Okay, uh another insects, but uh butterflies don't uh, but he did then say actually

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:49.720
 You know caterpillars don't eat lollipops either. This was just a this was it's a special caterpillar

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.640
 It's allowed to do what it wants. Yeah, all right. It's a children's book grow up

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.440
 And then another kid wrote in saying caterpillars don't have noses

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.120
 Oh

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:08.600
 And he said I know it hasn't nose on its face, but this feature grew out of my imagination

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:16.680
 Don't have shoes either caterpillars. I wrote an anecdote about him, which I I'm only bringing it up because I didn't understand it

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.240
 So I'm hoping that maybe you guys will um, so he said that his

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.680
 He wrote all these books as you were saying where it was sort of like the next kind of so the very busy spider

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:34.520
 The very quiet cricket and in an interview he says that um, he found himself in the changing rooms after swimming

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:40.280
 And a satirical young fan suggested a book entitled the very slow penis

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:46.760
 To the author's great amusement and I can't work out what's funny about that

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.760
 What's a slow penis ask your wife

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:54.520
 Does it also have a hole going through it this book?

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.160
 Just can't work out where the slow penis is

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.360
 Yeah, anyway, there's a slow loris

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.680
 Oh

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:11.960
 Well you've you've got this all done thank you had no such thing on twitter if you want to

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.760
 Let us know

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:21.160
 He's got their hairs right anyway butterflies and moths. I discovered have nearly 10 billion hairs on them

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.920
 10 billion because these scientists have spent over a decade

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.400
 Studying the surface area of animals

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:36.760
 The surface area of animals, I mean that's such a funny thing. I think let's say a cat surface area is actually like a ping-pong table

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:42.760
 When you cover your ping-pong table in cat the ball doesn't bounce nearly as well

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:47.800
 The author has the surface area of a professional hockey rink

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.840
 Because they've got because they've got

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:57.240
 And a honeybee has the same number of hairs as a squirrel

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.280
 Wow

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:05.080
 Yeah, the georgie institute of technology just astonishing

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.560
 That's amazing. Yeah, they were running calculations to find the true surface area of animals

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.320
 Because they were trying to work out ways of keeping things clean

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:19.400
 So dogs obviously shake or every animal has a different way of keeping clean

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.720
 And sometimes the fur helps them to stay clean. Sometimes it doesn't it's where you must never shave a dog

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.880
 I'm sure you haven't but don't shave a dog even a really furry one. It's not good for it

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.280
 I used to have a challenge to stop it. They don't get a number one

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.160
 Yeah, you shouldn't shave your chow chow. Do you have a number one? You shouldn't you shouldn't do that. That's bad

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.120
 That's what do this. Well, you told the chow chow needs to go and have a number one

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:45.640
 Did you go down to the hairdressers and say short as you can mate?

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.120
 And watch out for the number twos they will explode

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:57.880
 On on the idea of James this whole thing that you have about the uh, the incorrect facts about children's books

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:03.480
 Here's one thing that I this feels like a very qi thing. So I'm sure a lot of people already know this

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.680
 I didn't though a lot of kids books when there's a whale

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.680
 Let's say a blue whale or any kind of well that's surfacing. There's always this beautiful spout of water that's coming out and there's

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.800
 That's yeah, they don't do that. What?

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.760
 I feel like I've seen that in real life

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.920
 You have oh what go on go on

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.240
 Ah the riddler

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.040
 Oh

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.080
 But his horse was called Thursday. Yeah. Yeah. Now the doctor was his mum

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:46.680
 If you see if you see any kind of thing where it's a whale with a huge like yeah the water coming out spout of water

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:53.800
 That is basically according to experts. That's that's what would happen if a whale is drowning

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:59.400
 Oh, they don't spout water out of their blowhole. That's their nostril. That's their breathing. They don't put water out through

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:06.200
 So when you see they do breathe when you see that the breathing is moist air that's just collected inside and that's what's coming out

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.880
 So if you ever see a whale where there's spouts of water is coming down it is drowning

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.200
 So what I've seen I've not seen the drowning whale. I've seen like uh, what a vapor whale

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.840
 Yeah, exactly. You're seeing water vapor. I hope and it gives that misty kind of look like a castle

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.480
 Like a castle. Exactly. But if you see a fountain, that's you go save that whale. Wow. Yeah

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:34.040
 So basically what it means is every drawing of a whale in a child's book. It's dying. It's a dying whale. That's yeah very upsetting

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:42.760
 It is time for fact number three and that is

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:49.320
 Andy my fact is that the false gecko, which has the latin name pseudo gecko

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.120
 is a gecko

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.240
 There are 10 species of false gecko. They're all geckos

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.880
 Not one of them is not a gecko

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.800
 And that is just a name. It's just a really really bad name. Yeah

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.320
 Couldn't find why they're called false geckos. I think maybe they were found and assumed to be something different. Yeah, yeah

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.040
 Yeah, but geckos are wonderful

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.160
 Um, there are geckos that don't have legs that look like snakes. I would have thought that would have been the false

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.280
 Gecko cool. Yeah. Yeah, there are there are six families of geckos with no legs

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.280
 They're all endemic to australia and yugini

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.520
 Right, brilliant. They've got the vestigial hind limbs apparently they look a tiny bit like flaps

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:34.200
 Yeah, the yeah that you can see these little bumps that come out but and that yeah means it's a lizard

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.560
 Yeah, no eyelids either. No, every gecko has no eye. There are 1500 species of gecko

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:47.800
 And all bar 43 have no eyelids. Yeah, and the you blepharidae, which literally means good eyelids in ancient greek

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.640
 They have eyelids

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:56.360
 But even they also lick their eyes like all the other geckos do to moisten them despite having eyelids, right? Oh amazing

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.480
 Have you heard of the fuck you lizard? No

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:05.000
 This is this is a lizard which it's it's not its official name. That's not the the scientific name

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.640
 But um, it was it was a lizard that uh, when americans were over in vietnam during the war

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.320
 They kept noticing that they just they just kept hearing a little voice going fuck you

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.920
 and

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.920
 They're like who what is going on and they'd be walking up. Fuck you and

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.240
 And so they all discovered that it's just this lizard that just makes a noise

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:29.160
 Fuck you and so it became known as yeah the fuck you lizards. Why do we not all have one of those?

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:33.880
 The noises I was surprised that gecko noises so that they bark

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.880
 Well, they're the only lizard that makes a noise geckos. Oh, are they? Yeah, that's that because if you think what noises a lizard make

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.040
 You wouldn't it was

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:46.120
 But that that sort of it sounds more like a sort of electric buzzer ring doesn't it sally

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.920
 Do you think a gecko could ever win the palm dog?

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.520
 No

00:32:52.520 --> 00:33:00.760
 We covered a few years ago

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.400
 I think we come the hero dog of the year and a few years ago it was won by a cat. That's true

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.600
 I presented hero dog of the year

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:18.200
 I don't know last year or the year before not this year, but anyway quite recently and this is going to sound a bit mean now

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.720
 But one of the finalist dogs

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:26.600
 Okay, this is just my problem. It's a finalist dog and it wasn't a chihuahua, but it was similar. It was very very small

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:35.560
 And um, his owner slash mommy, whatever you prefer to call it said that the dog had saved her partner's life by giving him

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.360
 Um, cpr

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:43.000
 That's she's got home and her husband is kissing the dog. That's what's happened there

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.880
 The dog was very

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880
 Very small very small

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.920
 I don't know why the dog was trained in cpr

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.720
 But anyway, it's all a bit of a problem for me having to

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.080
 Silence the questions in my brain

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.800
 That kept coming. Well, because there's so many stages. You've got to lay the head back a bit

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.560
 You just want to go you're shitting me, right? Yeah

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:11.640
 Was that the oh, it was one of the finalists didn't win. Didn't win. Well, who the fuck is a dog?

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.200
 It's amazing. There were these water dogs that did open heart surgery

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:24.200
 It's a dog with SpaceX in mission control. Hey animals have done some amazing things

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.840
 I don't want to take before we move on from geckos though. Did you know that in january last year

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:37.640
 German hands curt cubus was caught at christ church airport new zealand with 44 geckos concealed in his pants

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:45.000
 Okay, we're doing a small incision and uh, he's just walking through immigration

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.160
 Fuck you, fuck you

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.440
 There's a massive market in gecko smuggling really

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:02.840
 Because they're diurnal like most geckos are nocturnal right new zealand gecko is is diurnal very very pretty

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:08.440
 And they can go for about $22,000. So this is massive. Sorry diurnal. Oh, I've got is that the wrong word?

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.960
 Awaken the day you you're diurnal. Yeah, is that the right word? Yeah

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.360
 Don't question yourself sally question. Yeah, I'm sorry

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.800
 You'll get you tell me more about yet. He's my ignorance

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:29.160
 Questions dad. Do you want to know a cool? So diurnal awaken the day? Yeah nocturnal awaken night. Yeah for a puscular

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:35.800
 Dusky. Yeah, I know that dawn and dusk. What happened to the terminal bit of the word. Why did they lose that? I don't know

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.040
 latin, isn't it

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.560
 Speaking of latin. I was reading about alien the roman writer and

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.480
 He said

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.560
 He said that if a dead gecko lands in your wine, then it's fine

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:58.440
 But okay, if it lands in your olive oil, it will taste terrible and when you eat it, it will immediately give you lice

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.360
 Wow

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.360
 Right, they've got lots of symbolic

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:08.280
 There's lots of superstition around geckos and lizards, aren't there if you find a lizard tail in your left shoe

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.280
 It is very lucky. Do not take it out

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:17.080
 Is that real? That's a real one. That's a good current day one just the tail. Yeah, because obviously their tails come off and they can

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.520
 Regrow them. Yeah. Do you know starfish though can regrow?

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:25.240
 If you take its leg off it can regrow a whole starfish from the leg. That's nuts

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.160
 Like that's crazy. That's crazy though. What do they have? What do they have?

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:32.920
 They store all the nutrients in the leg until they can grow a mouse

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:38.360
 Does ever brain or intelligence or any kind of thing? I probably doesn't know it's a starfish is the truth

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.400
 But they you know they have neurons

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:49.320
 Yeah, can I tell you about a guy called ben bar? He was looking for a particular gecko called the capola gecko

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:57.800
 Which was spotted for the first time in 1968 and then once again in 2007 and that was it

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:04.040
 No specimen had ever been observed or collected apart from those two occasions. No one knew if it was still

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:08.200
 Existing, you know or alive or if it was a teleporting horse

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:15.400
 Exactly. Yeah, and he led three trips to search for it and basically the process of searching for this capola gecko is just a turn over rocks

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:22.040
 He spent two years turning over rocks leaving no stone on turn. He left no stone on turn

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.360
 He didn't even know for sure what it looked like

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.200
 because

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:34.280
 Not exactly not exactly and no scientist had ever held one in the hand and after two years and three expeditions

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.440
 He found one

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:41.320
 He said he was so excited. He said it was very similar to having a baby the euphoria

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.000
 And if he bought the movie rice

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.640
 It's just lovely. Yeah, and he found four he found four on the same expeditions. I imagine under the same rock, but still

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:57.160
 Yeah, imagine that determination to keep on it's like your um surface area measuring

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.560
 Yes, yeah, you do admire it. Yeah, I got addicted to watching conservation

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.160
 TV at one point like the presentations of all the

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.600
 Scientists because it's all the conservation scientists zoologists. I guess they're called

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.560
 because there was it was so funny like the

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.880
 Argentinian wolf man

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.640
 He had long long hair and it really appeared to be having an affair with the

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.440
 British cheetah lady

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:28.200
 And and there was there was this really adorable couple. I think from chili from chile

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:30.680
 Who had been looking for the onion wildcat?

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:35.880
 We spent two and they said we have not ever seen the onion wildcat. They spent five years and they showed all these

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.800
 photos of

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.600
 Land Rover in different places where they had looked for the onion wildcat

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:45.880
 And not seen it and they were so charming and like oh, well, it's been interesting don't even

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.000
 We think there is wildcat. We think this is a wildcat

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.640
 Pooh, pooh, whatever they said stool

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.320
 And then they went off and then this really arrogant tool american thin american guy came in from the

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.520
 Rare wildcat conservation society and he went

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.760
 wildcat

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.880
 Wildcat, and he just had 50 slides of wildcats

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:14.200
 Yeah, wait were you presenting him with an award? No, I just I was just depressed. I was in bed watching them on youtube

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.920
 You know I became very interested in the the women who run sloth sanctuaries

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.960
 Oh, yeah, because they seem to have absolutely no zoological training whatsoever

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.000
 I know nothing about sloth

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.120
 So it's this one woman who goes all the sloth orphanage in Costa Rica

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:33.000
 She's gone on a cruise with her husband and a baby sloth had fallen out of a tree

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.480
 And she'd known right then she needed to abandon her life in the States and started sloth orphanage

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.840
 Which she did and the problem she has she has to stop them having sex with each other

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.840
 She didn't have room for any more and people get

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.680
 Bringing them so they were kept strictly segregated and that's a slow penis

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.240
 That is a slow penis

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.240
 Yes

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.680
 That's a slow penis

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:59.000
 But one of them got manged and she just shaved that shaved it and she didn't know whether this is right and she shaved them

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.280
 And these days she she didn't shave a sloth. I'm sure and there was a phd student

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:09.960
 And I ended up watching the you know sub documentary series about them and getting absolutely obsessed was a phd student there

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.440
 called Becky who

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.920
 I think we've mentioned Becky on the podcast

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.200
 Like no, she hasn't been I we can get her. No, but I mean

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:25.160
 It was really it was really I think I feel she was northern. I feel she was northern. She was quite lethargic herself

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:30.680
 She said I couldn't decide what to do for my phd

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:36.600
 And I went to see my tutor and I said I can't decide between Jaguar's

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:44.200
 And sloths and he said what about sloths? So here I am and then the cheetah lady went past

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.560
 Have you seen the video where a sloth mistaken its own arm for a tree branch?

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.680
 And then can't do anything about it because it's so slow. It just falls

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.560
 from the tree

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:07.720
 They can be quite fast. They can't they there's the ones that can swim. They swim really fast. If you put them in a fast current

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:13.480
 I think they they leaves that they that's just drugs, isn't it for them that they only eat one

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.640
 I did think about writing a film about this sloth sanctuary, which is why and um

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.480
 Obviously you can get the sloths out of uh, Costa Rica

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:26.120
 Their agents will never get back to you. That's the problem with the sloth. You can't can't transport them

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:32.840
 I was reading about a woman who runs a hospital for hawaiian monk seals and I read about her. This is amazing. Yeah, amazing

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.520
 Yeah, so she um

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:38.520
 She runs this this monk seal place and she was out and she was you know

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.200
 Getting lunch or something like that and she gets a missed call and or like she gets a call on her phone

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.200
 She picks it up. No one's there. What's going on?

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.640
 Um happens nine times while she's out and she's called she's called like the phone people

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.520
 She's like is there like anything wrong with the line? It looks all fine

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:56.200
 Gets back to the hospital and she looks and on the phone is a little gecko

00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:01.000
 Just pressing its finger on the call button and it's calling her and that was it

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.440
 She was getting they've been calling loads of other people as well. Yeah, it called it made a

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.160
 The newspaper said a bazillion phones

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:12.120
 That was the official number. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, just a little gecko fee

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:17.960
 Can I do a quick quiz before we move on? Yes, we do need to move. Yes. Um, so this was a weirdly named animal pseudo gecko

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.800
 Is it a gecko? Is it not?

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.520
 Um, I've got some more like this. So the coffin fish

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.320
 Can the coffin fish cough?

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:26.200
 Ah

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.960
 There's a quiz or are you tricking us with pronunciation? Does it live? I'd say it does float in a coffin

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.240
 It does float. It's coffin fish like a coffin, but can it cough?

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:38.840
 Uh, I'll say no, it can't I don't think fish. Well, you're wrong. Oh

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.640
 Um, fish can expel air through their gills if things get stuck in there and we call that coughing

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.560
 That's a cough. Um, can the swallow tail butterfly swallow its own tail?

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:52.760
 Yes, no, no, obviously not

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.560
 But the only fact I know about it is it has an eye on its penis

00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:04.920
 So it can see where it's going crumbs. Really? That is not true. It is true. The swallow tail the swallow tail

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.360
 Butterfly, but oh butterfly. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's fine. It's a butterfly

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.720
 You've read the very hungry caterpillar. That's the final

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:16.360
 scene and finally does the bloody nose beetle often have a bloody nose

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.440
 I'll say yes, Andy. I've told you insects don't have noses

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:26.040
 Will you please listen? Oh, I fell right into it. No, it expels blood from its mouth

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.760
 That's why it's called that spells blood from its mouth

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.240
 Um, we're gonna need to move on to our final fact of the show. Can't bear it

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.040
 the show or

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.600
 Right with you. I feel yeah, I want to talk about the penguin who got a knighthood

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.240
 And I want to talk about the welsh corgi. He's got a phd

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:54.680
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is sally

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.120
 The band the super furry animals

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:05.160
 Do you see what I did there wore yeti costumes for a year and they said it really changed their personalities

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:10.840
 Becoming much harrier changed how they performed. What was the surface area?

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:18.680
 So I don't know much about the super furry animals. Well, you know, to be honest until yesterday

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:27.400
 But the welsh welsh wrong. No, they're worse. They're like the centerpiece of the cool kumri

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:33.560
 You know welsh resurgence with gorky's psychotic minky. I'm gonna say that wrong. That's correct, isn't it?

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:38.360
 You're a super fan. They want you. I am a super furry fan. I love gorky's. I got it monkey as well

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.720
 You're wearing a t-shirt. You're wearing a t-shirt right now. Yeah, they are very very cool. They did loads of like

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:50.200
 Yeah, they did loads of crazy stuff. They had lots of like costumes and all that kind of stuff and yeah, they bought a tank

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.160
 And drove it into the nationalist steadford

00:44:53.160 --> 00:45:01.560
 Wow, they bought it for 10 000 pounds from a one-eyed arm stealer with a limp and then they sold it on to don henley from the eagles

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.680
 Really?

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.560
 Arms dealing band circuit

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.920
 It wasn't the only um contact they had with arms dealers either they

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:15.160
 Because they sampled lots of sounds and they they got some real guns

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:23.320
 What's with the yeti thing? So the yeti thing they um, well, they'd experimented on the the album before they had some

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:30.520
 Snow monsters on stage in glastonbury during the northern lights song. They were members of mogwai. Do you know all of this?

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.560
 And unfortunately mogwai had just dropped an e before putting

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.280
 The very hot suits on

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.280
 And it became quite dangerous

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.080
 So they had to have people running around giving them um giving them water

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.480
 But they they were really into different kinds of creatures and then they

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.680
 They came across a sculptor called peter gray

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.640
 who made loads of sculptures out of hair

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:57.720
 And he suggested just making these these yeti costumes for them for a video for the video for golden retriever

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.000
 And they they thought this was brilliant and peter gray said i'll tell you where it needs to be you need to shoot this

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:09.240
 On a glacier in iceland next to a giant fire, which all the yetis are worshiping

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.240
 But they'd recently signed with sony who said that was an uninsurable concept

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:19.880
 So they did it in a studio in north london and it sort of looks like the yetis are playing inside a cardboard box

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.080
 Which is being sniffed at and then urinated on by a dog

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:26.200
 And but it's really really cool. So how did it change the

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.440
 Change the personalities. So they said they're none of them exhibitionists really they

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:36.120
 You know, they're quite political and love music very creative and you know, non-conformist and

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.520
 and the rest of it

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:44.360
 They released a welsh entirely welsh language lp and then only told it in america and australia

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.320
 It went into the top 20

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.320
 Yeah, but um, they said that it was like being transformed. They said none of them were exhibitionists in reality

00:46:53.320 --> 00:47:00.120
 It's an actual quote, but we were able to put these costumes on and become 70s rock monsters and it drove the audience nuts

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.960
 Um, so they they really it's kind of interesting the impact of hair hairiness or hairlessness

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:12.840
 That's incredible power. I think it's a costume. So my my son's fifth birthday was um last year late last year

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:19.640
 And I dressed up as mr. Potato Head and I honestly felt I saw that I saw that or make it

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:23.480
 I bought it from yeah, I bought it online. It's really cool. I saw it. It was it was

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.800
 Did it inflate itself? Was it one of those?

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:29.880
 It was like a brown big piece of fabric and then you could stick on the eyes and the ears and stuff like that

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:35.000
 Do you know what it was a hit andy despite you, uh, I'm saying I'm saying it was good

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.880
 We've lent it out to multiple parents ever since have you parties? Yeah, we haven't even got it at the moment

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:42.520
 But here's the thing the confidence it gave me because it was

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:50.520
 With the audience of five year olds who would have worshiped you anyway, I know I honestly like really

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.200
 Yeah, it really I felt like a superhero. It was amazing. That's interesting

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.560
 And I went up because it was school had just started my son was going to a new school

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:02.040
 We knew no one so I went up to all the parents. I would never do that went up to all of them. Hey, what's up?

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.240
 You went to school. Not the school gates. This is uh, no, no, this is the party. I missed a potato

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:09.960
 What I'm just trying to say is I don't think it's the hair necessarily

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:15.480
 I think you must know this as an actor when you have a different persona that suddenly comes over you

00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.840
 There's a weird confidence that makes you a bit unstoppable in a way. I was

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:26.360
 It can go both ways. I'm I'm thinking a very vivid memories of it going the other way. Okay. I mean, I suppose one

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.480
 Yes, I do I do know what you mean

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.520
 It's weird when you play a bride in a film people on set treat you as if you're getting married

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.160
 Even though they know you're actually we all know you're actually you get treated people open doors and they

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:41.880
 Smile at you and go or it's interesting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, there is a thing with autistic kids

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:48.680
 Where if you put them in a mask you can not all you can't generalize but lots of people have found that theater can really

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:55.960
 Help people who are very introverted to speak. Well, that's really interesting. Well, interestingly just on topic

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:02.120
 So what they were doing there? They were dressing as yetis. It's not being a furry, but that's a lot of people dress up

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:06.040
 As furries, right? I think we should say what a what a furry is for those

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:13.640
 I mean, yeah, so a furry is someone who feels more comfortable when they're wearing a costume that has been designed where it's an animal

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.120
 No, I think a furry is just someone who's a fan of the culture of you know

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:23.160
 Anthropomorphic animals and some of them do like to work. Exactly. Sorry. They're very keen

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.880
 They they feel like a bad press and over 60 percent of furries feel that they are bullied

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:33.800
 And get negative people have negative concepts. It's weird things only around 25 of all furries

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.040
 owner suit

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.720
 Yeah, yeah

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:43.240
 So I don't know how you classify yourself as a furry if you well, I guess you the you go to the cons and you you like

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.280
 Like what really in your home clothes? Yeah, yeah, I thought it was all about the suit

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.560
 So did I that we're wrong. Maybe you can't afford it but on the point of autism

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.480
 There was one of these cons that had an autism panel with furries

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:59.240
 And there was a lady there who said that um, it really helps if you're autistic

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.680
 So she said for three days. I am not autistic for three days

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.440
 I am a giant anthropomorphic version of the titanic

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.160
 And she feels it helps break the ice

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:20.200
 The first furry convention

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.200
 The first furry convention was almost all people in normal clothes

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.600
 Or in human clothes and you can still see videos of it online. It was in holiday in in california

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.000
 And there's basically only one person who dresses up in a costume

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.840
 It was a guy called robert hill who came dressed as a giant s and m deer called hilda the bambioid

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.720
 Crikey, I know

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.600
 Yeah

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.360
 And but it's amazing and they chose that place because it's so close to disneyland

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.080
 And they thought that everyone who's kind of into anthropomorphic animals would also be into disneyland

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.920
 And they went there and they you know does if you go online

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.120
 You can see like the history of all these conferences that they've had called conference

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:06.200
 And the first time they had a problem with the hotel was in 1994

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:11.880
 And the problem was the hotel too many too many all all the bathrooms got clogged drains. That was the problem

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.800
 That was the only problem. Yeah. Yeah, it was and breakfast buffet was no

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:20.840
 Apparently it was too big the hotel so they couldn't fill it up with just their people

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.840
 So there was a load of other people there as well

00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.480
 And you know, they weren't so understanding and there was lots of complaints

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:34.600
 And then a maid found a costume in a room by a person who had a costume of veteran of the psychotic wars

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.840
 And it was a unicorn who carried a big sort of cartoon cherry bomb

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.440
 So they they would have like this big sort of black bomb shape like you would have it

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:46.120
 With like the the wick coming out. Yeah, exactly. What is going on? They found this

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.560
 The maid found this costume in the room

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.080
 Right and they called the bomb squad because there was a bomb in the room

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:57.320
 But a cartoon bomb a cartoon bomb although. What's the best place to hide a bomb?

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.720
 I guess so

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.200
 The bomb squad didn't see it the right way and they find the hotel for making a prank call

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.400
 So when the bomb squad came and they saw it was just cherry bomb

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.000
 And there was a unicorn costume next to us

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.400
 They're like you're wasting our time and they find them and they never were allowed to go back to that hotel again

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.640
 Okay, I don't think anyone's favorite reason to be there

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:21.240
 What what about this guy's just he's just got a costume. It's not his fault. Yeah, I guess they I did

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:27.320
 It did amuse me that quote in the article. We'd probably both read where um, they said most furries

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:29.800
 It's not an erotic thing. It just gets too hot

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:39.240
 The other astonishing fact was that there's 10 000 people in the uk who live as dogs

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.600
 Uh

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:47.960
 That's what it said on google living as maybe not living as dogs maybe like

00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:51.080
 Dogs have a very broad spectrum of wanting to be

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.760
 Referred to you will dress up as dogs or have handlers and

00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:59.160
 That seemed to be a different kind of outfit. That seemed to be a kind of it's a lot

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:05.160
 I go for a kind of white unitard with little spots. Right feels like you might have read live on the aisle of dogs

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:10.760
 I go for a walk every day. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you know am I one of your 10 000?

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.640
 Just some people would spectrum of dogs though

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:18.360
 Like well, some dogs some dogs live in the house. Some dogs might live in a kennel. Some dogs are pampered house dogs

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:23.240
 There is a bdsm thing of pups being a pup. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you've got you've got you say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:29.640
 I did not know that I said, yeah, you had to cut of course over it rather than rather than to fully endorse

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:35.640
 But you know dogs divide into hound pooch and mutt. Don't they those are the three do they yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.720
 Those are the three broad categories of dog

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.840
 Broad category of dog that you can choose to dress up as

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:46.200
 But like if you see a dog normally you'll know within a second whether it's a hound a pooch or a mutt

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:51.480
 Unless it's a labrador in which case it's just a dog. The lab the labrador is the kind of classic dog

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.200
 Does no one else play hound pooch or mutt? No

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.880
 Straudnery can you get Andy an introduction to hero dog of the year?

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:03.640
 I think I could qualify I do I do just on dressing up as as animals

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:08.200
 um, so a lot of people who have to dress as animals a lot and not

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.280
 Sort of a relaxation for their work are zookeepers. There's a brilliant photo from 2004 of some there's a

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.280
 Japanese party of school children. They're all about I'd say four or five years old

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:23.480
 And they are being approached by a life-size rhinoceros which is a pantomime rhinoceros

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.800
 With two zookeepers in it front and back

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.000
 Which are basically charging the school children the teachers have to get the

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.880
 Children away from the rhino. It looks genuinely terrifying

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:34.360
 But is it how realistic is the costume?

00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.840
 It's pretty good. Is it if I was five?

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:41.000
 I would be very nervous. Yeah, well, I don't think so because I once did a

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.040
 I once did a kid's show. I mean a long time ago. I did a kid's show with superkins in fact

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:51.320
 and called Lucy and the dinosaurs and a friend of ours was playing a tyrannosaurus rex

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.560
 and uh

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:59.400
 Ben Moore, do you know Ben? Ben Moore was tyrannosaurus rex. He had a big costume and superkins very

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:03.880
 irresponsibly said to the kids. Hey, let's beat up tyrannosaurus rex

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.160
 And the stage was stormed with upwards of 55 year olds

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:15.880
 Just kicking the living day lights out ben more who looks, you know, like a early mr. Muscle

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.640
 Mr. Muscle's got muscly recently if you notice that but anyway, mr. Muscle used to be

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.280
 In the advert but anyway, and ben was just in the recovery position sort of crying shaking

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:32.920
 Well, I've been beaten up in a chicken costume by allen davis on qi. You have yeah. Yeah beaten up by who by allen davis

00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:38.680
 Oh, yeah, actually properly. I think he was taken out a lot of frustration from the previous 10 years

00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:46.040
 But yeah, I was in a costume and he decided as a joke. I think was this during the show? Are you guys in a hotel room?

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:54.200
 It was for a Christmas special of qi and the thing is because the the kind of slot that you look through is quite small

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.800
 And it's a big sort of costume the one that I had and I assume it was the same

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:02.920
 It very easily goes in the wrong place and suddenly you can't see anything. Yeah, and it's boiling hot

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:07.800
 You're sweating and everything and all you can do is go fetal. It's like literally the only thing

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.720
 and you did

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.280
 On set that were like while filming it was incredibly

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.080
 People have to talk you down

00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:17.800
 I once got I once got asked if I wanted to be an alien in a film

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.600
 The robin orita

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:30.040
 Yeah, I've got the look. No, it was uh, I was playing basically that I would have been playing the beast that sort of landed in a

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:36.360
 In a meteorite and then that's crushed and then but the guy my friend who was casting the film said you will just have to lie

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.000
 In a field in a rubber suit for a week

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.600
 And and I said no and I regret it now. I bet I wish I'd done it now. What was the movie? I don't know

00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:52.760
 So apparently the just going back to furries a second the conventions are a nightmare for exactly the reason

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.840
 That you're always saying about uh, that one's too hot. Yeah, everyone's too hot. They can't see anything

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.560
 So anyone who's in a costume is just bumping into each other

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:05.080
 You're the article says inevitably you're gonna smack a child in the head because your arms are just you know

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:10.520
 Wapping about you can't see them at the level that you need to sorry got a big tail. Maybe. Oh, yeah

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:17.320
 I was just trying to help I was trying to contribute to the was it was it going that badly?

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.960
 By the way, we are gonna have to wrap up

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.920
 And we've gone really far over the whole like um, yeah

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:32.040
 Only just started. Can I give you some furry vocab and see if you can guess what they mean?

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.360
 Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so what do you think is a furry tan?

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.400
 Furry tan f u r i t a n

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:44.360
 Oh a puritan as someone who is like a puritan. It's someone who only wears the costume

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.440
 It's a furry fan who is not interested in any sexual content

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.480
 That's pretty good

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:54.600
 Um to scratch. Do you know what to scratch means?

00:57:54.600 --> 00:58:00.200
 Oh, you can't scratch yourself through the fur. Oh, that's good. What do you do? I don't know

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.600
 It's not that but it is to do with scratching

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:08.120
 It's to scratch someone gently often as a friendly gesture or greeting. Just do a little don't do that

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:15.480
 Uh, can you guess what a fur pile is?

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.440
 Is that where they all is that like a fun?

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:23.400
 Yeah, bundle they all just yeah a carpet is like a carpet. You would say it has a shag pile. So is it

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:29.080
 Broadly similar. It's pretty much that it's a gathering of fully costume participants who roll around on the floor

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.320
 scratching each other

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:34.920
 Scritching got quite sexy all of a sudden

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:40.680
 The other thing is that Andy mentioned tails earlier and there could be an idea in the future that maybe we give

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:46.600
 Maybe give all old people tails for balance for balance. Oh, you're good at this game

00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.840
 Um, yeah, the idea is you get like these sort of mechanical tails

00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.240
 And you put them on old people and they can tell if an old person with with their consent and

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.520
 And support just stop them falling over is it?

00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:03.400
 Yeah, so the the tail can tell when they're about to fall over and it can move itself

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.320
 That so it'll give them more balance. It'll stop people from falling over. I think that's brilliant

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:09.320
 Turn over to Dr. Octopus. Yeah

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.680
 It's just completely terrifying. I think we should give them gecko feet instead

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:16.040
 Because you don't want to go ground that what are you doing up there?

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.400
 That's one of the reasons there's such a trade in geckos apparently is they're being

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.600
 Studied for the space program. Did you read that?

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:29.480
 Yeah, because they're feet because they're so feet can stick to anything except

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.520
 Teflon

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:39.160
 Oh, gecko feet will stick to absolutely anything at all except dry Teflon. It's all right if it's wet

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:44.280
 But isn't Teflon what we largely use in space though. Yeah, so it's a problem

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.280
 No

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:54.520
 Yeah, because the cling ability great use we've made you exactly as good as a gecko and get on to that space station

00:59:54.520 --> 01:00:04.440
 Yeah, sorry. Well, they did this experiment where they got a load of geckos and they

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:08.280
 stuck them on stuff and then they euthanized them all

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.640
 And then they put them back up and they stayed exactly the same stuck dead as alive. So

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.360
 Wow on that note

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:20.280
 Always good to go out on a big laugh

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:28.760
