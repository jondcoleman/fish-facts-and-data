00:01:44,00:01:50,comedy actor and genius that is Sally Phillips. We did this show for the
00:01:50,00:01:56,Fantastic Beasts exhibition at the British library. They wanted us to do a show all about animals and
00:01:56,00:02:02,"I'll be honest. We stretched that a fair bit from time to time, but we had so much fun"
00:02:02,00:02:08,I really hope you enjoy this show. I'm sure you will and I guess what else is there to say apart from on with a podcast
00:02:08,00:02:32,Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from the British library
00:02:37,00:02:39,My name is Dan Shriver
00:02:39,00:02:44,I am sitting here with James Harkin Andrew Hunter Murray and Sally Phillips and once again
00:02:44,00:02:46,We yes and once again
00:02:46,00:02:52,We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order here
00:02:52,00:02:56,We go starting with fact number one and that is my fact
00:02:56,00:03:01,My fact this week is that the British library's fantastic beasts collection
00:03:01,00:03:06,Originally included accounts of a nine-foot dragon terrorizing Essex
00:03:07,00:03:12,And an army of horses that teleported to rural Wales
00:03:12,00:03:21,"And it was donated by the founder of the British Museum, Sir Han Sloan. Wow. So he was a nutcase"
00:03:21,00:03:26,So here's the thing right he's a Han Sloan if you don't know who he is
00:03:26,00:03:29,He was one of the founders of the British Museum an incredible guy
00:03:29,00:03:34,He was a doctor and at the top of being a doctor. He was obsessed with collecting he collected everything
00:03:34,00:03:39,And that's what became the basis of the British Museum's collection. He was a hoarder. He was a hoarder. Yeah
00:03:39,00:03:45,I mean he was a serious hoarder. He had he had like a separate apartment to hoard in because it got too much in his own
00:03:45,00:03:51,"Yeah, and how did he die? Did it all collapse on him exactly a museum pillar took him out?"
00:03:51,00:03:56,"No, he he was quite old. I think when he died. I think he was in his 90s 93"
00:03:56,00:04:01,Is this the bringer of chocolate the man? I know is the bringer of the hot chocolate
00:04:01,00:04:03,Controversial
00:04:03,00:04:07,He was and I think I think it's been claimed that
00:04:07,00:04:13,"That was something he nicked. It was ready in place. Yeah, I think he was in Jamaica, maybe"
00:04:13,00:04:20,"Yeah, okay, and then it was a practice they sort of a grated cocoa with milk and cinnamon and stuff"
00:04:20,00:04:22,But I think sorry to shit on him in his own home
00:04:22,00:04:28,"Teleporting horses better anyway, it's way better, isn't it? Yeah"
00:04:28,00:04:33,So this is what I was about to say was is all the collections that got handed over after he passed away in his will to be the
00:04:33,00:04:35,Basis of the British Museum's collection
00:04:35,00:04:39,Eventually became the British Library's collection as well and there was lots of papers
00:04:39,00:04:44,There's lots of physical objects and a part of it was a collection of things called strange news
00:04:44,00:04:52,He was obsessed with strange news stories that would come out from France and Scotland and Wales of odd things that you know like
00:04:52,00:04:55,Well like dragons
00:04:55,00:05:01,Appearing horses and it was the artifact version of no such thing as a fish. Yes. Well. He's the yeah
00:05:01,00:05:03,He's the old me I guess
00:05:03,00:05:06,You have fewer links to the slave trade we should say dad
00:05:06,00:05:15,"Yeah, so this this big dragon that arrived in Essex"
00:05:15,00:05:22,"It was in a place called Hennem, which is just north of Stanstead. It's about two miles north of Stanstead"
00:05:22,00:05:29,And so what I like to imagine is actually there was like a time-travel portal that came in and it was actually an easy jet flight
00:05:29,00:05:37,Maybe I don't know but there's loads of other things that he he claimed and the thing is he went out to collect things from around the
00:05:37,00:05:43,World but the reason he did that is because he thought it would help people to better understand God's design of the world and
00:05:43,00:05:47,So when he was finding this strange news a lot of things he didn't believe in but there were some things that he did
00:05:47,00:05:50,So he found a story from France where fist-sized
00:05:50,00:05:56,Hailstones came down and kind of battered everything and hurt a lot of people and killed a lot of crops
00:05:56,00:05:59,But the only thing that was saved was a Protestant church
00:05:59,00:06:04,"Yeah, I thought that this was proof that you know God was saving them. Yeah, this this one's amazing"
00:06:04,00:06:06,There was a story this is from Scotland
00:06:06,00:06:12,There was a guy who died and he was in his home. They would laid him to in state is in state. What is it when you lay someone?
00:06:12,00:06:17,"Sure. Yeah, sure. So he's laid in the house. He's in a coffin for people to come and see like an open coffin like a way"
00:06:17,00:06:22,"Yeah, yeah, it's state is pretty fancy. It's pretty Queen ish, isn't it? Yeah"
00:06:22,00:06:24,"Yeah, you just said this guy was this"
00:06:24,00:06:29,How long was the queue is what?
00:06:29,00:06:31,It was just a guy and
00:06:31,00:06:37,It was a town of Dumfries. Okay. Yeah. So apparently
00:06:37,00:06:40,People went to visit him and then it came the time where okay
00:06:40,00:06:43,Let's bury him now and they tried to lift him and no one could lift him
00:06:43,00:06:49,He was really heavy. They just they tried everything so they brought cattle in and they tied ropes around him and tried to pull him
00:06:49,00:06:56,And he didn't move and then the house burnt down and he remained as the only thing that was still there
00:06:56,00:07:01,He's like Arthur's sword in the stone. He's he's the guy in the house the corpse in the house
00:07:01,00:07:05,"Sorry, so he he collected this story if you didn't collect the guy"
00:07:05,00:07:09,"No, you can't collect the guy is the point of the story"
00:07:09,00:07:17,So he had straight with these kept in diary form or like what kind of evidence were they these were like weird pamphlets
00:07:17,00:07:20,That used to get produced and so people would go and buy them on the street
00:07:20,00:07:26,"And it would just say strange news from Scotland. So he's 1660s. Yeah. Yes. He was really early. Oh, yeah"
00:07:26,00:07:30,"Yeah, yeah, we should we should say that I know we don't we don't need to say none of the stuff is true that we're"
00:07:30,00:07:34,described as in we keep we keep saying apparently
00:07:36,00:07:39,"Describing things which people thought it was some people thought it was. Yeah, that's true"
00:07:39,00:07:47,I'm just saying if in like 400 years they're discussing a copy of the Daily Star and saying apparently there was a there is an infinitely heavy man
00:07:47,00:07:51,I think I remember that headline
00:07:51,00:07:57,I did I actually weirdly I found a star headline in the course of because I was researching animals which are not proven to exist
00:07:57,00:08:03,"Yes, and there was a headline in the Daily Star in 2008 Loch Ness monster dies aged three million"
00:08:04,00:08:06,Oh
00:08:06,00:08:16,"Global warming very sad. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting the whole thing of fictional fictional creatures cryptids"
00:08:16,00:08:25,I did Italian Dante. There were a lot of fictional creatures the phoenixes in in Dante at only incense and cardamom pods
00:08:25,00:08:30,"In heaven cardamom pods. What's that? It's that bit of a curry that you see and you're like, oh"
00:08:30,00:08:36,"They've left it in. Oh, wow. No, it's the thing in the in the in the jazz version of a cinnamon bun, right?"
00:08:36,00:08:42,"Yeah, there were three types of phoenixes three types of yeti's"
00:08:42,00:08:47,"Yeah, you found a yeti that i've never heard of which is what was it called? It was yeah, there's three types"
00:08:47,00:08:52,The nyelmo which is black has black fur and is the largest in the fetus
00:08:52,00:08:58,Which is 15 foot tall the tuti which is eight feet tall and lives eight thousand to ten thousand feet above sea level
00:08:58,00:09:00,And the rangshin bombo
00:09:00,00:09:05,Which is only three to five feet tall and I think must have been just the mistaken
00:09:05,00:09:12,"It's an orangutan or some kind of a boon. Yeah, the first one sounds like a gorilla rangshin bombo. Yeah, it does it does a bit"
00:09:12,00:09:16,"Yeah, yeah, the first one you described because it's black fur quite tall"
00:09:16,00:09:23,"Yeah, it's interesting the the abominable snowman. I mean they had some fur didn't they they kept they various times over history"
00:09:23,00:09:28,"They would analyze the dna of yeah, and occasionally find it to be a horse or yeah or"
00:09:28,00:09:33,"Or a bear or a they now think it is a kind of bear hybrid thing, don't they?"
00:09:33,00:09:40,"How do they I think say that's interesting. Yeah. Also, um, I I've studied this a lot actually Sally"
00:09:40,00:09:44,"And um, I'm trying to find the thing you haven't studied a lot"
00:09:44,00:09:47,I that's everything else
00:09:47,00:09:51,I can't believe we've hit on the one thing I've studied
00:09:51,00:09:56,"This is the dream come true, but um brine blessed who is a very um yeti"
00:09:57,00:09:59,It is
00:09:59,00:10:04,That's what he would say he would go for the yeti looking for the yeti and then the locals that he would meet in the himalayas would say
00:10:04,00:10:07,"Oh, it's a yeti and he realized that all the stories are him"
00:10:07,00:10:15,I read about uh quite recently in Nepal they had like these um
00:10:15,00:10:19,I think they were models or badges or some kind of publicity of the of the yeti
00:10:19,00:10:23,And they sent them out and then all the locals were like well the yeti looks nothing like that
00:10:23,00:10:27,What are you doing because you didn't have any fur on and the guy who did it said well
00:10:27,00:10:33,No one knows what it looks like anyway. So that's one thing and number two fur is actually really difficult to draw
00:10:33,00:10:39,"So king kong for example, yeah, not a cryptid. I know a fictional"
00:10:39,00:10:46,"Character character. Yeah a crowbar is what you know, we're talking about large hairy. Okay. Yeah"
00:10:46,00:10:53,"Fellas and king kong is is all of these three things. Um, but king kong was originally based on a lizard"
00:10:53,00:10:58,"Was it? Oh godzilla. No, I think godzilla's a bit later king kong was based on the komodo dragon"
00:10:58,00:11:04,"Really? Yeah, there was a so the filmmaker behind king kong was uh, maryon maryon c cooper"
00:11:04,00:11:07,And he was friends with an explorer called william burton who
00:11:07,00:11:14,Had had got permission to collect some komodo dragons from the dutch east indies as they were then now indonesia and um until
00:11:14,00:11:19,1910 nobody nobody from the west had seen a komodo dragon. So they were cryptids
00:11:19,00:11:25,They weren't believed in they had not been cited spotted hunted brought back or no specimens
00:11:25,00:11:31,"And uh, one was brought back by william burton to the usa and in the course of the expedition his wife was nearly"
00:11:31,00:11:37,"Eaton by eaten by a komodo dragon. What really and and yeah, she she was she'd finished sort of setting a"
00:11:37,00:11:41,"You know a photography, you know, like a photo trap up or something for it"
00:11:41,00:11:44,And was going back and came face to face with one and you know had a lucky escape
00:11:45,00:11:52,And so that image of this kind of glamorous woman faced with a terrifying beast when william burton brought back the
00:11:52,00:11:57,sample that he got of a komodo dragon maryon c cooper saw it and thought one of it was a monkey and
00:11:57,00:12:04,And I mean because gorillas were also new in the usa at the time. How old was how old was his wife?
00:12:04,00:12:09,Because there is a thing when you sort of hit menopause your your maternal instinct goes really
00:12:10,00:12:13,Into overdrive and you start wanting to mother beautiful
00:12:13,00:12:17,"Primates and yeah, lots of women get into trouble that way"
00:12:17,00:12:23,Animals and and show business as a marriage made in hell
00:12:23,00:12:27,We had an animal agent who came on to smack the pony quite a lot
00:12:27,00:12:31,Jackie she had quite a lot of represented a lot of animals that would come occasionally with need
00:12:31,00:12:35,"And she had a vietnamese potbellied pig on her business card. I went. Oh, he's so cute"
00:12:35,00:12:38,You know perimenopause starting so cute
00:12:39,00:12:42,"And um, do you still have him sure? No, he won't bring in any work. So we hurt him"
00:12:42,00:12:46,Wow
00:12:46,00:12:51,I hope she said that in ear shots of all the other animals
00:12:51,00:12:53,You better do your job
00:12:53,00:12:56,"Yeah, it was terrible"
00:12:56,00:13:00,Apparently the hardest animals to train are owls. They just don't get it apparently
00:13:00,00:13:05,"So it's really interesting that you think that an owl would be smart. Yeah, no dumb"
00:13:05,00:13:11,I cannot repeat ravens are the dogs of the of the sky penguins are aggressive a bit of a nightmare
00:13:11,00:13:14,And they have explosive poo. Do you know this?
00:13:14,00:13:17,Penguins who explodes
00:13:17,00:13:24,"So very difficult to well, no, no, no, no as you mean the poo shoots out. It doesn't they don't lay it and then"
00:13:24,00:13:29,Imagine if dogs did that
00:13:29,00:13:34,"Yeah, every time you've been walking through the park it'll be like walking through world war one, wouldn't it?"
00:13:34,00:13:37,Be like the end of black. Don't take your foot off it. Don't take your foot off it
00:13:37,00:13:45,"Yeah, they have lots of animals obviously playing each part the um, the kestrel in cares was played"
00:13:45,00:13:50,Do you know this you prudy he played by three different kestrels called freeman hardy and willis after
00:13:50,00:13:57,"After the shoe shop, that's amazing. Yeah, I presented the palm dog award for best. Hey my"
00:13:57,00:14:04,The palm dog palm dog. There is you know in can the can film festival. Yeah. Yeah some british journalist
00:14:04,00:14:11,22 years ago now set up the palm dog rather than the palm door for the best canine performance
00:14:11,00:14:13,And I was lucky enough
00:14:13,00:14:19,To present the award with runny and kona to quentin tarantino on behalf of
00:14:19,00:14:25,"The dog in once upon a time in hollywood. Oh, it's played by three three dogs two"
00:14:25,00:14:28,male dogs and
00:14:31,00:14:33,So the dogs don't get to come to the ceremony or
00:14:33,00:14:35,"Well, they didn't the the dog didn't come to the no"
00:14:35,00:14:42,"They found a similar breed and they brought that dog in dog didn't know what was happening. Oh god. They ate the first dog, didn't they?"
00:14:42,00:14:45,Quentin urinated on the carpet
00:14:45,00:14:51,"It was it was fine. But yeah, yeah, so you have you have several and they use different animals"
00:14:51,00:14:55,So he was saying quent my quentin
00:14:55,00:14:58,quent quenti quent
00:14:59,00:15:01,tar
00:15:01,00:15:06,"My brother tried to license his image to be on lunchboxes. I don't know why but anyway, well hang on"
00:15:06,00:15:11,But he said they have three different dogs one girl and two boys
00:15:11,00:15:14,Then on the day he thought the two male dogs were better
00:15:14,00:15:19,But then turned out the female dog was actually when he got into the edit he realized she was a much better actress
00:15:19,00:15:21,"Sorry, can we get back to your brother? Yeah tried to"
00:15:21,00:15:28,Tried to license quentin tarantino's image famously a man who makes 18 certificate films
00:15:29,00:15:31,"Yes, for lunchboxes"
00:15:31,00:15:38,What was he thinking the market? I I didn't ask it was only like a long time after he told me that that I realized that that was mad
00:15:38,00:15:46,Tarantino's up there. He's accepting an award as a dog that image of him like the shaguevara tarantino picture
00:15:46,00:15:51,"I think they were putting that on stuff. Oh, okay. Oh, is that a famous picture the shaguevara tarantino?"
00:15:51,00:15:55,Do you know the one I mean that because I don't you okay? So I feel like there's a very sort of known
00:15:56,00:15:59,I don't know if you remember Dan knows everything about yeti's and nothing about anything else
00:15:59,00:16:06,Do you know just just going back to mythological creatures a second the um speaking of penguins exploding
00:16:06,00:16:10,Um poo out their buns. There's a mythological creature called smooth. By the way smooth. Thank you
00:16:10,00:16:13,There's a thing called the bonacan
00:16:13,00:16:14,You heard of the bonacan?
00:16:14,00:16:18,Bonacan's like a it's it's like this beast which is like a half horse
00:16:18,00:16:23,It's got curved horns and the way that it would if it was being hunted by humans
00:16:23,00:16:28,"The way that it would deter the humans is to fire poisonous shit out of its bum, right?"
00:16:28,00:16:33,But it can it can make a distance and this is what's most impressive about this thing that doesn't exist
00:16:33,00:16:37,Is it can shoot at three acres
00:16:37,00:16:47,That's um a unit of area area not distance. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So does he cover the entire like one and a half football pictures?
00:16:47,00:16:54,"I think it does cover three. I've also read about the bonacan. Interestingly, brian blessed told me he could do that"
00:16:54,00:16:57,He could do that when he was on Everest four acres. Yeah
00:16:57,00:17:01,He said when he said he had a bout of diarrhea on Everest and the poo
00:17:01,00:17:07,Shot out and it he said his thing he often says is don't camp under the french
00:17:07,00:17:12,Because the fuckers will shit on you. That's that's his like that's like a t-shirt quote from him
00:17:12,00:17:14,"But again, who's buying these?"
00:17:14,00:17:18,"Obscene t-shirts and lunchboxes. Yeah, I need to meet your brother actually"
00:17:18,00:17:25,"Um, so anyway the bonacan the bonacan is a is a terrifying creature with three acre"
00:17:25,00:17:30,Poisonous poo shoots and everyone that's depicted trying to hunt it all faces the other way
00:17:30,00:17:33,Basically facing as as ready to run
00:17:33,00:17:39,"Because they want to escape the fire. Poisonous poo. Yeah, it's like fighting Medusa. Have you come across?"
00:17:39,00:17:43,I'm sure you have the fictitious creatures of lumberjack culture
00:17:44,00:17:48,"No, it sounds amazing. No guys settle in"
00:17:48,00:17:57,There are a number of books called things like fearsome critters about fictional creatures in lumberjack law
00:17:57,00:18:00,And they're things like
00:18:00,00:18:06,"Well, my favorite one. Let me take my favorite one. There's a splinter cat. It's a regular cat, but with no logic"
00:18:06,00:18:13,Who's an indiscriminate destroyer of hollow trees? Which was their explanation for um
00:18:14,00:18:20,"For lightning strikes, but there is a it was one that was uh, the lumberjack hunter"
00:18:20,00:18:26,"That hides behind trees so you can't see it, but um, can only be deterred by loads of alcohol"
00:18:26,00:18:30,The lumberjacks must be drunk
00:18:30,00:18:37,To keep safe. That's good. That's good logic. We're gonna have to move on. We've we've run way over
00:18:37,00:18:40,"Oh, no, I was reading some stuff by alien"
00:18:41,00:18:43,The roman writer and orator
00:18:43,00:18:49,What alien alien alien i'm gonna call him alien alien alien alien
00:18:49,00:18:55,And he's got loads of amazing creatures. He has the buprestis which he believed existed
00:18:55,00:19:00,Which is a creature which if swallowed by a cow causes the cow to swell and burst
00:19:00,00:19:03,He had a smooth lobster
00:19:03,00:19:09,Where if you saw it on the beach and then you marked where it was and you drove it to anywhere in the world
00:19:09,00:19:12,When you got back to where it was it would be back there. Whoa
00:19:12,00:19:15,He sure wasn't teleporting
00:19:15,00:19:21,And he said also that um if a snake is eating something that's a little bit too big for it to swallow
00:19:21,00:19:23,And it kind of gets it into the mouth and can't go any further
00:19:23,00:19:30,It'll stand straight on its tail and jiggle itself. So the food will go down into his stomach
00:19:30,00:19:36,"Have you seen those videos of people hunting anacondas? No, no, they put a"
00:19:37,00:19:43,"Leather trouser on and stick their entire leg into the snake's hole. Yeah, they get swallowed"
00:19:43,00:19:47,Why would you do that? And then they have a low to catch a snake to I guess eat it
00:19:47,00:19:49,You're the worm for fishing
00:19:49,00:19:52,And then they put they haul you out
00:19:52,00:19:57,And then and then kill the snake and the other thing is so that the snake doesn't digest
00:19:57,00:20:01,So all the juices doesn't digest the meat and maybe the teeth can't go through it or something
00:20:01,00:20:05,"Yeah, I think that is just there was a guy. Did you see the guy? I I think this is right"
00:20:05,00:20:11,"He was attempting to be swallowed by a snake as well. Um, and it was going to be like a world record"
00:20:11,00:20:13,But what's the what?
00:20:13,00:20:17,"I think I'm right in saying this again. This don't even accept, you know, heaviest cat anymore"
00:20:17,00:20:25,"I think unfortunately, no, they found an infinitely heavy one in Dumfries today"
00:20:25,00:20:32,But this guy who this was big it was bigger set up. It was like with a like a nat geo kind of thing. Um
00:20:32,00:20:36,The snake started swallowing on the wrong end. So he went head first
00:20:36,00:20:42,And he wasn't ready for it. And so they had to pull him out and cancel. Did you not did you not have his big leather hat?
00:20:42,00:20:47,"They do it. I mean they catch fish like that sometimes in America, don't they it's catfish"
00:20:47,00:20:53,And they'll get the cat to grab hold of their fist and then when it's bitten they pull it out. It's called catfisting
00:20:53,00:20:58,Is it this yeah
00:20:58,00:21:00,I'd rather be catfished
00:21:01,00:21:09,It is time for fact number two and that is
00:21:09,00:21:16,James. Okay. My fact this week is that in real life the very hungry caterpillar would have gone around headbutting his mates
00:21:16,00:21:22,"So these days, you know, all of these children's books are getting rewritten aren't they like"
00:21:22,00:21:30,Charlie of the chocolate factory and whatever and I'm calling for the very hungry caterpillar to be rewritten to be more factually accurate
00:21:30,00:21:34,"Um, because according to the people at florida atlantic university"
00:21:34,00:21:38,Whenever caterpillars get really really hungry and they don't have enough food
00:21:38,00:21:43,They'll go around looking for other caterpillars and then they'll attack them knock them off where they're eating
00:21:43,00:21:49,"And then they'll go in and eat their leaf. No way. Yeah, and so that's what eric carl really should have been writing about"
00:21:49,00:21:55,"It's a tougher. Yeah, they don't eat ice cream. They don't eat lollipops. They don't eat salami"
00:21:56,00:22:02,They tend to only eat one kind of leaf any caterpillar whatever caterpillar you get. This is going to sell big jokes
00:22:02,00:22:09,"On monday, you got him one fight and he ate one of the same kind of leaf that he's going to eat for the rest of the week"
00:22:09,00:22:15,They do occasionally they occasionally get a species which will eat fruit
00:22:15,00:22:17,So you might get one that would eat an apple
00:22:17,00:22:22,But it would only eat apple and it would only eat the same apple and it would live inside the apple
00:22:22,00:22:25,It was eating until it was ready. I actually really enjoy that book
00:22:26,00:22:31,My partner ian pointed out on the way here that eric carl was conscripted
00:22:31,00:22:38,"Into yeah, he fought on the siegfried line. I think it was so yeah, he was an american born"
00:22:38,00:22:43,"Yeah, age 15 who's conscripted and he had to dig the trenches"
00:22:43,00:22:47,In my head. That's a bit like a caterpillar to cat was dig
00:22:47,00:22:50,That's what gave him the idea
00:22:50,00:22:55,He was born in Germany the family moved to america really soon or he was he his early years were in america
00:22:55,00:22:58,Certainly then the family moved back to germany in 1935
00:22:58,00:23:04,Right when he was about six years old. So at the end of the war he was conscripted to dig trenches and he was fired at
00:23:04,00:23:10,"He was 15 as well. 15 years old. Yeah, and then and then after the war obviously had a horrible time"
00:23:10,00:23:14,His father was in a prison camp and and had an awful time
00:23:14,00:23:18,Then the family moved he certainly moved back to america
00:23:18,00:23:21,And then he was conscripted a second time
00:23:21,00:23:28,To go to to join the u.s. Army and to go back to germany again where he was involved in filling in the holes that he dug
00:23:28,00:23:32,I actually feel quite bad that i'm shitting on his buck now
00:23:32,00:23:37,"Well, I mean, is it any wonder that the follow-up book was called the very grumpy lady bird"
00:23:37,00:23:45,And there's something called polar bear. What do you hear? I think he read a lot. What do you see?
00:23:45,00:23:48,"What do you hear? Yeah, because yes, it's a great artist and yeah"
00:23:49,00:23:54,Also an amazing scheme off the back of this book because there was an eric carl museum that you can go to in america
00:23:54,00:23:56,And in the museum
00:23:56,00:24:01,"Everything everything has a hole in it. Oh, sorry. Well, no, not everything's edible. That would be amazing"
00:24:01,00:24:06,"Yeah, no every so like if you go to the canteen you buy a cookie and the cookie has a massive hole in it"
00:24:06,00:24:07,Like brilliant
00:24:07,00:24:14,So this guy is saving so much money in his like there was I remember reading that the new york times when they removed the
00:24:14,00:24:17,Dot at the end of new york times that little on the headline
00:24:18,00:24:22,They were saving six hundred dollars a year that little bit of ink cost them so much
00:24:22,00:24:27,Imagine how much that bit of cookie that's missing is what do they do with those little bits of cookie though?
00:24:27,00:24:30,Do they they smell they sell they sell their cookies. Yeah
00:24:30,00:24:35,But imagine how you could ruin that museum by having eric carl's experience of warfare
00:24:35,00:24:41,"Like a room. That's yeah, that's not the good way to go in. Yeah trench digging and trench room"
00:24:41,00:24:45,"Yeah, so I went on to his website because there is another problem in this book"
00:24:47,00:24:51,That is that to us the end the caterpillar goes into a cocoon
00:24:51,00:24:55,And it becomes a butterfly but butterflies don't go into cocoons
00:24:55,00:25:02,"Butterflies go into chrysalises or caterpillars caterpillars butterflies don't go into anything. No, they come from chrysalises. Yeah"
00:25:02,00:25:07,"Um, and so some kids have written into him and said well, why have you got a cocoon in your book?"
00:25:07,00:25:11,"And he replied saying well, there is a rare genus"
00:25:11,00:25:15,"That lives in Siberia, North Korea and the northern islands of japan"
00:25:16,00:25:19,Um called panacean which does pupate in a cocoon
00:25:19,00:25:23,So he's he was hugely relieved when he found out
00:25:23,00:25:28,I said that doesn't work the difference. Sorry. What's the difference between a christmas and a cocoon?
00:25:28,00:25:30,So a cocoon is made out of silk
00:25:30,00:25:32,"Uh, and the chrysalis isn't"
00:25:32,00:25:35,chrysalis is made out of nylon
00:25:35,00:25:44,"But you get quite a lot of moths that make cocoons. Okay, uh another insects, but uh butterflies don't uh, but he did then say actually"
00:25:44,00:25:49,You know caterpillars don't eat lollipops either. This was just a this was it's a special caterpillar
00:25:49,00:25:53,"It's allowed to do what it wants. Yeah, all right. It's a children's book grow up"
00:25:53,00:25:58,And then another kid wrote in saying caterpillars don't have noses
00:25:58,00:26:02,Oh
00:26:02,00:26:08,"And he said I know it hasn't nose on its face, but this feature grew out of my imagination"
00:26:09,00:26:16,"Don't have shoes either caterpillars. I wrote an anecdote about him, which I I'm only bringing it up because I didn't understand it"
00:26:16,00:26:21,"So I'm hoping that maybe you guys will um, so he said that his"
00:26:21,00:26:26,He wrote all these books as you were saying where it was sort of like the next kind of so the very busy spider
00:26:26,00:26:34,"The very quiet cricket and in an interview he says that um, he found himself in the changing rooms after swimming"
00:26:34,00:26:40,And a satirical young fan suggested a book entitled the very slow penis
00:26:40,00:26:46,To the author's great amusement and I can't work out what's funny about that
00:26:46,00:26:50,What's a slow penis ask your wife
00:26:50,00:26:54,Does it also have a hole going through it this book?
00:26:54,00:26:59,Just can't work out where the slow penis is
00:26:59,00:27:02,"Yeah, anyway, there's a slow loris"
00:27:02,00:27:04,Oh
00:27:04,00:27:11,Well you've you've got this all done thank you had no such thing on twitter if you want to
00:27:11,00:27:14,Let us know
00:27:14,00:27:21,He's got their hairs right anyway butterflies and moths. I discovered have nearly 10 billion hairs on them
00:27:21,00:27:24,10 billion because these scientists have spent over a decade
00:27:24,00:27:27,Studying the surface area of animals
00:27:28,00:27:36,"The surface area of animals, I mean that's such a funny thing. I think let's say a cat surface area is actually like a ping-pong table"
00:27:36,00:27:42,When you cover your ping-pong table in cat the ball doesn't bounce nearly as well
00:27:42,00:27:47,The author has the surface area of a professional hockey rink
00:27:47,00:27:50,Because they've got because they've got
00:27:50,00:27:57,And a honeybee has the same number of hairs as a squirrel
00:27:58,00:28:00,Wow
00:28:00,00:28:05,"Yeah, the georgie institute of technology just astonishing"
00:28:05,00:28:11,"That's amazing. Yeah, they were running calculations to find the true surface area of animals"
00:28:11,00:28:15,Because they were trying to work out ways of keeping things clean
00:28:15,00:28:19,So dogs obviously shake or every animal has a different way of keeping clean
00:28:19,00:28:23,And sometimes the fur helps them to stay clean. Sometimes it doesn't it's where you must never shave a dog
00:28:23,00:28:27,I'm sure you haven't but don't shave a dog even a really furry one. It's not good for it
00:28:27,00:28:30,I used to have a challenge to stop it. They don't get a number one
00:28:30,00:28:35,"Yeah, you shouldn't shave your chow chow. Do you have a number one? You shouldn't you shouldn't do that. That's bad"
00:28:35,00:28:40,"That's what do this. Well, you told the chow chow needs to go and have a number one"
00:28:40,00:28:45,Did you go down to the hairdressers and say short as you can mate?
00:28:45,00:28:50,And watch out for the number twos they will explode
00:28:50,00:28:57,"On on the idea of James this whole thing that you have about the uh, the incorrect facts about children's books"
00:28:58,00:29:03,Here's one thing that I this feels like a very qi thing. So I'm sure a lot of people already know this
00:29:03,00:29:06,I didn't though a lot of kids books when there's a whale
00:29:06,00:29:12,Let's say a blue whale or any kind of well that's surfacing. There's always this beautiful spout of water that's coming out and there's
00:29:12,00:29:15,"That's yeah, they don't do that. What?"
00:29:15,00:29:18,I feel like I've seen that in real life
00:29:18,00:29:22,You have oh what go on go on
00:29:22,00:29:27,Ah the riddler
00:29:28,00:29:30,Oh
00:29:30,00:29:35,But his horse was called Thursday. Yeah. Yeah. Now the doctor was his mum
00:29:35,00:29:46,If you see if you see any kind of thing where it's a whale with a huge like yeah the water coming out spout of water
00:29:46,00:29:53,That is basically according to experts. That's that's what would happen if a whale is drowning
00:29:53,00:29:59,"Oh, they don't spout water out of their blowhole. That's their nostril. That's their breathing. They don't put water out through"
00:29:59,00:30:06,So when you see they do breathe when you see that the breathing is moist air that's just collected inside and that's what's coming out
00:30:06,00:30:09,So if you ever see a whale where there's spouts of water is coming down it is drowning
00:30:09,00:30:14,"So what I've seen I've not seen the drowning whale. I've seen like uh, what a vapor whale"
00:30:14,00:30:18,"Yeah, exactly. You're seeing water vapor. I hope and it gives that misty kind of look like a castle"
00:30:19,00:30:25,"Like a castle. Exactly. But if you see a fountain, that's you go save that whale. Wow. Yeah"
00:30:25,00:30:34,So basically what it means is every drawing of a whale in a child's book. It's dying. It's a dying whale. That's yeah very upsetting
00:30:34,00:30:42,It is time for fact number three and that is
00:30:43,00:30:49,"Andy my fact is that the false gecko, which has the latin name pseudo gecko"
00:30:49,00:30:52,is a gecko
00:30:52,00:30:57,There are 10 species of false gecko. They're all geckos
00:30:57,00:30:59,Not one of them is not a gecko
00:30:59,00:31:03,And that is just a name. It's just a really really bad name. Yeah
00:31:03,00:31:09,"Couldn't find why they're called false geckos. I think maybe they were found and assumed to be something different. Yeah, yeah"
00:31:09,00:31:12,"Yeah, but geckos are wonderful"
00:31:12,00:31:17,"Um, there are geckos that don't have legs that look like snakes. I would have thought that would have been the false"
00:31:17,00:31:22,"Gecko cool. Yeah. Yeah, there are there are six families of geckos with no legs"
00:31:22,00:31:24,They're all endemic to australia and yugini
00:31:24,00:31:28,"Right, brilliant. They've got the vestigial hind limbs apparently they look a tiny bit like flaps"
00:31:28,00:31:34,"Yeah, the yeah that you can see these little bumps that come out but and that yeah means it's a lizard"
00:31:34,00:31:39,"Yeah, no eyelids either. No, every gecko has no eye. There are 1500 species of gecko"
00:31:40,00:31:47,"And all bar 43 have no eyelids. Yeah, and the you blepharidae, which literally means good eyelids in ancient greek"
00:31:47,00:31:49,They have eyelids
00:31:49,00:31:56,"But even they also lick their eyes like all the other geckos do to moisten them despite having eyelids, right? Oh amazing"
00:31:56,00:31:59,Have you heard of the fuck you lizard? No
00:31:59,00:32:05,This is this is a lizard which it's it's not its official name. That's not the the scientific name
00:32:05,00:32:09,"But um, it was it was a lizard that uh, when americans were over in vietnam during the war"
00:32:09,00:32:13,They kept noticing that they just they just kept hearing a little voice going fuck you
00:32:13,00:32:14,and
00:32:14,00:32:18,They're like who what is going on and they'd be walking up. Fuck you and
00:32:18,00:32:23,And so they all discovered that it's just this lizard that just makes a noise
00:32:23,00:32:29,Fuck you and so it became known as yeah the fuck you lizards. Why do we not all have one of those?
00:32:29,00:32:33,The noises I was surprised that gecko noises so that they bark
00:32:34,00:32:39,"Well, they're the only lizard that makes a noise geckos. Oh, are they? Yeah, that's that because if you think what noises a lizard make"
00:32:39,00:32:42,You wouldn't it was
00:32:42,00:32:46,But that that sort of it sounds more like a sort of electric buzzer ring doesn't it sally
00:32:46,00:32:48,Do you think a gecko could ever win the palm dog?
00:32:48,00:32:52,No
00:32:52,00:33:00,We covered a few years ago
00:33:00,00:33:05,I think we come the hero dog of the year and a few years ago it was won by a cat. That's true
00:33:05,00:33:08,I presented hero dog of the year
00:33:08,00:33:18,"I don't know last year or the year before not this year, but anyway quite recently and this is going to sound a bit mean now"
00:33:18,00:33:21,But one of the finalist dogs
00:33:21,00:33:26,"Okay, this is just my problem. It's a finalist dog and it wasn't a chihuahua, but it was similar. It was very very small"
00:33:27,00:33:35,"And um, his owner slash mommy, whatever you prefer to call it said that the dog had saved her partner's life by giving him"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Um, cpr"
00:33:38,00:33:43,That's she's got home and her husband is kissing the dog. That's what's happened there
00:33:43,00:33:45,The dog was very
00:33:45,00:33:47,Very small very small
00:33:47,00:33:50,I don't know why the dog was trained in cpr
00:33:50,00:33:53,"But anyway, it's all a bit of a problem for me having to"
00:33:53,00:33:57,Silence the questions in my brain
00:33:57,00:34:01,"That kept coming. Well, because there's so many stages. You've got to lay the head back a bit"
00:34:01,00:34:05,"You just want to go you're shitting me, right? Yeah"
00:34:05,00:34:11,"Was that the oh, it was one of the finalists didn't win. Didn't win. Well, who the fuck is a dog?"
00:34:11,00:34:16,It's amazing. There were these water dogs that did open heart surgery
00:34:16,00:34:24,It's a dog with SpaceX in mission control. Hey animals have done some amazing things
00:34:24,00:34:28,I don't want to take before we move on from geckos though. Did you know that in january last year
00:34:28,00:34:37,German hands curt cubus was caught at christ church airport new zealand with 44 geckos concealed in his pants
00:34:37,00:34:45,"Okay, we're doing a small incision and uh, he's just walking through immigration"
00:34:45,00:34:49,"Fuck you, fuck you"
00:34:51,00:34:54,There's a massive market in gecko smuggling really
00:34:54,00:35:02,Because they're diurnal like most geckos are nocturnal right new zealand gecko is is diurnal very very pretty
00:35:02,00:35:08,"And they can go for about $22,000. So this is massive. Sorry diurnal. Oh, I've got is that the wrong word?"
00:35:08,00:35:13,"Awaken the day you you're diurnal. Yeah, is that the right word? Yeah"
00:35:13,00:35:18,"Don't question yourself sally question. Yeah, I'm sorry"
00:35:19,00:35:21,You'll get you tell me more about yet. He's my ignorance
00:35:21,00:35:29,Questions dad. Do you want to know a cool? So diurnal awaken the day? Yeah nocturnal awaken night. Yeah for a puscular
00:35:29,00:35:35,"Dusky. Yeah, I know that dawn and dusk. What happened to the terminal bit of the word. Why did they lose that? I don't know"
00:35:35,00:35:38,"latin, isn't it"
00:35:38,00:35:41,Speaking of latin. I was reading about alien the roman writer and
00:35:41,00:35:45,He said
00:35:45,00:35:49,"He said that if a dead gecko lands in your wine, then it's fine"
00:35:49,00:35:58,"But okay, if it lands in your olive oil, it will taste terrible and when you eat it, it will immediately give you lice"
00:35:58,00:36:00,Wow
00:36:00,00:36:02,"Right, they've got lots of symbolic"
00:36:02,00:36:08,"There's lots of superstition around geckos and lizards, aren't there if you find a lizard tail in your left shoe"
00:36:08,00:36:10,It is very lucky. Do not take it out
00:36:10,00:36:17,"Is that real? That's a real one. That's a good current day one just the tail. Yeah, because obviously their tails come off and they can"
00:36:17,00:36:20,Regrow them. Yeah. Do you know starfish though can regrow?
00:36:20,00:36:25,If you take its leg off it can regrow a whole starfish from the leg. That's nuts
00:36:25,00:36:29,Like that's crazy. That's crazy though. What do they have? What do they have?
00:36:29,00:36:32,They store all the nutrients in the leg until they can grow a mouse
00:36:32,00:36:38,Does ever brain or intelligence or any kind of thing? I probably doesn't know it's a starfish is the truth
00:36:39,00:36:41,But they you know they have neurons
00:36:41,00:36:49,"Yeah, can I tell you about a guy called ben bar? He was looking for a particular gecko called the capola gecko"
00:36:49,00:36:57,Which was spotted for the first time in 1968 and then once again in 2007 and that was it
00:36:57,00:37:04,No specimen had ever been observed or collected apart from those two occasions. No one knew if it was still
00:37:05,00:37:08,"Existing, you know or alive or if it was a teleporting horse"
00:37:08,00:37:15,"Exactly. Yeah, and he led three trips to search for it and basically the process of searching for this capola gecko is just a turn over rocks"
00:37:15,00:37:22,He spent two years turning over rocks leaving no stone on turn. He left no stone on turn
00:37:22,00:37:26,He didn't even know for sure what it looked like
00:37:26,00:37:28,because
00:37:28,00:37:34,Not exactly not exactly and no scientist had ever held one in the hand and after two years and three expeditions
00:37:34,00:37:36,He found one
00:37:36,00:37:41,He said he was so excited. He said it was very similar to having a baby the euphoria
00:37:41,00:37:45,And if he bought the movie rice
00:37:45,00:37:51,"It's just lovely. Yeah, and he found four he found four on the same expeditions. I imagine under the same rock, but still"
00:37:51,00:37:57,"Yeah, imagine that determination to keep on it's like your um surface area measuring"
00:37:57,00:38:01,"Yes, yeah, you do admire it. Yeah, I got addicted to watching conservation"
00:38:01,00:38:05,TV at one point like the presentations of all the
00:38:05,00:38:10,Scientists because it's all the conservation scientists zoologists. I guess they're called
00:38:10,00:38:13,because there was it was so funny like the
00:38:13,00:38:15,Argentinian wolf man
00:38:15,00:38:19,He had long long hair and it really appeared to be having an affair with the
00:38:19,00:38:22,British cheetah lady
00:38:22,00:38:28,And and there was there was this really adorable couple. I think from chili from chile
00:38:28,00:38:30,Who had been looking for the onion wildcat?
00:38:30,00:38:35,We spent two and they said we have not ever seen the onion wildcat. They spent five years and they showed all these
00:38:35,00:38:37,photos of
00:38:37,00:38:40,Land Rover in different places where they had looked for the onion wildcat
00:38:40,00:38:45,"And not seen it and they were so charming and like oh, well, it's been interesting don't even"
00:38:45,00:38:49,We think there is wildcat. We think this is a wildcat
00:38:49,00:38:51,"Pooh, pooh, whatever they said stool"
00:38:51,00:38:57,And then they went off and then this really arrogant tool american thin american guy came in from the
00:38:58,00:39:00,Rare wildcat conservation society and he went
00:39:00,00:39:02,wildcat
00:39:02,00:39:05,"Wildcat, and he just had 50 slides of wildcats"
00:39:05,00:39:14,"Yeah, wait were you presenting him with an award? No, I just I was just depressed. I was in bed watching them on youtube"
00:39:14,00:39:18,You know I became very interested in the the women who run sloth sanctuaries
00:39:18,00:39:21,"Oh, yeah, because they seem to have absolutely no zoological training whatsoever"
00:39:21,00:39:25,I know nothing about sloth
00:39:25,00:39:28,So it's this one woman who goes all the sloth orphanage in Costa Rica
00:39:28,00:39:33,She's gone on a cruise with her husband and a baby sloth had fallen out of a tree
00:39:33,00:39:37,And she'd known right then she needed to abandon her life in the States and started sloth orphanage
00:39:37,00:39:40,Which she did and the problem she has she has to stop them having sex with each other
00:39:40,00:39:42,She didn't have room for any more and people get
00:39:42,00:39:46,Bringing them so they were kept strictly segregated and that's a slow penis
00:39:46,00:39:49,That is a slow penis
00:39:49,00:39:51,Yes
00:39:51,00:39:52,That's a slow penis
00:39:52,00:39:59,But one of them got manged and she just shaved that shaved it and she didn't know whether this is right and she shaved them
00:39:59,00:40:04,And these days she she didn't shave a sloth. I'm sure and there was a phd student
00:40:04,00:40:09,And I ended up watching the you know sub documentary series about them and getting absolutely obsessed was a phd student there
00:40:09,00:40:12,called Becky who
00:40:12,00:40:14,I think we've mentioned Becky on the podcast
00:40:14,00:40:18,"Like no, she hasn't been I we can get her. No, but I mean"
00:40:19,00:40:25,It was really it was really I think I feel she was northern. I feel she was northern. She was quite lethargic herself
00:40:25,00:40:30,She said I couldn't decide what to do for my phd
00:40:30,00:40:36,And I went to see my tutor and I said I can't decide between Jaguar's
00:40:36,00:40:44,And sloths and he said what about sloths? So here I am and then the cheetah lady went past
00:40:48,00:40:53,Have you seen the video where a sloth mistaken its own arm for a tree branch?
00:40:53,00:40:58,And then can't do anything about it because it's so slow. It just falls
00:40:58,00:41:01,from the tree
00:41:01,00:41:07,They can be quite fast. They can't they there's the ones that can swim. They swim really fast. If you put them in a fast current
00:41:07,00:41:13,"I think they they leaves that they that's just drugs, isn't it for them that they only eat one"
00:41:13,00:41:17,"I did think about writing a film about this sloth sanctuary, which is why and um"
00:41:18,00:41:21,"Obviously you can get the sloths out of uh, Costa Rica"
00:41:21,00:41:26,Their agents will never get back to you. That's the problem with the sloth. You can't can't transport them
00:41:26,00:41:32,"I was reading about a woman who runs a hospital for hawaiian monk seals and I read about her. This is amazing. Yeah, amazing"
00:41:32,00:41:34,"Yeah, so she um"
00:41:34,00:41:38,She runs this this monk seal place and she was out and she was you know
00:41:38,00:41:42,Getting lunch or something like that and she gets a missed call and or like she gets a call on her phone
00:41:42,00:41:44,She picks it up. No one's there. What's going on?
00:41:44,00:41:49,Um happens nine times while she's out and she's called she's called like the phone people
00:41:49,00:41:52,She's like is there like anything wrong with the line? It looks all fine
00:41:52,00:41:56,Gets back to the hospital and she looks and on the phone is a little gecko
00:41:56,00:42:01,Just pressing its finger on the call button and it's calling her and that was it
00:42:01,00:42:04,"She was getting they've been calling loads of other people as well. Yeah, it called it made a"
00:42:04,00:42:07,The newspaper said a bazillion phones
00:42:07,00:42:12,"That was the official number. Yeah. Wow. Yeah, just a little gecko fee"
00:42:12,00:42:17,"Can I do a quick quiz before we move on? Yes, we do need to move. Yes. Um, so this was a weirdly named animal pseudo gecko"
00:42:17,00:42:19,Is it a gecko? Is it not?
00:42:19,00:42:22,"Um, I've got some more like this. So the coffin fish"
00:42:22,00:42:25,Can the coffin fish cough?
00:42:25,00:42:26,Ah
00:42:26,00:42:31,There's a quiz or are you tricking us with pronunciation? Does it live? I'd say it does float in a coffin
00:42:31,00:42:35,"It does float. It's coffin fish like a coffin, but can it cough?"
00:42:35,00:42:38,"Uh, I'll say no, it can't I don't think fish. Well, you're wrong. Oh"
00:42:39,00:42:43,"Um, fish can expel air through their gills if things get stuck in there and we call that coughing"
00:42:43,00:42:47,"That's a cough. Um, can the swallow tail butterfly swallow its own tail?"
00:42:47,00:42:52,"Yes, no, no, obviously not"
00:42:52,00:42:57,But the only fact I know about it is it has an eye on its penis
00:42:57,00:43:04,So it can see where it's going crumbs. Really? That is not true. It is true. The swallow tail the swallow tail
00:43:04,00:43:08,"Butterfly, but oh butterfly. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's fine. It's a butterfly"
00:43:09,00:43:11,You've read the very hungry caterpillar. That's the final
00:43:11,00:43:16,scene and finally does the bloody nose beetle often have a bloody nose
00:43:16,00:43:20,"I'll say yes, Andy. I've told you insects don't have noses"
00:43:20,00:43:26,"Will you please listen? Oh, I fell right into it. No, it expels blood from its mouth"
00:43:26,00:43:28,That's why it's called that spells blood from its mouth
00:43:28,00:43:33,"Um, we're gonna need to move on to our final fact of the show. Can't bear it"
00:43:33,00:43:36,the show or
00:43:36,00:43:40,"Right with you. I feel yeah, I want to talk about the penguin who got a knighthood"
00:43:40,00:43:43,And I want to talk about the welsh corgi. He's got a phd
00:43:43,00:43:54,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is sally"
00:43:54,00:43:58,The band the super furry animals
00:43:58,00:44:05,Do you see what I did there wore yeti costumes for a year and they said it really changed their personalities
00:44:05,00:44:10,Becoming much harrier changed how they performed. What was the surface area?
00:44:10,00:44:18,"So I don't know much about the super furry animals. Well, you know, to be honest until yesterday"
00:44:18,00:44:27,"But the welsh welsh wrong. No, they're worse. They're like the centerpiece of the cool kumri"
00:44:27,00:44:33,"You know welsh resurgence with gorky's psychotic minky. I'm gonna say that wrong. That's correct, isn't it?"
00:44:33,00:44:38,You're a super fan. They want you. I am a super furry fan. I love gorky's. I got it monkey as well
00:44:38,00:44:43,"You're wearing a t-shirt. You're wearing a t-shirt right now. Yeah, they are very very cool. They did loads of like"
00:44:43,00:44:50,"Yeah, they did loads of crazy stuff. They had lots of like costumes and all that kind of stuff and yeah, they bought a tank"
00:44:50,00:44:53,And drove it into the nationalist steadford
00:44:53,00:45:01,"Wow, they bought it for 10 000 pounds from a one-eyed arm stealer with a limp and then they sold it on to don henley from the eagles"
00:45:02,00:45:04,Really?
00:45:04,00:45:07,Arms dealing band circuit
00:45:07,00:45:10,It wasn't the only um contact they had with arms dealers either they
00:45:10,00:45:15,Because they sampled lots of sounds and they they got some real guns
00:45:15,00:45:23,"What's with the yeti thing? So the yeti thing they um, well, they'd experimented on the the album before they had some"
00:45:23,00:45:30,Snow monsters on stage in glastonbury during the northern lights song. They were members of mogwai. Do you know all of this?
00:45:32,00:45:35,And unfortunately mogwai had just dropped an e before putting
00:45:35,00:45:38,The very hot suits on
00:45:38,00:45:40,And it became quite dangerous
00:45:40,00:45:43,So they had to have people running around giving them um giving them water
00:45:43,00:45:45,But they they were really into different kinds of creatures and then they
00:45:45,00:45:48,They came across a sculptor called peter gray
00:45:48,00:45:51,who made loads of sculptures out of hair
00:45:51,00:45:57,And he suggested just making these these yeti costumes for them for a video for the video for golden retriever
00:45:58,00:46:03,And they they thought this was brilliant and peter gray said i'll tell you where it needs to be you need to shoot this
00:46:03,00:46:09,"On a glacier in iceland next to a giant fire, which all the yetis are worshiping"
00:46:09,00:46:13,But they'd recently signed with sony who said that was an uninsurable concept
00:46:13,00:46:19,So they did it in a studio in north london and it sort of looks like the yetis are playing inside a cardboard box
00:46:19,00:46:23,Which is being sniffed at and then urinated on by a dog
00:46:23,00:46:26,And but it's really really cool. So how did it change the
00:46:27,00:46:30,Change the personalities. So they said they're none of them exhibitionists really they
00:46:30,00:46:36,"You know, they're quite political and love music very creative and you know, non-conformist and"
00:46:36,00:46:38,and the rest of it
00:46:38,00:46:44,They released a welsh entirely welsh language lp and then only told it in america and australia
00:46:44,00:46:47,It went into the top 20
00:46:47,00:46:53,"Yeah, but um, they said that it was like being transformed. They said none of them were exhibitionists in reality"
00:46:53,00:47:00,"It's an actual quote, but we were able to put these costumes on and become 70s rock monsters and it drove the audience nuts"
00:47:00,00:47:05,"Um, so they they really it's kind of interesting the impact of hair hairiness or hairlessness"
00:47:05,00:47:12,That's incredible power. I think it's a costume. So my my son's fifth birthday was um last year late last year
00:47:12,00:47:19,And I dressed up as mr. Potato Head and I honestly felt I saw that I saw that or make it
00:47:19,00:47:23,"I bought it from yeah, I bought it online. It's really cool. I saw it. It was it was"
00:47:23,00:47:25,Did it inflate itself? Was it one of those?
00:47:25,00:47:29,It was like a brown big piece of fabric and then you could stick on the eyes and the ears and stuff like that
00:47:29,00:47:35,"Do you know what it was a hit andy despite you, uh, I'm saying I'm saying it was good"
00:47:35,00:47:39,"We've lent it out to multiple parents ever since have you parties? Yeah, we haven't even got it at the moment"
00:47:39,00:47:42,But here's the thing the confidence it gave me because it was
00:47:45,00:47:50,"With the audience of five year olds who would have worshiped you anyway, I know I honestly like really"
00:47:50,00:47:54,"Yeah, it really I felt like a superhero. It was amazing. That's interesting"
00:47:54,00:47:57,And I went up because it was school had just started my son was going to a new school
00:47:57,00:48:02,"We knew no one so I went up to all the parents. I would never do that went up to all of them. Hey, what's up?"
00:48:02,00:48:07,"You went to school. Not the school gates. This is uh, no, no, this is the party. I missed a potato"
00:48:07,00:48:09,What I'm just trying to say is I don't think it's the hair necessarily
00:48:10,00:48:15,I think you must know this as an actor when you have a different persona that suddenly comes over you
00:48:15,00:48:18,There's a weird confidence that makes you a bit unstoppable in a way. I was
00:48:18,00:48:26,"It can go both ways. I'm I'm thinking a very vivid memories of it going the other way. Okay. I mean, I suppose one"
00:48:26,00:48:27,"Yes, I do I do know what you mean"
00:48:27,00:48:32,It's weird when you play a bride in a film people on set treat you as if you're getting married
00:48:32,00:48:37,Even though they know you're actually we all know you're actually you get treated people open doors and they
00:48:37,00:48:41,"Smile at you and go or it's interesting, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, there is a thing with autistic kids"
00:48:41,00:48:48,Where if you put them in a mask you can not all you can't generalize but lots of people have found that theater can really
00:48:48,00:48:55,"Help people who are very introverted to speak. Well, that's really interesting. Well, interestingly just on topic"
00:48:55,00:49:02,"So what they were doing there? They were dressing as yetis. It's not being a furry, but that's a lot of people dress up"
00:49:02,00:49:06,"As furries, right? I think we should say what a what a furry is for those"
00:49:06,00:49:13,"I mean, yeah, so a furry is someone who feels more comfortable when they're wearing a costume that has been designed where it's an animal"
00:49:13,00:49:18,"No, I think a furry is just someone who's a fan of the culture of you know"
00:49:18,00:49:23,Anthropomorphic animals and some of them do like to work. Exactly. Sorry. They're very keen
00:49:23,00:49:27,They they feel like a bad press and over 60 percent of furries feel that they are bullied
00:49:27,00:49:33,And get negative people have negative concepts. It's weird things only around 25 of all furries
00:49:33,00:49:36,owner suit
00:49:36,00:49:37,"Yeah, yeah"
00:49:37,00:49:43,"So I don't know how you classify yourself as a furry if you well, I guess you the you go to the cons and you you like"
00:49:43,00:49:48,"Like what really in your home clothes? Yeah, yeah, I thought it was all about the suit"
00:49:48,00:49:51,So did I that we're wrong. Maybe you can't afford it but on the point of autism
00:49:51,00:49:55,There was one of these cons that had an autism panel with furries
00:49:55,00:49:59,"And there was a lady there who said that um, it really helps if you're autistic"
00:49:59,00:50:02,So she said for three days. I am not autistic for three days
00:50:03,00:50:06,I am a giant anthropomorphic version of the titanic
00:50:06,00:50:11,And she feels it helps break the ice
00:50:11,00:50:20,The first furry convention
00:50:20,00:50:24,The first furry convention was almost all people in normal clothes
00:50:24,00:50:30,Or in human clothes and you can still see videos of it online. It was in holiday in in california
00:50:31,00:50:35,And there's basically only one person who dresses up in a costume
00:50:35,00:50:40,It was a guy called robert hill who came dressed as a giant s and m deer called hilda the bambioid
00:50:40,00:50:43,"Crikey, I know"
00:50:43,00:50:44,Yeah
00:50:44,00:50:48,And but it's amazing and they chose that place because it's so close to disneyland
00:50:48,00:50:53,And they thought that everyone who's kind of into anthropomorphic animals would also be into disneyland
00:50:53,00:50:56,And they went there and they you know does if you go online
00:50:57,00:51:02,You can see like the history of all these conferences that they've had called conference
00:51:02,00:51:06,And the first time they had a problem with the hotel was in 1994
00:51:06,00:51:11,And the problem was the hotel too many too many all all the bathrooms got clogged drains. That was the problem
00:51:11,00:51:15,"That was the only problem. Yeah. Yeah, it was and breakfast buffet was no"
00:51:15,00:51:20,Apparently it was too big the hotel so they couldn't fill it up with just their people
00:51:20,00:51:22,So there was a load of other people there as well
00:51:23,00:51:27,"And you know, they weren't so understanding and there was lots of complaints"
00:51:27,00:51:34,And then a maid found a costume in a room by a person who had a costume of veteran of the psychotic wars
00:51:34,00:51:38,And it was a unicorn who carried a big sort of cartoon cherry bomb
00:51:38,00:51:42,So they they would have like this big sort of black bomb shape like you would have it
00:51:42,00:51:46,"With like the the wick coming out. Yeah, exactly. What is going on? They found this"
00:51:46,00:51:49,The maid found this costume in the room
00:51:49,00:51:53,Right and they called the bomb squad because there was a bomb in the room
00:51:53,00:51:57,But a cartoon bomb a cartoon bomb although. What's the best place to hide a bomb?
00:51:57,00:51:59,I guess so
00:51:59,00:52:04,The bomb squad didn't see it the right way and they find the hotel for making a prank call
00:52:04,00:52:07,So when the bomb squad came and they saw it was just cherry bomb
00:52:07,00:52:09,And there was a unicorn costume next to us
00:52:09,00:52:13,They're like you're wasting our time and they find them and they never were allowed to go back to that hotel again
00:52:13,00:52:15,"Okay, I don't think anyone's favorite reason to be there"
00:52:15,00:52:21,"What what about this guy's just he's just got a costume. It's not his fault. Yeah, I guess they I did"
00:52:21,00:52:27,"It did amuse me that quote in the article. We'd probably both read where um, they said most furries"
00:52:27,00:52:29,It's not an erotic thing. It just gets too hot
00:52:29,00:52:39,The other astonishing fact was that there's 10 000 people in the uk who live as dogs
00:52:39,00:52:42,Uh
00:52:42,00:52:47,That's what it said on google living as maybe not living as dogs maybe like
00:52:48,00:52:51,Dogs have a very broad spectrum of wanting to be
00:52:51,00:52:54,Referred to you will dress up as dogs or have handlers and
00:52:54,00:52:59,That seemed to be a different kind of outfit. That seemed to be a kind of it's a lot
00:52:59,00:53:05,I go for a kind of white unitard with little spots. Right feels like you might have read live on the aisle of dogs
00:53:05,00:53:10,"I go for a walk every day. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you know am I one of your 10 000?"
00:53:10,00:53:13,Just some people would spectrum of dogs though
00:53:13,00:53:18,"Like well, some dogs some dogs live in the house. Some dogs might live in a kennel. Some dogs are pampered house dogs"
00:53:18,00:53:23,There is a bdsm thing of pups being a pup. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you've got you've got you say. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
00:53:23,00:53:29,"I did not know that I said, yeah, you had to cut of course over it rather than rather than to fully endorse"
00:53:29,00:53:35,But you know dogs divide into hound pooch and mutt. Don't they those are the three do they yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
00:53:35,00:53:37,Those are the three broad categories of dog
00:53:37,00:53:40,Broad category of dog that you can choose to dress up as
00:53:41,00:53:46,But like if you see a dog normally you'll know within a second whether it's a hound a pooch or a mutt
00:53:46,00:53:51,Unless it's a labrador in which case it's just a dog. The lab the labrador is the kind of classic dog
00:53:51,00:53:54,Does no one else play hound pooch or mutt? No
00:53:54,00:53:57,Straudnery can you get Andy an introduction to hero dog of the year?
00:53:57,00:54:03,I think I could qualify I do I do just on dressing up as as animals
00:54:03,00:54:08,"um, so a lot of people who have to dress as animals a lot and not"
00:54:09,00:54:14,Sort of a relaxation for their work are zookeepers. There's a brilliant photo from 2004 of some there's a
00:54:14,00:54:18,Japanese party of school children. They're all about I'd say four or five years old
00:54:18,00:54:23,And they are being approached by a life-size rhinoceros which is a pantomime rhinoceros
00:54:23,00:54:25,With two zookeepers in it front and back
00:54:25,00:54:29,Which are basically charging the school children the teachers have to get the
00:54:29,00:54:31,Children away from the rhino. It looks genuinely terrifying
00:54:31,00:54:34,But is it how realistic is the costume?
00:54:34,00:54:36,It's pretty good. Is it if I was five?
00:54:37,00:54:41,"I would be very nervous. Yeah, well, I don't think so because I once did a"
00:54:41,00:54:46,I once did a kid's show. I mean a long time ago. I did a kid's show with superkins in fact
00:54:46,00:54:51,and called Lucy and the dinosaurs and a friend of ours was playing a tyrannosaurus rex
00:54:51,00:54:53,and uh
00:54:53,00:54:59,"Ben Moore, do you know Ben? Ben Moore was tyrannosaurus rex. He had a big costume and superkins very"
00:54:59,00:55:03,"irresponsibly said to the kids. Hey, let's beat up tyrannosaurus rex"
00:55:04,00:55:09,And the stage was stormed with upwards of 55 year olds
00:55:09,00:55:15,"Just kicking the living day lights out ben more who looks, you know, like a early mr. Muscle"
00:55:15,00:55:19,"Mr. Muscle's got muscly recently if you notice that but anyway, mr. Muscle used to be"
00:55:19,00:55:24,"In the advert but anyway, and ben was just in the recovery position sort of crying shaking"
00:55:24,00:55:32,"Well, I've been beaten up in a chicken costume by allen davis on qi. You have yeah. Yeah beaten up by who by allen davis"
00:55:33,00:55:38,"Oh, yeah, actually properly. I think he was taken out a lot of frustration from the previous 10 years"
00:55:38,00:55:46,"But yeah, I was in a costume and he decided as a joke. I think was this during the show? Are you guys in a hotel room?"
00:55:46,00:55:54,It was for a Christmas special of qi and the thing is because the the kind of slot that you look through is quite small
00:55:54,00:55:57,And it's a big sort of costume the one that I had and I assume it was the same
00:55:58,00:56:02,"It very easily goes in the wrong place and suddenly you can't see anything. Yeah, and it's boiling hot"
00:56:02,00:56:07,You're sweating and everything and all you can do is go fetal. It's like literally the only thing
00:56:07,00:56:09,and you did
00:56:09,00:56:12,On set that were like while filming it was incredibly
00:56:12,00:56:15,People have to talk you down
00:56:15,00:56:17,I once got I once got asked if I wanted to be an alien in a film
00:56:17,00:56:20,The robin orita
00:56:23,00:56:30,"Yeah, I've got the look. No, it was uh, I was playing basically that I would have been playing the beast that sort of landed in a"
00:56:30,00:56:36,In a meteorite and then that's crushed and then but the guy my friend who was casting the film said you will just have to lie
00:56:36,00:56:39,In a field in a rubber suit for a week
00:56:39,00:56:44,And and I said no and I regret it now. I bet I wish I'd done it now. What was the movie? I don't know
00:56:44,00:56:52,So apparently the just going back to furries a second the conventions are a nightmare for exactly the reason
00:56:52,00:56:56,"That you're always saying about uh, that one's too hot. Yeah, everyone's too hot. They can't see anything"
00:56:56,00:56:59,So anyone who's in a costume is just bumping into each other
00:56:59,00:57:05,You're the article says inevitably you're gonna smack a child in the head because your arms are just you know
00:57:05,00:57:10,"Wapping about you can't see them at the level that you need to sorry got a big tail. Maybe. Oh, yeah"
00:57:10,00:57:17,I was just trying to help I was trying to contribute to the was it was it going that badly?
00:57:21,00:57:23,"By the way, we are gonna have to wrap up"
00:57:23,00:57:26,"And we've gone really far over the whole like um, yeah"
00:57:26,00:57:32,Only just started. Can I give you some furry vocab and see if you can guess what they mean?
00:57:32,00:57:36,"Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so what do you think is a furry tan?"
00:57:36,00:57:39,Furry tan f u r i t a n
00:57:39,00:57:44,Oh a puritan as someone who is like a puritan. It's someone who only wears the costume
00:57:44,00:57:48,It's a furry fan who is not interested in any sexual content
00:57:48,00:57:51,That's pretty good
00:57:51,00:57:54,Um to scratch. Do you know what to scratch means?
00:57:54,00:58:00,"Oh, you can't scratch yourself through the fur. Oh, that's good. What do you do? I don't know"
00:58:00,00:58:02,It's not that but it is to do with scratching
00:58:02,00:58:08,It's to scratch someone gently often as a friendly gesture or greeting. Just do a little don't do that
00:58:08,00:58:15,"Uh, can you guess what a fur pile is?"
00:58:15,00:58:18,Is that where they all is that like a fun?
00:58:18,00:58:23,"Yeah, bundle they all just yeah a carpet is like a carpet. You would say it has a shag pile. So is it"
00:58:23,00:58:29,Broadly similar. It's pretty much that it's a gathering of fully costume participants who roll around on the floor
00:58:29,00:58:31,scratching each other
00:58:31,00:58:34,Scritching got quite sexy all of a sudden
00:58:34,00:58:40,The other thing is that Andy mentioned tails earlier and there could be an idea in the future that maybe we give
00:58:40,00:58:46,"Maybe give all old people tails for balance for balance. Oh, you're good at this game"
00:58:47,00:58:50,"Um, yeah, the idea is you get like these sort of mechanical tails"
00:58:50,00:58:55,And you put them on old people and they can tell if an old person with with their consent and
00:58:55,00:58:58,And support just stop them falling over is it?
00:58:58,00:59:03,"Yeah, so the the tail can tell when they're about to fall over and it can move itself"
00:59:03,00:59:07,That so it'll give them more balance. It'll stop people from falling over. I think that's brilliant
00:59:07,00:59:09,Turn over to Dr. Octopus. Yeah
00:59:09,00:59:12,It's just completely terrifying. I think we should give them gecko feet instead
00:59:12,00:59:16,Because you don't want to go ground that what are you doing up there?
00:59:16,00:59:21,That's one of the reasons there's such a trade in geckos apparently is they're being
00:59:21,00:59:24,Studied for the space program. Did you read that?
00:59:24,00:59:29,"Yeah, because they're feet because they're so feet can stick to anything except"
00:59:29,00:59:32,Teflon
00:59:32,00:59:39,"Oh, gecko feet will stick to absolutely anything at all except dry Teflon. It's all right if it's wet"
00:59:39,00:59:44,"But isn't Teflon what we largely use in space though. Yeah, so it's a problem"
00:59:44,00:59:46,No
00:59:46,00:59:54,"Yeah, because the cling ability great use we've made you exactly as good as a gecko and get on to that space station"
00:59:54,01:00:04,"Yeah, sorry. Well, they did this experiment where they got a load of geckos and they"
01:00:04,01:00:08,stuck them on stuff and then they euthanized them all
01:00:08,01:00:13,And then they put them back up and they stayed exactly the same stuck dead as alive. So
01:00:14,01:00:16,Wow on that note
01:00:16,01:00:20,Always good to go out on a big laugh
