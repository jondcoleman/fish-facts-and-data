00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
 Hi everybody, before we start this week's podcast, just a quick reminder to remain indoors,

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,280
 and also to say we have an announcement to make. A few weeks ago, as some of you may know,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,360
 we put up back online the second complete year of fish. We put up 52 episodes. We are now doing

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,080
 the same thing with the first complete year of fish. Those episodes are all going back up online,

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,760
 and they are a kind of insight into how the podcast started in the first place.

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,240
 There's lots of crazy brilliant stuff on there, and if you're listening to reverse chronological

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,840
 order, you could notice the sound quality, audibly diminish, like week on week, as we get back to

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,920
 the first episode where we had a single microphone and we recorded it in a cupboard.

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,680
 So if you'd like to check that out, please do so. There is another amazing thing you can get.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,880
 When we first put out the first year of fish on sale, it had a special accompanying vinyl LP,

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,040
 which was brilliant, and that came with a bonus episode that we recorded. That vinyl is going on

12
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,560
 a special flash sale this weekend. It's going to be just 12 quid, and you can check it out at no such

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,880
 thing as a fish.com. Also, of course, the cassette tape USB that we did with the complete second

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,560
 year of fish is up there too, if you want to check it out. They're both great fun, and we love

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,960
 working with the companies who made them and made them a reality, so do check them out and enjoy

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:34,480
 the episodes, and enjoy this episode. Oh, with the show.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:47,360
 Hello, and welcome to another working from home episode of no such thing as a fish,

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,880
 a weekly podcast. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anacizinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,440
 and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around our microphones with our four favorite

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,080
 facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Andy.

21
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,640
 My fact is that the inventor of condensed milk, Gail Borden, had previously tried inventing a biscuit

22
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:19,760
 made of meat. Sounds delicious. I don't like condensed milk, but I've read about this meat biscuit,

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,320
 and it sounds amazing. It kind of sounds a bit like dog food, I think, but for people.

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,120
 That doesn't sound amazing, but I guess we have different tastes. He was alive in the mid-19th century,

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,360
 and there were all these problems about preserving food at the time, and feeding large numbers of

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
 people at a distance, or at a distance of time, so especially feeding your armies, things like this.

27
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,240
 This was a couple of decades before the Civil War, so he would have known there was a Civil War

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,040
 coming, needed to feed people for that. He had amazing powers of foresight, didn't he, this inventor?

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,160
 Yeah, I mean, incredible, actually. Sort of weird, he didn't make his money out of that, but he invented

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,080
 so much stuff. And one of the things he invented was a beef broth, which he then evaporated into

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,280
 this kind of syrup, and you could either fry or bake that syrup into a biscuit, and it was a universally

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,080
 derided, not actually not, you know, the scientific American said it was one of the best discoveries

33
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,800
 of modern times. Okay, that was a good review. It also won a gold medal at the Great Exhibition

34
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,920
 in 1851, but the army tried it, and they declared it was not only unpalatable, but failed to appease

35
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,920
 the craving of hunger, producing headache, nausea, and great muscular depression. Picky, picky.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,200
 But can we talk about some of the other stuff that bored and invented? Because he was incredible.

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,880
 So lots of his relatives, very sadly, died of yellow fever. His mother, his wife and his son had

38
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,760
 all passed away because of yellow fever. So it was a summer disease, predominantly, and one thing he

39
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,280
 decided to invent was a giant refrigerator to keep people in until they got better. That didn't

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:12,960
 work. Did you read about the amphibious machine he invented? The Teretqueus. Yeah. It was

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,280
 basically one of those things that you get on the Thames in London, wasn't it? Well, like a

42
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,840
 Dock ribbitor. It was a Dock ribbitor. It was built for prairies. It was like a wagon that could ride

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,040
 you along the prairies, but then it transformed into a boat at the click of a button or the erection

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,040
 of a sail, I guess, once it hit the water. It was horse drawn, wasn't it, as well? Yes. So I guess the

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,760
 horse stayed on shore. No, you then attached seahorses to it once it got in the water. Yeah, the poor

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,760
 horse didn't get to ride the boat, but it was pretty unsuccessful. I think on its first outing,

47
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,640
 all its occupants ended up in the water, right? Oh, no. Yeah, it did. So he went out a couple times

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,800
 to the ocean. One time, as you say, it tipped over the people into the ocean. Other times, they were

49
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
 just too afraid to let him take the boat in. And I was reading an account of that, which gives you an

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,000
 idea of other food inventions that he had, because he hosted a dinner before he took everyone out on

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,360
 this boat. And there's a quote, which is from which he talked about the food that he'd concocted

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,320
 that evening out of material, from which if you knew what they were, you would turn to loathing and

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,040
 horror. I have transmuted even the dirt itself into delicacies. That was dinner before the horror

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,640
 show boat experience. That's brilliant. Interestingly, you know when he invented this biscuit. I just

55
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,800
 want to go back to the biscuit, which I do think is pretty cool. Yeah, so he invented this biscuit.

56
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,840
 And then he went to the Great Exhibition in 1851. And everyone said it was amazing. Like I said,

57
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,360
 the scientific American said it was amazing. Everyone thought this was going to be the next big

58
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,760
 thing. And so he opened up a big office in New York. Okay, where he could sell these biscuits

59
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:56,640
 from. And it was opened on Maiden Lane in New York. And it was, and I can't quite tell from Google maps.

60
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,360
 It was either the same building or it's next door to the building where the Hamilton's song,

61
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,440
 the room where it happens. That room is in a building on the same street and it's either the same

62
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,960
 one or it's next door to it. So are you implying that the song, the room where it happened, is about

63
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,960
 the room where the meat biscuit almost took off. The original probably was, right? It probably was

64
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,720
 about the meat biscuit and then they thought, oh, you know what, it's not doing as well as we thought,

65
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,960
 let's change this musical from what used to be about the meat biscuit business. Now let's add

66
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,200
 into something about Hamilton. If only. I didn't know what the room where it happens is. I assumed

67
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,120
 it was a metaphor of some kind, but you're saying there's an actual room. And Anna knows the story

68
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 better than me, but I think is it not where they all got together and decided that the country would

69
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,880
 be a federal system or something like that? It was the bargaining moment, I think, between Hamilton and

70
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,920
 Jefferson and his second in command who was Madison. And Burr was not allowed into the meeting.

71
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,240
 And that's the meeting he wanted to be in because that said that's where power was and meat biscuits.

72
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,240
 Madison actually came out of that with his own set of demands, which is that he wanted to have

73
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,680
 some square gardens named after them in New York. So everyone got what they wanted a little bit.

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:19,520
 Back to Gail Borden for a second. Did you find, so quite a few of the biogs of him say he was

75
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,520
 Biven eccentric and he used to ride around Galveston on a pet bull apparently and he was quite an

76
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,200
 important guy. So he lived in this place called Galveston in Texas, but he actually also helped design

77
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,040
 it apparently. So this is in 1829, he moved there and then he helped set up all the streets of this place.

78
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,840
 And the way they measured streets was it was by the number of longhorn cattle that could move a

79
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,320
 breast down the street. So it shows in Texas at the time what was most important, the most important

80
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,600
 thing to transport. So a hundred foot wide street could fit 14 head of longhorn cattle.

81
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,720
 Wow. And then Borden basically then went on to make his condensed milk, didn't he?

82
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,120
 Andy. Yes. And that's what we know him best for today. So what we know and love him for today.

83
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,800
 But then Borden's milk is like I think in America still perhaps one of the big brands, is it?

84
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
 Yeah it is, but it wasn't called Borden's until after he died I believe. He was actually inspired

85
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,120
 to make the condensed milk on the way back from collecting his prize for the meat biscuit, right?

86
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
 He was obviously on a roll. Yeah. It was on the boat on the way back from London and there was cows

87
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,440
 there were cows on board to help feed the young kids on board and they were too distressed to produce

88
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,720
 their milk selfishly because of all the waves. And so a lot of the kids on board died and he

89
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
 thought we've got to have a way of getting milk that doesn't require sucking out the orders of a cow

90
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,520
 directly. Well the reason that he became so popular is that his milk was way better than

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,600
 everyone else's because he had what was called the dairy man's 10 commandments. And if anyone was

92
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,200
 going to sell him milk to condense it had to fit him with certain things that he said had to happen.

93
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,320
 So for instance they had to wash the cow's udders before milking and they had to sweep the

94
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,680
 barns clean and they had to dry the strainer's every morning and night and stuff like that. But he

95
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
 came up with these specific rules that you had to adhere to if you wanted to give him milk.

96
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,960
 Well he was working on his milk round about the time where milk was incredibly controversial,

97
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,760
 wasn't he? Because this is the 1850s and I didn't know about this thing, the great milk swill

98
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,520
 crisis, but I'm sure everyone else knows about it, which is basically this thing happened where until

99
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,440
 industrialisation people really did have a farmer bring a cow round to their door and they'd order

100
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,800
 milk from it. So you met the cow and you got to okay it. But with like urbanisation and stuff then

101
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,240
 you just had to buy milk without having met the cow firsthand. And so people used to start tampering

102
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,920
 with it. And a major problem was distilleries, always a bit rougish, used to basically set up

103
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
 side alleys in dairy farming and they just fill and then they just feed cows all the leftover

104
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,880
 kind of corn, rye, swilly mash and it was really badly infected and they'd sort of the milk would come

105
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,840
 out and it would be a gross watery blue colour and then they'd fill it up with things like chalk

106
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,640
 and plaster to make it look white and like real milk. And people were just dying by the bucket load

107
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,760
 because these incompetent whiskey makers were trying to give the milk. And so there was this huge

108
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,320
 huge crisis and huge controversy and once they cleared that up I think death rates went down about

109
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,920
 five times in New York. Wow. That's so interesting about, sorry to pick up on a very minor thing you said

110
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,720
 in that really, it's quite intense, I think about my exciting. But meeting the cow they gave you milk

111
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,520
 and sort of knowing its name, that's why I guess they must have the spokes cow that they have for

112
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,160
 orders milk which is LC. Yes. Because you would feel like okay LC's in charge here, she's

113
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,840
 she's looking after so they've had over 50 LC's over the year. Do you think everyone in America

114
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,360
 thinks that they're all getting milk from this one exhaust account? She puts on such a brave front

115
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,280
 but my girl, she's naked. Yeah. We've mentioned LC before. Anyway, like incredibly briefly, we mentioned

116
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,920
 her when we were talking about I think she was censored because she had others and LC has undergone a

117
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,040
 bit of a transformation from the first time she appeared. She used to be a complete cow. She used to be

118
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,680
 actually a cow and then she's kind of started, she was put on her hind legs and she was dressed in

119
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,640
 pinnifles and things and so she was in the kind of uncanny valley between human and cow and I think

120
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,560
 Hollywood censored her because she was a bit too sexy that for a cat, sexier than a cow should be

121
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,560
 basically. You do want to be turned on while you're trying to eat your breakfast cereal. No way.

122
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,120
 The fake cow. Okay. I do actually just if we're on milk, I have one more thing about condensed milk

123
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,640
 because I think I might have found an earlier example of condensed milk which is St. Cuthbert.

124
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:51,280
 St. Cuthbert was alive in the 7th century AD and he, according to legend, he chopped his own leg off

125
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,160
 after speaking angrily to his parents and it was then replaced with a cast that was made of milk

126
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,560
 and so I think that is a possible example of earlier milk conversation. What are you talking about?

127
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,040
 So, you know, miracles happen and if you've cut your own leg off because you've been speaking

128
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
 angrily to your parents and you're a morseful, sometimes God will grant you a new leg and his new

129
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,640
 one happened to be made of milk. Anyway, there's one weird connection which is that there is a St. Cuthbert's

130
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,560
 cooperative society which was a shop. It's now called Scottmid so it's one of the big Scottish

131
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:38,880
 grocery shops and they hired in 1944 Sean Connery as a milkman today. No way. Yeah. So, so what's the link

132
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:49,200
 again? Well, the Supermarket. It's called St. Cuthbert's cooperative. And Sean Connery got to do

133
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:56,960
 that. Has he got a leg made of milk? Yeah, it's the man with the milk he liked. They see

134
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,600
 it with the man with the golden gun. It was one of Cue's less popular gadgets.

135
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:12,880
 Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 2014

136
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 four non-related economists with the surname Goodman published a paper about the economics of

137
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,280
 surname sharing. The paper was titled A Few Good Men. Very clever. You've got to wonder what came

138
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,120
 first that title or any of the rest of it. Actually none of them was called Goodman when they first

139
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,080
 started the paper. They all had name changes. Well, they were very strict about that actually because

140
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,600
 they claimed that this is the first paper co-authored by four non-related surname sharing economists

141
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,920
 and there was a thought that this could be challenged because there was a paper published by

142
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,200
 Scarbeck, Scarbeck, Scarbeck and Scarbeck back in 2012. But they disqualified it from beating them

143
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,600
 to it because they said it was written by two brothers and there are two wives. So they argued that

144
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,400
 first the fact that the two wives had their maiden names before they started the paper and then

145
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:10,960
 took on the name Scarbeck disqualifies them. So they did it during the research and also one of the

146
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,160
 brothers and his wife are not economists. They're attorneys and so that also knocked them out. They were

147
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,880
 very thorough. So in this paper they looked at how likely it is for other groups of economists with

148
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:29,040
 the same name to share papers, didn't they? They had a data set with loads of names of economists and

149
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,480
 they found that 45% of them share a surname with at least one other economist. So I think that it

150
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 might be helpful. But the main reason that they think this whole thing might help is that if you

151
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,760
 have loads of people with the same name then you don't have that problem where the paper is by Dan

152
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,240
 Schreiber et al and we don't see who the other people who wrote the paper are. Why do they just pluralise

153
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,800
 this surname basically? By four Goodmans. They just say by Goodman et al but they don't refer to exactly

154
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,080
 which Goodman is the first Goodman. So actually everyone is getting equal billing. It's like if we

155
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,600
 all changed our name to Toshinsky and then we went to do a gig and then in big lights on the

156
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,840
 theatre it said Toshinsky, Toshinsky, Toshinsky, Toshinsky and Toshinsky. We wouldn't know who was the

157
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,240
 top of the bill. Of course it would be me but we wouldn't know who it was. Yeah, exactly. I'm not

158
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,240
 fully for that. I'm not rocking up to a fish gig with Harkin and et al. Nice try buddy.

159
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,800
 I wouldn't think about surnames and actually this is a Beatles fact so Dan I'm probably going to

160
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,680
 defer to you on this one. But is it the case that Paul McCartney wrote yesterday? Yes.

161
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:45,600
 This quiz is easy. All right. Next. Okay. No but I read that John Lennon became furious when he

162
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,800
 was in hotels because quite a lot of the time the person playing the piano in the hotel would play

163
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,320
 yesterday as a tribute to him and he hadn't written any of that song at all. It wasn't a Lennon

164
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,160
 McCartney song. It was just a McCartney song and so that made him furious. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

165
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:10,560
 So if you're if you ever see Andy in a hotel and you want to pay tribute to him,

166
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,640
 don't play him the episode of No Switch Things A Fish where Alex Bell was here instead of him

167
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,680
 because that'll just annoy him. Exactly. I'll be so angry. I'll be amazed at your piano skills

168
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,520
 if you can play that. Go imagine those poor penis getting requests. Do you know episode 313?

169
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:34,400
 No such thing as a banana with Wi-Fi? It's the same, dude. Everyone's the same.

170
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,080
 I'm on surnames in academia and problems at this poses. So the same surname problem is a

171
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,360
 serious issue and it's especially an issue in China because in China there are 200,000 people per

172
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,600
 unique surname. So they've got far fewer surnames in China and I read a piece written by a Wang,

173
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:04,880
 a J Wang, who is saying there are more than 1200 J Wangs in nano-science alone. So this is hell.

174
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,800
 So if you want to find an individual academic, you can't find them because you have, you know,

175
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,760
 200,000 Wangs to deal with. So now in academia you get something called your orchid, which is

176
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,120
 standardized now across most journals. So rather than being one of a billion, you know, Smiths,

177
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,000
 Wangs, you have to have a 16-digit number. But there is an issue because dead scientists probably

178
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,080
 won't sign up to this orchid system because they can't. And so the worry is that now if you're a

179
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,600
 deceased scientist, your academic work is going to become harder and harder to source.

180
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:41,280
 So have you guys heard of Dick Astman? No, I've never heard of it. He was a gas station employee from

181
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
 Canada and his name, if you look him up on Wikipedia, his name propelled him to celebrity status across

182
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:56,160
 North America for four months in 1995. Wow, that is like the, who is it? The Andy Warhol, isn't it? It's

183
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,160
 there. Everyone has their four months of fame. Yeah, exactly. I think it's because David Letterman

184
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,800
 found out that there was someone called Dick Astman. He found this so funny that he, you know,

185
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,320
 kept on referring to him. This became known as Asmania and eventually, eventually, his dad, by the way,

186
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,600
 was called Adolf Astman, which is amazing. I mean, what an amazing. Yeah. Wow. If you were only

187
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,240
 allowed to change one of those names, it's so hard to know which shoes.

188
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:35,360
 He became super famous and then he faded into obscurity. But there was another Astman recently who

189
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,720
 got in trouble over a vanity license plate. Another Canadian, I believe, who had Astman on his license plate

190
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
 and the authorities said, "No, you can't have that." Anyway, that's that name. I have a very random

191
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,440
 surname fact while we're just lobbing in some good old surname. I just read this late last night,

192
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,440
 Silla Black, the singer and TB show host. I found out what her real surname is. Do you guys know

193
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,320
 where her real surname is? No. Silla White. And she only got the name change as a result of a

194
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,200
 misprint in a mercy beat newspaper when she was starting out that called her Silla Black. And she

195
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,120
 just went, "Oh, that's a bit of a misprint, isn't it?" It's a massive type. Yeah, it's not a type

196
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:25,120
 or an old. It's literally the difference between black and white. Yeah, good, cool. But I can't believe

197
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,400
 she styled it out and just went, "Oh, yeah, yeah, that's me." Like, when a boss says your name wrong in

198
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,520
 a meeting, you just go, "Okay, I guess I'm Mike for this meeting." Yeah, she did it for her whole career.

199
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:44,720
 Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fault this week is that if you wanted to have

200
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:52,800
 a bath in Paris in the 1820s, you could have one delivered to your door. This is the bath delivery

201
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,400
 service. Did you have to take the bath outside of the door or could you bring it into your house?

202
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,680
 Oh, what? It was brought into your house. Sorry, so it was delivered to your door and then up your

203
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,960
 stairs and into whatever room you chose to bathe in. So this was called the Bant and Domicille

204
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,720
 and it was so popular in Paris in the 1820s. And yeah, someone would come along, a guy called

205
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,800
 a thermo floor would deliver a bath to your doorway and then they'd also bring these metal rails

206
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,000
 so they could wheel it up the stairs on these rails, plunk it down. They also came with a dressing

207
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,040
 gown and a towel and you could order your flavour of bath. So if you wanted a hot bath, you would say,

208
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,760
 if you wanted a refreshing cold bath that I may have been less money, I don't know, but that was

209
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,960
 also an option. I know when you say flavours, I don't usually associate hot and cold as flavours.

210
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,320
 So was there any of the anything else that you could choose like pistachio?

211
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,440
 I think there was one other choice. Mineral. Yeah, it's not again, not a flavour. Mineral is not a flavour.

212
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,560
 Well, I think it spices up bath time a bit if you do refer to them as flavours.

213
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,640
 Turn on the hot flavour, cold flavour. Sure. Try it next time.

214
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,680
 I love the fact that they brought a longer towel. That feels like the least important bit of the

215
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:15,280
 entire enterprise. What? So was there a porcelain bath they were bringing? Or was it made of something like?

216
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,160
 Andy, what do you do? Do you just trip dry whenever you get out of the bath? Of course I do.

217
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,000
 Of course I do. Just stand in the street letting nature do its work.

218
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:30,960
 It's very important to bath time to have a towel, obviously.

219
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,720
 Do you jump out like a dog and shake all of the water off you?

220
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,400
 I just shake it off once and then I'm normal again.

221
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,440
 Sorry, you were saying, was it a porcelain? Anna, was it porcelain?

222
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,000
 They were made of various different materials. Apparently someone made of leather and some were foldable,

223
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,360
 pleabla, apparently, said in one article. But I guess if it was leather and you had like a hot

224
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,640
 flavoured bath then it might what? I don't, maybe they had better technology that we've now forgotten.

225
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,960
 Like secret leather, yeah. Yeah. I love the bath. Your playing is a weird sex game.

226
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,680
 I must have been a no questions asked service.

227
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,720
 Anyway, what a great service. It seemed to sort of disappear, as I guess trends do.

228
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,880
 I think there were a thousand of these baths for Rent in Paris by the mid-1820s.

229
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,120
 And then they receded again. Bathroom was a bit controversial. I think some people thought it was a bit

230
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,480
 lascivious. There was a famous prostitute, a quarter-seff, French quarter-san, who had two baths.

231
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
 And that was a bit frowned upon. Like, oh, that's the kind of thing courtesans do.

232
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,760
 And one of her baths that was made of silver, she had three taps.

233
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,920
 One of which delivered water and another delivered milk and the other champagne.

234
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,160
 Just on the flavour thing though, because James was saying stuff about, what did you say? Like

235
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,960
 almond and stuff like that? I said pistachio, but it was just the first flavour that came into it.

236
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,080
 Yeah, but that was a thing. Like, there was the sort of prototype back then of the bath bomb that

237
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,880
 gives the colour and aroma that you get with them in the form of things like clouded, powdered,

238
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,440
 almond paste. And then milk was another big one. And largely I think that was a modesty thing for women.

239
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,000
 The idea was that you would have the bath, not necessarily in a bathroom, but possibly in an open room.

240
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,720
 And so it just created a layer of camouflage to stop your bits from being seen.

241
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,560
 You see that, but I think, let's say you have some nice redox in your bath or something,

242
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,320
 and it smells of lavender, then you come out of your bath and you smell like lavender.

243
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,480
 I probably don't want to smell like milk after you get out of the bath. Don't you know what I mean?

244
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,600
 I like milk. I wouldn't mind smelling like, is the milk fresh? That's the big question.

245
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,720
 To begin with, it will be. That's a really good challenge.

246
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,000
 If you're using the Peyton Murray drip dry method, then over time that milk will curdle.

247
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,440
 Also, I don't know how clean you can claim you are if you're stepping out of the bath and you're

248
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,560
 sort of covered in bits of pine nut and almond seed and whatever else it was that they had.

249
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,240
 Well, there was another thing where you used to have, and this was more for the aristocracy,

250
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,200
 you would have two baths. So you would have the bath that had the bath bomb in it,

251
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,600
 like the milk and the almond, you'd go in and wash down, then you'd get out and go into your next bath,

252
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,720
 and that would be just the clear water, and you could just wash in the purity of that and then get out.

253
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,800
 According to the Smithsonian, I read this on the website. Sometimes you wouldn't actually get

254
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 into your actual bath. You would wrap yourself in blankets and then you would lie or sit on sticks of

255
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,200
 wood which were balanced across the tub of water. I can't believe this is true. You're being steamed.

256
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,720
 Yeah. Basically, yeah. I mean, I really can't believe this is true. Is that to make you more healthy

257
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
 to consume and to give you a more satisfying crunch? That's why you do it to broccoli, isn't it?

258
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,160
 It's weird that we're talking about baths in this one, and someone we've talked about earlier

259
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:07,520
 in this podcast has quite a strong connection to bathing. Adolf Asman. Adolf Asman, I dread to think

260
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,120
 of the bath that he'd come up with. Gelborden of meat biscuit fame. Also invented a wagon which

261
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,400
 women could wheel down the beach into the shore, and then they could descend from there into the water

262
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,960
 without anyone saying them, which we had in the Victorian era, but he invented that in America,

263
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,880
 that's the ladies to use, so a bathing entrepreneur as well. Do you guys know who invented the

264
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,360
 heart shaped bath tub? No, I can't believe they're not famous for it though. Have you guys heard of

265
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,400
 the heart shaped bath? No. No. Okay, so this is a thing in America, I think, which is where you have

266
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:50,320
 a bath tub which is shaped in the classic heart, you know, so I guess the two of you sit, it's for

267
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,640
 couples. The invention of this thing was a guy called Morris Benjamin Wilkins, and I just, I like him so

268
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,800
 much this guy, because he served in the US Navy, he was in submarines, and then he came out of the navy,

269
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,920
 came out of the submarine and decided to invent a new kind of bath tub, I guess, to preserve a bit

270
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:13,680
 of the submarine experience. And again, that's the opposite. That's the opposite experience.

271
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,240
 In a submarine, you're out of the water. You're right, if you wanted to do that, he would just be in

272
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,960
 the sheath inside the bath. Yeah. He would be in like a metal sheath. Yeah. Okay. Or laying on the

273
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440
 twigs above the bath like your other invention. Did he get fired from being a submarine? Because

274
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:41,360
 you get trying to fill up the submarine. Okay, I badly misspoke. He hated submarines so much

275
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,400
 that he vowed to create the opposite of a submarine, which was a bath. But he, he, if you look him up,

276
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,600
 again, on Wikipedia, it says that he is credited with making the Pocono Mountains in Northeast

277
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,280
 Pennsylvania, the honeymoon capital of the world. Now, I have never heard of these mountains before now,

278
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,480
 so I don't know if they really are. But he invented this bathtub, and then he was so emboldened by it,

279
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,880
 Wilkins, that he went on to create the champagne glass bath tub. This is unbelievable. It's seven,

280
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,080
 it's an actual champagne glass, and you know, one of the shallow ones, not a very high flute.

281
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,160
 That'd be a disaster. One that's based on Murray Antoinette's press. Exactly. Yes. And it's, it's that

282
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,280
 shallow shape of a coupe, and you can both sit in there, but you are seven feet off the ground,

283
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:33,360
 and supported by this incredibly narrow look. Wow. Yeah, it's really cool. How do you get in there?

284
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,160
 Oh, I think you need a ladder to get in there. No, you're in, you're in a much higher champagne

285
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:46,080
 flute, and you kind of roll over the edge into that. Okay, it's time for our final

286
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,520
 fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that dogs can suffer from a

287
00:27:51,520 --> 00:28:01,280
 sprained tail if they get too happy. Sweet. So nice. Yeah, it's sweet, isn't it? So this, I read

288
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,680
 about this in a news article about Rolo, who was a seven-year-old Daxund, who managed to strain his

289
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:14,400
 tail by wagging it so hard. His family are at home a lot more at the moment, and so he's always happy

290
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:20,160
 because his humans are around. And so he kept wagging his tail, and he strained the ligaments.

291
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:26,080
 And it turns out that strained tails is a thing with dogs that you need to worry about. I've never

292
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,560
 had a dog, so I didn't know about this, but apparently it's a problem. How problematic is it? Because

293
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,880
 their tails aren't offering that much, are they? A bit of balance, but if you sprain it, it's not

294
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,360
 like an ankle. I guess it's just more painful than awkward for their lives. It's a thing called

295
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,360
 limber tail. It's also called dead tail, swimmers tail, cold tail, frozen tail, sprained tail,

296
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,560
 limp tail, sprung tail and broken tail. Lots of synonyms for it. Did you say swimmers tail? Swimmers

297
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:00,320
 tail, because that's one of the main times you get a sore tail if you're a dog. If you get swimming

298
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,360
 in water that's too cold or too hot, so either of the flavours, then it narrows the space

299
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:15,280
 where your spinal cord goes through, and that can cause basically the bones to rub against the

300
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,000
 ligaments and stuff, and that can cause problems and cause you to have injured ligaments.

301
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,280
 Ouch, so always request the mineral option for your dog bath.

302
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,720
 It's exactly, yeah. Is this quite common, James? Is this something that a lot of people

303
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
 who have dogs are off to have the vet for? I don't think it's the most common thing in the world,

304
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,280
 but it is definitely a thing that happens if you look on the internet and Google "Engine

305
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:44,560
 Tail." Like I say, I don't have a dog, and I do have a cat and she seems fine. Yeah, it's not as

306
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,640
 common as worms, is it? No, it's less common than worms, but more common than being hit by a meteorite.

307
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,480
 I've grown up with dogs and we never had to take them to the vet for a sprained tail, but then we

308
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,200
 made sure they were never happy. Just didn't want the hassle. It's not just happy that they

309
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,240
 wag their tails when they are, right? It's strong. They do it when they're angry, they do it when

310
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,680
 they're about to attack. There's different kinds of wax, and I was reading, there was a guy

311
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:23,520
 called Dr. Roger Mugford who invented a wagometer, and the wagometer, so Dr. Mugford, probably best known

312
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,840
 for retraining Prince Anne's bull terrier dotty after a bit two boys. That's how I know him.

313
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:36,640
 Best known. Unbelievable. So he created the wagometer, which can indicate whether or not the dog is happy

314
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,920
 or angry or about to attack, and it's a sensor that's attached to its tail. What it's used for, though,

315
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:47,760
 is when they do dog shows, they want to sometimes tell who's the happiest dog, so the wagometer

316
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,000
 is put on the dogs, and it monitors the wag that's going on to then officially scientifically

317
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,520
 using Mugford's wagometer to determine who the happiest is. I think we're all Mugford's here.

318
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,840
 They do definitely have different wags, though, that you can kind of tell, so if it's,

319
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,520
 apparently if they do like a really slow, quite stiff wag, then that's when they're saying, go away,

320
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,520
 I might attack you, I'm anxious. But left and right is the difference, too. So if they I had no idea

321
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,240
 about this before looking this up, that a tail wagging to the left is negative emotions,

322
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,240
 and wagging to the right is happy. And I thought that dogs just wag their tails left and right.

323
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,400
 Yeah. The wag was a wag. I would have thought a wag would be left and right,

324
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:36,720
 then left and right. Exactly. Yeah. Oh no, they lean. They tend to one side, unless our dogs

325
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,920
 are a bit lopsided, but they don't. Is it a stage left or? Is it a dog's left or is it my left?

326
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,760
 It's the dog's left. Yeah. Is that important to know? It's from the perspective of the dog,

327
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,480
 because it's about brain hemispheres, right? The same is in Yemen. So amazingly, they've got similar

328
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,680
 brain hemisphere responsibilities as we do. And so when they're wagging to the right and they're happy,

329
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,280
 that's because the left side of their brain is kind of active when they're feeling relaxed and chill.

330
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,120
 And then the right side of their brain is active when it's an emergency. And so that's why they

331
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,040
 then wag the left. That's where, because whenever I do the hoki-koki, whenever I put the right

332
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,840
 leg in, it always feels really relaxed. But then as soon as I put the left leg in, I feel really anxious.

333
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:25,520
 You're misaligned. There are researchers at Keo University. They have invented a tale for humans.

334
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:33,600
 That's great. So a full-sized tale for humans. And the idea is that it will help you to walk around

335
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,520
 bend over and anything that you might find a little bit tough to do because your body has

336
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:45,520
 things that it can't do. The tale will just help balance you. When you say a full-sized tale,

337
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,480
 do you mean are we talking kangaroo length or are we talking dog length? More kangaroo-y than dog,

338
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,840
 because it has to balance your entire upper body. So let's say you're running a bath and you have

339
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,840
 to bend over. I've got a shower kind of screen next to my bath. So it's kind of hard to bend

340
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,160
 around and turn my bath on without getting in the bath. But if I had a tale, I could do it easily,

341
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:10,480
 because that would just balance me out. And I could kind of bend my body in any direction. And it

342
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,520
 might be useful, especially for elderly people who have, like, limited mobility. It might help them

343
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,680
 to bend over and reach things that they can't normally reach. So it might be that when you get to a

344
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,920
 certain age, you get a tale attached. That would be amazing. Something to look forward to.

345
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,280
 It's not surgically attached, is it? They just sort of strap it on you. At the moment, it's strap-on.

346
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:39,920
 Well, that'll bring a bit of spice to the 70th birthday party, won't it?

347
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:47,520
 Granddad, we bought you a strap-on. It's a hell of an intimidating strap-on to walk in a room on

348
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,440
 kangaroo length. Whoa. You've got it on the wrong side, Granddad.

349
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:01,600
 It's supposed to be sticking out the back. Oh, Jesus. Oh, dear. Some sheep, when they're nursing

350
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,240
 they're young. They get so carried away grooming newborn lambs that they lick off their entire tails.

351
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,720
 Wow. They sort of chew them. They're chewing the larger chew out some of the debris in their fur,

352
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,400
 but they really love them. You know, sometimes a parent, if you really love your baby,

353
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,960
 you've got a baby, Dan. You kind of want to sort of bite it. But they're in, they'd like that,

354
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,360
 and they accidentally chew off their tail. Dan, this child's leg is made of condensed milk, so it's a bit

355
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:32,080
 easier for him. That is remarkable, though. Like, wow. You'd resent your parent. Do you know why

356
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,240
 rabbits have white tails? No. I've always thought. It does seem stupid. Because whenever you see a

357
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,800
 rabbit running around in the countryside, they're really easy to spot because they have this white,

358
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
 fluffy tail that jumps around. Yeah. And you can see them from anywhere, so you would think that

359
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,960
 a fox would have the same skill, right? Well, it turns out that while you do notice them immediately,

360
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,480
 they're really good for kind of tricking you as to which direction rabbits go.

361
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,360
 Because if you do see a rabbit running away, they kind of dart from left to right, from left to right.

362
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,560
 And so when they're directly in front of you, you see the tail, but as soon as they dodge to the left,

363
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,800
 or the right, you can't see the tail anymore. You can only see the dark, but you can't see the light

364
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,440
 bit. So for a second, you can't tell whether they've gone left or right. So basically,

365
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,280
 confuses any predators. So that's so good. Yeah, it's really good.

366
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,440
 Tail decoys and animals are so fascinating, like how, you know, how lizards can just drop their

367
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,480
 tail off. I was reading about geckos and the fact that the way that their tails are made up,

368
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,320
 they're kind of like toilet paper. They're kind of serrated already. They're pre-serrated, so that

369
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,520
 they help the process of the tail to be bitten off by clenching muscles. They're actually

370
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,160
 actively part of it, which is why if a gecko is already dead, it's much harder to bite off its tail,

371
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,000
 because it's not helping the animal eating it to do it. Yeah. And there was this really cool thing,

372
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,720
 which is it's very fatty, their tails. And so if the predator then pursues the gecko and the

373
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,200
 gecko still gets away, the gecko will then go back and eat the tail, because it's so fatty,

374
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,120
 it's got so much nutrients in it. Yeah, so it's effectively also an emergency meal for them.

375
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,000
 Do we know if they sort of cry as they're doing it? Because I think if you had to eat your own limb to

376
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,440
 survive, you would. Yeah. Crocodile tears, but even so. Actually, the longest tail in nature is a

377
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,680
 lizard, isn't it? Which can be deposited at will. It's the Asian grass lizard, which looks so funny.

378
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,080
 It looks like a child got carried away when drawing the tail. So its tail, its tail is 25 centimeters,

379
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:38,400
 which is over three times the length of its body. It's so sweet. And I also quite like the term,

380
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,920
 the terminology when they're talking about the length of lizards compared to their tails,

381
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,760
 they talk about snout to vent. Snout to vent, length is six centimeters. Is the vent the bottom? The

382
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,320
 vent is the bottom, yes, from which you vent air and other things. I just like that phrase, how

383
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,560
 tall is he snout to vent? Yeah, that's true actually, because people who have long legs

384
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,200
 is like having a long tail, it's not as important, is it? Yeah. The most important bit is from your

385
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,120
 nose to your anus. Yeah. That's really what happens below that is just incidental. I agree. All these

386
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:25,760
 basket bull is bragging. Snout to vent, they're barely different to us. Okay, that's it, that's all

387
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,680
 of our facts. Thank you so much for listening. If you'd like to get in contact with any of us about

388
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,440
 the things that we've said over the course of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

389
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,400
 I'm on @Streiberland, James. @JamesHarkin, Andy @AndruhunterM, and Shazinsky. You can email

390
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,080
 podcast@QI.com. Yeah, but you could go to our group account at no such thing or our website. No such

391
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,640
 thing as a fish.com. We've got everything up there from all of our previous episodes, and when we

392
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,120
 say all, we mean all. Every single one that disappeared from the internet a couple of years ago is

393
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,760
 back up there, so there's over now a hundred episodes for you to re-listen to from the first and

394
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,720
 second years of fish. And also, if you'd like to buy the cassette or the vinyl, they're there too.

395
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,880
 And we will be back again next week with another working from home episode. Guys, we really hope

396
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,840
 you're doing okay. Stay home, stay safe, love to your family. We'll see you again next week. Goodbye.

397
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:27,120
 Let's say, for instance, oh, I get hear birds. Yeah, I can too. Yeah, me too. Yeah.

398
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,440
 Anna, can you hear birds in the foreground? Is that a problem? That's a problem, isn't it?

399
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,000
 I'm recording outside the space. Maybe next time, don't keep fish and chips next to your computer.

400
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,600
 Anna, is this your pitch to be on Tested Island dish?

401
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
 [laughter]
