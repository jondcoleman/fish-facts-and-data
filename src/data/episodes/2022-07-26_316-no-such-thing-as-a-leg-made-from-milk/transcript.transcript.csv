00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi everybody, before we start this week's podcast, just a quick reminder to remain indoors,"
00:00:04,00:00:11,"and also to say we have an announcement to make. A few weeks ago, as some of you may know,"
00:00:11,00:00:19,we put up back online the second complete year of fish. We put up 52 episodes. We are now doing
00:00:19,00:00:26,"the same thing with the first complete year of fish. Those episodes are all going back up online,"
00:00:26,00:00:31,and they are a kind of insight into how the podcast started in the first place.
00:00:31,00:00:36,"There's lots of crazy brilliant stuff on there, and if you're listening to reverse chronological"
00:00:36,00:00:41,"order, you could notice the sound quality, audibly diminish, like week on week, as we get back to"
00:00:41,00:00:45,the first episode where we had a single microphone and we recorded it in a cupboard.
00:00:45,00:00:51,"So if you'd like to check that out, please do so. There is another amazing thing you can get."
00:00:51,00:00:56,"When we first put out the first year of fish on sale, it had a special accompanying vinyl LP,"
00:00:56,00:01:03,"which was brilliant, and that came with a bonus episode that we recorded. That vinyl is going on"
00:01:03,00:01:08,"a special flash sale this weekend. It's going to be just 12 quid, and you can check it out at no such"
00:01:08,00:01:14,"thing as a fish.com. Also, of course, the cassette tape USB that we did with the complete second"
00:01:14,00:01:18,"year of fish is up there too, if you want to check it out. They're both great fun, and we love"
00:01:18,00:01:24,"working with the companies who made them and made them a reality, so do check them out and enjoy"
00:01:24,00:01:34,"the episodes, and enjoy this episode. Oh, with the show."
00:01:34,00:01:47,"Hello, and welcome to another working from home episode of no such thing as a fish,"
00:01:47,00:01:52,"a weekly podcast. My name is Dan Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anacizinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:01:52,00:01:57,"and James Harkin. And once again, we have gathered around our microphones with our four favorite"
00:01:57,00:02:04,"facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go. Starting with you, Andy."
00:02:04,00:02:10,"My fact is that the inventor of condensed milk, Gail Borden, had previously tried inventing a biscuit"
00:02:10,00:02:19,"made of meat. Sounds delicious. I don't like condensed milk, but I've read about this meat biscuit,"
00:02:19,00:02:26,"and it sounds amazing. It kind of sounds a bit like dog food, I think, but for people."
00:02:26,00:02:33,"That doesn't sound amazing, but I guess we have different tastes. He was alive in the mid-19th century,"
00:02:33,00:02:39,"and there were all these problems about preserving food at the time, and feeding large numbers of"
00:02:39,00:02:44,"people at a distance, or at a distance of time, so especially feeding your armies, things like this."
00:02:44,00:02:50,"This was a couple of decades before the Civil War, so he would have known there was a Civil War"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"coming, needed to feed people for that. He had amazing powers of foresight, didn't he, this inventor?"
00:02:55,00:03:02,"Yeah, I mean, incredible, actually. Sort of weird, he didn't make his money out of that, but he invented"
00:03:02,00:03:08,"so much stuff. And one of the things he invented was a beef broth, which he then evaporated into"
00:03:08,00:03:15,"this kind of syrup, and you could either fry or bake that syrup into a biscuit, and it was a universally"
00:03:15,00:03:20,"derided, not actually not, you know, the scientific American said it was one of the best discoveries"
00:03:20,00:03:26,"of modern times. Okay, that was a good review. It also won a gold medal at the Great Exhibition"
00:03:26,00:03:33,"in 1851, but the army tried it, and they declared it was not only unpalatable, but failed to appease"
00:03:33,00:03:39,"the craving of hunger, producing headache, nausea, and great muscular depression. Picky, picky."
00:03:39,00:03:47,But can we talk about some of the other stuff that bored and invented? Because he was incredible.
00:03:47,00:03:52,"So lots of his relatives, very sadly, died of yellow fever. His mother, his wife and his son had"
00:03:52,00:03:57,"all passed away because of yellow fever. So it was a summer disease, predominantly, and one thing he"
00:03:57,00:04:03,decided to invent was a giant refrigerator to keep people in until they got better. That didn't
00:04:03,00:04:12,work. Did you read about the amphibious machine he invented? The Teretqueus. Yeah. It was
00:04:12,00:04:17,"basically one of those things that you get on the Thames in London, wasn't it? Well, like a"
00:04:17,00:04:23,Dock ribbitor. It was a Dock ribbitor. It was built for prairies. It was like a wagon that could ride
00:04:23,00:04:29,"you along the prairies, but then it transformed into a boat at the click of a button or the erection"
00:04:29,00:04:35,"of a sail, I guess, once it hit the water. It was horse drawn, wasn't it, as well? Yes. So I guess the"
00:04:35,00:04:41,"horse stayed on shore. No, you then attached seahorses to it once it got in the water. Yeah, the poor"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"horse didn't get to ride the boat, but it was pretty unsuccessful. I think on its first outing,"
00:04:45,00:04:50,"all its occupants ended up in the water, right? Oh, no. Yeah, it did. So he went out a couple times"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"to the ocean. One time, as you say, it tipped over the people into the ocean. Other times, they were"
00:04:54,00:04:59,"just too afraid to let him take the boat in. And I was reading an account of that, which gives you an"
00:04:59,00:05:04,"idea of other food inventions that he had, because he hosted a dinner before he took everyone out on"
00:05:04,00:05:09,"this boat. And there's a quote, which is from which he talked about the food that he'd concocted"
00:05:09,00:05:14,"that evening out of material, from which if you knew what they were, you would turn to loathing and"
00:05:14,00:05:21,horror. I have transmuted even the dirt itself into delicacies. That was dinner before the horror
00:05:21,00:05:28,"show boat experience. That's brilliant. Interestingly, you know when he invented this biscuit. I just"
00:05:28,00:05:32,"want to go back to the biscuit, which I do think is pretty cool. Yeah, so he invented this biscuit."
00:05:32,00:05:37,"And then he went to the Great Exhibition in 1851. And everyone said it was amazing. Like I said,"
00:05:37,00:05:41,the scientific American said it was amazing. Everyone thought this was going to be the next big
00:05:41,00:05:47,"thing. And so he opened up a big office in New York. Okay, where he could sell these biscuits"
00:05:47,00:05:56,"from. And it was opened on Maiden Lane in New York. And it was, and I can't quite tell from Google maps."
00:05:56,00:06:01,"It was either the same building or it's next door to the building where the Hamilton's song,"
00:06:01,00:06:07,the room where it happens. That room is in a building on the same street and it's either the same
00:06:07,00:06:12,"one or it's next door to it. So are you implying that the song, the room where it happened, is about"
00:06:12,00:06:18,"the room where the meat biscuit almost took off. The original probably was, right? It probably was"
00:06:18,00:06:22,"about the meat biscuit and then they thought, oh, you know what, it's not doing as well as we thought,"
00:06:22,00:06:26,let's change this musical from what used to be about the meat biscuit business. Now let's add
00:06:26,00:06:33,into something about Hamilton. If only. I didn't know what the room where it happens is. I assumed
00:06:33,00:06:37,"it was a metaphor of some kind, but you're saying there's an actual room. And Anna knows the story"
00:06:37,00:06:43,"better than me, but I think is it not where they all got together and decided that the country would"
00:06:43,00:06:48,"be a federal system or something like that? It was the bargaining moment, I think, between Hamilton and"
00:06:48,00:06:55,Jefferson and his second in command who was Madison. And Burr was not allowed into the meeting.
00:06:55,00:07:00,And that's the meeting he wanted to be in because that said that's where power was and meat biscuits.
00:07:00,00:07:06,"Madison actually came out of that with his own set of demands, which is that he wanted to have"
00:07:06,00:07:11,some square gardens named after them in New York. So everyone got what they wanted a little bit.
00:07:11,00:07:19,"Back to Gail Borden for a second. Did you find, so quite a few of the biogs of him say he was"
00:07:19,00:07:25,Biven eccentric and he used to ride around Galveston on a pet bull apparently and he was quite an
00:07:25,00:07:31,"important guy. So he lived in this place called Galveston in Texas, but he actually also helped design"
00:07:31,00:07:37,"it apparently. So this is in 1829, he moved there and then he helped set up all the streets of this place."
00:07:37,00:07:41,And the way they measured streets was it was by the number of longhorn cattle that could move a
00:07:41,00:07:46,"breast down the street. So it shows in Texas at the time what was most important, the most important"
00:07:46,00:07:51,thing to transport. So a hundred foot wide street could fit 14 head of longhorn cattle.
00:07:51,00:07:56,"Wow. And then Borden basically then went on to make his condensed milk, didn't he?"
00:07:56,00:08:01,Andy. Yes. And that's what we know him best for today. So what we know and love him for today.
00:08:01,00:08:06,"But then Borden's milk is like I think in America still perhaps one of the big brands, is it?"
00:08:06,00:08:10,"Yeah it is, but it wasn't called Borden's until after he died I believe. He was actually inspired"
00:08:10,00:08:15,"to make the condensed milk on the way back from collecting his prize for the meat biscuit, right?"
00:08:15,00:08:19,He was obviously on a roll. Yeah. It was on the boat on the way back from London and there was cows
00:08:19,00:08:25,there were cows on board to help feed the young kids on board and they were too distressed to produce
00:08:25,00:08:30,their milk selfishly because of all the waves. And so a lot of the kids on board died and he
00:08:30,00:08:34,thought we've got to have a way of getting milk that doesn't require sucking out the orders of a cow
00:08:34,00:08:39,directly. Well the reason that he became so popular is that his milk was way better than
00:08:39,00:08:45,everyone else's because he had what was called the dairy man's 10 commandments. And if anyone was
00:08:45,00:08:51,going to sell him milk to condense it had to fit him with certain things that he said had to happen.
00:08:51,00:08:56,So for instance they had to wash the cow's udders before milking and they had to sweep the
00:08:56,00:09:01,barns clean and they had to dry the strainer's every morning and night and stuff like that. But he
00:09:01,00:09:05,came up with these specific rules that you had to adhere to if you wanted to give him milk.
00:09:05,00:09:10,"Well he was working on his milk round about the time where milk was incredibly controversial,"
00:09:10,00:09:15,"wasn't he? Because this is the 1850s and I didn't know about this thing, the great milk swill"
00:09:15,00:09:23,"crisis, but I'm sure everyone else knows about it, which is basically this thing happened where until"
00:09:23,00:09:27,industrialisation people really did have a farmer bring a cow round to their door and they'd order
00:09:27,00:09:32,milk from it. So you met the cow and you got to okay it. But with like urbanisation and stuff then
00:09:32,00:09:38,you just had to buy milk without having met the cow firsthand. And so people used to start tampering
00:09:38,00:09:43,"with it. And a major problem was distilleries, always a bit rougish, used to basically set up"
00:09:43,00:09:49,side alleys in dairy farming and they just fill and then they just feed cows all the leftover
00:09:49,00:09:54,"kind of corn, rye, swilly mash and it was really badly infected and they'd sort of the milk would come"
00:09:54,00:09:59,out and it would be a gross watery blue colour and then they'd fill it up with things like chalk
00:09:59,00:10:04,and plaster to make it look white and like real milk. And people were just dying by the bucket load
00:10:04,00:10:09,because these incompetent whiskey makers were trying to give the milk. And so there was this huge
00:10:09,00:10:14,huge crisis and huge controversy and once they cleared that up I think death rates went down about
00:10:14,00:10:19,"five times in New York. Wow. That's so interesting about, sorry to pick up on a very minor thing you said"
00:10:19,00:10:26,"in that really, it's quite intense, I think about my exciting. But meeting the cow they gave you milk"
00:10:26,00:10:33,"and sort of knowing its name, that's why I guess they must have the spokes cow that they have for"
00:10:33,00:10:38,"orders milk which is LC. Yes. Because you would feel like okay LC's in charge here, she's"
00:10:38,00:10:43,she's looking after so they've had over 50 LC's over the year. Do you think everyone in America
00:10:43,00:10:49,thinks that they're all getting milk from this one exhaust account? She puts on such a brave front
00:10:49,00:10:57,"but my girl, she's naked. Yeah. We've mentioned LC before. Anyway, like incredibly briefly, we mentioned"
00:10:57,00:11:03,her when we were talking about I think she was censored because she had others and LC has undergone a
00:11:03,00:11:09,bit of a transformation from the first time she appeared. She used to be a complete cow. She used to be
00:11:09,00:11:15,"actually a cow and then she's kind of started, she was put on her hind legs and she was dressed in"
00:11:15,00:11:20,pinnifles and things and so she was in the kind of uncanny valley between human and cow and I think
00:11:20,00:11:26,"Hollywood censored her because she was a bit too sexy that for a cat, sexier than a cow should be"
00:11:26,00:11:30,basically. You do want to be turned on while you're trying to eat your breakfast cereal. No way.
00:11:31,00:11:37,"The fake cow. Okay. I do actually just if we're on milk, I have one more thing about condensed milk"
00:11:37,00:11:42,because I think I might have found an earlier example of condensed milk which is St. Cuthbert.
00:11:42,00:11:51,"St. Cuthbert was alive in the 7th century AD and he, according to legend, he chopped his own leg off"
00:11:51,00:11:58,after speaking angrily to his parents and it was then replaced with a cast that was made of milk
00:11:58,00:12:04,and so I think that is a possible example of earlier milk conversation. What are you talking about?
00:12:04,00:12:11,"So, you know, miracles happen and if you've cut your own leg off because you've been speaking"
00:12:11,00:12:14,"angrily to your parents and you're a morseful, sometimes God will grant you a new leg and his new"
00:12:14,00:12:20,"one happened to be made of milk. Anyway, there's one weird connection which is that there is a St. Cuthbert's"
00:12:20,00:12:26,cooperative society which was a shop. It's now called Scottmid so it's one of the big Scottish
00:12:26,00:12:38,"grocery shops and they hired in 1944 Sean Connery as a milkman today. No way. Yeah. So, so what's the link"
00:12:38,00:12:49,"again? Well, the Supermarket. It's called St. Cuthbert's cooperative. And Sean Connery got to do"
00:12:49,00:12:56,"that. Has he got a leg made of milk? Yeah, it's the man with the milk he liked. They see"
00:12:56,00:13:01,it with the man with the golden gun. It was one of Cue's less popular gadgets.
00:13:01,00:13:12,"Okay, it is time for fact number two and that is my fact. My fact this week is that in 2014"
00:13:12,00:13:18,four non-related economists with the surname Goodman published a paper about the economics of
00:13:18,00:13:25,surname sharing. The paper was titled A Few Good Men. Very clever. You've got to wonder what came
00:13:25,00:13:31,first that title or any of the rest of it. Actually none of them was called Goodman when they first
00:13:31,00:13:36,"started the paper. They all had name changes. Well, they were very strict about that actually because"
00:13:36,00:13:41,they claimed that this is the first paper co-authored by four non-related surname sharing economists
00:13:41,00:13:45,and there was a thought that this could be challenged because there was a paper published by
00:13:45,00:13:53,"Scarbeck, Scarbeck, Scarbeck and Scarbeck back in 2012. But they disqualified it from beating them"
00:13:53,00:13:57,to it because they said it was written by two brothers and there are two wives. So they argued that
00:13:57,00:14:04,first the fact that the two wives had their maiden names before they started the paper and then
00:14:04,00:14:10,took on the name Scarbeck disqualifies them. So they did it during the research and also one of the
00:14:10,00:14:16,brothers and his wife are not economists. They're attorneys and so that also knocked them out. They were
00:14:16,00:14:22,very thorough. So in this paper they looked at how likely it is for other groups of economists with
00:14:22,00:14:29,"the same name to share papers, didn't they? They had a data set with loads of names of economists and"
00:14:29,00:14:34,they found that 45% of them share a surname with at least one other economist. So I think that it
00:14:34,00:14:40,might be helpful. But the main reason that they think this whole thing might help is that if you
00:14:40,00:14:45,have loads of people with the same name then you don't have that problem where the paper is by Dan
00:14:45,00:14:52,Schreiber et al and we don't see who the other people who wrote the paper are. Why do they just pluralise
00:14:52,00:14:58,this surname basically? By four Goodmans. They just say by Goodman et al but they don't refer to exactly
00:14:58,00:15:06,which Goodman is the first Goodman. So actually everyone is getting equal billing. It's like if we
00:15:06,00:15:11,all changed our name to Toshinsky and then we went to do a gig and then in big lights on the
00:15:11,00:15:15,"theatre it said Toshinsky, Toshinsky, Toshinsky, Toshinsky and Toshinsky. We wouldn't know who was the"
00:15:15,00:15:20,"top of the bill. Of course it would be me but we wouldn't know who it was. Yeah, exactly. I'm not"
00:15:20,00:15:26,fully for that. I'm not rocking up to a fish gig with Harkin and et al. Nice try buddy.
00:15:26,00:15:30,I wouldn't think about surnames and actually this is a Beatles fact so Dan I'm probably going to
00:15:30,00:15:37,defer to you on this one. But is it the case that Paul McCartney wrote yesterday? Yes.
00:15:37,00:15:45,This quiz is easy. All right. Next. Okay. No but I read that John Lennon became furious when he
00:15:45,00:15:50,was in hotels because quite a lot of the time the person playing the piano in the hotel would play
00:15:50,00:15:56,yesterday as a tribute to him and he hadn't written any of that song at all. It wasn't a Lennon
00:15:56,00:16:02,"McCartney song. It was just a McCartney song and so that made him furious. Yeah, that's true. Yeah."
00:16:02,00:16:10,"So if you're if you ever see Andy in a hotel and you want to pay tribute to him,"
00:16:10,00:16:14,don't play him the episode of No Switch Things A Fish where Alex Bell was here instead of him
00:16:14,00:16:19,because that'll just annoy him. Exactly. I'll be so angry. I'll be amazed at your piano skills
00:16:19,00:16:27,if you can play that. Go imagine those poor penis getting requests. Do you know episode 313?
00:16:27,00:16:34,"No such thing as a banana with Wi-Fi? It's the same, dude. Everyone's the same."
00:16:34,00:16:42,I'm on surnames in academia and problems at this poses. So the same surname problem is a
00:16:42,00:16:49,"serious issue and it's especially an issue in China because in China there are 200,000 people per"
00:16:49,00:16:55,"unique surname. So they've got far fewer surnames in China and I read a piece written by a Wang,"
00:16:55,00:17:04,"a J Wang, who is saying there are more than 1200 J Wangs in nano-science alone. So this is hell."
00:17:04,00:17:08,"So if you want to find an individual academic, you can't find them because you have, you know,"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"200,000 Wangs to deal with. So now in academia you get something called your orchid, which is"
00:17:13,00:17:19,"standardized now across most journals. So rather than being one of a billion, you know, Smiths,"
00:17:19,00:17:24,"Wangs, you have to have a 16-digit number. But there is an issue because dead scientists probably"
00:17:24,00:17:30,won't sign up to this orchid system because they can't. And so the worry is that now if you're a
00:17:30,00:17:33,"deceased scientist, your academic work is going to become harder and harder to source."
00:17:33,00:17:41,"So have you guys heard of Dick Astman? No, I've never heard of it. He was a gas station employee from"
00:17:41,00:17:47,"Canada and his name, if you look him up on Wikipedia, his name propelled him to celebrity status across"
00:17:47,00:17:56,"North America for four months in 1995. Wow, that is like the, who is it? The Andy Warhol, isn't it? It's"
00:17:56,00:18:02,"there. Everyone has their four months of fame. Yeah, exactly. I think it's because David Letterman"
00:18:02,00:18:06,"found out that there was someone called Dick Astman. He found this so funny that he, you know,"
00:18:06,00:18:14,"kept on referring to him. This became known as Asmania and eventually, eventually, his dad, by the way,"
00:18:14,00:18:19,"was called Adolf Astman, which is amazing. I mean, what an amazing. Yeah. Wow. If you were only"
00:18:19,00:18:24,"allowed to change one of those names, it's so hard to know which shoes."
00:18:24,00:18:35,He became super famous and then he faded into obscurity. But there was another Astman recently who
00:18:35,00:18:40,"got in trouble over a vanity license plate. Another Canadian, I believe, who had Astman on his license plate"
00:18:40,00:18:44,"and the authorities said, ""No, you can't have that."" Anyway, that's that name. I have a very random"
00:18:44,00:18:51,"surname fact while we're just lobbing in some good old surname. I just read this late last night,"
00:18:51,00:18:57,"Silla Black, the singer and TB show host. I found out what her real surname is. Do you guys know"
00:18:57,00:19:04,where her real surname is? No. Silla White. And she only got the name change as a result of a
00:19:04,00:19:09,misprint in a mercy beat newspaper when she was starting out that called her Silla Black. And she
00:19:09,00:19:15,"just went, ""Oh, that's a bit of a misprint, isn't it?"" It's a massive type. Yeah, it's not a type"
00:19:15,00:19:25,"or an old. It's literally the difference between black and white. Yeah, good, cool. But I can't believe"
00:19:25,00:19:30,"she styled it out and just went, ""Oh, yeah, yeah, that's me."" Like, when a boss says your name wrong in"
00:19:30,00:19:35,"a meeting, you just go, ""Okay, I guess I'm Mike for this meeting."" Yeah, she did it for her whole career."
00:19:35,00:19:44,"Okay, it's time for fact number three and that is Anna. My fault this week is that if you wanted to have"
00:19:44,00:19:52,"a bath in Paris in the 1820s, you could have one delivered to your door. This is the bath delivery"
00:19:52,00:19:58,service. Did you have to take the bath outside of the door or could you bring it into your house?
00:19:59,00:20:03,"Oh, what? It was brought into your house. Sorry, so it was delivered to your door and then up your"
00:20:03,00:20:08,stairs and into whatever room you chose to bathe in. So this was called the Bant and Domicille
00:20:08,00:20:14,"and it was so popular in Paris in the 1820s. And yeah, someone would come along, a guy called"
00:20:14,00:20:20,a thermo floor would deliver a bath to your doorway and then they'd also bring these metal rails
00:20:20,00:20:26,"so they could wheel it up the stairs on these rails, plunk it down. They also came with a dressing"
00:20:26,00:20:33,"gown and a towel and you could order your flavour of bath. So if you wanted a hot bath, you would say,"
00:20:33,00:20:37,"if you wanted a refreshing cold bath that I may have been less money, I don't know, but that was"
00:20:37,00:20:42,"also an option. I know when you say flavours, I don't usually associate hot and cold as flavours."
00:20:42,00:20:48,So was there any of the anything else that you could choose like pistachio?
00:20:48,00:20:55,"I think there was one other choice. Mineral. Yeah, it's not again, not a flavour. Mineral is not a flavour."
00:20:56,00:21:00,"Well, I think it spices up bath time a bit if you do refer to them as flavours."
00:21:00,00:21:04,"Turn on the hot flavour, cold flavour. Sure. Try it next time."
00:21:04,00:21:09,I love the fact that they brought a longer towel. That feels like the least important bit of the
00:21:09,00:21:15,entire enterprise. What? So was there a porcelain bath they were bringing? Or was it made of something like?
00:21:15,00:21:20,"Andy, what do you do? Do you just trip dry whenever you get out of the bath? Of course I do."
00:21:20,00:21:24,Of course I do. Just stand in the street letting nature do its work.
00:21:24,00:21:30,"It's very important to bath time to have a towel, obviously."
00:21:30,00:21:34,Do you jump out like a dog and shake all of the water off you?
00:21:34,00:21:38,I just shake it off once and then I'm normal again.
00:21:38,00:21:43,"Sorry, you were saying, was it a porcelain? Anna, was it porcelain?"
00:21:43,00:21:50,"They were made of various different materials. Apparently someone made of leather and some were foldable,"
00:21:50,00:21:57,"pleabla, apparently, said in one article. But I guess if it was leather and you had like a hot"
00:21:57,00:22:02,"flavoured bath then it might what? I don't, maybe they had better technology that we've now forgotten."
00:22:02,00:22:08,"Like secret leather, yeah. Yeah. I love the bath. Your playing is a weird sex game."
00:22:08,00:22:15,I must have been a no questions asked service.
00:22:17,00:22:22,"Anyway, what a great service. It seemed to sort of disappear, as I guess trends do."
00:22:22,00:22:28,I think there were a thousand of these baths for Rent in Paris by the mid-1820s.
00:22:28,00:22:33,And then they receded again. Bathroom was a bit controversial. I think some people thought it was a bit
00:22:33,00:22:38,"lascivious. There was a famous prostitute, a quarter-seff, French quarter-san, who had two baths."
00:22:38,00:22:42,"And that was a bit frowned upon. Like, oh, that's the kind of thing courtesans do."
00:22:42,00:22:47,"And one of her baths that was made of silver, she had three taps."
00:22:48,00:22:51,One of which delivered water and another delivered milk and the other champagne.
00:22:51,00:22:56,"Just on the flavour thing though, because James was saying stuff about, what did you say? Like"
00:22:56,00:23:00,"almond and stuff like that? I said pistachio, but it was just the first flavour that came into it."
00:23:00,00:23:06,"Yeah, but that was a thing. Like, there was the sort of prototype back then of the bath bomb that"
00:23:06,00:23:12,"gives the colour and aroma that you get with them in the form of things like clouded, powdered,"
00:23:12,00:23:19,almond paste. And then milk was another big one. And largely I think that was a modesty thing for women.
00:23:19,00:23:24,"The idea was that you would have the bath, not necessarily in a bathroom, but possibly in an open room."
00:23:24,00:23:28,And so it just created a layer of camouflage to stop your bits from being seen.
00:23:28,00:23:34,"You see that, but I think, let's say you have some nice redox in your bath or something,"
00:23:34,00:23:38,"and it smells of lavender, then you come out of your bath and you smell like lavender."
00:23:39,00:23:44,I probably don't want to smell like milk after you get out of the bath. Don't you know what I mean?
00:23:44,00:23:49,"I like milk. I wouldn't mind smelling like, is the milk fresh? That's the big question."
00:23:49,00:23:52,"To begin with, it will be. That's a really good challenge."
00:23:52,00:23:58,"If you're using the Peyton Murray drip dry method, then over time that milk will curdle."
00:23:58,00:24:03,"Also, I don't know how clean you can claim you are if you're stepping out of the bath and you're"
00:24:03,00:24:08,sort of covered in bits of pine nut and almond seed and whatever else it was that they had.
00:24:08,00:24:12,"Well, there was another thing where you used to have, and this was more for the aristocracy,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"you would have two baths. So you would have the bath that had the bath bomb in it,"
00:24:15,00:24:19,"like the milk and the almond, you'd go in and wash down, then you'd get out and go into your next bath,"
00:24:19,00:24:24,"and that would be just the clear water, and you could just wash in the purity of that and then get out."
00:24:24,00:24:28,"According to the Smithsonian, I read this on the website. Sometimes you wouldn't actually get"
00:24:28,00:24:34,into your actual bath. You would wrap yourself in blankets and then you would lie or sit on sticks of
00:24:34,00:24:41,wood which were balanced across the tub of water. I can't believe this is true. You're being steamed.
00:24:41,00:24:46,"Yeah. Basically, yeah. I mean, I really can't believe this is true. Is that to make you more healthy"
00:24:46,00:24:51,"to consume and to give you a more satisfying crunch? That's why you do it to broccoli, isn't it?"
00:24:51,00:24:58,"It's weird that we're talking about baths in this one, and someone we've talked about earlier"
00:24:58,00:25:07,"in this podcast has quite a strong connection to bathing. Adolf Asman. Adolf Asman, I dread to think"
00:25:07,00:25:15,of the bath that he'd come up with. Gelborden of meat biscuit fame. Also invented a wagon which
00:25:15,00:25:20,"women could wheel down the beach into the shore, and then they could descend from there into the water"
00:25:20,00:25:24,"without anyone saying them, which we had in the Victorian era, but he invented that in America,"
00:25:24,00:25:30,"that's the ladies to use, so a bathing entrepreneur as well. Do you guys know who invented the"
00:25:30,00:25:37,"heart shaped bath tub? No, I can't believe they're not famous for it though. Have you guys heard of"
00:25:37,00:25:44,"the heart shaped bath? No. No. Okay, so this is a thing in America, I think, which is where you have"
00:25:44,00:25:50,"a bath tub which is shaped in the classic heart, you know, so I guess the two of you sit, it's for"
00:25:50,00:25:56,"couples. The invention of this thing was a guy called Morris Benjamin Wilkins, and I just, I like him so"
00:25:56,00:26:02,"much this guy, because he served in the US Navy, he was in submarines, and then he came out of the navy,"
00:26:02,00:26:07,"came out of the submarine and decided to invent a new kind of bath tub, I guess, to preserve a bit"
00:26:07,00:26:13,"of the submarine experience. And again, that's the opposite. That's the opposite experience."
00:26:15,00:26:22,"In a submarine, you're out of the water. You're right, if you wanted to do that, he would just be in"
00:26:22,00:26:28,the sheath inside the bath. Yeah. He would be in like a metal sheath. Yeah. Okay. Or laying on the
00:26:28,00:26:33,twigs above the bath like your other invention. Did he get fired from being a submarine? Because
00:26:33,00:26:41,"you get trying to fill up the submarine. Okay, I badly misspoke. He hated submarines so much"
00:26:41,00:26:48,"that he vowed to create the opposite of a submarine, which was a bath. But he, he, if you look him up,"
00:26:48,00:26:53,"again, on Wikipedia, it says that he is credited with making the Pocono Mountains in Northeast"
00:26:53,00:26:59,"Pennsylvania, the honeymoon capital of the world. Now, I have never heard of these mountains before now,"
00:26:59,00:27:04,"so I don't know if they really are. But he invented this bathtub, and then he was so emboldened by it,"
00:27:04,00:27:10,"Wilkins, that he went on to create the champagne glass bath tub. This is unbelievable. It's seven,"
00:27:10,00:27:16,"it's an actual champagne glass, and you know, one of the shallow ones, not a very high flute."
00:27:16,00:27:22,"That'd be a disaster. One that's based on Murray Antoinette's press. Exactly. Yes. And it's, it's that"
00:27:22,00:27:27,"shallow shape of a coupe, and you can both sit in there, but you are seven feet off the ground,"
00:27:27,00:27:33,"and supported by this incredibly narrow look. Wow. Yeah, it's really cool. How do you get in there?"
00:27:33,00:27:38,"Oh, I think you need a ladder to get in there. No, you're in, you're in a much higher champagne"
00:27:38,00:27:46,"flute, and you kind of roll over the edge into that. Okay, it's time for our final"
00:27:46,00:27:51,"fact of the show, and that is James. Okay, my fact this week is that dogs can suffer from a"
00:27:51,00:28:01,"sprained tail if they get too happy. Sweet. So nice. Yeah, it's sweet, isn't it? So this, I read"
00:28:01,00:28:07,"about this in a news article about Rolo, who was a seven-year-old Daxund, who managed to strain his"
00:28:07,00:28:14,"tail by wagging it so hard. His family are at home a lot more at the moment, and so he's always happy"
00:28:14,00:28:20,"because his humans are around. And so he kept wagging his tail, and he strained the ligaments."
00:28:20,00:28:26,And it turns out that strained tails is a thing with dogs that you need to worry about. I've never
00:28:26,00:28:30,"had a dog, so I didn't know about this, but apparently it's a problem. How problematic is it? Because"
00:28:30,00:28:34,"their tails aren't offering that much, are they? A bit of balance, but if you sprain it, it's not"
00:28:34,00:28:41,like an ankle. I guess it's just more painful than awkward for their lives. It's a thing called
00:28:41,00:28:47,"limber tail. It's also called dead tail, swimmers tail, cold tail, frozen tail, sprained tail,"
00:28:47,00:28:54,"limp tail, sprung tail and broken tail. Lots of synonyms for it. Did you say swimmers tail? Swimmers"
00:28:54,00:29:00,"tail, because that's one of the main times you get a sore tail if you're a dog. If you get swimming"
00:29:00,00:29:07,"in water that's too cold or too hot, so either of the flavours, then it narrows the space"
00:29:07,00:29:15,"where your spinal cord goes through, and that can cause basically the bones to rub against the"
00:29:15,00:29:20,"ligaments and stuff, and that can cause problems and cause you to have injured ligaments."
00:29:20,00:29:23,"Ouch, so always request the mineral option for your dog bath."
00:29:23,00:29:28,"It's exactly, yeah. Is this quite common, James? Is this something that a lot of people"
00:29:28,00:29:33,"who have dogs are off to have the vet for? I don't think it's the most common thing in the world,"
00:29:33,00:29:37,"but it is definitely a thing that happens if you look on the internet and Google ""Engine"
00:29:37,00:29:44,"Tail."" Like I say, I don't have a dog, and I do have a cat and she seems fine. Yeah, it's not as"
00:29:44,00:29:50,"common as worms, is it? No, it's less common than worms, but more common than being hit by a meteorite."
00:29:50,00:29:56,"I've grown up with dogs and we never had to take them to the vet for a sprained tail, but then we"
00:29:56,00:30:03,made sure they were never happy. Just didn't want the hassle. It's not just happy that they
00:30:03,00:30:08,"wag their tails when they are, right? It's strong. They do it when they're angry, they do it when"
00:30:08,00:30:13,"they're about to attack. There's different kinds of wax, and I was reading, there was a guy"
00:30:13,00:30:23,"called Dr. Roger Mugford who invented a wagometer, and the wagometer, so Dr. Mugford, probably best known"
00:30:23,00:30:27,for retraining Prince Anne's bull terrier dotty after a bit two boys. That's how I know him.
00:30:27,00:30:36,"Best known. Unbelievable. So he created the wagometer, which can indicate whether or not the dog is happy"
00:30:36,00:30:41,"or angry or about to attack, and it's a sensor that's attached to its tail. What it's used for, though,"
00:30:41,00:30:47,"is when they do dog shows, they want to sometimes tell who's the happiest dog, so the wagometer"
00:30:47,00:30:54,"is put on the dogs, and it monitors the wag that's going on to then officially scientifically"
00:30:54,00:30:59,using Mugford's wagometer to determine who the happiest is. I think we're all Mugford's here.
00:30:59,00:31:05,"They do definitely have different wags, though, that you can kind of tell, so if it's,"
00:31:05,00:31:11,"apparently if they do like a really slow, quite stiff wag, then that's when they're saying, go away,"
00:31:11,00:31:17,"I might attack you, I'm anxious. But left and right is the difference, too. So if they I had no idea"
00:31:17,00:31:22,"about this before looking this up, that a tail wagging to the left is negative emotions,"
00:31:22,00:31:26,and wagging to the right is happy. And I thought that dogs just wag their tails left and right.
00:31:26,00:31:30,"Yeah. The wag was a wag. I would have thought a wag would be left and right,"
00:31:30,00:31:36,"then left and right. Exactly. Yeah. Oh no, they lean. They tend to one side, unless our dogs"
00:31:36,00:31:41,"are a bit lopsided, but they don't. Is it a stage left or? Is it a dog's left or is it my left?"
00:31:41,00:31:45,"It's the dog's left. Yeah. Is that important to know? It's from the perspective of the dog,"
00:31:45,00:31:50,"because it's about brain hemispheres, right? The same is in Yemen. So amazingly, they've got similar"
00:31:50,00:31:55,"brain hemisphere responsibilities as we do. And so when they're wagging to the right and they're happy,"
00:31:55,00:32:01,that's because the left side of their brain is kind of active when they're feeling relaxed and chill.
00:32:01,00:32:05,And then the right side of their brain is active when it's an emergency. And so that's why they
00:32:05,00:32:09,"then wag the left. That's where, because whenever I do the hoki-koki, whenever I put the right"
00:32:09,00:32:13,"leg in, it always feels really relaxed. But then as soon as I put the left leg in, I feel really anxious."
00:32:13,00:32:25,You're misaligned. There are researchers at Keo University. They have invented a tale for humans.
00:32:25,00:32:33,That's great. So a full-sized tale for humans. And the idea is that it will help you to walk around
00:32:33,00:32:39,bend over and anything that you might find a little bit tough to do because your body has
00:32:39,00:32:45,"things that it can't do. The tale will just help balance you. When you say a full-sized tale,"
00:32:45,00:32:50,"do you mean are we talking kangaroo length or are we talking dog length? More kangaroo-y than dog,"
00:32:50,00:32:55,because it has to balance your entire upper body. So let's say you're running a bath and you have
00:32:55,00:33:01,to bend over. I've got a shower kind of screen next to my bath. So it's kind of hard to bend
00:33:01,00:33:06,"around and turn my bath on without getting in the bath. But if I had a tale, I could do it easily,"
00:33:06,00:33:10,because that would just balance me out. And I could kind of bend my body in any direction. And it
00:33:10,00:33:17,"might be useful, especially for elderly people who have, like, limited mobility. It might help them"
00:33:17,00:33:21,to bend over and reach things that they can't normally reach. So it might be that when you get to a
00:33:21,00:33:27,"certain age, you get a tale attached. That would be amazing. Something to look forward to."
00:33:27,00:33:33,"It's not surgically attached, is it? They just sort of strap it on you. At the moment, it's strap-on."
00:33:33,00:33:39,"Well, that'll bring a bit of spice to the 70th birthday party, won't it?"
00:33:39,00:33:47,"Granddad, we bought you a strap-on. It's a hell of an intimidating strap-on to walk in a room on"
00:33:47,00:33:51,"kangaroo length. Whoa. You've got it on the wrong side, Granddad."
00:33:52,00:34:01,"It's supposed to be sticking out the back. Oh, Jesus. Oh, dear. Some sheep, when they're nursing"
00:34:01,00:34:06,they're young. They get so carried away grooming newborn lambs that they lick off their entire tails.
00:34:06,00:34:12,"Wow. They sort of chew them. They're chewing the larger chew out some of the debris in their fur,"
00:34:12,00:34:16,"but they really love them. You know, sometimes a parent, if you really love your baby,"
00:34:16,00:34:20,"you've got a baby, Dan. You kind of want to sort of bite it. But they're in, they'd like that,"
00:34:20,00:34:25,"and they accidentally chew off their tail. Dan, this child's leg is made of condensed milk, so it's a bit"
00:34:25,00:34:32,"easier for him. That is remarkable, though. Like, wow. You'd resent your parent. Do you know why"
00:34:32,00:34:38,rabbits have white tails? No. I've always thought. It does seem stupid. Because whenever you see a
00:34:38,00:34:42,"rabbit running around in the countryside, they're really easy to spot because they have this white,"
00:34:42,00:34:46,"fluffy tail that jumps around. Yeah. And you can see them from anywhere, so you would think that"
00:34:46,00:34:52,"a fox would have the same skill, right? Well, it turns out that while you do notice them immediately,"
00:34:52,00:34:56,they're really good for kind of tricking you as to which direction rabbits go.
00:34:56,00:35:01,"Because if you do see a rabbit running away, they kind of dart from left to right, from left to right."
00:35:01,00:35:06,"And so when they're directly in front of you, you see the tail, but as soon as they dodge to the left,"
00:35:06,00:35:10,"or the right, you can't see the tail anymore. You can only see the dark, but you can't see the light"
00:35:10,00:35:15,"bit. So for a second, you can't tell whether they've gone left or right. So basically,"
00:35:15,00:35:19,"confuses any predators. So that's so good. Yeah, it's really good."
00:35:19,00:35:25,"Tail decoys and animals are so fascinating, like how, you know, how lizards can just drop their"
00:35:25,00:35:32,"tail off. I was reading about geckos and the fact that the way that their tails are made up,"
00:35:32,00:35:38,"they're kind of like toilet paper. They're kind of serrated already. They're pre-serrated, so that"
00:35:38,00:35:43,they help the process of the tail to be bitten off by clenching muscles. They're actually
00:35:43,00:35:48,"actively part of it, which is why if a gecko is already dead, it's much harder to bite off its tail,"
00:35:48,00:35:54,"because it's not helping the animal eating it to do it. Yeah. And there was this really cool thing,"
00:35:54,00:35:58,"which is it's very fatty, their tails. And so if the predator then pursues the gecko and the"
00:35:58,00:36:03,"gecko still gets away, the gecko will then go back and eat the tail, because it's so fatty,"
00:36:03,00:36:09,"it's got so much nutrients in it. Yeah, so it's effectively also an emergency meal for them."
00:36:09,00:36:14,Do we know if they sort of cry as they're doing it? Because I think if you had to eat your own limb to
00:36:14,00:36:19,"survive, you would. Yeah. Crocodile tears, but even so. Actually, the longest tail in nature is a"
00:36:19,00:36:25,"lizard, isn't it? Which can be deposited at will. It's the Asian grass lizard, which looks so funny."
00:36:25,00:36:32,"It looks like a child got carried away when drawing the tail. So its tail, its tail is 25 centimeters,"
00:36:32,00:36:38,"which is over three times the length of its body. It's so sweet. And I also quite like the term,"
00:36:38,00:36:41,"the terminology when they're talking about the length of lizards compared to their tails,"
00:36:41,00:36:49,"they talk about snout to vent. Snout to vent, length is six centimeters. Is the vent the bottom? The"
00:36:49,00:36:56,"vent is the bottom, yes, from which you vent air and other things. I just like that phrase, how"
00:36:56,00:37:02,"tall is he snout to vent? Yeah, that's true actually, because people who have long legs"
00:37:02,00:37:07,"is like having a long tail, it's not as important, is it? Yeah. The most important bit is from your"
00:37:07,00:37:13,nose to your anus. Yeah. That's really what happens below that is just incidental. I agree. All these
00:37:13,00:37:25,"basket bull is bragging. Snout to vent, they're barely different to us. Okay, that's it, that's all"
