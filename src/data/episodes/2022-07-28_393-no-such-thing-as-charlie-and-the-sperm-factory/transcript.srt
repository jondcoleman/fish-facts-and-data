00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,180
 Now, before I remind you about our tour, which is about to begin in places such as

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,680
 Tumbridge Wells, Nottingham Richmond, Reading, Peterborough and a whole load of other places,

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,120
 I want to tell you about the very, very, very special guest that we have on today's show.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,480
 Anna is away at the moment, she's on holiday, I'm not sure exactly where she's gone, probably

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,180
 somewhere very sunny.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:30,240
 Last day saw she was removing lots of the holiday clothes from her bag and replacing

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,960
 them with 19th century literature, so I'm sure she's having a great time.

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,360
 But in her place, we have the incredible journalist and author, Mary Roach.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
 Now I don't know if you'll know about Mary, you really should if you don't.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
 She is, well, what I would say is if you were to take QI, the TV show, and No Such Thing

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,160
 as a Fish, and squish it all together in a tiny little ball, send it over to America,

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,940
 and then reconstitute it as a single human, then pretty much you're going to end up with

14
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,940
 Mary Roach.

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,300
 She has written some of the greatest popular science books in history.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:13,380
 Books such as Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, Bonk, The Curious Coupling

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,940
 of Science and Sex, I think you can see probably why we get on very well with Mary, Packing

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,980
 for Mars, The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Gulp, Adventures on the Elementary Canal,

19
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:31,520
 and her latest book is in America, it's called Fuzz When Nature Breaks the Law, and in the

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,120
 UK it is known as Animal Vegetable Criminal, and it is a book all about times when the

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,360
 natural world came up against the legal world.

22
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,240
 I haven't read it yet, Dan has read it, and he assures me it's absolutely brilliant, and

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,360
 I can definitely believe that because I've read all of Mary's other books, and to a

24
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,920
 tome, they are incredible, so really do enjoy the show, I'm sure you will.

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,780
 Buy Mary's new book, and pretty much all of her old books if you're interested in stuff,

26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,380
 and do come to our live shows.

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,220
 If you live in any of the aforementioned places that I mentioned earlier on, then come along

28
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,740
 in the next couple of weeks, or if you live anywhere in the UK and Ireland, then go to

29
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,300
 qi.com/fishevents and you can see where we'll be playing near you.

30
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:30,880
 Okay, on with the podcast.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

32
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,600
 to you from four undisclosed locations globally.

33
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,820
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

34
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,300
 and our very special guest, it is Mary Roach, and once again we have gathered round the microphones

35
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,140
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,820
 we go.

37
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,940
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mary.

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,660
 When feeling threatened, gulls practice a maneuver called defensive vomiting, the point

39
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,160
 of which experts say is not to discuss and repel the predator, but to offer it an alternative

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 meal.

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,520
 Wow, what possibly could they offer that is better than what the animal was coming for

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
 in the first place?

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
 Is it vomit?

44
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,680
 Is it actual vomit?

45
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,640
 It is, it's vomit, and I think that is a service because it's partially digested.

46
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
 Oh yeah.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,080
 It saves effort, so when I first heard about defensive vomiting, I actually heard about

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,340
 it in a vulture, because vultures do this too, and I thought, oh, they do this to be lighter,

49
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,580
 so when they flee, when they fly away, they'll have less weight, and then the guy said, no,

50
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,980
 no, that's not why they do it.

51
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,780
 The other thing I thought would be to discuss to them, because you hear about women feeling

52
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,940
 threatened and like vomiting to discuss to their attacker, so I thought it was that,

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,260
 in fact, no, it's just to offer them something more appealing to eat.

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,080
 I was reading in your book that you were talking to an expert, and specifically the items that

55
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,360
 she has seen been vomited up before her include ants, strawberry shortcake, a large mackerel.

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,400
 Yeah, but Dan, think about it, that does make sense, right?

57
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
 If you're coming over to eat a gull, but you get some strawberry shortcake instead, then

58
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,560
 that's obviously way tastier, though.

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
 That's a big win.

60
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,040
 Well, it looks like from the list that sometimes it's a very awesome cuisine, like spaghetti

61
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,300
 marinara with mussels, and the other times, it's a loaded diaper.

62
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
 Wow.

63
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,860
 I wonder if the predator ever waits sitting there in front of a diaper that's just been

64
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,180
 vomited up in front of it, and it's saying, no, I'm still going to eat you unless you

65
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,820
 can come up with something a little bit better.

66
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,420
 The guy was saying, hang on, hang on, I've got some shortcake, I'm sure I had some shortcake

67
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,420
 earlier.

68
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,980
 I read of one bird, the full mar.

69
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,980
 Do you know this one?

70
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,100
 It's very oily, the full mar, and in the olden days, they used to use them as torches.

71
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,240
 They would set them on fire because they were so oily.

72
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,000
 I read that they sometimes vomit very, very oily sick onto another animal, and it might

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,160
 stop their feathers from working and stop them from being able to fly and swim and stuff

74
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
 like that.

75
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,160
 Right.

76
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,160
 Yeah, that's a very cool idea.

77
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,840
 So many things you can do with vomit.

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,360
 I think we underutilize our own vomit.

79
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
 Yeah.

80
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
 Are there powers?

81
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,960
 Do we have extra powers to our vomit that we're not utilizing?

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,360
 I don't know if we do.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,360
 Maybe so.

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,800
 You're really interested in that, aren't you?

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,200
 Because just this morning, you messaged us saying that you'd just been vomited on.

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
 Yes.

87
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,040
 This wasn't me doing research for the show.

88
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,360
 My son vomited on me this morning in pure coincidence, he's a bit ill, but yeah, it

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
 is.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
 I couldn't fly afterwards.

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
 I was very stagey.

92
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
 I really like it.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,240
 It's not bird related, but it's a Nigerian bit of folklore that there are snakes which

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,840
 will vomit up a diamond, okay?

95
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,280
 If they're hunting at night, they need a bit of light, and so they throw up a diamond,

96
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,440
 and the light will refract around inside it and light up the local area.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,720
 That's really interesting, because do you know those little bits of glass in Rhodes'

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
 cat size?

99
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,960
 Well, they were supposed to have been invented in the 20th century, right?

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,080
 But it seems like maybe snakes invented them way before.

101
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,080
 Yes.

102
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,920
 The snakes don't do this, unfortunately.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,200
 It would be amazing if they did.

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,600
 The reason the myth came about is they've got these little mineral deposits, I think

105
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
 they're called calculi, or calculi, I don't know how you pronounce it.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,840
 They're like kidney stones basically in their bodies, and so they are there, but they're

107
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
 not diamonds, and the snakes don't throw them up.

108
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,000
 But I guess people have cut open the snakes and said, "Ah, look, here's the magical diamond

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,160
 it uses as a torch."

110
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,680
 But don't you need a light source?

111
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,920
 Do they also throw up a flashlight?

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,080
 I mean, where are they?

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,740
 It's like the diamond is no good if you don't have the right kind of light.

114
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,740
 So true.

115
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,080
 So vultures do it as well.

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
 Any other birds?

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,600
 Any other animals do this?

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,960
 I've only heard of vultures and gulls.

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,720
 Vultures are problematic because they like to roost on, you know, those giant communications

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 towers.

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,040
 They have a lot of places for vultures to just sit there and hang out, which they like

122
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,360
 to do.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,520
 And so it makes it really, if you're someone whose job is to climb the communications tower

124
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,400
 and do work, you, first of all, are stepping a lot of vultures shit all over the struts

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,880
 of the communications tower, but also you have like 50 vultures vomiting down this rain of

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
 vomit.

127
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,520
 Oh my goodness.

128
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
 Yeah.

129
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,480
 I heard that when I first read about gulls spewing out, I thought it was a thing about,

130
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 you know, just getting weight off so that they could fly away faster.

131
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,400
 And that's, that turns out to be a myth, but apparently it's not a myth within Komodo

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
 Dragons.

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
 They can't fly.

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
 That's a different dragon you're thinking of, Dan.

135
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
 Sorry, yeah.

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,520
 But you know, if they need to make a speedy getaway, they will just quickly have a vomit

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,840
 and it will lighten their load a bit, just allowing them that extra bit of speed.

138
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,680
 And also, I'm sorry, how do we really know what the answer is?

139
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,920
 Nobody's asked the gulls.

140
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,920
 Yes.

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,360
 We've got different theories and I kind of like the, you know, speedy getaway.

142
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
 Let me lighten the load.

143
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,320
 Have we even tested that as a theory?

144
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,160
 Like, surely Usain Bolt should have had a quick vomit before he ran some of those hundred

145
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,120
 meters to really smash the record.

146
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,720
 You do get that sports people sometimes do vomit before the sporting events.

147
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 I've heard of a few soccer players doing it, but usually I think it's like nerves and

148
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
 stuff like that, right?

149
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 Adrenaline and stuff.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,960
 And of course, there was the marathon runner, what she called Paula Radcliffe.

151
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,200
 Paula Radcliffe, she had a poo halfway through, which might have lightened her load and.

152
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
 Did she win?

153
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
 Yeah, she did.

154
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 She did.

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
 See, it works.

156
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,560
 I think though, in the long run, she probably would think, maybe I wouldn't take that poo.

157
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,960
 Maybe it wasn't worth the win because it's all anyone talks about.

158
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,880
 It's the greatest speed marathon run out of all time, and that's all we ever talk about

159
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,880
 anyway.

160
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
 Exactly.

161
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,760
 Like, three of us knew that she definitely had a poo, but I did not know if she won that

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
 race.

163
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,160
 This example of the gull vomiting, which is in your book, which I was reading about, it

164
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,480
 kind of was leading into this story about how there was huge problems at the Vatican when

165
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,760
 the Pope was going to have a big celebration and they had all these daffodils there and

166
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,440
 all the gulls were coming in and they don't eat flowers, but they were pissed off and seemed

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,740
 to be knocking them over and they thought maybe they were going in to pick the worms,

168
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,440
 but there was no obvious sign that there was happening and you sort of were questioning

169
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,600
 whether or not this is just a dickhead species of gull, maybe.

170
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 Exactly.

171
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,680
 As we learned, gulls will eat just about anything, but they don't eat flowers and daffodils.

172
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,160
 I read somewhere a poisonous, so and they didn't eat.

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
 They weren't eating them.

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,960
 They were just sort of pulling them up and throwing them around and the people who set

175
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,960
 this floral display up, they come down from the Netherlands and they spend like the entire

176
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,400
 day before setting it up, so they were pretty pissed at the gulls, but there wasn't any

177
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,640
 obvious reason gulls do a defensive thing where they pull up grass to just be macho

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,920
 and say, "This is my territory," but that's why I just sort of thought, "Well, is it just

179
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
 that they're dicks?

180
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
 I don't know."

181
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,140
 Mary, I was reading about the training that you did because I know the book is all about

182
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,880
 wildlife and humans and the sort of vexed legal areas between them, and you did this.

183
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
 Is it what?

184
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
 Yes.

185
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
 Wildlife, human, attack, response training.

186
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,000
 Yeah, it's kind of a, I don't know if you guys have forensics shows, like people go

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,160
 into the crime scene and collect evidence.

188
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

189
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,480
 It's kind of that, but when wild animals killed someone.

190
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
 So they still have the yellow tape, you know, and the people come in with their evidence

191
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,700
 bags, the little evidence flags, and they're looking for blood spatter patterns and all

192
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,700
 that stuff.

193
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,520
 I love it though, because the thing you wrote about is we do think, okay, so they're coming

194
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,160
 in and they're looking at, say, like a cougar that's killed a young man, but then it turns

195
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,680
 out that's all a setup.

196
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,560
 The cougar has been framed, and actually it was a human killer that they didn't identify

197
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,520
 at the time only years later because they see puncture marks, but those have been framed,

198
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,280
 and I just love the idea that they're there to sort of suss out, okay, it looks like they

199
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,680
 were mauled by a cougar, but were they really?

200
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
 Yeah, exactly.

201
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,620
 It was a dude with an ice pick who stabbed somebody in the neck, and some doofus wildlife

202
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,420
 person who didn't take wart training, he's like, yeah, that looks like a cougar because

203
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
 they go right for the neck.

204
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,780
 Yeah, they do go for the neck, but they have an upper jaw and a lower jaw, and the teeth

205
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,560
 marks are look a certain way, they don't look like an ice pick anyway.

206
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,780
 So that guy finally did get busted like 10 years later, he was bragging about the crime

207
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
 in prison or something else.

208
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
 In prison.

209
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
 Oh, there we go.

210
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,480
 So the advice I read about what to do if you have to shoot a bear because it's attacking

211
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,880
 someone, and it said, I can't believe this, but I wanted to check it with you, your advice

212
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,840
 to run up to the bear, plant the barrel on it, and then shoot upwards, and it's because

213
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,160
 you can't aim under those circumstances because it's so stressful.

214
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
 Yeah, exactly.

215
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,560
 And also, there's a whole thing about if a bear is attacking somebody and they're going

216
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,640
 at it, and you're trying to shoot the bear, how do you make sure you don't shoot the guy?

217
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,740
 So there was this story of this, I forget the guy's name, Wharf or something, or Wolf,

218
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,900
 I don't know, anyway, he killed the bear, but he also shot the guy in the leg, but,

219
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,380
 you know, a small price to pay, I suppose.

220
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,940
 I suppose you can't really outrun a bear if it's going to come after you, right?

221
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,780
 So you might as well go towards it.

222
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,660
 But if it's busy attacking your friend, you've got a chance.

223
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,660
 Yes, you do.

224
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,780
 Always give a second slowest person.

225
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,780
 Yeah, yeah.

226
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,740
 Well, you could try the vomit.

227
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
 What?

228
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
 It's busy.

229
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,920
 Your friend's being mauled by the bear.

230
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,400
 You just throw it throwing up in the background.

231
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,600
 Mary, did you do any arson stuff or arson dog stuff in the course of the book?

232
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
 Any arson?

233
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,680
 Sorry, I was reading about the arson dogs that they have in America.

234
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,280
 Have you heard of these?

235
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
 It's insane.

236
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,800
 There's a place in Connecticut called the Accelerant Detection Canine School.

237
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,400
 Oh, the Accelerant?

238
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
 Yeah, exactly.

239
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,620
 All the anything used to get a fire going, they can identify 17 different types of Accelerant.

240
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,740
 And this is the amazing thing.

241
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,300
 Sometimes they will bring the dogs to the fire while it's still burning, because often

242
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,660
 when there's a fire, there's a crowd of onlookers, right?

243
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,520
 But sometimes the people who set the fire are in the crowd watching it, and they will

244
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,100
 turn up and the dog will sniff a few drops of petrol or whatever they used on them and

245
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
 then they get busted.

246
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
 Wow.

247
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
 That's incredible.

248
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,140
 We should probably move on in a sec to our next fact.

249
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,640
 Does anyone else want to add anything before we do?

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,520
 Can I say something about fly vomit?

251
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
 Yeah.

252
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:30,800
 Most people vomit after they eat, but flies will vomit onto the food that they're planning

253
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,200
 to eat and digest it outside the body, kind of turn it into soup and then basically put

254
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
 a straw in it and suck it up.

255
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 Fround on.

256
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
 Yeah, we frowned on.

257
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
 Up the face.

258
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:51,260
 I once went to New Zealand and I was in a cave and it was pitch black and you kind of float

259
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,540
 on these rubber rings and on the ceiling, it looks like stars.

260
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,460
 It looks like you're looking at the heavens.

261
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,460
 I've seen it.

262
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
 Have you seen it?

263
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,460
 Yeah.

264
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
 So the glowworms, right?

265
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,540
 But what they don't, well, what they do tell you, but what I'd forgotten is that actually

266
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,300
 it's glowworm vomit that is hanging down from the ceiling.

267
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,460
 And what they do is they vomit out these strands and then animals get caught in it and then

268
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,920
 they can gobble it up a bit like flypaper.

269
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:22,680
 They did some analysis on the vomit and they found that it was 99% water and 1% something

270
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
 else.

271
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,200
 And that something else turns out to be urea, which is basically glowworm piss.

272
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,320
 And they're not quite sure how the piss gets into the vomit, but it does seem like they're

273
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,400
 vomiting out pissy water to collect these insects.

274
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,380
 James, just quickly, the New Zealand cave you went to.

275
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
 Is it called the Waikiki?

276
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
 Yeah.

277
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
 Waikiki, I think.

278
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
 Yeah.

279
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
 Something like that.

280
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,820
 We went on tour to Australia and New Zealand and that's what you did with your time after

281
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
 the tour ended.

282
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,500
 Yes, it is actually, as it happens.

283
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,980
 I also went to the Hobbit World.

284
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,540
 No, it's good, but just I had a few days extra, but I didn't have the means to travel.

285
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,700
 So I just went to the Wellington Funicular Railway Museum instead.

286
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,420
 I have to say, yours does sound more exciting.

287
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,780
 I've got to say both of these sound very much on brand, don't they?

288
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,280
 I went to World of Socks.

289
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
 What?

290
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
 I heard about it.

291
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:18,000
 I saw signs before and I made my husband take a detour for World of Socks.

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,500
 That's amazing.

293
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 It's just a store.

294
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,320
 It's a store that sells socks.

295
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:36,080
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

296
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
 Okay.

297
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,940
 My fact this week is that any truffle farmer worth their salt will do regular PCR tests

298
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,440
 on their truffles.

299
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,620
 Are they testing them for COVID and do they have to go into isolation, blah, blah, blah.

300
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,420
 So this is basically me playing off the fact that PCR tests are just a very common widely

301
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,460
 used thing in biology and chemistry.

302
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:07,520
 They are tests where you make billions and billions of copies of the DNA of a sample

303
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,560
 and it just means that you can test it a lot easier.

304
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:18,360
 I went very recently to the Echomuse de la Trouffe in the village of Soge in France,

305
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,720
 which is the big truffle museum in France, and this is something I learned while I was

306
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
 there.

307
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,080
 Is this whole podcast, you just doing tax deductible trips by mentioning it as work?

308
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,560
 Is that what's going on?

309
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:34,060
 I've been doing that for eight years now, I surprise you haven't noticed by now.

310
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,660
 Yeah, so there's a few reasons why you might do it.

311
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,460
 So first of all, you might want to check your truffles to make sure that there's no other

312
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,900
 funguses coming into your farm yard because a truffle for anyone who doesn't know, it's

313
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,580
 like a mushroom, but it's from the fungal family, but unlike a normal mushroom, it doesn't

314
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,580
 send out spores.

315
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,900
 The spores all grow on the inside and they grow underground and you can pull them out

316
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,280
 and they're delicious to eat, but they're very, very expensive.

317
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,080
 And so when you're growing them, you need to know that they're growing properly and

318
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,920
 the PCR tests can check if there's any other fungus in the area.

319
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,680
 And the other way that they're useful is you get a lot of cheap funguses coming in from

320
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,440
 different parts of the world, especially from China.

321
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:19,360
 And so when you are selling your truffles, you can do a PCR test to show they're the

322
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,160
 real deal and they're not cheap truffles from elsewhere in the world.

323
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,580
 And what's amazing as well is those cheap truffles are so identical to a real truffle

324
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,140
 that even if you held them under a microscope, the spores are just not different enough for

325
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,740
 you to be able to tell the difference.

326
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
 Yeah, it's incredible.

327
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,900
 So there's two ways of telling, one on a molecular level, or the other way is by tasting it,

328
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,540
 because according to French truffle aficionado Eduardo Manazares, it tastes like a turnip.

329
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:54,920
 Whereas a truffle has this amazing kind of earthy flavor, doesn't it, like actual truffles,

330
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,360
 but these ones taste like potatoes, uncooked, unsalted potatoes.

331
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
 But you know what?

332
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
 I think probably you ship them over here to America, the fake ones, and then nobody will

333
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
 know.

334
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,000
 I'm not sure I've ever eaten any truffles.

335
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,920
 I did think, oh, no, once a few years ago I had some chips which had truffle oil on

336
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
 them.

337
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,120
 Imagine my surprise researching this fact, most truffle oil has never even been near

338
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
 a truffle.

339
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,740
 It's made of something called bis-meltilio-methane, which is derived from petroleum, and the

340
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,560
 only reason it's used is that it smells a bit like truffle.

341
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,560
 No.

342
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,560
 Wait.

343
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
 You did put a petrol on your chips.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,320
 Yeah, I wonder why they were burned all the time.

345
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,720
 So they use, we're talking about arson dogs earlier, they use truffle dogs to find them,

346
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,080
 but not only do they use truffle dogs, they use truffle hogs.

347
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,080
 Truffle hogs are amazing.

348
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,560
 These are domesticated pigs that go around smelling out the truffles, and the reason

349
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,600
 they're able to smell them is because they share the natural sex hormones that the male

350
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,280
 pigs produce in their testicles, which they somehow bring up to their mouth and salivate

351
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,400
 out for the female pig to smell.

352
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,080
 It's got a very similar smell, and so they're basically smelling the ground for male hogs,

353
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,480
 but finding truffles.

354
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
 That's amazing.

355
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,880
 I encountered some amazing boar technology that involved those pheromones and that saliva

356
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,280
 in Denmark in order to figure out which pigs are ready for mating.

357
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,800
 You can do it by just taking around a teaser boar, and the boar kind of salivates and makes

358
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:34,000
 these horrible, retching, grunting sounds, and the females that get aroused, they know,

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,240
 "Okay, these females are ready for insemination," but instead of the teaser boar, somebody, the

360
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:46,040
 Danish Pig Production Council, I think it was, they developed this boar on wheels, remote

361
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,160
 controlled, that was doused with boar mate, which is the pheromone of the boar.

362
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
 It's a spray.

363
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,480
 So it was doused with that, and they had an MP3 of it playing the retching horrible grunting

364
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,400
 sounds, and they would make it go around to all the females to see which ones were ready,

365
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,440
 but it didn't work very well, and the farmers didn't like it.

366
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,440
 This name was Skippy.

367
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,400
 Oh, boy, you'd feel really disappointed if you'd called for Skippy the bush kangaroo

368
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,720
 and Skippy the wheeled sex boar turned up.

369
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,200
 The thing is about the pigs, Dan, you were saying, is that they don't really use pigs

370
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,000
 anymore because of the hogs, because they basically will eat the truffles if they find

371
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,240
 them, whereas the dogs will just sniff them.

372
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,240
 And the other thing is, if you have a really good area where your truffles are, then you

373
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,360
 don't want anyone else to know about them, you want to keep it secret.

374
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,440
 If you drive up there with a dog in your car, then people will think, oh, he's just taking

375
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
 his dog for a walk.

376
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,720
 But if you drive up there with a pig in your car, then people are like, well, I know what

377
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 this guy's up to.

378
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,840
 Well, I've got a good idea what this guy might be up to.

379
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,280
 That's exactly it, because the idea is, as soon as the pig finds it, you basically have

380
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,200
 to wrestle the 20 stone pig, and you have to wrestle the truffle out of its mouth.

381
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,440
 That's impossible to do, whereas dogs will swap the sausages, apparently.

382
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,840
 They kind of notify you, and then they say, okay.

383
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,880
 But actually the best thing to find truffles is truffle flies.

384
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,920
 So truffle flies can find truffles better than dogs and pigs, and that's because female

385
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:22,000
 truffle flies like to lay their eggs in truffles, so they need to be able to find them.

386
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,840
 And the way that you do that is you walk around, because these flies are really, really tiny

387
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,600
 and they're almost see-through, so you can hardly see them, and you just prod the grass

388
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
 with the little stick, and then if you get the right moment, then they'll all kind of

389
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,160
 fly up, and they'll hover over the area where your truffles are, and then you can dig in

390
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
 and get them.

391
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,960
 Would you eat a truffle which had truffle flies in it, James?

392
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
 In it?

393
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
 Hmm.

394
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,520
 Well, I must say, I'm not a big fan of any kind of mushrooms, so probably not.

395
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
 No, not really.

396
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,520
 Okay.

397
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
 Because apparently that does happen.

398
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,680
 It's not always treated as a bad thing if there are truffle flies in there.

399
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,360
 So there was a doctor at the University of Nancy called Dr. Francis Martin, who said that

400
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,240
 if you collect it just at the right time, the truffle will have eggs and larvae in

401
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,320
 it, which adds proteins and aroma to the truffle.

402
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,600
 Have you ever eaten any weird stuff like that, Mary?

403
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,120
 I kind of get the feeling you might have done that.

404
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,880
 I have had some weird food.

405
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,760
 Yeah, I was up in the Arctic, in an Inuit town, because I had this idea, like, if you

406
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,880
 only eat meat, how do you get your vitamins?

407
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,080
 And the answer is the organ meats, so they basically eat the whole entity.

408
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,440
 I went to this community feast, and they had this Arctic char lying there, and the guy

409
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,480
 who was hosting me said, "We're going to give you the best part," and I could see

410
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
 you sort of cutting something that looks like the forehead, and I was like, "Oh, okay, great,

411
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,960
 because I know cheeks, you know, cheeks are good, so probably forehead is pretty good,"

412
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,280
 but it was the raw eye, and it's a fairly sizable fish, though it has a fairly sizable

413
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,200
 eye, and it had that, you know, that thing hanging in the muscular thing in the back.

414
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,120
 I don't know if you know that the back of the eye has this, it's kind of like when

415
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,800
 you eat a chicken leg, that hard, awful, tendony bit, it was like that, and I said, "Oh, thank

416
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,440
 you," and all the elders were standing around, like, nodding like, and I don't know if they

417
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,120
 were just, it was a prank, or it really is the best part, but I said, "It's not going

418
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,760
 to be like a cherry tomato, is it?"

419
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:20,680
 They don't eat cherry tomatoes, he's like, he's like, "No, no, no, it was like a cherry

420
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:26,400
 tomato, it just exploded in my mouth," because you'd have to eat the whole thing at once,

421
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,240
 you know, take a bite because it would dribble.

422
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
 Oh my goodness.

423
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,520
 I've never had truffle, I mean, I guess I've had shaved truffle, shavings, so, you know,

424
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,680
 but that's, yeah, I don't know, I don't know what all that fuss is.

425
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:43,240
 I know, I sell for so much, so like a pound of black truffle, you can get white and black

426
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,960
 truffle, you can sell for like 400 American dollars a pound.

427
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,560
 Do you guys know, is it the case that it's not just about eating, but if you can get

428
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,640
 a truffle, you can breed it, is that the thing, or is it not, is it purely just eating?

429
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,360
 Some of them are cultivated, in fact, there are some kinds that you can and some you can't,

430
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,600
 so I think it's Italian white truffles, they're still wild and they're really hard to find,

431
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,160
 but French black truffles, pretty much all of those are cultivated, so.

432
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,880
 Yeah, something like 95% now of all the French truffles are cultivated these days, they cultivate

433
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,320
 them all over the world, in America they certainly do, for sure.

434
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,640
 It takes 10 years for them to grow, and it might be that you just plant your farm then

435
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,440
 10 years later, you find out you've got a load of turnips.

436
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,400
 Well, not if you use your PCR test.

437
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
 A lot of your PCR tests, absolutely.

438
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 Have you guys heard of Helen Gilkey?

439
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
 No.

440
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 No.

441
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,400
 So Helen Gilkey was the first woman to receive a PhD in botany at the University of California

442
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:43,000
 in Berkeley, and she was the world expert on truffles, probably throughout the 1930s,

443
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,320
 1940s and into the 1950s.

444
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,920
 She named a whole load of truffles, but whenever she named them she also drew them, as she

445
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,400
 would also write a poem about them, and the poems that she wrote were amazing, so here's

446
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,680
 a poem that she wrote.

447
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,840
 Now here comes Hidnotriah, it's hymenium lush, lining the walls with a deep piled plush,

448
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,200
 gradually merging at entrances wide into the pattern of surface outside.

449
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,360
 American species we have not a few, and both those in Europe we likewise have two.

450
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,280
 For example, H. Tulasnei of Old World Fame by mycologist Berkeley, given its name, its

451
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:27,160
 presence in US regarded as myth, until here discovered by Alex H. Smith.

452
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
 Very nice.

453
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,160
 That's great.

454
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,400
 It's a bit of dogarole, but I think that's really nice.

455
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
 I love it.

456
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,440
 I love it when a poem is like a Wikipedia article for you, like we just got the story of the

457
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
 truffle.

458
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,320
 She must lean very heavily on the words snuffle, scuffle and ruffle though.

459
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,160
 Can I tell you one thing about the truffle of the year?

460
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,160
 Oh, yes.

461
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,280
 This was a thing in the '40s and '50s, and it was a PR campaign.

462
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,360
 There was a guy called Jacomo Mora who was trying to make white truffles fashionable,

463
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,240
 which they weren't at the time, it was all about the black truffles then, and he launched

464
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,640
 this campaign where he would send the best truffle of the year to a global celebrity.

465
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,960
 So in 1949, Rita Hayworth received the best truffle of the year.

466
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,600
 53, Winston Churchill, 1954, Marilyn Monroe, Paul VI in 1965, Emperor Haile Selassie got

467
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,160
 one, or just this weird club of people who've received the best truffle.

468
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
 That's incredible.

469
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,480
 Do we know that they received them as in they didn't just receive some weird thing in the

470
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,480
 mail and chuck it away?

471
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,400
 I'm sure it was recorded delivery, but I don't really find their reactions.

472
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,560
 We haven't got photos of Marilyn with the truffle of Haile Selassie.

473
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,320
 Even if it wasn't recorded delivery, he probably had a letter with it explaining what it was.

474
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,040
 It probably wasn't just a truffle through the past.

475
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:50,480
 Hopefully, they were given some kind of warning before it showed up, because I used to work

476
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,320
 at the SPCA, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

477
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,600
 I was in the public affairs office, and my boss at one year, for Christmas presents for

478
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,760
 people in the media, she had these cookies in the shape of a bone, human cookies, and

479
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,440
 she just left them in a bag on the doorstep.

480
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,880
 She went around and delivered them, but she didn't tell people.

481
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:18,400
 Someone called the bombs squad and blew off the cookies.

482
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,760
 On truffles and how much people love them, I just love this line.

483
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,600
 The composer Rossini, he claimed that he had only cried three times in his entire life.

484
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
 Okay?

485
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
 Here's the quote.

486
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,080
 He said, "Once when my first opera failed.

487
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,640
 Once again, the first time I heard Paganini play the violin, and once when a truffle's

488
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,760
 turkey fell overboard at a boating picnic."

489
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:51,440
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

490
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,920
 My fact this week is that there are signed copies of Life Magazine circulating on auction

491
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:02,480
 sites that are said to be autographed by Ham, the first chimpanzee in space, but are in

492
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,920
 fact forgeries signed by other chimps.

493
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
 Wow.

494
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,200
 Other chimps that have been in space or just other chimps?

495
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 No.

496
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 Oh, really?

497
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,400
 Just boring other chimps.

498
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,400
 This is true.

499
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,400
 I talked to Ham's trainer and vet, Bill Brits, when I was working on Packing for Mars, and

500
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:27,280
 he said, he's talking about how Ham was this beloved world famous on the cover of Life

501
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,280
 Magazine to the extent that people were sending flowers and letters to Ham, and they started

502
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,200
 requesting autographs for Ham the chimpanzee.

503
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,080
 So Bill tried to oblige them, you know, they would send their copy, and Ham the chimp was

504
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,200
 not signing with a pen, it was a paw print, and at a certain point he said, "I was afraid

505
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,800
 we would wear him out."

506
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,200
 So at a certain point we just took any chimpanzee and used their palms, so it is true.

507
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,800
 The other chimps are actually, I've accused them of forging signatures here, they are

508
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,320
 innocent bystanders whose palms have been pressed onto paper.

509
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,560
 I was quite benevolent then, that's nice, I didn't know that background, that's a

510
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,560
 relief.

511
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,000
 Yeah, as in it was done for Ham's benefit, you know.

512
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,880
 Part of it was, you know, because the Soviets had put dogs up in space and successfully

513
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,440
 landed them, the U.S. was trying to make a really big deal about, "Look, we did it too!"

514
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,880
 It was like he was a short hairy astronaut, they dressed him up in a pressure suit, which

515
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,800
 he didn't need, the capsule was pressurized to these photo shoots, and he was a very

516
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:36,120
 friendly outgoing chimp, unlike the second chimp, Enos, that nobody ever talks about.

517
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,480
 So what was wrong with Enos?

518
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,680
 He was a very ornery, aggressive, unpleasant, and kind of ugly chimpanzee.

519
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,080
 The Buzz Aldrin, yes.

520
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,080
 Wow.

521
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,800
 Just your buzz is grumpy.

522
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,840
 Yeah, his trainer, Dr. Finney, you know, people would ask him about him, this is how he described

523
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:04,680
 him in public, instead of saying he was ornery, he was cussed, he was horrible, he said he

524
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,360
 was a taciturn pillar of the community kind of guy.

525
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,400
 Oh, do you know these handprints?

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,760
 Can you tell the difference between a ham one and a sham one?

527
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,840
 Is it possible to tell the difference or not?

528
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,320
 Probably if you had a real one and you compared it, I mean, they're probably fingerprints,

529
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,320
 right?

530
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
 Oh, yeah, I guess so.

531
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,800
 I would imagine it would be pretty easy, but you'd need to have an actual ham print, yeah.

532
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,640
 I've seen a photo, they do look quite hard to distinguish, they're quite inky, they're

533
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,440
 quite thick, so the one that I found was sold on an auction site back in, I think around

534
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,520
 2008 and sold for surprisingly little, in my opinion, it was $2,100 and they sell other

535
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,040
 things like, you know, like on lots of animals, you'll have the identifying name on a little

536
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
 metal sign.

537
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,360
 What do you mean, Dan, do you mean like a dog tag?

538
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,560
 A dog tag, sorry, but it was a chimp tag, yeah, actually just very quickly because a lot

539
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:04,400
 of people listening might actually not be aware that we sent primates to space before

540
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,480
 we sent humans, and in fact, Ham has that honour.

541
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,000
 Ham is the first primate to go into space, beat Alan Shepard, the American, beat Yuri

542
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,920
 Gagarin, the Russian, and this was on the 31st of January 1961.

543
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,480
 It was a test for the Americans to make sure that everything would go right ahead of their

544
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,760
 trip with Alan Shepard, which actually cost them the honour of getting the first man in

545
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,040
 space because Yuri Gagarin got in there in that time, but Ham was a huge celebrity back

546
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
 in the day.

547
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,160
 It was obviously a big deal, and as Mary was saying, just a really charismatic chimp.

548
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,720
 And you know who got no publicity at all was the five Alberts who went up before Ham.

549
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 What?

550
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,800
 Yeah, the Alberts, and then there was Patricia and Michael.

551
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,200
 These were all monkeys, they weren't apes, you know, chimps and apes were monkeys that

552
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,000
 were launched in a suborbital flight and came back down.

553
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,400
 Right, but wow, I've never heard of them.

554
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,400
 Yeah, the Alberts.

555
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,400
 The first Alberts ended catastrophically.

556
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:09,560
 They didn't survive, so at a certain point somebody realised, you know, maybe we should

557
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,440
 stop calling them Alberts.

558
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,200
 They switched to Michael and Patricia.

559
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,960
 It's a bit weird naming them in the first place, because it does humanise them a bit

560
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,520
 more when you hear that, you know, Michael and Patricia have not survived their space

561
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
 journey.

562
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,760
 It's much sadder.

563
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,360
 But so Ham was retrospectively named because for that exact reason, Andy, so when I say

564
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,160
 that the dog tag was sold, I didn't say the word Ham on it, it just had the number 65,

565
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,800
 because that was the number of chimpanzees he was in a big number of, I think around

566
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,280
 80 chimpanzees who were auditioned for the role.

567
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
 What kind of audition was it?

568
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,280
 You had to sing a song, then you had to do your party trick.

569
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
 In a 2-2.

570
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,400
 Yeah, there was a swimsuit round, yeah, it was bizarre, the training wasn't bizarre,

571
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,720
 it was very soundively worked out, but you had to push a lever after seeing a light.

572
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,280
 That was the mission, and then that's what Ham had to do in space.

573
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,600
 Yeah, it was basically to make sure that they were still functioning, that something horrible

574
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,200
 wasn't happening to their cognitive abilities in zero gravity, that they were able to do

575
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,760
 the training that they'd been trained to do.

576
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,120
 Ham did do a breast briefing after his trip.

577
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,520
 He was wheeled out, as you say, in the suit, or certainly he was asked to get into the

578
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,800
 metal couch that was like the one he'd been in on the space flight, and he very vigorously

579
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,120
 refused to get in there.

580
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,880
 So it seems to imply he didn't have a wonderful time.

581
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,800
 It's a thing that's sort of being rewritten in the sort of perception of Ham, because

582
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,520
 the footage that always gets shown of Ham is him having, let's say, a quite pleasant

583
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,160
 trip up into space, but the extended version of it, and I've not seen the footage myself,

584
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,440
 but there's a lot of talk about there being a lot of distress in his face and him being

585
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,160
 quite scared, and Jane Goodall, who did see the footage when it happened, said she's never

586
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:54,920
 seen a chimpanzee look so scared in her life with the facial expressions, and I think at

587
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,000
 the time, as Mary, you point out in the book, no one knew how to place Ham.

588
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,960
 Was Ham an astronaut who was going there as part of a heroic adventure, or was it an animal

589
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
 who had no idea what was going on?

590
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,840
 And obviously it was an animal that had no idea, but the perception was that it was

591
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,040
 a hero for America.

592
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,160
 And so the narrative was that, and it's being reassessed a lot now to say, actually, it

593
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,200
 was animal cruelty.

594
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,960
 I have a refrigerator magnet of Ham, and he looks like he's smiling.

595
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,940
 In fact, that's not a smile, that's a sort of a grimace of stress, but people looked

596
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,280
 at it and thought, oh, look, he looks so happy.

597
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,000
 But I have a photo of myself doing that on a log flume, right, on a theme park, and again,

598
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 it does look like a smile, but I'm not happy.

599
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,340
 I was looking at other Ham's in space.

600
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,340
 Go on.

601
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,800
 Well, I found a few.

602
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,360
 So we've mentioned on the podcast before, the first ever meal eaten on the moon was

603
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,360
 a Ham sandwich.

604
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,200
 So, you know, Ham is quite an iconic thing.

605
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
 By Buzz Aldrin.

606
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
 By Buzz Aldrin.

607
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 The ugly one.

608
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,200
 Oh, no.

609
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,200
 The grumpy one.

610
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
 Oh, my God.

611
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,480
 So that would be a little dehydrated cubed Ham sandwich, about one inch square, I believe.

612
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
 Oh, what's that?

613
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
 Yeah.

614
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,960
 We're not talking rye and mustard and lettuce and tomato.

615
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,700
 Well, you see, in my head, it was always like, yeah, like a 12-inch sub.

616
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
 Definitely.

617
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
 Yeah.

618
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,200
 The ones that went to the moon, the space sandwiches then were like, they were little

619
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,180
 dehydrated cubes that you would pop the whole sandwich in your mouth at once so there would

620
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,180
 be no crumbs.

621
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,700
 Because if you had crumbs and they floated around and they get into the electronics and

622
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,660
 they could cause problems and they were so dry that you would have to moisten them with

623
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,660
 your own saliva.

624
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:48,100
 You'd have to hold them in your mouth and kind of gather up the spit to make them swallowable.

625
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,100
 Wow.

626
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:53,420
 They were so, they tended, this stuff tended to travel up into space and come right back

627
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,420
 down.

628
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,640
 And they also didn't want to eat because they didn't have a toilet, they just had the bag,

629
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
 the fecal bag.

630
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
 Oh, yeah.

631
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,000
 A lot of times they, on these shorter missions particularly, Gemini, they just didn't eat

632
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,780
 because they didn't want to use the bag.

633
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
 So, yeah.

634
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,780
 That makes sense.

635
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,780
 That makes sense.

636
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,620
 Just on that, do you remember we had Tim Beacon about a year ago talking about his

637
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
 time in space?

638
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:16,260
 I don't think we ever mentioned, they do this training where you're underwater for a while,

639
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,060
 the special underwater base.

640
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,540
 And they had a problem with their toilet and for whatever reason, the answer became you

641
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:29,780
 had to stick your bum out of this underwater base and just sort of poo into the open ocean.

642
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,100
 But the problem was that lots of fish got the message that this was dinner time and

643
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,000
 they would turn up and they'd start nibbling your bum if you didn't have a poo quickly

644
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,540
 enough.

645
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,140
 Is that a nice thing when people like go into shopping centers sometimes and get fished

646
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,420
 and nibble on their feet, right?

647
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,260
 People say that's a nice feeling, do you think it's the same on the bum bum?

648
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,420
 James is actually banned from every shopping center in the UK for misuse of those facilities.

649
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,340
 And I think they tried to solve the problem by putting up this curtain of bubbles to give

650
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,000
 the astronauts in training a kind of privacy screen, right?

651
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,820
 But unfortunately, it was just a massive dinner gong and all the fish would see the

652
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,220
 bubbles from miles away and go, "Oh, great, there's going to be an astronaut poking their

653
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,220
 arse out."

654
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,900
 I suppose it's all right if there's a little kind of nibbling fish, but if you get a huge

655
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,100
 like great white shark coming along, you don't want that, do you?

656
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,180
 What a death, though.

657
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:30,500
 What to report there, Tim Peake died when a shark ate him anus first.

658
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:38,320
 Do you guys know, you might probably do know her actually, Peggy Whitson.

659
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,200
 She's an astronaut, so she has the record for the most time that any American has been

660
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,320
 in space and any woman has been in space.

661
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:55,720
 She was in space for 665 days and she was the first person to do a real-time kind of

662
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,300
 DNA test to find species while in the ISS.

663
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,540
 So basically, they would scrape a bit of the table and they would put it in and they would

664
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,980
 be able to tell which species are there and that's obviously really, really important,

665
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
 especially in the future.

666
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,220
 It might be really important when we're trying to find, you know, if there is life on other

667
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,220
 planets or wherever.

668
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,900
 But she did that, of course, using a PCR test.

669
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:28,060
 So in the future, any astronaut worth their salt will be doing a PCR test wherever they

670
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
 go.

671
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
 Wow.

672
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,640
 I interviewed Commander Whitson, Peggy from Mars.

673
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
 I did.

674
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,880
 She's just really badass fabulous.

675
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,720
 So she told me this story about, she was coming back from the ISS on Soyuz, you know, the

676
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,040
 capsule, and they do, they don't do a splashdown.

677
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,160
 They come down on land while they, it was kind of an off-nominal as they say.

678
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,340
 Things didn't go quite right and she didn't land where she was meant to land.

679
00:38:53,340 --> 00:39:00,700
 She lands in this field out on the steps and she gets out and then this farmer comes over

680
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,940
 and he's like, "Where did you come from?"

681
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,180
 And she's like, "I came from space."

682
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,100
 He's just like, "Walks away."

683
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,700
 That's amazing.

684
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:22,160
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

685
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,880
 My fact is that you can now send sperm on a postcard.

686
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,360
 Andy's address is...

687
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,760
 So I couldn't do it before.

688
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
 Could I not?

689
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,040
 Well, it's just been proved that it can be done.

690
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,760
 So you mean like, and it survives?

691
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,820
 I mean, it's a dead sperm on a postcard forever.

692
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
 Yes.

693
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,820
 Absolutely.

694
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,700
 Since the invention of the medium, yeah, it's been, I'm sure.

695
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,820
 Probably one of the first things they said, I would have thought.

696
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,820
 Absolutely.

697
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
 Wish you were here.

698
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:04,860
 Okay, so this is an experiment that some scientists in Japan at Yamanashi University

699
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
 have been doing.

700
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:11,280
 Normally, sperm gets sent around the place in glass vials and it's vulnerable to breaking

701
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,400
 and some freezing methods are things like freezing with liquid nitrogen, which it's

702
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,760
 not a great system for sending sperm around the place.

703
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,200
 And they have been working on ways to make sperm viable in transit in more convenient

704
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
 ways.

705
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,320
 And they've been freeze-drying sperm for some years now and now they are getting to the

706
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,840
 bit of their experiments where they are sending it around.

707
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,140
 So what they did was they freeze-dried some sperm, mouse sperm in this case, onto a single

708
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,500
 sheet of paper and they sandwiched the paper between two little sheets of plastic, but

709
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,700
 then they just attached that to a postcard and they sent it through the post.

710
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:53,220
 And it was absolutely fine and they were able to get viable mice bred from this sperm and

711
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,700
 they would really test themselves as well.

712
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:00,340
 They sent it a new year when the postal system is under a lot of stress because lots of people

713
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,840
 are writing to each other.

714
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,280
 And what was on the back of the postcard?

715
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,880
 Was it a scenic view?

716
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
 One of them was a happy new year card.

717
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,400
 We do know that from the experiment, but they haven't clarified what else was on the exciting

718
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
 bits.

719
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,400
 Oh, I don't know if it was the front or the back, actually.

720
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,640
 I assume that it was on the bit where you write the message.

721
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,640
 Yeah.

722
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,640
 You would think so.

723
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,640
 Yeah.

724
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
 Right.

725
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,880
 But the bigger challenge here is possibly how to get the sperm out of the mouse.

726
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,940
 That is a bit of a challenge for scientists.

727
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,880
 I talked to a woman who was looking into a male birth control and they were testing it

728
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:43,340
 on macaques and she said, "We had a heck of a time getting them to, you know, they wanted

729
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,180
 them to masturbate and produce a sample."

730
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,020
 And it was very, very difficult.

731
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,740
 They had to end up using a sort of ejaculator thing.

732
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,260
 But anyway, she had this great line.

733
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,140
 She said, "A monkey is not smart enough to know what we want, but too smart to have sex

734
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,840
 with an artificial vagina."

735
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:04,220
 Because that's what they were trying to get them to mount the artificial monkey vagina.

736
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,940
 So that was the challenge.

737
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,940
 So a mouse?

738
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:07,940
 Yeah.

739
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,520
 Well, maybe this is the answer to your postcard question because maybe on the other side

740
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,680
 was a sexy picture of a mouse and they just got them looking at it and as they ejaculated,

741
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,680
 just swap it around.

742
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,480
 If you know how they got sperm out of a mouse, then send your answers on a postcard to Andra

743
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,240
 Kuntamari.

744
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:29,480
 Maybe they just wheel in a little mouse on wheels, you know, playing some noise.

745
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,480
 Skippy.

746
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,480
 Skippy, what is this?

747
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
 Korea's really dropped.

748
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,920
 Well, you've got a new gig, mate.

749
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,580
 No, but Mary, you're absolutely right about the, because I know that for bigger animals,

750
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,060
 they sometimes use a little...

751
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,560
 Artificial vagina.

752
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,320
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, ejaculator, yeah.

753
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
 Yes.

754
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,240
 Which goes, I think, into up the bum.

755
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,840
 And then, yeah, quick blast of that, and away you go.

756
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,680
 But no, you're right, they use the artificial ones too, but for a mouse, I don't know if

757
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,680
 anyone makes a...

758
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
 It's tiny.

759
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,680
 More tiny.

760
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
 Yeah.

761
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
 It was interesting.

762
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,680
 They tried lots of different types of paper, didn't they, to see which was the best.

763
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,120
 They tried washi, which is like that traditional Japanese wrapping paper.

764
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,040
 They also tried like a vinyl sheet.

765
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,080
 They tried weighing paper, which turned out to be the best filter paper, a few different

766
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
 things.

767
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,760
 And that even though some of them were, it's like, for instance, weighing paper, were particularly

768
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,080
 well, some of them didn't work because the paper would stick together with the sperm,

769
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
 and so you wouldn't be able to get it back afterwards.

770
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,080
 Interesting.

771
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,080
 Right.

772
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,120
 I might be wrong about this, but I think from what I was reading in the paper, the sperm

773
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,080
 mattozoa die, but you can still get the DNA.

774
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,280
 The DNA remains intact, and then you can take the DNA and then you can inject it into like

775
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
 a...

776
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
 Right.

777
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,040
 I don't know what an oocyte or whatever they inject stuff into.

778
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,040
 I see.

779
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
 Okay.

780
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,040
 Yeah.

781
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,200
 The sperm, it's not like in Star Wars where they bring back Han Solo after he's been frozen

782
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,000
 in position in the thing.

783
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,200
 How do they get the sperm out of Han Solo?

784
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,800
 Is it a solo Han thing?

785
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,680
 They are very nice.

786
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,480
 Some mouse sperm, they think are saboteurs, which kind of act as cock blockers for other

787
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,000
 sperm or for rival mouse sperm.

788
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,320
 They seem to block the sense of direction systems in other mouse sperm, which is just

789
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
 remarkable.

790
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
 That's interesting.

791
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:27,240
 I remember someone did a study testing this theory that the corona of the glands, the penis

792
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:33,680
 was a sperm displacement device, like, in other words, if you go in right after another

793
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,280
 guy's been in there, this ridge would kind of remove the other person's sperm.

794
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:46,440
 And what I enjoyed about this study is that they had to come up with a recipe for semen

795
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,200
 simulant in order to test this.

796
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:56,600
 They also had to buy a bunch of dildos, and in my book, actually I had two recipes for

797
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,880
 semen simulant and one with cornstarch base, one fire-based.

798
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,840
 What I liked a lot was that, you know how in a recipe it'll be like, yield two dozen

799
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
 cookies?

800
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,280
 This is what it said, yield one ejaculate.

801
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,280
 Wow.

802
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:20,880
 Speaking of semen recipes, have you guys happened to come across, wrong word, the wrong phrasing.

803
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,160
 Have you guys seen the book Natural Harvest?

804
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
 No.

805
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,120
 Interesting book, published by a guy called Paul Fotenhauer, Foti, this is his nickname,

806
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,960
 and it's basically a collection of semen-based recipes.

807
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,960
 Oh, damn.

808
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:39,880
 It's released in 2008, it's a real book, you can buy it, he's done a sequel, which

809
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,440
 is a sort of cocktail bartender's handbook.

810
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,960
 So what kind of tale?

811
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,160
 So here's the description, he says, "semen is not only nutritious, but also has a wonderful

812
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,560
 texture and amazing cooking properties.

813
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,600
 Like fine wine and cheeses, the taste of semen is complex and dynamic.

814
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,640
 Semen is inexpensive to produce and is commonly available in many, if not most, homes and

815
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,640
 restaurants.

816
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,080
 Despite all of these positive qualities, semen remains neglected as a food, and it's an entire

817
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,600
 book that you can get where semen is sort of just added in the recipe as a little twist.

818
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,640
 So is it a lot of normal recipes, just with, you know, like Shepherd's Pie with semen?

819
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,640
 Oh my god.

820
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,640
 Really?

821
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,840
 I mean, because I was thinking it has proteins in it, doesn't it?

822
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,040
 So you could whip it up like egg whites, I was thinking for cocktails, for instance.

823
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,040
 I don't know.

824
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,320
 Like a very small meringue.

825
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,880
 Very small meringue though.

826
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,720
 No, do you remember "Midget Gems", Andy?

827
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,720
 I do.

828
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,480
 They were like little bits of biscuit with a tiny meringue on top.

829
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,440
 I thought they had very complex flavours when I was growing up.

830
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,440
 I had no idea.

831
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,440
 I don't know what you're talking about.

832
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,840
 No, you had to grow up in the UK in the 1980s to get that.

833
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,000
 "Midget Gems", I swear to God, the Peter K demographic has just lost their minds for

834
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
 that bit.

835
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,480
 That's good.

836
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:04,840
 So when you're sending semen from one place to another, you obviously need it to be in

837
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,960
 as good condition as possible and that's why you might need something called an extender.

838
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,440
 And an extender is a nutrition rich liquid which you can add to your semen from, let's

839
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,600
 say, a horse or from whatever and it will make it last for longer.

840
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,040
 So you can get human extender.

841
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,360
 There's one company called Sperm Prep which they make this thing out of egg yolks and

842
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,480
 you can kind of mix it in and it'll make sperm last for longer.

843
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,000
 One of them is called Excel which obviously make sure you get the right Excel if you're

844
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,240
 trying to get something on your computer, don't go for the wrong thing.

845
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,240
 And also another one called BTS.

846
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,920
 So if you're ever trying to buy a Korean pop groups record, make sure you get the right

847
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
 BTS.

848
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,340
 And so what it just sort of keeps it in good nick and yeah, it's nutrition, right?

849
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:57,640
 Like it's the one that James is talking about with the yolk is that's called a TYB, a test

850
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,160
 yolk buffer and it's basically the same, it's the same principles of when a person is ovulating,

851
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,840
 they obviously have to feed.

852
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:09,480
 It helps the sperm to get fed as it's trying to fertilize and this is the exact same principle.

853
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,000
 So it's like chicken egg yolk or a type of chicken egg yolk that is just feeding it as

854
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
 it's in the mail.

855
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
 It's really clever.

856
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
 It's really interesting.

857
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,100
 This whole situation with sperm donors in the pandemic, because the supply has not been

858
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,420
 as great as the demand.

859
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,180
 The demand has been huge because a lot of people as they've been sitting at home think

860
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,980
 actually I maybe I do want a kid and maybe they haven't been able to do it and so they

861
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,900
 need the donations, but they haven't been able to get enough into the actual sperm banks

862
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,900
 to distribute them.

863
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,380
 So there's been this whole kind of black market that is a black market that exists on Facebook

864
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,040
 pages for example.

865
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:50,740
 And there were these, what are kind of known as these kind of like mega sperm donors, these

866
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:57,480
 specific men in the US who famously have fathered, you know, hundreds of kids, they've been flying

867
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:03,200
 all over the country since the lockdown has stopped and been sort of like handing over

868
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
 their sperm basically.

869
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,240
 Also, these guys are kind of like, they used to have, before there was artificial insemination,

870
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,040
 they had what's called the bore truck and it was just a bore with good genes that would

871
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,140
 travel from farm to farm and inseminate the sounds.

872
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,140
 Wow.

873
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,140
 Exactly that.

874
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
 The bore truck.

875
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,620
 And it's what, the most interesting thing about it is you know who the donor is, which

876
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,100
 apparently has been a big thing for a long time.

877
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,300
 You have a lot of people going, I wish I could know the name and the genetics of the family

878
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,220
 that I'll be inheriting through the father's sperm.

879
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,780
 And this is the quick way of doing it.

880
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:35,740
 You don't have to wait till a child is 18.

881
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,740
 You suddenly can do it.

882
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,740
 Yeah.

883
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,740
 Remember there's a story about the guy.

884
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,560
 Like a genius sperm bank, you know, supposedly all these well-bred Ivy League school types

885
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:49,480
 would come in and donate sperm and there was a waiting list and it turned out in the end,

886
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,940
 it's just the guys started the company.

887
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,480
 It's just all his sperm.

888
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,480
 No way.

889
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
 Just one guy.

890
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,480
 Yeah.

891
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,480
 A lot of it was one guy.

892
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
 Yeah.

893
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,480
 They charged him a lot of money.

894
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,480
 It was quite a scam.

895
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,480
 Yeah.

896
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,480
 Gosh.

897
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,920
 I think he found it hard to get Nobel Prize winners to donate, didn't he?

898
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,700
 And also a lot of them are in their 60s and 70s and 80s and perhaps aren't giving the

899
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,740
 full cup full at that age.

900
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,700
 But also you want their dads, don't you?

901
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:16,980
 You want the dads of the Nobel Prize winners.

902
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:17,980
 So...

903
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,980
 Oh, good point.

904
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:19,980
 You want Mozart's dad.

905
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,980
 You don't want Mozart.

906
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:21,980
 This is...

907
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,160
 A lot of this is the plot of a Roald Dahl novel.

908
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,300
 Roald Dahl's readers novel and Roald Dahl's least family appropriate novel.

909
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,580
 James and the Giant Sperm, was it?

910
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,060
 Oh my gosh.

911
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,220
 Charlie and the Sperm Factory.

912
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,400
 George's Marvelous Medicine.

913
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,960
 No, it was...

914
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,200
 It's called My Uncle Oswald.

915
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,200
 Oh.

916
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,400
 And it is extremely rude.

917
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,480
 It's hilarious and very...

918
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,560
 It's absolutely scandalous and it was before he started becoming cuddly Uncle Roald.

919
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:55,520
 Here's something that I didn't know about Sperm until I was researching this week.

920
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,920
 And that is post-ejaculatory modifications to Sperm, otherwise known as Pems.

921
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,140
 This is, in lots of animals, we're kind of just starting to learn about it so we don't

922
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:07,620
 know how common it is.

923
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:13,780
 But in lots of animals, a male sperm, once it gets into the female reproductive system,

924
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:20,380
 will change and will gain proteins and gain changes from the reproductive tract of the

925
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,380
 female.

926
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:22,940
 So it will actually completely change.

927
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,180
 So there are some animals where the sperm will be a certain size and then once it gets

928
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:33,120
 into the female, she will add some kind of proteins or whatever and it will grow in size.

929
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,160
 Some of them they will turn inside out.

930
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,740
 The scientists who were writing about this were saying basically the problem is that

931
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,140
 all of our biology over the last 500 years, people have basically only looked at male

932
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:45,940
 subjects all the way through.

933
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:50,000
 And now that we're starting to look at more of the female reproductive system, we're starting

934
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,740
 to learn a whole load of stuff that we didn't know before.

935
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:53,740
 That's crazy.

936
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
 Isn't that amazing?

937
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,400
 I've never heard of that.

938
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,400
 That's insane.

939
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,300
 It's like having a different outfit for when you're trying to get into a club versus an

940
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,780
 outfit that you're comfortable dancing in.

941
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,780
 We should wrap up shortly.

942
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,340
 Do you guys have anything else before we go?

943
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,700
 William Shatner got all of the horse semen in his recent divorce.

944
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,740
 That's just a fact.

945
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:16,740
 Wow.

946
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,740
 Yeah.

947
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:18,740
 There's not much more to say about that.

948
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,300
 Apart from he and his wife got divorced, they have horses and she's allowed to visit

949
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,560
 the horses, but explicitly in the settlement, he gets all the sperm.

950
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
 Okay.

951
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,880
 So he gets the horses as well.

952
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,600
 It's not like he just collects.

953
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
 No.

954
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,920
 He doesn't just go once every few months and collects it.

955
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
 Wow.

956
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
 No.

957
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,460
 That's a kind of weird future custody element almost.

958
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,360
 I don't know if it's custody.

959
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,800
 They didn't say anything about the consistency.

960
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,800
 What is he doing with it is the question.

961
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,900
 While making more horses, I think.

962
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,900
 Making more horses.

963
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
 Okay.

964
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,900
 Oh, he's got natural harvest.

965
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
 Paul.

966
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,900
 Paul.

967
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,900
 Okay.

968
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,900
 That is it.

969
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,820
 That is all of our facts.

970
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,300
 Thank you so much for listening.

971
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,500

00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,000
 If you're listening over there, it's called Fuzz.

 If you're in the UK, it is called Animal Vegetable Criminal.

991
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:54,460
 This is genuinely, and I don't care that she's here with us right now listening to this.

992
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,060
 This is the best author out there.

993
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,420
 She's the best we've got.

994
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,020
 Such an honor to have her on our show.

995
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,020
 Do get this new book.

996
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:02,340
 We're reading at the moment and it's just fucking awesome.

997
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,340
 All right.

998
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,400
 We will be back again next week with another episode and we'll see you then.

999
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:06,900
