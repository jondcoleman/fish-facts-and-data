00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.180
 Now, before I remind you about our tour, which is about to begin in places such as

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.680
 Tumbridge Wells, Nottingham Richmond, Reading, Peterborough and a whole load of other places,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.120
 I want to tell you about the very, very, very special guest that we have on today's show.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.480
 Anna is away at the moment, she's on holiday, I'm not sure exactly where she's gone, probably

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.180
 somewhere very sunny.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.240
 Last day saw she was removing lots of the holiday clothes from her bag and replacing

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 them with 19th century literature, so I'm sure she's having a great time.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.360
 But in her place, we have the incredible journalist and author, Mary Roach.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.120
 Now I don't know if you'll know about Mary, you really should if you don't.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.160
 She is, well, what I would say is if you were to take QI, the TV show, and No Such Thing

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.160
 as a Fish, and squish it all together in a tiny little ball, send it over to America,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.940
 and then reconstitute it as a single human, then pretty much you're going to end up with

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.940
 Mary Roach.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.300
 She has written some of the greatest popular science books in history.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.380
 Books such as Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, Bonk, The Curious Coupling

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.940
 of Science and Sex, I think you can see probably why we get on very well with Mary, Packing

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.980
 for Mars, The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Gulp, Adventures on the Elementary Canal,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.520
 and her latest book is in America, it's called Fuzz When Nature Breaks the Law, and in the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.120
 UK it is known as Animal Vegetable Criminal, and it is a book all about times when the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.360
 natural world came up against the legal world.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.240
 I haven't read it yet, Dan has read it, and he assures me it's absolutely brilliant, and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.360
 I can definitely believe that because I've read all of Mary's other books, and to a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.920
 tome, they are incredible, so really do enjoy the show, I'm sure you will.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.780
 Buy Mary's new book, and pretty much all of her old books if you're interested in stuff,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.380
 and do come to our live shows.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.220
 If you live in any of the aforementioned places that I mentioned earlier on, then come along

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.740
 in the next couple of weeks, or if you live anywhere in the UK and Ireland, then go to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 qi.com/fishevents and you can see where we'll be playing near you.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:30.880
 Okay, on with the podcast.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.600
 to you from four undisclosed locations globally.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.820
 My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.300
 and our very special guest, it is Mary Roach, and once again we have gathered round the microphones

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.140
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.820
 we go.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.940
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Mary.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.660
 When feeling threatened, gulls practice a maneuver called defensive vomiting, the point

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.160
 of which experts say is not to discuss and repel the predator, but to offer it an alternative

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160
 meal.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.520
 Wow, what possibly could they offer that is better than what the animal was coming for

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.680
 in the first place?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
 Is it vomit?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 Is it actual vomit?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 It is, it's vomit, and I think that is a service because it's partially digested.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 Oh yeah.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.080
 It saves effort, so when I first heard about defensive vomiting, I actually heard about

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.340
 it in a vulture, because vultures do this too, and I thought, oh, they do this to be lighter,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.580
 so when they flee, when they fly away, they'll have less weight, and then the guy said, no,

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.980
 no, that's not why they do it.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.780
 The other thing I thought would be to discuss to them, because you hear about women feeling

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.940
 threatened and like vomiting to discuss to their attacker, so I thought it was that,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.260
 in fact, no, it's just to offer them something more appealing to eat.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.080
 I was reading in your book that you were talking to an expert, and specifically the items that

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.360
 she has seen been vomited up before her include ants, strawberry shortcake, a large mackerel.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.400
 Yeah, but Dan, think about it, that does make sense, right?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.880
 If you're coming over to eat a gull, but you get some strawberry shortcake instead, then

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.560
 that's obviously way tastier, though.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560
 That's a big win.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.040
 Well, it looks like from the list that sometimes it's a very awesome cuisine, like spaghetti

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.300
 marinara with mussels, and the other times, it's a loaded diaper.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.300
 Wow.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.860
 I wonder if the predator ever waits sitting there in front of a diaper that's just been

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.180
 vomited up in front of it, and it's saying, no, I'm still going to eat you unless you

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.820
 can come up with something a little bit better.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.420
 The guy was saying, hang on, hang on, I've got some shortcake, I'm sure I had some shortcake

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.420
 earlier.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.980
 I read of one bird, the full mar.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980
 Do you know this one?

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.100
 It's very oily, the full mar, and in the olden days, they used to use them as torches.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.240
 They would set them on fire because they were so oily.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.000
 I read that they sometimes vomit very, very oily sick onto another animal, and it might

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.160
 stop their feathers from working and stop them from being able to fly and swim and stuff

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160
 like that.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160
 Right.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 Yeah, that's a very cool idea.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.840
 So many things you can do with vomit.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.360
 I think we underutilize our own vomit.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
 Yeah.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
 Are there powers?

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.960
 Do we have extra powers to our vomit that we're not utilizing?

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.360
 I don't know if we do.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.360
 Maybe so.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.800
 You're really interested in that, aren't you?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.200
 Because just this morning, you messaged us saying that you'd just been vomited on.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
 Yes.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.040
 This wasn't me doing research for the show.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.360
 My son vomited on me this morning in pure coincidence, he's a bit ill, but yeah, it

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360
 is.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.360
 I couldn't fly afterwards.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360
 I was very stagey.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 I really like it.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.240
 It's not bird related, but it's a Nigerian bit of folklore that there are snakes which

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.840
 will vomit up a diamond, okay?

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.280
 If they're hunting at night, they need a bit of light, and so they throw up a diamond,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.440
 and the light will refract around inside it and light up the local area.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.720
 That's really interesting, because do you know those little bits of glass in Rhodes'

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.720
 cat size?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.960
 Well, they were supposed to have been invented in the 20th century, right?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.080
 But it seems like maybe snakes invented them way before.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080
 Yes.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.920
 The snakes don't do this, unfortunately.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.200
 It would be amazing if they did.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.600
 The reason the myth came about is they've got these little mineral deposits, I think

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.600
 they're called calculi, or calculi, I don't know how you pronounce it.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.840
 They're like kidney stones basically in their bodies, and so they are there, but they're

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.840
 not diamonds, and the snakes don't throw them up.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.000
 But I guess people have cut open the snakes and said, "Ah, look, here's the magical diamond

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.160
 it uses as a torch."

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.680
 But don't you need a light source?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.920
 Do they also throw up a flashlight?

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.080
 I mean, where are they?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.740
 It's like the diamond is no good if you don't have the right kind of light.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.740
 So true.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.080
 So vultures do it as well.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080
 Any other birds?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.600
 Any other animals do this?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.960
 I've only heard of vultures and gulls.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.720
 Vultures are problematic because they like to roost on, you know, those giant communications

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720
 towers.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.040
 They have a lot of places for vultures to just sit there and hang out, which they like

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.360
 to do.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.520
 And so it makes it really, if you're someone whose job is to climb the communications tower

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.400
 and do work, you, first of all, are stepping a lot of vultures shit all over the struts

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.880
 of the communications tower, but also you have like 50 vultures vomiting down this rain of

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880
 vomit.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.520
 Oh my goodness.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.520
 Yeah.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:32.480
 I heard that when I first read about gulls spewing out, I thought it was a thing about,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.480
 you know, just getting weight off so that they could fly away faster.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.400
 And that's, that turns out to be a myth, but apparently it's not a myth within Komodo

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400
 Dragons.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.400
 They can't fly.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.400
 That's a different dragon you're thinking of, Dan.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.400
 Sorry, yeah.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.520
 But you know, if they need to make a speedy getaway, they will just quickly have a vomit

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.840
 and it will lighten their load a bit, just allowing them that extra bit of speed.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.680
 And also, I'm sorry, how do we really know what the answer is?

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.920
 Nobody's asked the gulls.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920
 Yes.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.360
 We've got different theories and I kind of like the, you know, speedy getaway.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.720
 Let me lighten the load.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.320
 Have we even tested that as a theory?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.160
 Like, surely Usain Bolt should have had a quick vomit before he ran some of those hundred

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.120
 meters to really smash the record.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.720
 You do get that sports people sometimes do vomit before the sporting events.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.720
 I've heard of a few soccer players doing it, but usually I think it's like nerves and

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.720
 stuff like that, right?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.720
 Adrenaline and stuff.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.960
 And of course, there was the marathon runner, what she called Paula Radcliffe.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.200
 Paula Radcliffe, she had a poo halfway through, which might have lightened her load and.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.200
 Did she win?

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.200
 Yeah, she did.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200
 She did.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200
 See, it works.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.560
 I think though, in the long run, she probably would think, maybe I wouldn't take that poo.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.960
 Maybe it wasn't worth the win because it's all anyone talks about.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.880
 It's the greatest speed marathon run out of all time, and that's all we ever talk about

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880
 anyway.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.880
 Exactly.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.760
 Like, three of us knew that she definitely had a poo, but I did not know if she won that

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760
 race.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.160
 This example of the gull vomiting, which is in your book, which I was reading about, it

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.480
 kind of was leading into this story about how there was huge problems at the Vatican when

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.760
 the Pope was going to have a big celebration and they had all these daffodils there and

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.440
 all the gulls were coming in and they don't eat flowers, but they were pissed off and seemed

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.740
 to be knocking them over and they thought maybe they were going in to pick the worms,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.440
 but there was no obvious sign that there was happening and you sort of were questioning

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.600
 whether or not this is just a dickhead species of gull, maybe.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.600
 Exactly.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.680
 As we learned, gulls will eat just about anything, but they don't eat flowers and daffodils.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.160
 I read somewhere a poisonous, so and they didn't eat.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.160
 They weren't eating them.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:38.960
 They were just sort of pulling them up and throwing them around and the people who set

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.960
 this floral display up, they come down from the Netherlands and they spend like the entire

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.400
 day before setting it up, so they were pretty pissed at the gulls, but there wasn't any

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.640
 obvious reason gulls do a defensive thing where they pull up grass to just be macho

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.920
 and say, "This is my territory," but that's why I just sort of thought, "Well, is it just

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.920
 that they're dicks?

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.920
 I don't know."

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.140
 Mary, I was reading about the training that you did because I know the book is all about

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.880
 wildlife and humans and the sort of vexed legal areas between them, and you did this.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880
 Is it what?

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.880
 Yes.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880
 Wildlife, human, attack, response training.

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.000
 Yeah, it's kind of a, I don't know if you guys have forensics shows, like people go

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.160
 into the crime scene and collect evidence.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.480
 It's kind of that, but when wild animals killed someone.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.800
 So they still have the yellow tape, you know, and the people come in with their evidence

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.700
 bags, the little evidence flags, and they're looking for blood spatter patterns and all

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.700
 that stuff.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.520
 I love it though, because the thing you wrote about is we do think, okay, so they're coming

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.160
 in and they're looking at, say, like a cougar that's killed a young man, but then it turns

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.680
 out that's all a setup.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.560
 The cougar has been framed, and actually it was a human killer that they didn't identify

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.520
 at the time only years later because they see puncture marks, but those have been framed,

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.280
 and I just love the idea that they're there to sort of suss out, okay, it looks like they

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.680
 were mauled by a cougar, but were they really?

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.620
 It was a dude with an ice pick who stabbed somebody in the neck, and some doofus wildlife

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.420
 person who didn't take wart training, he's like, yeah, that looks like a cougar because

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.420
 they go right for the neck.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.780
 Yeah, they do go for the neck, but they have an upper jaw and a lower jaw, and the teeth

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.560
 marks are look a certain way, they don't look like an ice pick anyway.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:23.780
 So that guy finally did get busted like 10 years later, he was bragging about the crime

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.780
 in prison or something else.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.780
 In prison.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.780
 Oh, there we go.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.480
 So the advice I read about what to do if you have to shoot a bear because it's attacking

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.880
 someone, and it said, I can't believe this, but I wanted to check it with you, your advice

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:41.840
 to run up to the bear, plant the barrel on it, and then shoot upwards, and it's because

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.160
 you can't aim under those circumstances because it's so stressful.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.160
 Yeah, exactly.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.560
 And also, there's a whole thing about if a bear is attacking somebody and they're going

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.640
 at it, and you're trying to shoot the bear, how do you make sure you don't shoot the guy?

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.740
 So there was this story of this, I forget the guy's name, Wharf or something, or Wolf,

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.900
 I don't know, anyway, he killed the bear, but he also shot the guy in the leg, but,

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.380
 you know, a small price to pay, I suppose.

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.940
 I suppose you can't really outrun a bear if it's going to come after you, right?

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.780
 So you might as well go towards it.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:15.660
 But if it's busy attacking your friend, you've got a chance.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.660
 Yes, you do.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.780
 Always give a second slowest person.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:21.780
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:23.740
 Well, you could try the vomit.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.740
 What?

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.740
 It's busy.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:27.920
 Your friend's being mauled by the bear.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.400
 You just throw it throwing up in the background.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.600
 Mary, did you do any arson stuff or arson dog stuff in the course of the book?

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600
 Any arson?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.680
 Sorry, I was reading about the arson dogs that they have in America.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.280
 Have you heard of these?

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.280
 It's insane.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.800
 There's a place in Connecticut called the Accelerant Detection Canine School.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.400
 Oh, the Accelerant?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:55.620
 All the anything used to get a fire going, they can identify 17 different types of Accelerant.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.740
 And this is the amazing thing.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.300
 Sometimes they will bring the dogs to the fire while it's still burning, because often

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.660
 when there's a fire, there's a crowd of onlookers, right?

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.520
 But sometimes the people who set the fire are in the crowd watching it, and they will

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.100
 turn up and the dog will sniff a few drops of petrol or whatever they used on them and

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.100
 then they get busted.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.100
 Wow.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.100
 That's incredible.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.140
 We should probably move on in a sec to our next fact.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.640
 Does anyone else want to add anything before we do?

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.520
 Can I say something about fly vomit?

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.520
 Yeah.

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:30.800
 Most people vomit after they eat, but flies will vomit onto the food that they're planning

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.200
 to eat and digest it outside the body, kind of turn it into soup and then basically put

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.200
 a straw in it and suck it up.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.200
 Fround on.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.200
 Yeah, we frowned on.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.200
 Up the face.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:51.260
 I once went to New Zealand and I was in a cave and it was pitch black and you kind of float

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.540
 on these rubber rings and on the ceiling, it looks like stars.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.460
 It looks like you're looking at the heavens.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.460
 I've seen it.

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.460
 Have you seen it?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.460
 Yeah.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.460
 So the glowworms, right?

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.540
 But what they don't, well, what they do tell you, but what I'd forgotten is that actually

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:09.300
 it's glowworm vomit that is hanging down from the ceiling.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.460
 And what they do is they vomit out these strands and then animals get caught in it and then

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.920
 they can gobble it up a bit like flypaper.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.680
 They did some analysis on the vomit and they found that it was 99% water and 1% something

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680
 else.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:29.200
 And that something else turns out to be urea, which is basically glowworm piss.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.320
 And they're not quite sure how the piss gets into the vomit, but it does seem like they're

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.400
 vomiting out pissy water to collect these insects.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.380
 James, just quickly, the New Zealand cave you went to.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.380
 Is it called the Waikiki?

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.380
 Yeah.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.380
 Waikiki, I think.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.380
 Yeah.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.380
 Something like that.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.820
 We went on tour to Australia and New Zealand and that's what you did with your time after

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.820
 the tour ended.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.500
 Yes, it is actually, as it happens.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.980
 I also went to the Hobbit World.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.540
 No, it's good, but just I had a few days extra, but I didn't have the means to travel.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.700
 So I just went to the Wellington Funicular Railway Museum instead.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.420
 I have to say, yours does sound more exciting.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.780
 I've got to say both of these sound very much on brand, don't they?

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.280
 I went to World of Socks.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.280
 What?

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280
 I heard about it.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.000
 I saw signs before and I made my husband take a detour for World of Socks.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.500
 That's amazing.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500
 It's just a store.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:27.320
 It's a store that sells socks.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:36.080
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.080
 Okay.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.940
 My fact this week is that any truffle farmer worth their salt will do regular PCR tests

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.440
 on their truffles.

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:52.620
 Are they testing them for COVID and do they have to go into isolation, blah, blah, blah.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.420
 So this is basically me playing off the fact that PCR tests are just a very common widely

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.460
 used thing in biology and chemistry.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:07.520
 They are tests where you make billions and billions of copies of the DNA of a sample

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.560
 and it just means that you can test it a lot easier.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:18.360
 I went very recently to the Echomuse de la Trouffe in the village of Soge in France,

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.720
 which is the big truffle museum in France, and this is something I learned while I was

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720
 there.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.080
 Is this whole podcast, you just doing tax deductible trips by mentioning it as work?

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.560
 Is that what's going on?

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.060
 I've been doing that for eight years now, I surprise you haven't noticed by now.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.660
 Yeah, so there's a few reasons why you might do it.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.460
 So first of all, you might want to check your truffles to make sure that there's no other

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.900
 funguses coming into your farm yard because a truffle for anyone who doesn't know, it's

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.580
 like a mushroom, but it's from the fungal family, but unlike a normal mushroom, it doesn't

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:52.580
 send out spores.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.900
 The spores all grow on the inside and they grow underground and you can pull them out

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.280
 and they're delicious to eat, but they're very, very expensive.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.080
 And so when you're growing them, you need to know that they're growing properly and

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.920
 the PCR tests can check if there's any other fungus in the area.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.680
 And the other way that they're useful is you get a lot of cheap funguses coming in from

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.440
 different parts of the world, especially from China.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.360
 And so when you are selling your truffles, you can do a PCR test to show they're the

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.160
 real deal and they're not cheap truffles from elsewhere in the world.

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.580
 And what's amazing as well is those cheap truffles are so identical to a real truffle

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:33.140
 that even if you held them under a microscope, the spores are just not different enough for

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.740
 you to be able to tell the difference.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.740
 Yeah, it's incredible.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:41.900
 So there's two ways of telling, one on a molecular level, or the other way is by tasting it,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:48.540
 because according to French truffle aficionado Eduardo Manazares, it tastes like a turnip.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:54.920
 Whereas a truffle has this amazing kind of earthy flavor, doesn't it, like actual truffles,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.360
 but these ones taste like potatoes, uncooked, unsalted potatoes.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:59.360
 But you know what?

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.160
 I think probably you ship them over here to America, the fake ones, and then nobody will

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160
 know.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.000
 I'm not sure I've ever eaten any truffles.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.920
 I did think, oh, no, once a few years ago I had some chips which had truffle oil on

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:12.920
 them.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.120
 Imagine my surprise researching this fact, most truffle oil has never even been near

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120
 a truffle.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.740
 It's made of something called bis-meltilio-methane, which is derived from petroleum, and the

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.560
 only reason it's used is that it smells a bit like truffle.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.560
 No.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560
 Wait.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.000
 You did put a petrol on your chips.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.320
 Yeah, I wonder why they were burned all the time.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:39.720
 So they use, we're talking about arson dogs earlier, they use truffle dogs to find them,

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.080
 but not only do they use truffle dogs, they use truffle hogs.

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.080
 Truffle hogs are amazing.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.560
 These are domesticated pigs that go around smelling out the truffles, and the reason

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:56.600
 they're able to smell them is because they share the natural sex hormones that the male

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.280
 pigs produce in their testicles, which they somehow bring up to their mouth and salivate

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.400
 out for the female pig to smell.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.080
 It's got a very similar smell, and so they're basically smelling the ground for male hogs,

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.480
 but finding truffles.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.480
 That's amazing.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:18.880
 I encountered some amazing boar technology that involved those pheromones and that saliva

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.280
 in Denmark in order to figure out which pigs are ready for mating.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.800
 You can do it by just taking around a teaser boar, and the boar kind of salivates and makes

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.000
 these horrible, retching, grunting sounds, and the females that get aroused, they know,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.240
 "Okay, these females are ready for insemination," but instead of the teaser boar, somebody, the

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:46.040
 Danish Pig Production Council, I think it was, they developed this boar on wheels, remote

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:51.160
 controlled, that was doused with boar mate, which is the pheromone of the boar.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160
 It's a spray.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:56.480
 So it was doused with that, and they had an MP3 of it playing the retching horrible grunting

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.400
 sounds, and they would make it go around to all the females to see which ones were ready,

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.440
 but it didn't work very well, and the farmers didn't like it.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440
 This name was Skippy.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:13.400
 Oh, boy, you'd feel really disappointed if you'd called for Skippy the bush kangaroo

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.720
 and Skippy the wheeled sex boar turned up.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.200
 The thing is about the pigs, Dan, you were saying, is that they don't really use pigs

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:27.000
 anymore because of the hogs, because they basically will eat the truffles if they find

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.240
 them, whereas the dogs will just sniff them.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.240
 And the other thing is, if you have a really good area where your truffles are, then you

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.360
 don't want anyone else to know about them, you want to keep it secret.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.440
 If you drive up there with a dog in your car, then people will think, oh, he's just taking

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.440
 his dog for a walk.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.720
 But if you drive up there with a pig in your car, then people are like, well, I know what

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720
 this guy's up to.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.840
 Well, I've got a good idea what this guy might be up to.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.280
 That's exactly it, because the idea is, as soon as the pig finds it, you basically have

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.200
 to wrestle the 20 stone pig, and you have to wrestle the truffle out of its mouth.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.440
 That's impossible to do, whereas dogs will swap the sausages, apparently.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.840
 They kind of notify you, and then they say, okay.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.880
 But actually the best thing to find truffles is truffle flies.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.920
 So truffle flies can find truffles better than dogs and pigs, and that's because female

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:22.000
 truffle flies like to lay their eggs in truffles, so they need to be able to find them.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.840
 And the way that you do that is you walk around, because these flies are really, really tiny

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.600
 and they're almost see-through, so you can hardly see them, and you just prod the grass

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.280
 with the little stick, and then if you get the right moment, then they'll all kind of

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.160
 fly up, and they'll hover over the area where your truffles are, and then you can dig in

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.160
 and get them.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.960
 Would you eat a truffle which had truffle flies in it, James?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960
 In it?

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960
 Hmm.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.520
 Well, I must say, I'm not a big fan of any kind of mushrooms, so probably not.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.520
 No, not really.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.520
 Okay.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.520
 Because apparently that does happen.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.680
 It's not always treated as a bad thing if there are truffle flies in there.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:57.360
 So there was a doctor at the University of Nancy called Dr. Francis Martin, who said that

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:01.240
 if you collect it just at the right time, the truffle will have eggs and larvae in

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.320
 it, which adds proteins and aroma to the truffle.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.600
 Have you ever eaten any weird stuff like that, Mary?

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.120
 I kind of get the feeling you might have done that.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.880
 I have had some weird food.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.760
 Yeah, I was up in the Arctic, in an Inuit town, because I had this idea, like, if you

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.880
 only eat meat, how do you get your vitamins?

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:27.080
 And the answer is the organ meats, so they basically eat the whole entity.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:32.440
 I went to this community feast, and they had this Arctic char lying there, and the guy

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.480
 who was hosting me said, "We're going to give you the best part," and I could see

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.480
 you sort of cutting something that looks like the forehead, and I was like, "Oh, okay, great,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.960
 because I know cheeks, you know, cheeks are good, so probably forehead is pretty good,"

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:51.280
 but it was the raw eye, and it's a fairly sizable fish, though it has a fairly sizable

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:56.200
 eye, and it had that, you know, that thing hanging in the muscular thing in the back.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.120
 I don't know if you know that the back of the eye has this, it's kind of like when

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.800
 you eat a chicken leg, that hard, awful, tendony bit, it was like that, and I said, "Oh, thank

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.440
 you," and all the elders were standing around, like, nodding like, and I don't know if they

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.120
 were just, it was a prank, or it really is the best part, but I said, "It's not going

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.760
 to be like a cherry tomato, is it?"

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:20.680
 They don't eat cherry tomatoes, he's like, he's like, "No, no, no, it was like a cherry

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:26.400
 tomato, it just exploded in my mouth," because you'd have to eat the whole thing at once,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.240
 you know, take a bite because it would dribble.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.800
 Oh my goodness.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:35.520
 I've never had truffle, I mean, I guess I've had shaved truffle, shavings, so, you know,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.680
 but that's, yeah, I don't know, I don't know what all that fuss is.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:43.240
 I know, I sell for so much, so like a pound of black truffle, you can get white and black

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.960
 truffle, you can sell for like 400 American dollars a pound.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.560
 Do you guys know, is it the case that it's not just about eating, but if you can get

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:55.640
 a truffle, you can breed it, is that the thing, or is it not, is it purely just eating?

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.360
 Some of them are cultivated, in fact, there are some kinds that you can and some you can't,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.600
 so I think it's Italian white truffles, they're still wild and they're really hard to find,

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.160
 but French black truffles, pretty much all of those are cultivated, so.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.880
 Yeah, something like 95% now of all the French truffles are cultivated these days, they cultivate

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.320
 them all over the world, in America they certainly do, for sure.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.640
 It takes 10 years for them to grow, and it might be that you just plant your farm then

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.440
 10 years later, you find out you've got a load of turnips.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.400
 Well, not if you use your PCR test.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.640
 A lot of your PCR tests, absolutely.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.640
 Have you guys heard of Helen Gilkey?

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640
 No.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640
 No.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.400
 So Helen Gilkey was the first woman to receive a PhD in botany at the University of California

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:43.000
 in Berkeley, and she was the world expert on truffles, probably throughout the 1930s,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.320
 1940s and into the 1950s.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.920
 She named a whole load of truffles, but whenever she named them she also drew them, as she

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.400
 would also write a poem about them, and the poems that she wrote were amazing, so here's

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.680
 a poem that she wrote.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:03.840
 Now here comes Hidnotriah, it's hymenium lush, lining the walls with a deep piled plush,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.200
 gradually merging at entrances wide into the pattern of surface outside.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.360
 American species we have not a few, and both those in Europe we likewise have two.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:21.280
 For example, H. Tulasnei of Old World Fame by mycologist Berkeley, given its name, its

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:27.160
 presence in US regarded as myth, until here discovered by Alex H. Smith.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160
 Very nice.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.160
 That's great.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.400
 It's a bit of dogarole, but I think that's really nice.

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.400
 I love it.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.440
 I love it when a poem is like a Wikipedia article for you, like we just got the story of the

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.440
 truffle.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:42.320
 She must lean very heavily on the words snuffle, scuffle and ruffle though.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.160
 Can I tell you one thing about the truffle of the year?

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160
 Oh, yes.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.280
 This was a thing in the '40s and '50s, and it was a PR campaign.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.360
 There was a guy called Jacomo Mora who was trying to make white truffles fashionable,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.240
 which they weren't at the time, it was all about the black truffles then, and he launched

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.640
 this campaign where he would send the best truffle of the year to a global celebrity.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:11.960
 So in 1949, Rita Hayworth received the best truffle of the year.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:19.600
 53, Winston Churchill, 1954, Marilyn Monroe, Paul VI in 1965, Emperor Haile Selassie got

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.160
 one, or just this weird club of people who've received the best truffle.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.160
 That's incredible.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.480
 Do we know that they received them as in they didn't just receive some weird thing in the

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.480
 mail and chuck it away?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.400
 I'm sure it was recorded delivery, but I don't really find their reactions.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.560
 We haven't got photos of Marilyn with the truffle of Haile Selassie.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.320
 Even if it wasn't recorded delivery, he probably had a letter with it explaining what it was.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.040
 It probably wasn't just a truffle through the past.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:50.480
 Hopefully, they were given some kind of warning before it showed up, because I used to work

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.320
 at the SPCA, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.600
 I was in the public affairs office, and my boss at one year, for Christmas presents for

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.760
 people in the media, she had these cookies in the shape of a bone, human cookies, and

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.440
 she just left them in a bag on the doorstep.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.880
 She went around and delivered them, but she didn't tell people.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:18.400
 Someone called the bombs squad and blew off the cookies.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.760
 On truffles and how much people love them, I just love this line.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.600
 The composer Rossini, he claimed that he had only cried three times in his entire life.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600
 Okay?

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600
 Here's the quote.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.080
 He said, "Once when my first opera failed.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.640
 Once again, the first time I heard Paganini play the violin, and once when a truffle's

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:41.760
 turkey fell overboard at a boating picnic."

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:51.440
 Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.920
 My fact this week is that there are signed copies of Life Magazine circulating on auction

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:02.480
 sites that are said to be autographed by Ham, the first chimpanzee in space, but are in

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.920
 fact forgeries signed by other chimps.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920
 Wow.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.200
 Other chimps that have been in space or just other chimps?

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200
 No.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200
 Oh, really?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.400
 Just boring other chimps.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.400
 This is true.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:22.400
 I talked to Ham's trainer and vet, Bill Brits, when I was working on Packing for Mars, and

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.280
 he said, he's talking about how Ham was this beloved world famous on the cover of Life

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:33.280
 Magazine to the extent that people were sending flowers and letters to Ham, and they started

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.200
 requesting autographs for Ham the chimpanzee.

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:42.080
 So Bill tried to oblige them, you know, they would send their copy, and Ham the chimp was

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.200
 not signing with a pen, it was a paw print, and at a certain point he said, "I was afraid

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.800
 we would wear him out."

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:54.200
 So at a certain point we just took any chimpanzee and used their palms, so it is true.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.800
 The other chimps are actually, I've accused them of forging signatures here, they are

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.320
 innocent bystanders whose palms have been pressed onto paper.

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:06.560
 I was quite benevolent then, that's nice, I didn't know that background, that's a

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.560
 relief.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.000
 Yeah, as in it was done for Ham's benefit, you know.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.880
 Part of it was, you know, because the Soviets had put dogs up in space and successfully

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.440
 landed them, the U.S. was trying to make a really big deal about, "Look, we did it too!"

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.880
 It was like he was a short hairy astronaut, they dressed him up in a pressure suit, which

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.800
 he didn't need, the capsule was pressurized to these photo shoots, and he was a very

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:36.120
 friendly outgoing chimp, unlike the second chimp, Enos, that nobody ever talks about.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.480
 So what was wrong with Enos?

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.680
 He was a very ornery, aggressive, unpleasant, and kind of ugly chimpanzee.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.080
 The Buzz Aldrin, yes.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.080
 Wow.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.800
 Just your buzz is grumpy.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.840
 Yeah, his trainer, Dr. Finney, you know, people would ask him about him, this is how he described

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:04.680
 him in public, instead of saying he was ornery, he was cussed, he was horrible, he said he

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.360
 was a taciturn pillar of the community kind of guy.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:12.400
 Oh, do you know these handprints?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.760
 Can you tell the difference between a ham one and a sham one?

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.840
 Is it possible to tell the difference or not?

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.320
 Probably if you had a real one and you compared it, I mean, they're probably fingerprints,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.320
 right?

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:26.320
 Oh, yeah, I guess so.

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.800
 I would imagine it would be pretty easy, but you'd need to have an actual ham print, yeah.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.640
 I've seen a photo, they do look quite hard to distinguish, they're quite inky, they're

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.440
 quite thick, so the one that I found was sold on an auction site back in, I think around

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:46.520
 2008 and sold for surprisingly little, in my opinion, it was $2,100 and they sell other

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:52.040
 things like, you know, like on lots of animals, you'll have the identifying name on a little

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.040
 metal sign.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.360
 What do you mean, Dan, do you mean like a dog tag?

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.560
 A dog tag, sorry, but it was a chimp tag, yeah, actually just very quickly because a lot

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.400
 of people listening might actually not be aware that we sent primates to space before

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.480
 we sent humans, and in fact, Ham has that honour.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:13.000
 Ham is the first primate to go into space, beat Alan Shepard, the American, beat Yuri

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.920
 Gagarin, the Russian, and this was on the 31st of January 1961.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.480
 It was a test for the Americans to make sure that everything would go right ahead of their

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.760
 trip with Alan Shepard, which actually cost them the honour of getting the first man in

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.040
 space because Yuri Gagarin got in there in that time, but Ham was a huge celebrity back

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040
 in the day.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.160
 It was obviously a big deal, and as Mary was saying, just a really charismatic chimp.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.720
 And you know who got no publicity at all was the five Alberts who went up before Ham.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:46.720
 What?

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.800
 Yeah, the Alberts, and then there was Patricia and Michael.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:54.200
 These were all monkeys, they weren't apes, you know, chimps and apes were monkeys that

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.000
 were launched in a suborbital flight and came back down.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.400
 Right, but wow, I've never heard of them.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400
 Yeah, the Alberts.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.400
 The first Alberts ended catastrophically.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.560
 They didn't survive, so at a certain point somebody realised, you know, maybe we should

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.440
 stop calling them Alberts.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.200
 They switched to Michael and Patricia.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.960
 It's a bit weird naming them in the first place, because it does humanise them a bit

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.520
 more when you hear that, you know, Michael and Patricia have not survived their space

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.520
 journey.

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.760
 It's much sadder.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.360
 But so Ham was retrospectively named because for that exact reason, Andy, so when I say

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.160
 that the dog tag was sold, I didn't say the word Ham on it, it just had the number 65,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.800
 because that was the number of chimpanzees he was in a big number of, I think around

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.280
 80 chimpanzees who were auditioned for the role.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.320
 What kind of audition was it?

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.280
 You had to sing a song, then you had to do your party trick.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.280
 In a 2-2.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:51.400
 Yeah, there was a swimsuit round, yeah, it was bizarre, the training wasn't bizarre,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.720
 it was very soundively worked out, but you had to push a lever after seeing a light.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.280
 That was the mission, and then that's what Ham had to do in space.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.600
 Yeah, it was basically to make sure that they were still functioning, that something horrible

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.200
 wasn't happening to their cognitive abilities in zero gravity, that they were able to do

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.760
 the training that they'd been trained to do.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.120
 Ham did do a breast briefing after his trip.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:19.520
 He was wheeled out, as you say, in the suit, or certainly he was asked to get into the

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.800
 metal couch that was like the one he'd been in on the space flight, and he very vigorously

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.120
 refused to get in there.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.880
 So it seems to imply he didn't have a wonderful time.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.800
 It's a thing that's sort of being rewritten in the sort of perception of Ham, because

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.520
 the footage that always gets shown of Ham is him having, let's say, a quite pleasant

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.160
 trip up into space, but the extended version of it, and I've not seen the footage myself,

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.440
 but there's a lot of talk about there being a lot of distress in his face and him being

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.160
 quite scared, and Jane Goodall, who did see the footage when it happened, said she's never

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.920
 seen a chimpanzee look so scared in her life with the facial expressions, and I think at

00:33:54.920 --> 00:34:00.000
 the time, as Mary, you point out in the book, no one knew how to place Ham.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.960
 Was Ham an astronaut who was going there as part of a heroic adventure, or was it an animal

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.920
 who had no idea what was going on?

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.840
 And obviously it was an animal that had no idea, but the perception was that it was

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.040
 a hero for America.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.160
 And so the narrative was that, and it's being reassessed a lot now to say, actually, it

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.200
 was animal cruelty.

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.960
 I have a refrigerator magnet of Ham, and he looks like he's smiling.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.940
 In fact, that's not a smile, that's a sort of a grimace of stress, but people looked

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.280
 at it and thought, oh, look, he looks so happy.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:39.000
 But I have a photo of myself doing that on a log flume, right, on a theme park, and again,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
 it does look like a smile, but I'm not happy.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.340
 I was looking at other Ham's in space.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.340
 Go on.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.800
 Well, I found a few.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.360
 So we've mentioned on the podcast before, the first ever meal eaten on the moon was

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360
 a Ham sandwich.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.200
 So, you know, Ham is quite an iconic thing.

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.200
 By Buzz Aldrin.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.200
 By Buzz Aldrin.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.200
 The ugly one.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200
 Oh, no.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.200
 The grumpy one.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200
 Oh, my God.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.480
 So that would be a little dehydrated cubed Ham sandwich, about one inch square, I believe.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.480
 Oh, what's that?

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:12.480
 Yeah.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.960
 We're not talking rye and mustard and lettuce and tomato.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.700
 Well, you see, in my head, it was always like, yeah, like a 12-inch sub.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.700
 Definitely.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:21.700
 Yeah.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.200
 The ones that went to the moon, the space sandwiches then were like, they were little

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:31.180
 dehydrated cubes that you would pop the whole sandwich in your mouth at once so there would

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.180
 be no crumbs.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.700
 Because if you had crumbs and they floated around and they get into the electronics and

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.660
 they could cause problems and they were so dry that you would have to moisten them with

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:41.660
 your own saliva.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:48.100
 You'd have to hold them in your mouth and kind of gather up the spit to make them swallowable.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100
 Wow.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:53.420
 They were so, they tended, this stuff tended to travel up into space and come right back

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.420
 down.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.640
 And they also didn't want to eat because they didn't have a toilet, they just had the bag,

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640
 the fecal bag.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.000
 A lot of times they, on these shorter missions particularly, Gemini, they just didn't eat

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.780
 because they didn't want to use the bag.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.780
 So, yeah.

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.780
 That makes sense.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:08.780
 That makes sense.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.620
 Just on that, do you remember we had Tim Beacon about a year ago talking about his

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.620
 time in space?

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.260
 I don't think we ever mentioned, they do this training where you're underwater for a while,

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:18.060
 the special underwater base.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:22.540
 And they had a problem with their toilet and for whatever reason, the answer became you

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:29.780
 had to stick your bum out of this underwater base and just sort of poo into the open ocean.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:34.100
 But the problem was that lots of fish got the message that this was dinner time and

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.000
 they would turn up and they'd start nibbling your bum if you didn't have a poo quickly

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.540
 enough.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:47.140
 Is that a nice thing when people like go into shopping centers sometimes and get fished

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.420
 and nibble on their feet, right?

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.260
 People say that's a nice feeling, do you think it's the same on the bum bum?

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:57.420
 James is actually banned from every shopping center in the UK for misuse of those facilities.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:02.340
 And I think they tried to solve the problem by putting up this curtain of bubbles to give

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.000
 the astronauts in training a kind of privacy screen, right?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.820
 But unfortunately, it was just a massive dinner gong and all the fish would see the

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.220
 bubbles from miles away and go, "Oh, great, there's going to be an astronaut poking their

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.220
 arse out."

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:18.900
 I suppose it's all right if there's a little kind of nibbling fish, but if you get a huge

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.100
 like great white shark coming along, you don't want that, do you?

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.180
 What a death, though.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:30.500
 What to report there, Tim Peake died when a shark ate him anus first.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:38.320
 Do you guys know, you might probably do know her actually, Peggy Whitson.

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.200
 She's an astronaut, so she has the record for the most time that any American has been

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.320
 in space and any woman has been in space.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:55.720
 She was in space for 665 days and she was the first person to do a real-time kind of

00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:02.300
 DNA test to find species while in the ISS.

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.540
 So basically, they would scrape a bit of the table and they would put it in and they would

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:10.980
 be able to tell which species are there and that's obviously really, really important,

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.980
 especially in the future.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:16.220
 It might be really important when we're trying to find, you know, if there is life on other

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.220
 planets or wherever.

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:21.900
 But she did that, of course, using a PCR test.

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:28.060
 So in the future, any astronaut worth their salt will be doing a PCR test wherever they

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.060
 go.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.060
 Wow.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:32.640
 I interviewed Commander Whitson, Peggy from Mars.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.640
 I did.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.880
 She's just really badass fabulous.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:41.720
 So she told me this story about, she was coming back from the ISS on Soyuz, you know, the

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.040
 capsule, and they do, they don't do a splashdown.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:49.160
 They come down on land while they, it was kind of an off-nominal as they say.

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.340
 Things didn't go quite right and she didn't land where she was meant to land.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:39:00.700
 She lands in this field out on the steps and she gets out and then this farmer comes over

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.940
 and he's like, "Where did you come from?"

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.180
 And she's like, "I came from space."

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.100
 He's just like, "Walks away."

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:11.700
 That's amazing.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:22.160
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.880
 My fact is that you can now send sperm on a postcard.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:32.360
 Andy's address is...

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.760
 So I couldn't do it before.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760
 Could I not?

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:38.040
 Well, it's just been proved that it can be done.

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.760
 So you mean like, and it survives?

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:44.820
 I mean, it's a dead sperm on a postcard forever.

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.820
 Yes.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.820
 Absolutely.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.700
 Since the invention of the medium, yeah, it's been, I'm sure.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.820
 Probably one of the first things they said, I would have thought.

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.820
 Absolutely.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.820
 Wish you were here.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:04.860
 Okay, so this is an experiment that some scientists in Japan at Yamanashi University

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860
 have been doing.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:11.280
 Normally, sperm gets sent around the place in glass vials and it's vulnerable to breaking

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.400
 and some freezing methods are things like freezing with liquid nitrogen, which it's

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.760
 not a great system for sending sperm around the place.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:24.200
 And they have been working on ways to make sperm viable in transit in more convenient

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.200
 ways.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.320
 And they've been freeze-drying sperm for some years now and now they are getting to the

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.840
 bit of their experiments where they are sending it around.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:37.140
 So what they did was they freeze-dried some sperm, mouse sperm in this case, onto a single

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:42.500
 sheet of paper and they sandwiched the paper between two little sheets of plastic, but

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:46.700
 then they just attached that to a postcard and they sent it through the post.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:53.220
 And it was absolutely fine and they were able to get viable mice bred from this sperm and

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.700
 they would really test themselves as well.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.340
 They sent it a new year when the postal system is under a lot of stress because lots of people

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.840
 are writing to each other.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.280
 And what was on the back of the postcard?

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.880
 Was it a scenic view?

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.480
 One of them was a happy new year card.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:14.400
 We do know that from the experiment, but they haven't clarified what else was on the exciting

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.400
 bits.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:16.400
 Oh, I don't know if it was the front or the back, actually.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.640
 I assume that it was on the bit where you write the message.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:19.640
 Yeah.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:20.640
 You would think so.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.640
 Yeah.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.640
 Right.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.880
 But the bigger challenge here is possibly how to get the sperm out of the mouse.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.940
 That is a bit of a challenge for scientists.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:35.880
 I talked to a woman who was looking into a male birth control and they were testing it

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:43.340
 on macaques and she said, "We had a heck of a time getting them to, you know, they wanted

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:46.180
 them to masturbate and produce a sample."

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.020
 And it was very, very difficult.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.740
 They had to end up using a sort of ejaculator thing.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.260
 But anyway, she had this great line.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:57.140
 She said, "A monkey is not smart enough to know what we want, but too smart to have sex

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.840
 with an artificial vagina."

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.220
 Because that's what they were trying to get them to mount the artificial monkey vagina.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.940
 So that was the challenge.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.940
 So a mouse?

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.940
 Yeah.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.520
 Well, maybe this is the answer to your postcard question because maybe on the other side

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.680
 was a sexy picture of a mouse and they just got them looking at it and as they ejaculated,

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680
 just swap it around.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:20.480
 If you know how they got sperm out of a mouse, then send your answers on a postcard to Andra

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.240
 Kuntamari.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:29.480
 Maybe they just wheel in a little mouse on wheels, you know, playing some noise.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480
 Skippy.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.480
 Skippy, what is this?

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.480
 Korea's really dropped.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.920
 Well, you've got a new gig, mate.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.580
 No, but Mary, you're absolutely right about the, because I know that for bigger animals,

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.060
 they sometimes use a little...

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.560
 Artificial vagina.

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.320
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, ejaculator, yeah.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320
 Yes.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.240
 Which goes, I think, into up the bum.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:55.840
 And then, yeah, quick blast of that, and away you go.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.680
 But no, you're right, they use the artificial ones too, but for a mouse, I don't know if

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.680
 anyone makes a...

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.680
 It's tiny.

00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680
 More tiny.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.680
 Yeah.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680
 It was interesting.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:08.680
 They tried lots of different types of paper, didn't they, to see which was the best.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:13.120
 They tried washi, which is like that traditional Japanese wrapping paper.

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.040
 They also tried like a vinyl sheet.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.080
 They tried weighing paper, which turned out to be the best filter paper, a few different

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.080
 things.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.760
 And that even though some of them were, it's like, for instance, weighing paper, were particularly

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.080
 well, some of them didn't work because the paper would stick together with the sperm,

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:30.080
 and so you wouldn't be able to get it back afterwards.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080
 Interesting.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.080
 Right.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.120
 I might be wrong about this, but I think from what I was reading in the paper, the sperm

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.080
 mattozoa die, but you can still get the DNA.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.280
 The DNA remains intact, and then you can take the DNA and then you can inject it into like

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280
 a...

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280
 Right.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.040
 I don't know what an oocyte or whatever they inject stuff into.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040
 I see.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040
 Okay.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040
 Yeah.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:55.200
 The sperm, it's not like in Star Wars where they bring back Han Solo after he's been frozen

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.000
 in position in the thing.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.200
 How do they get the sperm out of Han Solo?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.800
 Is it a solo Han thing?

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:05.680
 They are very nice.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:12.480
 Some mouse sperm, they think are saboteurs, which kind of act as cock blockers for other

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.000
 sperm or for rival mouse sperm.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.320
 They seem to block the sense of direction systems in other mouse sperm, which is just

00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.320
 remarkable.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.320
 That's interesting.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:27.240
 I remember someone did a study testing this theory that the corona of the glands, the penis

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:33.680
 was a sperm displacement device, like, in other words, if you go in right after another

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:40.280
 guy's been in there, this ridge would kind of remove the other person's sperm.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:46.440
 And what I enjoyed about this study is that they had to come up with a recipe for semen

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:48.200
 simulant in order to test this.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:56.600
 They also had to buy a bunch of dildos, and in my book, actually I had two recipes for

00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:01.880
 semen simulant and one with cornstarch base, one fire-based.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.840
 What I liked a lot was that, you know how in a recipe it'll be like, yield two dozen

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.840
 cookies?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.280
 This is what it said, yield one ejaculate.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280
 Wow.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:20.880
 Speaking of semen recipes, have you guys happened to come across, wrong word, the wrong phrasing.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.160
 Have you guys seen the book Natural Harvest?

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160
 No.

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:32.120
 Interesting book, published by a guy called Paul Fotenhauer, Foti, this is his nickname,

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.960
 and it's basically a collection of semen-based recipes.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.960
 Oh, damn.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.880
 It's released in 2008, it's a real book, you can buy it, he's done a sequel, which

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.440
 is a sort of cocktail bartender's handbook.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:46.960
 So what kind of tale?

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:51.160
 So here's the description, he says, "semen is not only nutritious, but also has a wonderful

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.560
 texture and amazing cooking properties.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:57.600
 Like fine wine and cheeses, the taste of semen is complex and dynamic.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.640
 Semen is inexpensive to produce and is commonly available in many, if not most, homes and

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640
 restaurants.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:09.080
 Despite all of these positive qualities, semen remains neglected as a food, and it's an entire

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.600
 book that you can get where semen is sort of just added in the recipe as a little twist.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.640
 So is it a lot of normal recipes, just with, you know, like Shepherd's Pie with semen?

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:20.640
 Oh my god.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640
 Really?

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.840
 I mean, because I was thinking it has proteins in it, doesn't it?

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.040
 So you could whip it up like egg whites, I was thinking for cocktails, for instance.

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.040
 I don't know.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.320
 Like a very small meringue.

00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:35.880
 Very small meringue though.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.720
 No, do you remember "Midget Gems", Andy?

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.720
 I do.

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.480
 They were like little bits of biscuit with a tiny meringue on top.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.440
 I thought they had very complex flavours when I was growing up.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.440
 I had no idea.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.440
 I don't know what you're talking about.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.840
 No, you had to grow up in the UK in the 1980s to get that.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.000
 "Midget Gems", I swear to God, the Peter K demographic has just lost their minds for

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
 that bit.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.480
 That's good.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:04.840
 So when you're sending semen from one place to another, you obviously need it to be in

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.960
 as good condition as possible and that's why you might need something called an extender.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:15.440
 And an extender is a nutrition rich liquid which you can add to your semen from, let's

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.600
 say, a horse or from whatever and it will make it last for longer.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.040
 So you can get human extender.

00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:27.360
 There's one company called Sperm Prep which they make this thing out of egg yolks and

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.480
 you can kind of mix it in and it'll make sperm last for longer.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.000
 One of them is called Excel which obviously make sure you get the right Excel if you're

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.240
 trying to get something on your computer, don't go for the wrong thing.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.240
 And also another one called BTS.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:45.920
 So if you're ever trying to buy a Korean pop groups record, make sure you get the right

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920
 BTS.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:52.340
 And so what it just sort of keeps it in good nick and yeah, it's nutrition, right?

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:57.640
 Like it's the one that James is talking about with the yolk is that's called a TYB, a test

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.160
 yolk buffer and it's basically the same, it's the same principles of when a person is ovulating,

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.840
 they obviously have to feed.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.480
 It helps the sperm to get fed as it's trying to fertilize and this is the exact same principle.

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:14.000
 So it's like chicken egg yolk or a type of chicken egg yolk that is just feeding it as

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
 it's in the mail.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
 It's really clever.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
 It's really interesting.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.100
 This whole situation with sperm donors in the pandemic, because the supply has not been

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:24.420
 as great as the demand.

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:28.180
 The demand has been huge because a lot of people as they've been sitting at home think

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:31.980
 actually I maybe I do want a kid and maybe they haven't been able to do it and so they

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:37.900
 need the donations, but they haven't been able to get enough into the actual sperm banks

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.900
 to distribute them.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:44.380
 So there's been this whole kind of black market that is a black market that exists on Facebook

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:46.040
 pages for example.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:50.740
 And there were these, what are kind of known as these kind of like mega sperm donors, these

00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:57.480
 specific men in the US who famously have fathered, you know, hundreds of kids, they've been flying

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:03.200
 all over the country since the lockdown has stopped and been sort of like handing over

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:04.200
 their sperm basically.

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:08.240
 Also, these guys are kind of like, they used to have, before there was artificial insemination,

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.040
 they had what's called the bore truck and it was just a bore with good genes that would

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.140
 travel from farm to farm and inseminate the sounds.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.140
 Wow.

00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.140
 Exactly that.

00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:19.140
 The bore truck.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.620
 And it's what, the most interesting thing about it is you know who the donor is, which

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.100
 apparently has been a big thing for a long time.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.300
 You have a lot of people going, I wish I could know the name and the genetics of the family

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.220
 that I'll be inheriting through the father's sperm.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.780
 And this is the quick way of doing it.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:35.740
 You don't have to wait till a child is 18.

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.740
 You suddenly can do it.

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:37.740
 Yeah.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.740
 Remember there's a story about the guy.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:44.560
 Like a genius sperm bank, you know, supposedly all these well-bred Ivy League school types

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.480
 would come in and donate sperm and there was a waiting list and it turned out in the end,

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.940
 it's just the guys started the company.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.480
 It's just all his sperm.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.480
 No way.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480
 Just one guy.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480
 Yeah.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480
 A lot of it was one guy.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480
 Yeah.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480
 They charged him a lot of money.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.480
 It was quite a scam.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480
 Yeah.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.480
 Gosh.

00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.920
 I think he found it hard to get Nobel Prize winners to donate, didn't he?

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.700
 And also a lot of them are in their 60s and 70s and 80s and perhaps aren't giving the

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.740
 full cup full at that age.

00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.700
 But also you want their dads, don't you?

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.980
 You want the dads of the Nobel Prize winners.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.980
 So...

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:18.980
 Oh, good point.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:19.980
 You want Mozart's dad.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:20.980
 You don't want Mozart.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:21.980
 This is...

00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:24.160
 A lot of this is the plot of a Roald Dahl novel.

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.300
 Roald Dahl's readers novel and Roald Dahl's least family appropriate novel.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.580
 James and the Giant Sperm, was it?

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:33.060
 Oh my gosh.

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.220
 Charlie and the Sperm Factory.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:38.400
 George's Marvelous Medicine.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.960
 No, it was...

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:41.200
 It's called My Uncle Oswald.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200
 Oh.

00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.400
 And it is extremely rude.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.480
 It's hilarious and very...

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.560
 It's absolutely scandalous and it was before he started becoming cuddly Uncle Roald.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.520
 Here's something that I didn't know about Sperm until I was researching this week.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:01.920
 And that is post-ejaculatory modifications to Sperm, otherwise known as Pems.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.140
 This is, in lots of animals, we're kind of just starting to learn about it so we don't

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.620
 know how common it is.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:13.780
 But in lots of animals, a male sperm, once it gets into the female reproductive system,

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:20.380
 will change and will gain proteins and gain changes from the reproductive tract of the

00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.380
 female.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.940
 So it will actually completely change.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:28.180
 So there are some animals where the sperm will be a certain size and then once it gets

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:33.120
 into the female, she will add some kind of proteins or whatever and it will grow in size.

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.160
 Some of them they will turn inside out.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:39.740
 The scientists who were writing about this were saying basically the problem is that

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.140
 all of our biology over the last 500 years, people have basically only looked at male

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:45.940
 subjects all the way through.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.000
 And now that we're starting to look at more of the female reproductive system, we're starting

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.740
 to learn a whole load of stuff that we didn't know before.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.740
 That's crazy.

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740
 Isn't that amazing?

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.400
 I've never heard of that.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:57.400
 That's insane.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:02.300
 It's like having a different outfit for when you're trying to get into a club versus an

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.780
 outfit that you're comfortable dancing in.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.780
 We should wrap up shortly.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.340
 Do you guys have anything else before we go?

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.700
 William Shatner got all of the horse semen in his recent divorce.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.740
 That's just a fact.

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:16.740
 Wow.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.740
 Yeah.

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.740
 There's not much more to say about that.

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:23.300
 Apart from he and his wife got divorced, they have horses and she's allowed to visit

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.560
 the horses, but explicitly in the settlement, he gets all the sperm.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:28.560
 Okay.

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:29.880
 So he gets the horses as well.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.600
 It's not like he just collects.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600
 No.

00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.920
 He doesn't just go once every few months and collects it.

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.920
 Wow.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.920
 No.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.460
 That's a kind of weird future custody element almost.

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:42.360
 I don't know if it's custody.

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.800
 They didn't say anything about the consistency.

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:50.800
 What is he doing with it is the question.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.900
 While making more horses, I think.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:53.900
 Making more horses.

00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.900
 Okay.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:55.900
 Oh, he's got natural harvest.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:56.900
 Paul.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:57.900
 Paul.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:58.900
 Okay.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:01.900
 That is it.

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.820
 That is all of our facts.

00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.300

 You'll find all of our previous episodes up there.

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.000
 You'll also find links to our tour, which we're about to start.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.440
 We're going to 26 different places in the UK and Ireland.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.340
 We're even playing crazy places like the London Palladium.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:39.420
 So do go and check it out.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.680
 But the most important thing of all is you need to get Mary's latest book in America.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:47.000
 If you're listening over there, it's called Fuzz.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.420
 If you're in the UK, it is called Animal Vegetable Criminal.

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:54.460
 This is genuinely, and I don't care that she's here with us right now listening to this.

00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:56.060
 This is the best author out there.

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:57.420
 She's the best we've got.

00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.020
 Such an honor to have her on our show.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:00.020
 Do get this new book.

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.340
 We're reading at the moment and it's just fucking awesome.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.340
 All right.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.400
 We will be back again next week with another episode and we'll see you then.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:06.900
 Goodbye.
