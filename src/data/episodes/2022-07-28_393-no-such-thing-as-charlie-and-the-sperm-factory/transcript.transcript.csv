00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of No Such Thing as a Fish."
00:00:03,00:00:09,"Now, before I remind you about our tour, which is about to begin in places such as"
00:00:09,00:00:13,"Tumbridge Wells, Nottingham Richmond, Reading, Peterborough and a whole load of other places,"
00:00:13,00:00:19,"I want to tell you about the very, very, very special guest that we have on today's show."
00:00:19,00:00:24,"Anna is away at the moment, she's on holiday, I'm not sure exactly where she's gone, probably"
00:00:24,00:00:26,somewhere very sunny.
00:00:26,00:00:30,Last day saw she was removing lots of the holiday clothes from her bag and replacing
00:00:30,00:00:33,"them with 19th century literature, so I'm sure she's having a great time."
00:00:33,00:00:41,"But in her place, we have the incredible journalist and author, Mary Roach."
00:00:41,00:00:45,"Now I don't know if you'll know about Mary, you really should if you don't."
00:00:45,00:00:50,"She is, well, what I would say is if you were to take QI, the TV show, and No Such Thing"
00:00:50,00:00:56,"as a Fish, and squish it all together in a tiny little ball, send it over to America,"
00:00:56,00:01:00,"and then reconstitute it as a single human, then pretty much you're going to end up with"
00:01:00,00:01:01,Mary Roach.
00:01:01,00:01:07,She has written some of the greatest popular science books in history.
00:01:07,00:01:13,"Books such as Stiff, The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, Bonk, The Curious Coupling"
00:01:13,00:01:18,"of Science and Sex, I think you can see probably why we get on very well with Mary, Packing"
00:01:18,00:01:24,"for Mars, The Curious Science of Life in the Void, Gulp, Adventures on the Elementary Canal,"
00:01:24,00:01:31,"and her latest book is in America, it's called Fuzz When Nature Breaks the Law, and in the"
00:01:31,00:01:37,"UK it is known as Animal Vegetable Criminal, and it is a book all about times when the"
00:01:37,00:01:40,natural world came up against the legal world.
00:01:40,00:01:44,"I haven't read it yet, Dan has read it, and he assures me it's absolutely brilliant, and"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"I can definitely believe that because I've read all of Mary's other books, and to a"
00:01:48,00:01:53,"tome, they are incredible, so really do enjoy the show, I'm sure you will."
00:01:53,00:01:59,"Buy Mary's new book, and pretty much all of her old books if you're interested in stuff,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,and do come to our live shows.
00:02:01,00:02:06,"If you live in any of the aforementioned places that I mentioned earlier on, then come along"
00:02:06,00:02:09,"in the next couple of weeks, or if you live anywhere in the UK and Ireland, then go to"
00:02:09,00:02:14,qi.com/fishevents and you can see where we'll be playing near you.
00:02:14,00:02:30,"Okay, on with the podcast."
00:02:30,00:02:36,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:02:36,00:02:40,to you from four undisclosed locations globally.
00:02:40,00:02:45,"My name is Dan Schreiber, I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:02:45,00:02:50,"and our very special guest, it is Mary Roach, and once again we have gathered round the microphones"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here"
00:02:55,00:02:56,we go.
00:02:56,00:02:59,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Mary."
00:02:59,00:03:05,"When feeling threatened, gulls practice a maneuver called defensive vomiting, the point"
00:03:05,00:03:12,"of which experts say is not to discuss and repel the predator, but to offer it an alternative"
00:03:12,00:03:13,meal.
00:03:13,00:03:18,"Wow, what possibly could they offer that is better than what the animal was coming for"
00:03:18,00:03:19,in the first place?
00:03:19,00:03:20,Is it vomit?
00:03:20,00:03:21,Is it actual vomit?
00:03:21,00:03:25,"It is, it's vomit, and I think that is a service because it's partially digested."
00:03:25,00:03:26,Oh yeah.
00:03:26,00:03:32,"It saves effort, so when I first heard about defensive vomiting, I actually heard about"
00:03:32,00:03:39,"it in a vulture, because vultures do this too, and I thought, oh, they do this to be lighter,"
00:03:39,00:03:43,"so when they flee, when they fly away, they'll have less weight, and then the guy said, no,"
00:03:43,00:03:44,"no, that's not why they do it."
00:03:44,00:03:49,"The other thing I thought would be to discuss to them, because you hear about women feeling"
00:03:49,00:03:54,"threatened and like vomiting to discuss to their attacker, so I thought it was that,"
00:03:54,00:04:00,"in fact, no, it's just to offer them something more appealing to eat."
00:04:00,00:04:06,"I was reading in your book that you were talking to an expert, and specifically the items that"
00:04:06,00:04:13,"she has seen been vomited up before her include ants, strawberry shortcake, a large mackerel."
00:04:13,00:04:16,"Yeah, but Dan, think about it, that does make sense, right?"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"If you're coming over to eat a gull, but you get some strawberry shortcake instead, then"
00:04:20,00:04:22,"that's obviously way tastier, though."
00:04:22,00:04:23,That's a big win.
00:04:23,00:04:28,"Well, it looks like from the list that sometimes it's a very awesome cuisine, like spaghetti"
00:04:28,00:04:32,"marinara with mussels, and the other times, it's a loaded diaper."
00:04:32,00:04:33,Wow.
00:04:33,00:04:38,I wonder if the predator ever waits sitting there in front of a diaper that's just been
00:04:38,00:04:42,"vomited up in front of it, and it's saying, no, I'm still going to eat you unless you"
00:04:42,00:04:43,can come up with something a little bit better.
00:04:43,00:04:47,"The guy was saying, hang on, hang on, I've got some shortcake, I'm sure I had some shortcake"
00:04:47,00:04:48,earlier.
00:04:48,00:04:50,"I read of one bird, the full mar."
00:04:50,00:04:51,Do you know this one?
00:04:51,00:04:57,"It's very oily, the full mar, and in the olden days, they used to use them as torches."
00:04:57,00:04:59,They would set them on fire because they were so oily.
00:04:59,00:05:06,"I read that they sometimes vomit very, very oily sick onto another animal, and it might"
00:05:06,00:05:10,stop their feathers from working and stop them from being able to fly and swim and stuff
00:05:10,00:05:11,like that.
00:05:11,00:05:12,Right.
00:05:12,00:05:13,"Yeah, that's a very cool idea."
00:05:13,00:05:15,So many things you can do with vomit.
00:05:15,00:05:18,I think we underutilize our own vomit.
00:05:18,00:05:19,Yeah.
00:05:19,00:05:20,Are there powers?
00:05:20,00:05:22,Do we have extra powers to our vomit that we're not utilizing?
00:05:22,00:05:24,I don't know if we do.
00:05:24,00:05:25,Maybe so.
00:05:25,00:05:26,"You're really interested in that, aren't you?"
00:05:26,00:05:30,"Because just this morning, you messaged us saying that you'd just been vomited on."
00:05:30,00:05:31,Yes.
00:05:31,00:05:34,This wasn't me doing research for the show.
00:05:34,00:05:39,"My son vomited on me this morning in pure coincidence, he's a bit ill, but yeah, it"
00:05:39,00:05:40,is.
00:05:40,00:05:41,I couldn't fly afterwards.
00:05:41,00:05:42,I was very stagey.
00:05:42,00:05:43,I really like it.
00:05:43,00:05:47,"It's not bird related, but it's a Nigerian bit of folklore that there are snakes which"
00:05:47,00:05:49,"will vomit up a diamond, okay?"
00:05:49,00:05:55,"If they're hunting at night, they need a bit of light, and so they throw up a diamond,"
00:05:55,00:05:58,and the light will refract around inside it and light up the local area.
00:05:58,00:06:02,"That's really interesting, because do you know those little bits of glass in Rhodes'"
00:06:02,00:06:03,cat size?
00:06:03,00:06:06,"Well, they were supposed to have been invented in the 20th century, right?"
00:06:06,00:06:10,But it seems like maybe snakes invented them way before.
00:06:10,00:06:11,Yes.
00:06:11,00:06:12,"The snakes don't do this, unfortunately."
00:06:12,00:06:16,It would be amazing if they did.
00:06:16,00:06:19,"The reason the myth came about is they've got these little mineral deposits, I think"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"they're called calculi, or calculi, I don't know how you pronounce it."
00:06:22,00:06:26,"They're like kidney stones basically in their bodies, and so they are there, but they're"
00:06:26,00:06:28,"not diamonds, and the snakes don't throw them up."
00:06:28,00:06:32,"But I guess people have cut open the snakes and said, ""Ah, look, here's the magical diamond"
00:06:32,00:06:33,"it uses as a torch."""
00:06:33,00:06:35,But don't you need a light source?
00:06:35,00:06:37,Do they also throw up a flashlight?
00:06:37,00:06:40,"I mean, where are they?"
00:06:40,00:06:44,It's like the diamond is no good if you don't have the right kind of light.
00:06:44,00:06:45,So true.
00:06:45,00:06:47,So vultures do it as well.
00:06:47,00:06:48,Any other birds?
00:06:48,00:06:49,Any other animals do this?
00:06:49,00:06:52,I've only heard of vultures and gulls.
00:06:52,00:06:56,"Vultures are problematic because they like to roost on, you know, those giant communications"
00:06:56,00:06:57,towers.
00:06:57,00:07:03,"They have a lot of places for vultures to just sit there and hang out, which they like"
00:07:03,00:07:04,to do.
00:07:04,00:07:09,"And so it makes it really, if you're someone whose job is to climb the communications tower"
00:07:09,00:07:16,"and do work, you, first of all, are stepping a lot of vultures shit all over the struts"
00:07:16,00:07:22,"of the communications tower, but also you have like 50 vultures vomiting down this rain of"
00:07:22,00:07:23,vomit.
00:07:23,00:07:25,Oh my goodness.
00:07:25,00:07:26,Yeah.
00:07:26,00:07:32,"I heard that when I first read about gulls spewing out, I thought it was a thing about,"
00:07:32,00:07:35,"you know, just getting weight off so that they could fly away faster."
00:07:35,00:07:39,"And that's, that turns out to be a myth, but apparently it's not a myth within Komodo"
00:07:39,00:07:40,Dragons.
00:07:40,00:07:41,They can't fly.
00:07:41,00:07:43,"That's a different dragon you're thinking of, Dan."
00:07:43,00:07:44,"Sorry, yeah."
00:07:44,00:07:48,"But you know, if they need to make a speedy getaway, they will just quickly have a vomit"
00:07:48,00:07:52,"and it will lighten their load a bit, just allowing them that extra bit of speed."
00:07:52,00:07:56,"And also, I'm sorry, how do we really know what the answer is?"
00:07:56,00:07:57,Nobody's asked the gulls.
00:07:57,00:07:58,Yes.
00:07:58,00:08:03,"We've got different theories and I kind of like the, you know, speedy getaway."
00:08:03,00:08:04,Let me lighten the load.
00:08:04,00:08:06,Have we even tested that as a theory?
00:08:06,00:08:10,"Like, surely Usain Bolt should have had a quick vomit before he ran some of those hundred"
00:08:10,00:08:13,meters to really smash the record.
00:08:13,00:08:16,You do get that sports people sometimes do vomit before the sporting events.
00:08:16,00:08:20,"I've heard of a few soccer players doing it, but usually I think it's like nerves and"
00:08:20,00:08:21,"stuff like that, right?"
00:08:21,00:08:22,Adrenaline and stuff.
00:08:22,00:08:25,"And of course, there was the marathon runner, what she called Paula Radcliffe."
00:08:25,00:08:30,"Paula Radcliffe, she had a poo halfway through, which might have lightened her load and."
00:08:30,00:08:31,Did she win?
00:08:31,00:08:32,"Yeah, she did."
00:08:32,00:08:33,She did.
00:08:33,00:08:34,"See, it works."
00:08:34,00:08:37,"I think though, in the long run, she probably would think, maybe I wouldn't take that poo."
00:08:37,00:08:41,Maybe it wasn't worth the win because it's all anyone talks about.
00:08:41,00:08:45,"It's the greatest speed marathon run out of all time, and that's all we ever talk about"
00:08:45,00:08:46,anyway.
00:08:46,00:08:47,Exactly.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"Like, three of us knew that she definitely had a poo, but I did not know if she won that"
00:08:51,00:08:52,race.
00:08:52,00:08:58,"This example of the gull vomiting, which is in your book, which I was reading about, it"
00:08:58,00:09:03,kind of was leading into this story about how there was huge problems at the Vatican when
00:09:03,00:09:07,the Pope was going to have a big celebration and they had all these daffodils there and
00:09:07,00:09:12,"all the gulls were coming in and they don't eat flowers, but they were pissed off and seemed"
00:09:12,00:09:17,"to be knocking them over and they thought maybe they were going in to pick the worms,"
00:09:17,00:09:21,but there was no obvious sign that there was happening and you sort of were questioning
00:09:21,00:09:25,"whether or not this is just a dickhead species of gull, maybe."
00:09:25,00:09:26,Exactly.
00:09:26,00:09:31,"As we learned, gulls will eat just about anything, but they don't eat flowers and daffodils."
00:09:31,00:09:34,"I read somewhere a poisonous, so and they didn't eat."
00:09:34,00:09:35,They weren't eating them.
00:09:35,00:09:38,They were just sort of pulling them up and throwing them around and the people who set
00:09:38,00:09:42,"this floral display up, they come down from the Netherlands and they spend like the entire"
00:09:42,00:09:47,"day before setting it up, so they were pretty pissed at the gulls, but there wasn't any"
00:09:47,00:09:52,obvious reason gulls do a defensive thing where they pull up grass to just be macho
00:09:52,00:09:58,"and say, ""This is my territory,"" but that's why I just sort of thought, ""Well, is it just"
00:09:58,00:09:59,that they're dicks?
00:09:59,00:10:00,"I don't know."""
00:10:00,00:10:05,"Mary, I was reading about the training that you did because I know the book is all about"
00:10:05,00:10:10,"wildlife and humans and the sort of vexed legal areas between them, and you did this."
00:10:10,00:10:11,Is it what?
00:10:11,00:10:12,Yes.
00:10:12,00:10:13,"Wildlife, human, attack, response training."
00:10:13,00:10:18,"Yeah, it's kind of a, I don't know if you guys have forensics shows, like people go"
00:10:18,00:10:20,into the crime scene and collect evidence.
00:10:20,00:10:21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:10:21,00:10:24,"It's kind of that, but when wild animals killed someone."
00:10:24,00:10:28,"So they still have the yellow tape, you know, and the people come in with their evidence"
00:10:28,00:10:32,"bags, the little evidence flags, and they're looking for blood spatter patterns and all"
00:10:32,00:10:33,that stuff.
00:10:33,00:10:37,"I love it though, because the thing you wrote about is we do think, okay, so they're coming"
00:10:37,00:10:41,"in and they're looking at, say, like a cougar that's killed a young man, but then it turns"
00:10:41,00:10:42,out that's all a setup.
00:10:42,00:10:46,"The cougar has been framed, and actually it was a human killer that they didn't identify"
00:10:46,00:10:50,"at the time only years later because they see puncture marks, but those have been framed,"
00:10:50,00:10:55,"and I just love the idea that they're there to sort of suss out, okay, it looks like they"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"were mauled by a cougar, but were they really?"
00:10:57,00:10:58,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:58,00:11:04,"It was a dude with an ice pick who stabbed somebody in the neck, and some doofus wildlife"
00:11:04,00:11:10,"person who didn't take wart training, he's like, yeah, that looks like a cougar because"
00:11:10,00:11:11,they go right for the neck.
00:11:11,00:11:15,"Yeah, they do go for the neck, but they have an upper jaw and a lower jaw, and the teeth"
00:11:15,00:11:19,"marks are look a certain way, they don't look like an ice pick anyway."
00:11:19,00:11:23,"So that guy finally did get busted like 10 years later, he was bragging about the crime"
00:11:23,00:11:25,in prison or something else.
00:11:25,00:11:26,In prison.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"Oh, there we go."
00:11:27,00:11:32,So the advice I read about what to do if you have to shoot a bear because it's attacking
00:11:32,00:11:36,"someone, and it said, I can't believe this, but I wanted to check it with you, your advice"
00:11:36,00:11:41,"to run up to the bear, plant the barrel on it, and then shoot upwards, and it's because"
00:11:41,00:11:45,you can't aim under those circumstances because it's so stressful.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"Yeah, exactly."
00:11:46,00:11:50,"And also, there's a whole thing about if a bear is attacking somebody and they're going"
00:11:50,00:11:55,"at it, and you're trying to shoot the bear, how do you make sure you don't shoot the guy?"
00:11:55,00:11:59,"So there was this story of this, I forget the guy's name, Wharf or something, or Wolf,"
00:11:59,00:12:04,"I don't know, anyway, he killed the bear, but he also shot the guy in the leg, but,"
00:12:04,00:12:07,"you know, a small price to pay, I suppose."
00:12:07,00:12:10,"I suppose you can't really outrun a bear if it's going to come after you, right?"
00:12:10,00:12:12,So you might as well go towards it.
00:12:12,00:12:15,"But if it's busy attacking your friend, you've got a chance."
00:12:15,00:12:18,"Yes, you do."
00:12:18,00:12:20,Always give a second slowest person.
00:12:20,00:12:21,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:21,00:12:23,"Well, you could try the vomit."
00:12:23,00:12:24,What?
00:12:24,00:12:25,It's busy.
00:12:25,00:12:27,Your friend's being mauled by the bear.
00:12:27,00:12:30,You just throw it throwing up in the background.
00:12:30,00:12:36,"Mary, did you do any arson stuff or arson dog stuff in the course of the book?"
00:12:36,00:12:37,Any arson?
00:12:37,00:12:41,"Sorry, I was reading about the arson dogs that they have in America."
00:12:41,00:12:43,Have you heard of these?
00:12:43,00:12:44,It's insane.
00:12:44,00:12:47,There's a place in Connecticut called the Accelerant Detection Canine School.
00:12:47,00:12:49,"Oh, the Accelerant?"
00:12:49,00:12:50,"Yeah, exactly."
00:12:50,00:12:55,"All the anything used to get a fire going, they can identify 17 different types of Accelerant."
00:12:55,00:12:57,And this is the amazing thing.
00:12:57,00:13:02,"Sometimes they will bring the dogs to the fire while it's still burning, because often"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"when there's a fire, there's a crowd of onlookers, right?"
00:13:04,00:13:08,"But sometimes the people who set the fire are in the crowd watching it, and they will"
00:13:08,00:13:14,turn up and the dog will sniff a few drops of petrol or whatever they used on them and
00:13:14,00:13:15,then they get busted.
00:13:15,00:13:16,Wow.
00:13:16,00:13:17,That's incredible.
00:13:17,00:13:19,We should probably move on in a sec to our next fact.
00:13:19,00:13:21,Does anyone else want to add anything before we do?
00:13:21,00:13:23,Can I say something about fly vomit?
00:13:23,00:13:24,Yeah.
00:13:24,00:13:30,"Most people vomit after they eat, but flies will vomit onto the food that they're planning"
00:13:30,00:13:37,"to eat and digest it outside the body, kind of turn it into soup and then basically put"
00:13:37,00:13:39,a straw in it and suck it up.
00:13:39,00:13:40,Fround on.
00:13:40,00:13:41,"Yeah, we frowned on."
00:13:41,00:13:42,Up the face.
00:13:42,00:13:51,I once went to New Zealand and I was in a cave and it was pitch black and you kind of float
00:13:51,00:13:55,"on these rubber rings and on the ceiling, it looks like stars."
00:13:55,00:13:57,It looks like you're looking at the heavens.
00:13:57,00:13:58,I've seen it.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Have you seen it?
00:13:59,00:14:00,Yeah.
00:14:00,00:14:01,"So the glowworms, right?"
00:14:01,00:14:04,"But what they don't, well, what they do tell you, but what I'd forgotten is that actually"
00:14:04,00:14:09,it's glowworm vomit that is hanging down from the ceiling.
00:14:09,00:14:14,And what they do is they vomit out these strands and then animals get caught in it and then
00:14:14,00:14:16,they can gobble it up a bit like flypaper.
00:14:16,00:14:22,They did some analysis on the vomit and they found that it was 99% water and 1% something
00:14:22,00:14:23,else.
00:14:23,00:14:29,"And that something else turns out to be urea, which is basically glowworm piss."
00:14:29,00:14:33,"And they're not quite sure how the piss gets into the vomit, but it does seem like they're"
00:14:33,00:14:37,vomiting out pissy water to collect these insects.
00:14:37,00:14:40,"James, just quickly, the New Zealand cave you went to."
00:14:40,00:14:41,Is it called the Waikiki?
00:14:41,00:14:42,Yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Waikiki, I think."
00:14:43,00:14:44,Yeah.
00:14:44,00:14:45,Something like that.
00:14:45,00:14:47,We went on tour to Australia and New Zealand and that's what you did with your time after
00:14:47,00:14:48,the tour ended.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"Yes, it is actually, as it happens."
00:14:50,00:14:51,I also went to the Hobbit World.
00:14:51,00:14:55,"No, it's good, but just I had a few days extra, but I didn't have the means to travel."
00:14:55,00:14:58,So I just went to the Wellington Funicular Railway Museum instead.
00:14:58,00:15:02,"I have to say, yours does sound more exciting."
00:15:02,00:15:06,"I've got to say both of these sound very much on brand, don't they?"
00:15:06,00:15:10,I went to World of Socks.
00:15:10,00:15:11,What?
00:15:11,00:15:12,I heard about it.
00:15:12,00:15:18,I saw signs before and I made my husband take a detour for World of Socks.
00:15:18,00:15:19,That's amazing.
00:15:19,00:15:21,It's just a store.
00:15:21,00:15:27,It's a store that sells socks.
00:15:27,00:15:36,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:15:36,00:15:37,Okay.
00:15:37,00:15:42,My fact this week is that any truffle farmer worth their salt will do regular PCR tests
00:15:42,00:15:46,on their truffles.
00:15:46,00:15:52,"Are they testing them for COVID and do they have to go into isolation, blah, blah, blah."
00:15:52,00:15:58,So this is basically me playing off the fact that PCR tests are just a very common widely
00:15:58,00:16:01,used thing in biology and chemistry.
00:16:01,00:16:07,They are tests where you make billions and billions of copies of the DNA of a sample
00:16:07,00:16:10,and it just means that you can test it a lot easier.
00:16:10,00:16:18,"I went very recently to the Echomuse de la Trouffe in the village of Soge in France,"
00:16:18,00:16:22,"which is the big truffle museum in France, and this is something I learned while I was"
00:16:22,00:16:23,there.
00:16:23,00:16:28,"Is this whole podcast, you just doing tax deductible trips by mentioning it as work?"
00:16:28,00:16:29,Is that what's going on?
00:16:29,00:16:34,"I've been doing that for eight years now, I surprise you haven't noticed by now."
00:16:34,00:16:36,"Yeah, so there's a few reasons why you might do it."
00:16:36,00:16:41,"So first of all, you might want to check your truffles to make sure that there's no other"
00:16:41,00:16:46,"funguses coming into your farm yard because a truffle for anyone who doesn't know, it's"
00:16:46,00:16:51,"like a mushroom, but it's from the fungal family, but unlike a normal mushroom, it doesn't"
00:16:51,00:16:52,send out spores.
00:16:52,00:16:56,The spores all grow on the inside and they grow underground and you can pull them out
00:16:56,00:17:00,"and they're delicious to eat, but they're very, very expensive."
00:17:00,00:17:04,"And so when you're growing them, you need to know that they're growing properly and"
00:17:04,00:17:07,the PCR tests can check if there's any other fungus in the area.
00:17:07,00:17:11,And the other way that they're useful is you get a lot of cheap funguses coming in from
00:17:11,00:17:14,"different parts of the world, especially from China."
00:17:14,00:17:19,"And so when you are selling your truffles, you can do a PCR test to show they're the"
00:17:19,00:17:23,real deal and they're not cheap truffles from elsewhere in the world.
00:17:23,00:17:28,And what's amazing as well is those cheap truffles are so identical to a real truffle
00:17:28,00:17:33,"that even if you held them under a microscope, the spores are just not different enough for"
00:17:33,00:17:34,you to be able to tell the difference.
00:17:34,00:17:35,"Yeah, it's incredible."
00:17:35,00:17:41,"So there's two ways of telling, one on a molecular level, or the other way is by tasting it,"
00:17:41,00:17:48,"because according to French truffle aficionado Eduardo Manazares, it tastes like a turnip."
00:17:48,00:17:54,"Whereas a truffle has this amazing kind of earthy flavor, doesn't it, like actual truffles,"
00:17:54,00:17:58,"but these ones taste like potatoes, uncooked, unsalted potatoes."
00:17:58,00:17:59,But you know what?
00:17:59,00:18:04,"I think probably you ship them over here to America, the fake ones, and then nobody will"
00:18:04,00:18:05,know.
00:18:05,00:18:08,I'm not sure I've ever eaten any truffles.
00:18:08,00:18:11,"I did think, oh, no, once a few years ago I had some chips which had truffle oil on"
00:18:11,00:18:12,them.
00:18:12,00:18:16,"Imagine my surprise researching this fact, most truffle oil has never even been near"
00:18:16,00:18:17,a truffle.
00:18:17,00:18:22,"It's made of something called bis-meltilio-methane, which is derived from petroleum, and the"
00:18:22,00:18:25,only reason it's used is that it smells a bit like truffle.
00:18:25,00:18:26,No.
00:18:26,00:18:27,Wait.
00:18:27,00:18:29,You did put a petrol on your chips.
00:18:29,00:18:34,"Yeah, I wonder why they were burned all the time."
00:18:34,00:18:39,"So they use, we're talking about arson dogs earlier, they use truffle dogs to find them,"
00:18:39,00:18:45,"but not only do they use truffle dogs, they use truffle hogs."
00:18:45,00:18:46,Truffle hogs are amazing.
00:18:46,00:18:51,"These are domesticated pigs that go around smelling out the truffles, and the reason"
00:18:51,00:18:56,they're able to smell them is because they share the natural sex hormones that the male
00:18:56,00:19:01,"pigs produce in their testicles, which they somehow bring up to their mouth and salivate"
00:19:01,00:19:03,out for the female pig to smell.
00:19:03,00:19:09,"It's got a very similar smell, and so they're basically smelling the ground for male hogs,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,but finding truffles.
00:19:10,00:19:11,That's amazing.
00:19:11,00:19:18,I encountered some amazing boar technology that involved those pheromones and that saliva
00:19:18,00:19:23,in Denmark in order to figure out which pigs are ready for mating.
00:19:23,00:19:28,"You can do it by just taking around a teaser boar, and the boar kind of salivates and makes"
00:19:28,00:19:34,"these horrible, retching, grunting sounds, and the females that get aroused, they know,"
00:19:34,00:19:39,"""Okay, these females are ready for insemination,"" but instead of the teaser boar, somebody, the"
00:19:39,00:19:46,"Danish Pig Production Council, I think it was, they developed this boar on wheels, remote"
00:19:46,00:19:51,"controlled, that was doused with boar mate, which is the pheromone of the boar."
00:19:51,00:19:52,It's a spray.
00:19:52,00:19:56,"So it was doused with that, and they had an MP3 of it playing the retching horrible grunting"
00:19:56,00:20:02,"sounds, and they would make it go around to all the females to see which ones were ready,"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"but it didn't work very well, and the farmers didn't like it."
00:20:06,00:20:07,This name was Skippy.
00:20:07,00:20:13,"Oh, boy, you'd feel really disappointed if you'd called for Skippy the bush kangaroo"
00:20:13,00:20:17,and Skippy the wheeled sex boar turned up.
00:20:17,00:20:21,"The thing is about the pigs, Dan, you were saying, is that they don't really use pigs"
00:20:21,00:20:27,"anymore because of the hogs, because they basically will eat the truffles if they find"
00:20:27,00:20:29,"them, whereas the dogs will just sniff them."
00:20:29,00:20:34,"And the other thing is, if you have a really good area where your truffles are, then you"
00:20:34,00:20:37,"don't want anyone else to know about them, you want to keep it secret."
00:20:37,00:20:40,"If you drive up there with a dog in your car, then people will think, oh, he's just taking"
00:20:40,00:20:41,his dog for a walk.
00:20:41,00:20:45,"But if you drive up there with a pig in your car, then people are like, well, I know what"
00:20:45,00:20:46,this guy's up to.
00:20:46,00:20:51,"Well, I've got a good idea what this guy might be up to."
00:20:51,00:20:56,"That's exactly it, because the idea is, as soon as the pig finds it, you basically have"
00:20:56,00:21:00,"to wrestle the 20 stone pig, and you have to wrestle the truffle out of its mouth."
00:21:00,00:21:03,"That's impossible to do, whereas dogs will swap the sausages, apparently."
00:21:03,00:21:06,"They kind of notify you, and then they say, okay."
00:21:06,00:21:10,But actually the best thing to find truffles is truffle flies.
00:21:10,00:21:16,"So truffle flies can find truffles better than dogs and pigs, and that's because female"
00:21:16,00:21:22,"truffle flies like to lay their eggs in truffles, so they need to be able to find them."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"And the way that you do that is you walk around, because these flies are really, really tiny"
00:21:25,00:21:29,"and they're almost see-through, so you can hardly see them, and you just prod the grass"
00:21:29,00:21:33,"with the little stick, and then if you get the right moment, then they'll all kind of"
00:21:33,00:21:37,"fly up, and they'll hover over the area where your truffles are, and then you can dig in"
00:21:37,00:21:38,and get them.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"Would you eat a truffle which had truffle flies in it, James?"
00:21:41,00:21:42,In it?
00:21:42,00:21:43,Hmm.
00:21:43,00:21:47,"Well, I must say, I'm not a big fan of any kind of mushrooms, so probably not."
00:21:47,00:21:48,"No, not really."
00:21:48,00:21:49,Okay.
00:21:49,00:21:50,Because apparently that does happen.
00:21:50,00:21:52,It's not always treated as a bad thing if there are truffle flies in there.
00:21:52,00:21:57,"So there was a doctor at the University of Nancy called Dr. Francis Martin, who said that"
00:21:57,00:22:01,"if you collect it just at the right time, the truffle will have eggs and larvae in"
00:22:01,00:22:06,"it, which adds proteins and aroma to the truffle."
00:22:06,00:22:08,"Have you ever eaten any weird stuff like that, Mary?"
00:22:08,00:22:11,I kind of get the feeling you might have done that.
00:22:11,00:22:12,I have had some weird food.
00:22:12,00:22:18,"Yeah, I was up in the Arctic, in an Inuit town, because I had this idea, like, if you"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"only eat meat, how do you get your vitamins?"
00:22:21,00:22:27,"And the answer is the organ meats, so they basically eat the whole entity."
00:22:27,00:22:32,"I went to this community feast, and they had this Arctic char lying there, and the guy"
00:22:32,00:22:36,"who was hosting me said, ""We're going to give you the best part,"" and I could see"
00:22:36,00:22:41,"you sort of cutting something that looks like the forehead, and I was like, ""Oh, okay, great,"
00:22:41,00:22:45,"because I know cheeks, you know, cheeks are good, so probably forehead is pretty good,"""
00:22:45,00:22:51,"but it was the raw eye, and it's a fairly sizable fish, though it has a fairly sizable"
00:22:51,00:22:56,"eye, and it had that, you know, that thing hanging in the muscular thing in the back."
00:22:56,00:22:59,"I don't know if you know that the back of the eye has this, it's kind of like when"
00:22:59,00:23:04,"you eat a chicken leg, that hard, awful, tendony bit, it was like that, and I said, ""Oh, thank"
00:23:04,00:23:08,"you,"" and all the elders were standing around, like, nodding like, and I don't know if they"
00:23:08,00:23:12,"were just, it was a prank, or it really is the best part, but I said, ""It's not going"
00:23:12,00:23:14,"to be like a cherry tomato, is it?"""
00:23:14,00:23:20,"They don't eat cherry tomatoes, he's like, he's like, ""No, no, no, it was like a cherry"
00:23:20,00:23:26,"tomato, it just exploded in my mouth,"" because you'd have to eat the whole thing at once,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,"you know, take a bite because it would dribble."
00:23:28,00:23:29,Oh my goodness.
00:23:29,00:23:35,"I've never had truffle, I mean, I guess I've had shaved truffle, shavings, so, you know,"
00:23:35,00:23:38,"but that's, yeah, I don't know, I don't know what all that fuss is."
00:23:38,00:23:43,"I know, I sell for so much, so like a pound of black truffle, you can get white and black"
00:23:43,00:23:46,"truffle, you can sell for like 400 American dollars a pound."
00:23:46,00:23:50,"Do you guys know, is it the case that it's not just about eating, but if you can get"
00:23:50,00:23:55,"a truffle, you can breed it, is that the thing, or is it not, is it purely just eating?"
00:23:55,00:23:59,"Some of them are cultivated, in fact, there are some kinds that you can and some you can't,"
00:23:59,00:24:03,"so I think it's Italian white truffles, they're still wild and they're really hard to find,"
00:24:03,00:24:07,"but French black truffles, pretty much all of those are cultivated, so."
00:24:07,00:24:11,"Yeah, something like 95% now of all the French truffles are cultivated these days, they cultivate"
00:24:11,00:24:15,"them all over the world, in America they certainly do, for sure."
00:24:15,00:24:19,"It takes 10 years for them to grow, and it might be that you just plant your farm then"
00:24:19,00:24:22,"10 years later, you find out you've got a load of turnips."
00:24:22,00:24:24,"Well, not if you use your PCR test."
00:24:24,00:24:26,"A lot of your PCR tests, absolutely."
00:24:26,00:24:28,Have you guys heard of Helen Gilkey?
00:24:28,00:24:29,No.
00:24:29,00:24:30,No.
00:24:30,00:24:35,So Helen Gilkey was the first woman to receive a PhD in botany at the University of California
00:24:35,00:24:43,"in Berkeley, and she was the world expert on truffles, probably throughout the 1930s,"
00:24:43,00:24:45,1940s and into the 1950s.
00:24:45,00:24:50,"She named a whole load of truffles, but whenever she named them she also drew them, as she"
00:24:50,00:24:55,"would also write a poem about them, and the poems that she wrote were amazing, so here's"
00:24:55,00:24:56,a poem that she wrote.
00:24:56,00:25:03,"Now here comes Hidnotriah, it's hymenium lush, lining the walls with a deep piled plush,"
00:25:03,00:25:09,gradually merging at entrances wide into the pattern of surface outside.
00:25:09,00:25:14,"American species we have not a few, and both those in Europe we likewise have two."
00:25:14,00:25:21,"For example, H. Tulasnei of Old World Fame by mycologist Berkeley, given its name, its"
00:25:21,00:25:27,"presence in US regarded as myth, until here discovered by Alex H. Smith."
00:25:27,00:25:28,Very nice.
00:25:28,00:25:29,That's great.
00:25:29,00:25:31,"It's a bit of dogarole, but I think that's really nice."
00:25:31,00:25:32,I love it.
00:25:32,00:25:36,"I love it when a poem is like a Wikipedia article for you, like we just got the story of the"
00:25:36,00:25:37,truffle.
00:25:37,00:25:42,"She must lean very heavily on the words snuffle, scuffle and ruffle though."
00:25:42,00:25:48,Can I tell you one thing about the truffle of the year?
00:25:48,00:25:49,"Oh, yes."
00:25:49,00:25:52,"This was a thing in the '40s and '50s, and it was a PR campaign."
00:25:52,00:25:57,"There was a guy called Jacomo Mora who was trying to make white truffles fashionable,"
00:25:57,00:26:01,"which they weren't at the time, it was all about the black truffles then, and he launched"
00:26:01,00:26:05,this campaign where he would send the best truffle of the year to a global celebrity.
00:26:05,00:26:11,"So in 1949, Rita Hayworth received the best truffle of the year."
00:26:11,00:26:19,"53, Winston Churchill, 1954, Marilyn Monroe, Paul VI in 1965, Emperor Haile Selassie got"
00:26:19,00:26:23,"one, or just this weird club of people who've received the best truffle."
00:26:23,00:26:24,That's incredible.
00:26:24,00:26:28,Do we know that they received them as in they didn't just receive some weird thing in the
00:26:28,00:26:29,mail and chuck it away?
00:26:29,00:26:34,"I'm sure it was recorded delivery, but I don't really find their reactions."
00:26:34,00:26:38,We haven't got photos of Marilyn with the truffle of Haile Selassie.
00:26:38,00:26:42,"Even if it wasn't recorded delivery, he probably had a letter with it explaining what it was."
00:26:42,00:26:45,It probably wasn't just a truffle through the past.
00:26:45,00:26:50,"Hopefully, they were given some kind of warning before it showed up, because I used to work"
00:26:50,00:26:53,"at the SPCA, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."
00:26:53,00:26:58,"I was in the public affairs office, and my boss at one year, for Christmas presents for"
00:26:58,00:27:03,"people in the media, she had these cookies in the shape of a bone, human cookies, and"
00:27:03,00:27:07,she just left them in a bag on the doorstep.
00:27:07,00:27:09,"She went around and delivered them, but she didn't tell people."
00:27:09,00:27:18,Someone called the bombs squad and blew off the cookies.
00:27:18,00:27:21,"On truffles and how much people love them, I just love this line."
00:27:21,00:27:27,"The composer Rossini, he claimed that he had only cried three times in his entire life."
00:27:27,00:27:28,Okay?
00:27:28,00:27:29,Here's the quote.
00:27:29,00:27:32,"He said, ""Once when my first opera failed."
00:27:32,00:27:37,"Once again, the first time I heard Paganini play the violin, and once when a truffle's"
00:27:37,00:27:41,"turkey fell overboard at a boating picnic."""
00:27:41,00:27:51,"Okay, it is time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:27:51,00:27:56,My fact this week is that there are signed copies of Life Magazine circulating on auction
00:27:56,00:28:02,"sites that are said to be autographed by Ham, the first chimpanzee in space, but are in"
00:28:02,00:28:05,fact forgeries signed by other chimps.
00:28:05,00:28:06,Wow.
00:28:06,00:28:11,Other chimps that have been in space or just other chimps?
00:28:11,00:28:12,No.
00:28:12,00:28:13,"Oh, really?"
00:28:13,00:28:14,Just boring other chimps.
00:28:14,00:28:15,This is true.
00:28:15,00:28:22,"I talked to Ham's trainer and vet, Bill Brits, when I was working on Packing for Mars, and"
00:28:22,00:28:27,"he said, he's talking about how Ham was this beloved world famous on the cover of Life"
00:28:27,00:28:33,"Magazine to the extent that people were sending flowers and letters to Ham, and they started"
00:28:33,00:28:37,requesting autographs for Ham the chimpanzee.
00:28:37,00:28:42,"So Bill tried to oblige them, you know, they would send their copy, and Ham the chimp was"
00:28:42,00:28:47,"not signing with a pen, it was a paw print, and at a certain point he said, ""I was afraid"
00:28:47,00:28:48,"we would wear him out."""
00:28:48,00:28:54,"So at a certain point we just took any chimpanzee and used their palms, so it is true."
00:28:54,00:28:58,"The other chimps are actually, I've accused them of forging signatures here, they are"
00:28:58,00:29:02,innocent bystanders whose palms have been pressed onto paper.
00:29:02,00:29:06,"I was quite benevolent then, that's nice, I didn't know that background, that's a"
00:29:06,00:29:07,relief.
00:29:07,00:29:10,"Yeah, as in it was done for Ham's benefit, you know."
00:29:10,00:29:14,"Part of it was, you know, because the Soviets had put dogs up in space and successfully"
00:29:14,00:29:19,"landed them, the U.S. was trying to make a really big deal about, ""Look, we did it too!"""
00:29:19,00:29:23,"It was like he was a short hairy astronaut, they dressed him up in a pressure suit, which"
00:29:23,00:29:29,"he didn't need, the capsule was pressurized to these photo shoots, and he was a very"
00:29:29,00:29:36,"friendly outgoing chimp, unlike the second chimp, Enos, that nobody ever talks about."
00:29:36,00:29:38,So what was wrong with Enos?
00:29:38,00:29:44,"He was a very ornery, aggressive, unpleasant, and kind of ugly chimpanzee."
00:29:44,00:29:47,"The Buzz Aldrin, yes."
00:29:47,00:29:48,Wow.
00:29:48,00:29:52,Just your buzz is grumpy.
00:29:52,00:29:58,"Yeah, his trainer, Dr. Finney, you know, people would ask him about him, this is how he described"
00:29:58,00:30:04,"him in public, instead of saying he was ornery, he was cussed, he was horrible, he said he"
00:30:04,00:30:08,was a taciturn pillar of the community kind of guy.
00:30:08,00:30:12,"Oh, do you know these handprints?"
00:30:12,00:30:16,Can you tell the difference between a ham one and a sham one?
00:30:16,00:30:19,Is it possible to tell the difference or not?
00:30:19,00:30:24,"Probably if you had a real one and you compared it, I mean, they're probably fingerprints,"
00:30:24,00:30:25,right?
00:30:25,00:30:26,"Oh, yeah, I guess so."
00:30:26,00:30:30,"I would imagine it would be pretty easy, but you'd need to have an actual ham print, yeah."
00:30:30,00:30:34,"I've seen a photo, they do look quite hard to distinguish, they're quite inky, they're"
00:30:34,00:30:39,"quite thick, so the one that I found was sold on an auction site back in, I think around"
00:30:39,00:30:46,"2008 and sold for surprisingly little, in my opinion, it was $2,100 and they sell other"
00:30:46,00:30:52,"things like, you know, like on lots of animals, you'll have the identifying name on a little"
00:30:52,00:30:53,metal sign.
00:30:53,00:30:55,"What do you mean, Dan, do you mean like a dog tag?"
00:30:55,00:30:59,"A dog tag, sorry, but it was a chimp tag, yeah, actually just very quickly because a lot"
00:30:59,00:31:04,of people listening might actually not be aware that we sent primates to space before
00:31:04,00:31:07,"we sent humans, and in fact, Ham has that honour."
00:31:07,00:31:13,"Ham is the first primate to go into space, beat Alan Shepard, the American, beat Yuri"
00:31:13,00:31:17,"Gagarin, the Russian, and this was on the 31st of January 1961."
00:31:17,00:31:23,It was a test for the Americans to make sure that everything would go right ahead of their
00:31:23,00:31:27,"trip with Alan Shepard, which actually cost them the honour of getting the first man in"
00:31:27,00:31:33,"space because Yuri Gagarin got in there in that time, but Ham was a huge celebrity back"
00:31:33,00:31:34,in the day.
00:31:34,00:31:39,"It was obviously a big deal, and as Mary was saying, just a really charismatic chimp."
00:31:39,00:31:45,And you know who got no publicity at all was the five Alberts who went up before Ham.
00:31:45,00:31:46,What?
00:31:46,00:31:49,"Yeah, the Alberts, and then there was Patricia and Michael."
00:31:49,00:31:54,"These were all monkeys, they weren't apes, you know, chimps and apes were monkeys that"
00:31:54,00:31:59,were launched in a suborbital flight and came back down.
00:31:59,00:32:01,"Right, but wow, I've never heard of them."
00:32:01,00:32:02,"Yeah, the Alberts."
00:32:02,00:32:05,The first Alberts ended catastrophically.
00:32:05,00:32:09,"They didn't survive, so at a certain point somebody realised, you know, maybe we should"
00:32:09,00:32:11,stop calling them Alberts.
00:32:11,00:32:14,They switched to Michael and Patricia.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"It's a bit weird naming them in the first place, because it does humanise them a bit"
00:32:16,00:32:21,"more when you hear that, you know, Michael and Patricia have not survived their space"
00:32:21,00:32:22,journey.
00:32:22,00:32:23,It's much sadder.
00:32:23,00:32:28,"But so Ham was retrospectively named because for that exact reason, Andy, so when I say"
00:32:28,00:32:33,"that the dog tag was sold, I didn't say the word Ham on it, it just had the number 65,"
00:32:33,00:32:37,"because that was the number of chimpanzees he was in a big number of, I think around"
00:32:37,00:32:40,80 chimpanzees who were auditioned for the role.
00:32:40,00:32:42,What kind of audition was it?
00:32:42,00:32:45,"You had to sing a song, then you had to do your party trick."
00:32:45,00:32:46,In a 2-2.
00:32:46,00:32:51,"Yeah, there was a swimsuit round, yeah, it was bizarre, the training wasn't bizarre,"
00:32:51,00:32:55,"it was very soundively worked out, but you had to push a lever after seeing a light."
00:32:55,00:32:59,"That was the mission, and then that's what Ham had to do in space."
00:32:59,00:33:04,"Yeah, it was basically to make sure that they were still functioning, that something horrible"
00:33:04,00:33:09,"wasn't happening to their cognitive abilities in zero gravity, that they were able to do"
00:33:09,00:33:11,the training that they'd been trained to do.
00:33:11,00:33:14,Ham did do a breast briefing after his trip.
00:33:14,00:33:19,"He was wheeled out, as you say, in the suit, or certainly he was asked to get into the"
00:33:19,00:33:23,"metal couch that was like the one he'd been in on the space flight, and he very vigorously"
00:33:23,00:33:25,refused to get in there.
00:33:25,00:33:27,So it seems to imply he didn't have a wonderful time.
00:33:27,00:33:31,"It's a thing that's sort of being rewritten in the sort of perception of Ham, because"
00:33:31,00:33:36,"the footage that always gets shown of Ham is him having, let's say, a quite pleasant"
00:33:36,00:33:41,"trip up into space, but the extended version of it, and I've not seen the footage myself,"
00:33:41,00:33:45,but there's a lot of talk about there being a lot of distress in his face and him being
00:33:45,00:33:50,"quite scared, and Jane Goodall, who did see the footage when it happened, said she's never"
00:33:50,00:33:54,"seen a chimpanzee look so scared in her life with the facial expressions, and I think at"
00:33:54,00:34:00,"the time, as Mary, you point out in the book, no one knew how to place Ham."
00:34:00,00:34:05,"Was Ham an astronaut who was going there as part of a heroic adventure, or was it an animal"
00:34:05,00:34:07,who had no idea what was going on?
00:34:07,00:34:11,"And obviously it was an animal that had no idea, but the perception was that it was"
00:34:11,00:34:14,a hero for America.
00:34:14,00:34:18,"And so the narrative was that, and it's being reassessed a lot now to say, actually, it"
00:34:18,00:34:20,was animal cruelty.
00:34:20,00:34:24,"I have a refrigerator magnet of Ham, and he looks like he's smiling."
00:34:24,00:34:31,"In fact, that's not a smile, that's a sort of a grimace of stress, but people looked"
00:34:31,00:34:34,"at it and thought, oh, look, he looks so happy."
00:34:34,00:34:39,"But I have a photo of myself doing that on a log flume, right, on a theme park, and again,"
00:34:39,00:34:42,"it does look like a smile, but I'm not happy."
00:34:42,00:34:48,I was looking at other Ham's in space.
00:34:48,00:34:49,Go on.
00:34:49,00:34:50,"Well, I found a few."
00:34:50,00:34:55,"So we've mentioned on the podcast before, the first ever meal eaten on the moon was"
00:34:55,00:34:56,a Ham sandwich.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"So, you know, Ham is quite an iconic thing."
00:34:59,00:35:00,By Buzz Aldrin.
00:35:00,00:35:01,By Buzz Aldrin.
00:35:01,00:35:02,The ugly one.
00:35:02,00:35:03,"Oh, no."
00:35:03,00:35:04,The grumpy one.
00:35:04,00:35:05,"Oh, my God."
00:35:05,00:35:10,"So that would be a little dehydrated cubed Ham sandwich, about one inch square, I believe."
00:35:10,00:35:11,"Oh, what's that?"
00:35:11,00:35:12,Yeah.
00:35:12,00:35:14,We're not talking rye and mustard and lettuce and tomato.
00:35:14,00:35:19,"Well, you see, in my head, it was always like, yeah, like a 12-inch sub."
00:35:19,00:35:20,Definitely.
00:35:20,00:35:21,Yeah.
00:35:21,00:35:26,"The ones that went to the moon, the space sandwiches then were like, they were little"
00:35:26,00:35:31,dehydrated cubes that you would pop the whole sandwich in your mouth at once so there would
00:35:31,00:35:32,be no crumbs.
00:35:32,00:35:35,Because if you had crumbs and they floated around and they get into the electronics and
00:35:35,00:35:40,they could cause problems and they were so dry that you would have to moisten them with
00:35:40,00:35:41,your own saliva.
00:35:41,00:35:48,You'd have to hold them in your mouth and kind of gather up the spit to make them swallowable.
00:35:48,00:35:49,Wow.
00:35:49,00:35:53,"They were so, they tended, this stuff tended to travel up into space and come right back"
00:35:53,00:35:54,down.
00:35:54,00:35:58,"And they also didn't want to eat because they didn't have a toilet, they just had the bag,"
00:35:58,00:35:59,the fecal bag.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:00,00:36:04,"A lot of times they, on these shorter missions particularly, Gemini, they just didn't eat"
00:36:04,00:36:05,because they didn't want to use the bag.
00:36:05,00:36:06,"So, yeah."
00:36:06,00:36:07,That makes sense.
00:36:07,00:36:08,That makes sense.
00:36:08,00:36:11,"Just on that, do you remember we had Tim Beacon about a year ago talking about his"
00:36:11,00:36:12,time in space?
00:36:12,00:36:16,"I don't think we ever mentioned, they do this training where you're underwater for a while,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,the special underwater base.
00:36:18,00:36:22,"And they had a problem with their toilet and for whatever reason, the answer became you"
00:36:22,00:36:29,had to stick your bum out of this underwater base and just sort of poo into the open ocean.
00:36:29,00:36:34,But the problem was that lots of fish got the message that this was dinner time and
00:36:34,00:36:38,they would turn up and they'd start nibbling your bum if you didn't have a poo quickly
00:36:38,00:36:41,enough.
00:36:41,00:36:47,Is that a nice thing when people like go into shopping centers sometimes and get fished
00:36:47,00:36:49,"and nibble on their feet, right?"
00:36:49,00:36:52,"People say that's a nice feeling, do you think it's the same on the bum bum?"
00:36:52,00:36:57,James is actually banned from every shopping center in the UK for misuse of those facilities.
00:36:57,00:37:02,And I think they tried to solve the problem by putting up this curtain of bubbles to give
00:37:02,00:37:05,"the astronauts in training a kind of privacy screen, right?"
00:37:05,00:37:08,"But unfortunately, it was just a massive dinner gong and all the fish would see the"
00:37:08,00:37:12,"bubbles from miles away and go, ""Oh, great, there's going to be an astronaut poking their"
00:37:12,00:37:13,"arse out."""
00:37:13,00:37:18,"I suppose it's all right if there's a little kind of nibbling fish, but if you get a huge"
00:37:18,00:37:22,"like great white shark coming along, you don't want that, do you?"
00:37:22,00:37:23,"What a death, though."
00:37:23,00:37:30,"What to report there, Tim Peake died when a shark ate him anus first."
00:37:30,00:37:38,"Do you guys know, you might probably do know her actually, Peggy Whitson."
00:37:38,00:37:44,"She's an astronaut, so she has the record for the most time that any American has been"
00:37:44,00:37:46,in space and any woman has been in space.
00:37:46,00:37:55,She was in space for 665 days and she was the first person to do a real-time kind of
00:37:55,00:38:02,DNA test to find species while in the ISS.
00:38:02,00:38:07,"So basically, they would scrape a bit of the table and they would put it in and they would"
00:38:07,00:38:10,"be able to tell which species are there and that's obviously really, really important,"
00:38:10,00:38:11,especially in the future.
00:38:11,00:38:16,"It might be really important when we're trying to find, you know, if there is life on other"
00:38:16,00:38:18,planets or wherever.
00:38:18,00:38:21,"But she did that, of course, using a PCR test."
00:38:21,00:38:28,"So in the future, any astronaut worth their salt will be doing a PCR test wherever they"
00:38:28,00:38:29,go.
00:38:29,00:38:30,Wow.
00:38:30,00:38:32,"I interviewed Commander Whitson, Peggy from Mars."
00:38:32,00:38:33,I did.
00:38:33,00:38:35,She's just really badass fabulous.
00:38:35,00:38:41,"So she told me this story about, she was coming back from the ISS on Soyuz, you know, the"
00:38:41,00:38:44,"capsule, and they do, they don't do a splashdown."
00:38:44,00:38:49,"They come down on land while they, it was kind of an off-nominal as they say."
00:38:49,00:38:53,Things didn't go quite right and she didn't land where she was meant to land.
00:38:53,00:39:00,She lands in this field out on the steps and she gets out and then this farmer comes over
00:39:00,00:39:04,"and he's like, ""Where did you come from?"""
00:39:04,00:39:07,"And she's like, ""I came from space."""
00:39:07,00:39:10,"He's just like, ""Walks away."""
00:39:10,00:39:11,That's amazing.
00:39:11,00:39:22,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show and that is Andy."
00:39:22,00:39:25,My fact is that you can now send sperm on a postcard.
00:39:25,00:39:32,Andy's address is...
00:39:32,00:39:33,So I couldn't do it before.
00:39:33,00:39:34,Could I not?
00:39:34,00:39:38,"Well, it's just been proved that it can be done."
00:39:38,00:39:39,"So you mean like, and it survives?"
00:39:39,00:39:44,"I mean, it's a dead sperm on a postcard forever."
00:39:44,00:39:45,Yes.
00:39:45,00:39:46,Absolutely.
00:39:46,00:39:50,"Since the invention of the medium, yeah, it's been, I'm sure."
00:39:50,00:39:52,"Probably one of the first things they said, I would have thought."
00:39:52,00:39:53,Absolutely.
00:39:53,00:39:54,Wish you were here.
00:39:54,00:40:04,"Okay, so this is an experiment that some scientists in Japan at Yamanashi University"
00:40:04,00:40:05,have been doing.
00:40:05,00:40:11,"Normally, sperm gets sent around the place in glass vials and it's vulnerable to breaking"
00:40:11,00:40:16,"and some freezing methods are things like freezing with liquid nitrogen, which it's"
00:40:16,00:40:18,not a great system for sending sperm around the place.
00:40:18,00:40:24,And they have been working on ways to make sperm viable in transit in more convenient
00:40:24,00:40:25,ways.
00:40:25,00:40:29,And they've been freeze-drying sperm for some years now and now they are getting to the
00:40:29,00:40:31,bit of their experiments where they are sending it around.
00:40:31,00:40:37,"So what they did was they freeze-dried some sperm, mouse sperm in this case, onto a single"
00:40:37,00:40:42,"sheet of paper and they sandwiched the paper between two little sheets of plastic, but"
00:40:42,00:40:46,then they just attached that to a postcard and they sent it through the post.
00:40:46,00:40:53,And it was absolutely fine and they were able to get viable mice bred from this sperm and
00:40:53,00:40:54,they would really test themselves as well.
00:40:54,00:41:00,They sent it a new year when the postal system is under a lot of stress because lots of people
00:41:00,00:41:01,are writing to each other.
00:41:01,00:41:04,And what was on the back of the postcard?
00:41:04,00:41:06,Was it a scenic view?
00:41:06,00:41:08,One of them was a happy new year card.
00:41:08,00:41:14,"We do know that from the experiment, but they haven't clarified what else was on the exciting"
00:41:14,00:41:15,bits.
00:41:15,00:41:16,"Oh, I don't know if it was the front or the back, actually."
00:41:16,00:41:18,I assume that it was on the bit where you write the message.
00:41:18,00:41:19,Yeah.
00:41:19,00:41:20,You would think so.
00:41:20,00:41:21,Yeah.
00:41:21,00:41:22,Right.
00:41:22,00:41:27,But the bigger challenge here is possibly how to get the sperm out of the mouse.
00:41:27,00:41:29,That is a bit of a challenge for scientists.
00:41:29,00:41:35,I talked to a woman who was looking into a male birth control and they were testing it
00:41:35,00:41:43,"on macaques and she said, ""We had a heck of a time getting them to, you know, they wanted"
00:41:43,00:41:46,"them to masturbate and produce a sample."""
00:41:46,00:41:48,"And it was very, very difficult."
00:41:48,00:41:50,They had to end up using a sort of ejaculator thing.
00:41:50,00:41:52,"But anyway, she had this great line."
00:41:52,00:41:57,"She said, ""A monkey is not smart enough to know what we want, but too smart to have sex"
00:41:57,00:41:58,"with an artificial vagina."""
00:41:58,00:42:04,Because that's what they were trying to get them to mount the artificial monkey vagina.
00:42:04,00:42:05,So that was the challenge.
00:42:05,00:42:06,So a mouse?
00:42:06,00:42:07,Yeah.
00:42:07,00:42:10,"Well, maybe this is the answer to your postcard question because maybe on the other side"
00:42:10,00:42:14,"was a sexy picture of a mouse and they just got them looking at it and as they ejaculated,"
00:42:14,00:42:15,just swap it around.
00:42:15,00:42:20,"If you know how they got sperm out of a mouse, then send your answers on a postcard to Andra"
00:42:20,00:42:23,Kuntamari.
00:42:23,00:42:29,"Maybe they just wheel in a little mouse on wheels, you know, playing some noise."
00:42:29,00:42:30,Skippy.
00:42:30,00:42:31,"Skippy, what is this?"
00:42:31,00:42:32,Korea's really dropped.
00:42:32,00:42:35,"Well, you've got a new gig, mate."
00:42:35,00:42:40,"No, but Mary, you're absolutely right about the, because I know that for bigger animals,"
00:42:40,00:42:43,they sometimes use a little...
00:42:43,00:42:44,Artificial vagina.
00:42:44,00:42:47,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, ejaculator, yeah."
00:42:47,00:42:48,Yes.
00:42:48,00:42:52,"Which goes, I think, into up the bum."
00:42:52,00:42:55,"And then, yeah, quick blast of that, and away you go."
00:42:55,00:42:59,"But no, you're right, they use the artificial ones too, but for a mouse, I don't know if"
00:42:59,00:43:00,anyone makes a...
00:43:00,00:43:01,It's tiny.
00:43:01,00:43:02,More tiny.
00:43:02,00:43:03,Yeah.
00:43:03,00:43:04,It was interesting.
00:43:04,00:43:08,"They tried lots of different types of paper, didn't they, to see which was the best."
00:43:08,00:43:13,"They tried washi, which is like that traditional Japanese wrapping paper."
00:43:13,00:43:15,They also tried like a vinyl sheet.
00:43:15,00:43:19,"They tried weighing paper, which turned out to be the best filter paper, a few different"
00:43:19,00:43:20,things.
00:43:20,00:43:23,"And that even though some of them were, it's like, for instance, weighing paper, were particularly"
00:43:23,00:43:28,"well, some of them didn't work because the paper would stick together with the sperm,"
00:43:28,00:43:30,and so you wouldn't be able to get it back afterwards.
00:43:30,00:43:31,Interesting.
00:43:31,00:43:32,Right.
00:43:32,00:43:35,"I might be wrong about this, but I think from what I was reading in the paper, the sperm"
00:43:35,00:43:38,"mattozoa die, but you can still get the DNA."
00:43:38,00:43:42,"The DNA remains intact, and then you can take the DNA and then you can inject it into like"
00:43:42,00:43:43,a...
00:43:43,00:43:44,Right.
00:43:44,00:43:47,I don't know what an oocyte or whatever they inject stuff into.
00:43:47,00:43:48,I see.
00:43:48,00:43:49,Okay.
00:43:49,00:43:50,Yeah.
00:43:50,00:43:55,"The sperm, it's not like in Star Wars where they bring back Han Solo after he's been frozen"
00:43:55,00:43:57,in position in the thing.
00:43:57,00:43:59,How do they get the sperm out of Han Solo?
00:43:59,00:44:01,Is it a solo Han thing?
00:44:01,00:44:05,They are very nice.
00:44:05,00:44:12,"Some mouse sperm, they think are saboteurs, which kind of act as cock blockers for other"
00:44:12,00:44:15,sperm or for rival mouse sperm.
00:44:15,00:44:19,"They seem to block the sense of direction systems in other mouse sperm, which is just"
00:44:19,00:44:20,remarkable.
00:44:20,00:44:21,That's interesting.
00:44:21,00:44:27,"I remember someone did a study testing this theory that the corona of the glands, the penis"
00:44:27,00:44:33,"was a sperm displacement device, like, in other words, if you go in right after another"
00:44:33,00:44:40,"guy's been in there, this ridge would kind of remove the other person's sperm."
00:44:40,00:44:46,And what I enjoyed about this study is that they had to come up with a recipe for semen
00:44:46,00:44:48,simulant in order to test this.
00:44:48,00:44:56,"They also had to buy a bunch of dildos, and in my book, actually I had two recipes for"
00:44:56,00:45:01,"semen simulant and one with cornstarch base, one fire-based."
00:45:01,00:45:05,"What I liked a lot was that, you know how in a recipe it'll be like, yield two dozen"
00:45:05,00:45:06,cookies?
00:45:06,00:45:10,"This is what it said, yield one ejaculate."
00:45:10,00:45:11,Wow.
00:45:11,00:45:20,"Speaking of semen recipes, have you guys happened to come across, wrong word, the wrong phrasing."
00:45:20,00:45:24,Have you guys seen the book Natural Harvest?
00:45:24,00:45:25,No.
00:45:25,00:45:32,"Interesting book, published by a guy called Paul Fotenhauer, Foti, this is his nickname,"
00:45:32,00:45:34,and it's basically a collection of semen-based recipes.
00:45:34,00:45:35,"Oh, damn."
00:45:35,00:45:39,"It's released in 2008, it's a real book, you can buy it, he's done a sequel, which"
00:45:39,00:45:42,is a sort of cocktail bartender's handbook.
00:45:42,00:45:46,So what kind of tale?
00:45:46,00:45:51,"So here's the description, he says, ""semen is not only nutritious, but also has a wonderful"
00:45:51,00:45:53,texture and amazing cooking properties.
00:45:53,00:45:57,"Like fine wine and cheeses, the taste of semen is complex and dynamic."
00:45:57,00:46:02,"Semen is inexpensive to produce and is commonly available in many, if not most, homes and"
00:46:02,00:46:03,restaurants.
00:46:03,00:46:09,"Despite all of these positive qualities, semen remains neglected as a food, and it's an entire"
00:46:09,00:46:13,book that you can get where semen is sort of just added in the recipe as a little twist.
00:46:13,00:46:18,"So is it a lot of normal recipes, just with, you know, like Shepherd's Pie with semen?"
00:46:18,00:46:20,Oh my god.
00:46:20,00:46:21,Really?
00:46:21,00:46:24,"I mean, because I was thinking it has proteins in it, doesn't it?"
00:46:24,00:46:29,"So you could whip it up like egg whites, I was thinking for cocktails, for instance."
00:46:29,00:46:30,I don't know.
00:46:30,00:46:32,Like a very small meringue.
00:46:32,00:46:35,Very small meringue though.
00:46:35,00:46:38,"No, do you remember ""Midget Gems"", Andy?"
00:46:38,00:46:39,I do.
00:46:39,00:46:43,They were like little bits of biscuit with a tiny meringue on top.
00:46:43,00:46:46,I thought they had very complex flavours when I was growing up.
00:46:46,00:46:47,I had no idea.
00:46:47,00:46:49,I don't know what you're talking about.
00:46:49,00:46:52,"No, you had to grow up in the UK in the 1980s to get that."
00:46:52,00:46:56,"""Midget Gems"", I swear to God, the Peter K demographic has just lost their minds for"
00:46:56,00:46:57,that bit.
00:46:57,00:46:59,That's good.
00:46:59,00:47:04,"So when you're sending semen from one place to another, you obviously need it to be in"
00:47:04,00:47:09,as good condition as possible and that's why you might need something called an extender.
00:47:09,00:47:15,"And an extender is a nutrition rich liquid which you can add to your semen from, let's"
00:47:15,00:47:19,"say, a horse or from whatever and it will make it last for longer."
00:47:19,00:47:22,So you can get human extender.
00:47:22,00:47:27,There's one company called Sperm Prep which they make this thing out of egg yolks and
00:47:27,00:47:30,you can kind of mix it in and it'll make sperm last for longer.
00:47:30,00:47:35,One of them is called Excel which obviously make sure you get the right Excel if you're
00:47:35,00:47:38,"trying to get something on your computer, don't go for the wrong thing."
00:47:38,00:47:41,And also another one called BTS.
00:47:41,00:47:45,"So if you're ever trying to buy a Korean pop groups record, make sure you get the right"
00:47:45,00:47:46,BTS.
00:47:46,00:47:52,"And so what it just sort of keeps it in good nick and yeah, it's nutrition, right?"
00:47:52,00:47:57,"Like it's the one that James is talking about with the yolk is that's called a TYB, a test"
00:47:57,00:48:02,"yolk buffer and it's basically the same, it's the same principles of when a person is ovulating,"
00:48:02,00:48:03,they obviously have to feed.
00:48:03,00:48:09,It helps the sperm to get fed as it's trying to fertilize and this is the exact same principle.
00:48:09,00:48:14,So it's like chicken egg yolk or a type of chicken egg yolk that is just feeding it as
00:48:14,00:48:15,it's in the mail.
00:48:15,00:48:16,It's really clever.
00:48:16,00:48:17,It's really interesting.
00:48:17,00:48:23,"This whole situation with sperm donors in the pandemic, because the supply has not been"
00:48:23,00:48:24,as great as the demand.
00:48:24,00:48:28,The demand has been huge because a lot of people as they've been sitting at home think
00:48:28,00:48:31,actually I maybe I do want a kid and maybe they haven't been able to do it and so they
00:48:31,00:48:37,"need the donations, but they haven't been able to get enough into the actual sperm banks"
00:48:37,00:48:38,to distribute them.
00:48:38,00:48:44,So there's been this whole kind of black market that is a black market that exists on Facebook
00:48:44,00:48:46,pages for example.
00:48:46,00:48:50,"And there were these, what are kind of known as these kind of like mega sperm donors, these"
00:48:50,00:48:57,"specific men in the US who famously have fathered, you know, hundreds of kids, they've been flying"
00:48:57,00:49:03,all over the country since the lockdown has stopped and been sort of like handing over
00:49:03,00:49:04,their sperm basically.
00:49:04,00:49:08,"Also, these guys are kind of like, they used to have, before there was artificial insemination,"
00:49:08,00:49:13,they had what's called the bore truck and it was just a bore with good genes that would
00:49:13,00:49:16,travel from farm to farm and inseminate the sounds.
00:49:16,00:49:17,Wow.
00:49:17,00:49:18,Exactly that.
00:49:18,00:49:19,The bore truck.
00:49:19,00:49:22,"And it's what, the most interesting thing about it is you know who the donor is, which"
00:49:22,00:49:25,apparently has been a big thing for a long time.
00:49:25,00:49:29,"You have a lot of people going, I wish I could know the name and the genetics of the family"
00:49:29,00:49:32,that I'll be inheriting through the father's sperm.
00:49:32,00:49:33,And this is the quick way of doing it.
00:49:33,00:49:35,You don't have to wait till a child is 18.
00:49:35,00:49:36,You suddenly can do it.
00:49:36,00:49:37,Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:38,Remember there's a story about the guy.
00:49:38,00:49:44,"Like a genius sperm bank, you know, supposedly all these well-bred Ivy League school types"
00:49:44,00:49:49,"would come in and donate sperm and there was a waiting list and it turned out in the end,"
00:49:49,00:49:51,it's just the guys started the company.
00:49:51,00:49:53,It's just all his sperm.
00:49:53,00:49:55,No way.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Just one guy.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Yeah.
00:49:57,00:49:58,A lot of it was one guy.
00:49:58,00:49:59,Yeah.
00:49:59,00:50:00,They charged him a lot of money.
00:50:00,00:50:01,It was quite a scam.
00:50:01,00:50:02,Yeah.
00:50:02,00:50:03,Gosh.
00:50:03,00:50:05,"I think he found it hard to get Nobel Prize winners to donate, didn't he?"
00:50:05,00:50:10,And also a lot of them are in their 60s and 70s and 80s and perhaps aren't giving the
00:50:10,00:50:12,full cup full at that age.
00:50:12,00:50:14,"But also you want their dads, don't you?"
00:50:14,00:50:16,You want the dads of the Nobel Prize winners.
00:50:16,00:50:17,So...
00:50:17,00:50:18,"Oh, good point."
00:50:18,00:50:19,You want Mozart's dad.
00:50:19,00:50:20,You don't want Mozart.
00:50:20,00:50:21,This is...
00:50:21,00:50:24,A lot of this is the plot of a Roald Dahl novel.
00:50:24,00:50:28,Roald Dahl's readers novel and Roald Dahl's least family appropriate novel.
00:50:28,00:50:31,"James and the Giant Sperm, was it?"
00:50:31,00:50:33,Oh my gosh.
00:50:33,00:50:35,Charlie and the Sperm Factory.
00:50:35,00:50:38,George's Marvelous Medicine.
00:50:38,00:50:39,"No, it was..."
00:50:39,00:50:41,It's called My Uncle Oswald.
00:50:41,00:50:42,Oh.
00:50:42,00:50:44,And it is extremely rude.
00:50:44,00:50:46,It's hilarious and very...
00:50:46,00:50:51,It's absolutely scandalous and it was before he started becoming cuddly Uncle Roald.
00:50:51,00:50:55,Here's something that I didn't know about Sperm until I was researching this week.
00:50:55,00:51:01,"And that is post-ejaculatory modifications to Sperm, otherwise known as Pems."
00:51:01,00:51:06,"This is, in lots of animals, we're kind of just starting to learn about it so we don't"
00:51:06,00:51:07,know how common it is.
00:51:07,00:51:13,"But in lots of animals, a male sperm, once it gets into the female reproductive system,"
00:51:13,00:51:20,will change and will gain proteins and gain changes from the reproductive tract of the
00:51:20,00:51:21,female.
00:51:21,00:51:22,So it will actually completely change.
00:51:22,00:51:28,So there are some animals where the sperm will be a certain size and then once it gets
00:51:28,00:51:33,"into the female, she will add some kind of proteins or whatever and it will grow in size."
00:51:33,00:51:35,Some of them they will turn inside out.
00:51:35,00:51:39,The scientists who were writing about this were saying basically the problem is that
00:51:39,00:51:44,"all of our biology over the last 500 years, people have basically only looked at male"
00:51:44,00:51:45,subjects all the way through.
00:51:45,00:51:50,"And now that we're starting to look at more of the female reproductive system, we're starting"
00:51:50,00:51:52,to learn a whole load of stuff that we didn't know before.
00:51:52,00:51:53,That's crazy.
00:51:53,00:51:54,Isn't that amazing?
00:51:54,00:51:56,I've never heard of that.
00:51:56,00:51:57,That's insane.
00:51:57,00:52:02,It's like having a different outfit for when you're trying to get into a club versus an
00:52:02,00:52:06,outfit that you're comfortable dancing in.
00:52:06,00:52:07,We should wrap up shortly.
00:52:07,00:52:10,Do you guys have anything else before we go?
00:52:10,00:52:13,William Shatner got all of the horse semen in his recent divorce.
00:52:13,00:52:15,That's just a fact.
00:52:15,00:52:16,Wow.
00:52:16,00:52:17,Yeah.
00:52:17,00:52:18,There's not much more to say about that.
00:52:18,00:52:23,"Apart from he and his wife got divorced, they have horses and she's allowed to visit"
00:52:23,00:52:27,"the horses, but explicitly in the settlement, he gets all the sperm."
00:52:27,00:52:28,Okay.
00:52:28,00:52:29,So he gets the horses as well.
00:52:29,00:52:31,It's not like he just collects.
00:52:31,00:52:32,No.
00:52:32,00:52:36,He doesn't just go once every few months and collects it.
00:52:36,00:52:37,Wow.
00:52:37,00:52:38,No.
00:52:38,00:52:40,That's a kind of weird future custody element almost.
00:52:40,00:52:42,I don't know if it's custody.
00:52:42,00:52:44,They didn't say anything about the consistency.
00:52:44,00:52:50,What is he doing with it is the question.
00:52:50,00:52:52,"While making more horses, I think."
00:52:52,00:52:53,Making more horses.
00:52:53,00:52:54,Okay.
00:52:54,00:52:55,"Oh, he's got natural harvest."
00:52:55,00:52:56,Paul.
00:52:56,00:52:57,Paul.
00:52:57,00:52:58,Okay.
00:52:58,00:53:01,That is it.
