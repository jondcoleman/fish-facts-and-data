00:00:11,00:00:18,unedited so it's pretty long but yeah hope you enjoy it. We really enjoyed it so much in fact

00:00:58,00:01:03,"Welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you this week"
00:01:03,00:01:08,from the Aces & 8 bar in Tuppnell Park. This is our first ever live recording. My name is
00:01:08,00:01:13,"Dan Schroiber. Please welcome to the stage the three regular elves Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and"
00:01:13,00:01:24,James Horkin. Once again we have gathered around with our four favorite facts from the last seven
00:01:24,00:01:28,"days and in no particular order here we go. Fact number one and beginning with you,"
00:01:28,00:01:35,James. Okay my fact this week is that the first BBC radio presenter with a northern accent
00:01:35,00:01:39,was given the job to make it more difficult for the Nazis to impersonate news readers.
00:01:39,00:01:47,So why were the Nazis impersonating newsreaders? They thought that if they could pretend to be newsreaders
00:01:47,00:01:51,over the radio then people would believe anything they said and they'd be able to say oh we've
00:01:51,00:01:55,got such a strong army and people would just believe it. So they let raid the BBC? It was just
00:01:55,00:02:00,propaganda really. They would pretend to be BBC newsreaders. And so people wore horror and people
00:02:00,00:02:11,like that. But yeah. It's also why we've got James on the podcast. James a Nazi. No this was a guy
00:02:11,00:02:19,called Wilfrid Pickles. He was the first northern newsreader from 1941. He was from Yorkshire
00:02:19,00:02:24,and a lot of people didn't believe the news when he read it out because he had a northern accent.
00:02:24,00:02:29,Apparently. What did they think? They thought that's a Nazi trying to do a British accent.
00:02:29,00:02:37,No I don't know what they thought really. They just thought this guy's uneducated he
00:02:37,00:02:40,can't possibly know what the news is. That's what they I read this thing about in the early days
00:02:40,00:02:46,of news reporting particularly on radio that they never it was all male presenters and they said
00:02:46,00:02:50,that they wouldn't allow female presenters on because they didn't want them to have to go through
00:02:50,00:02:55,reading bad news like upsetting news stories. Yeah. They just thought they're not going to like that. That
00:02:55,00:03:00,would be too emotional. And it's true. It's a BBC thing where they announced that they said we're
00:03:00,00:03:05,not going to allow wind to do that. They'll be too upset when they hear this bad news. No. It's
00:03:05,00:03:11,terrible. They did have one in 1933 the first female newsreader. She was called Mrs. Giles Borrett.
00:03:11,00:03:15,I don't know what her real first name was. It doesn't seem to come up any more.
00:03:15,00:03:19,"Have you seen a picture of that? Mrs. Giles Borrett. Yeah, as he named after her husband. We were asked"
00:03:19,00:03:24,holes to women back in the day. We still are but like I mean doubly so. That's terrible.
00:03:24,00:03:28,There were complaints she was there for two months and the BBC took her off the air for technical
00:03:28,00:03:38,reasons. She's technically a gender is wrong. Did you know that all newsreaders were originally
00:03:38,00:03:43,anonymous? No. So they didn't give their names on air. It was just the voice of the BBC news.
00:03:43,00:03:47,And so we have the Nazis to thank the named newsreaders because during the war people said that they
00:03:47,00:03:52,should be able to listen and kind of authenticate who they were listening to. So the first one was
00:03:52,00:03:57,Frank Phillips and he said in July 1940 battle of Britain time this is Frank Phillips from the BBC
00:03:57,00:04:02,so that again you couldn't be impersonated. So today we might have Hugh Edwards just being a man
00:04:02,00:04:09,on a screen. Wow. That's kind of used to me. Yeah. Isn't that weird though that none of them
00:04:09,00:04:14,identified themselves? Do you guys know about the very first ever BBC news report on the radio?
00:04:14,00:04:19,No. Okay. It's great. It basically was on the 14th of November and I forgot to look up the date.
00:04:19,00:04:23,But it's on the 14th of November so we're coming up to the anniversary. Very exciting.
00:04:23,00:04:32,And basically he read out the news. It was a guy called Arthur Burrows and he read it out
00:04:32,00:04:38,but he read it twice once quickly and then once slowly and then asked the listeners which to do
00:04:38,00:04:43,proper. Just for future recordings to know which way they go. And the wish did they go with?
00:04:43,00:04:49,I think it's not been recorded. I don't know the answer. So we didn't know if now we have quick
00:04:49,00:04:54,news or slow news. I have no idea. I have no idea. Also it was really weird because when they started
00:04:54,00:04:59,doing the news they did it post 7pm and Lord Reath joined. So Lord Reath if you don't know his name
00:04:59,00:05:05,he's the guy who in the BBC they have a big kind of saying which is to entertain and form and
00:05:05,00:05:09,educate. That's the Lord Reath philosophy for BBC that everyone's tried to stick to. He joined
00:05:09,00:05:15,the week after the very first broadcast of a radio announcement telling the news on the BBC.
00:05:15,00:05:20,And he had this thing where he said we don't want anyone to be doing news bulletins before 6pm
00:05:20,00:05:25,because the newspapers will be hurt as a result of it. And so no one was allowed to do anything
00:05:25,00:05:31,in terms of announcing any news to the point that when they showed horse racing on the
00:05:31,00:05:38,news they couldn't have commentators commentating on the horse race so you listen to hooves
00:05:38,00:05:45,and people cheering at like 4pm and then at 7pm they go and blitzer one. They would wait till the
00:05:45,00:05:49,7 o'clock news. Was there a pause in between the end of the hoose? I think so. And blitzer one.
00:05:49,00:05:55,So you were speaking of radio though. Do you know what they did in 1955 when ITV started? I think
00:05:55,00:06:03,it was 1955 wasn't it? And what the BBC did to try and jeopardize ITV's chances? No.
00:06:03,00:06:07,It wasn't actually on TV because radio was the more popular medium at that time. They killed off
00:06:07,00:06:15,Grace Archer in the Archer's gas. 20 million people tuned in. The population of Britain was 40
00:06:15,00:06:20,million at the time. Half the country tuned in to listen to Grace get killed off from the Archer.
00:06:20,00:06:28,The Archer's fans really hate you don't they don't they? We make I so outside anyone who
00:06:28,00:06:33,listens to this podcast might know that we also the four of us work for QI and one of the QI
00:06:33,00:06:38,things is a radio show called Museum of Curiosity. And Museum of Curiosity is played at 630 every
00:06:38,00:06:43,evening on a Monday and Archer's follows immediately and we get the shit ripped out of us by the Archer's
00:06:43,00:06:48,fans they hate us and they just they don't even they just they say how much they hate us and then
00:06:48,00:06:56,they do hashtag the archers and so everyone they catch the last five minutes of Museum of Curiosity
00:06:56,00:07:00,and we're usually talking about pubic lies or something like that and this it doesn't come up on
00:07:00,00:07:03,the Archer's apparently. No it doesn't there was a great there was a fantastic one this week though
00:07:03,00:07:07,there was someone who actually tweeted what is this garbage I absolutely hate it hashtag the
00:07:07,00:07:11,Archer's someone wrote back going I know this program sucks they should cancel it the Archer's is
00:07:11,00:07:20,terrible lovely confusion I have a fact about Lord wreath John wreath as he was then when he applied
00:07:20,00:07:24,for the post of general manager of the British broadcasting company he did not know what broadcasting
00:07:24,00:07:31,was and he wrote in his diary that when he was called to an interview he quote still hadn't the
00:07:31,00:07:36,remotest idea as to what broadcasting was I hadn't trouble to find out and they gave him the job
00:07:38,00:07:45,and when so do you know where remote controls were for what was the main attraction of them
00:07:45,00:07:49,how they were marketed remote controls what for TV yeah is that I'm calling them you don't have to
00:07:49,00:07:54,get up and walk over to the thing presumably it is that but their main strategy in the marketing
00:07:54,00:07:59,was it was after ITV came about and Adverts came about and remote controls were just volume controls
00:07:59,00:08:02,and they looked like one of those rotary phones so they were like a a dial which you just dialed
00:08:02,00:08:08,up or down and it was they can meet the Adverts so Adverts came onto TV and immediately they marked
00:08:08,00:08:13,something that could make them shut there was one really early there was one really early remote
00:08:13,00:08:18,control that was done by light the problem with it was that when the sun shot on it it would turn
00:08:18,00:08:26,the channel over there's a great I was talking about this in the office a few days ago and I can't
00:08:26,00:08:31,verify this fact and I really want to really go anyone knows this show I'm known as the dubious one
00:08:31,00:08:37,on the show not just on the show just in life the way I do any research for this show is to put in the
00:08:37,00:08:42,fact and then put plus Yeti that's my kind of research of this show that's how bad I am at it but
00:08:42,00:08:47,I read a fact in a book years ago when I first moved to England and it was a fact that when they
00:08:47,00:08:51,doing when they did live TV dramas they would have a thing where obviously it was black and white
00:08:51,00:08:56,everything had to be done live as they were going along and the actors if they forgot their lines
00:08:56,00:09:00,as they were doing this play live they would mind speaking and then the other actor would mind
00:09:00,00:09:06,speaking back at them so that while the production we're quickly trying to find cards that could show
00:09:06,00:09:09,them what the next line was the people at home were going what the hell's wrong with the TV are
00:09:09,00:09:13,sounds gone again and get up and hit it and then by the time they remember the line they'd be like
00:09:13,00:09:17,we should go to the shops and then they're back into the play but I can't prove this as a fact so
00:09:17,00:09:23,if anyone listening or anyone in this room tonight knows it please let me know yeah don't wait
00:09:23,00:09:30,up for the post accents oh go on what no what was yours well I've got to max and go on yeah talk
00:09:30,00:09:35,about you know for an accent syndrome oh yeah what's that what's that the real thing so it's not
00:09:35,00:09:40,just mad people making it up you know when someone wakes up and you make that terrible
00:09:40,00:09:45,self-hyros accent yeah I would but yeah it's a real thing so it happens if you have a particularly
00:09:45,00:09:49,bad migraine you can get for an accent syndrome but it's not where you wake up with a specific
00:09:49,00:09:53,for an accent it's just where you wake up with an accent that sounds kind of like for an accent
00:09:53,00:09:57,so there's like an interview with this woman Julie Matthias who just had a migraine and now speaks in
00:09:57,00:10:04,this bizarre kind of Scandinavian Indian South African hybrid and I think it's really horrible
00:10:04,00:10:10,for her is it it must be tough right also cat breasts syndrome do you know that one it's where you
00:10:10,00:10:16,believe that one of your loved ones has actually been has died and been replaced by a robot or
00:10:16,00:10:24,something like that once the real yeah yeah yeah what like we all had it like that time when my dad
00:10:24,00:10:29,died and was replaced by a robot yeah but that actually happened yeah but for people with a
00:10:29,00:10:35,syndrome yeah yeah but if you google this and look for examples of it happening there's like one
00:10:35,00:10:40,pretty much one or two examples on the BBC news and the most famous person to have it done it was
00:10:40,00:10:46,called Alan Davis really yeah and I always wanted to run that on cue I but thought no not really
00:10:46,00:10:52,it's just in case it's actually him yeah all right come if you're mocking me on cue I do you
00:10:52,00:10:58,want to hear something cool about the Queen's accent yeah so they've done a study on her but without
00:10:58,00:11:04,and okay they've they've listened to the Queen's speech from three from different decades so they
00:11:04,00:11:08,listened to loads from the 1950s and then they listened to loads from the 1980s and they found
00:11:08,00:11:13,that she no longer speaks the Queen's English so they measured loads of her sounds surely by
00:11:13,00:11:18,definition what she says is a good thing that's true but they it was a study at Macquarie University
00:11:18,00:11:23,on Australia and they said that her accent has drifted a bit so she sounds a bit like some younger
00:11:23,00:11:28,and I'm using their words she sounds Jamaican now she sounds Jamaican they said she has
00:11:28,00:11:33,Cockney influences now apparently yeah I mean you can't tell apparently most of the changes it
00:11:33,00:11:41,was 12 or 13 vowel sounds she says you get me yeah why can't we tell if she has it
00:11:41,00:11:50,where machines can hear it apparently computers can hear machines yes my dad my dad but they
00:11:50,00:11:54,they they were so happy to study her because and these are the words she hasn't lived and lived
00:11:54,00:12:01,in different communities that might alter her accent yeah no kidding so you reckon she got
00:12:01,00:12:06,it off TV or something I don't know maybe yeah she is a fact she's a huge fan of I think
00:12:06,00:12:10,the other things of the archers yeah it's a miracle museum is still going you should say
00:12:10,00:12:16,your tweets to me the terrible and she didn't do a speech in 1969 there was no Queen's speech
00:12:16,00:12:23,on TV and the reason was she had already done one interview that year in the summer for a documentary
00:12:23,00:12:28,and it changed her accent so much she couldn't bear does she just said that's enough you get one
00:12:28,00:12:34,dose a queen a year and that was it for 1969 so she didn't know that's great and we used to speak
00:12:34,00:12:38,rotec English didn't we which is how the American speak English show the way American speak is the
00:12:38,00:12:44,way that is proper English is the English that we were speaking in the 17th century yeah we didn't
00:12:44,00:12:48,pronounce our arse and that's wrong and that's because spelling hasn't kept up with the way we speak
00:12:48,00:12:52,what do you mean don't pronounce her like oh god I'm not going to be able to think of any
00:12:52,00:12:57,examples now so you know if we said I've just got the word Somerset written down here so if we say
00:12:57,00:13:01,Somerset they'd say Somerset or that she just sounds like a Somerset
00:13:01,00:13:10,to sound like 40 say Somerset Dan you've got a Somerset yeah exactly like cover and garden
00:13:10,00:13:17,cover what there's no or in cover but he's he's got it wrong this is the biggest content should say
00:13:17,00:13:22,I have a messed up accent I know I have a messed up accent the main tweet outside of archers hatred
00:13:22,00:13:27,towards me that I get is people listening to our show saying why are you saying
00:13:27,00:13:32,cover and garden like I get so much what about the what about the child who listens to the podcast oh
00:13:32,00:13:37,there's a child who listens to our podcast they're three four years old yeah three four years old the
00:13:37,00:13:43,godmother wrote into us to say that James every time uh you're you talk my my my my little goddaughter
00:13:43,00:13:48,she smiles and she's how happy how nice yeah and then when Dan comes on she frowns and looks
00:13:48,00:13:57,disappointed in Southwest really splitting accent well okay let's go back to the point in hand
00:13:57,00:14:01,yeah I want to speak about Wilfred Pickles so this was the guy with a northern accent who read the
00:14:01,00:14:07,news uh he also was the host of the first British quiz show to give away prizes it was called
00:14:07,00:14:14,Hava Go and the jackpot was three pounds wow let's see what was more than I suppose but still
00:14:14,00:14:24,yeah it's not who wants to be a million who wants to own three pounds but they got an audience of
00:14:24,00:14:33,26 million yeah if you think about what uh break off got what 13 million this was uh up to 1967 he
00:14:33,00:14:37,did it yeah a lot more people used to watch yeah but they didn't make up they didn't have beg off back
00:14:37,00:14:42,then so you know what was what was the what was the fact that you told me in the office the other day
00:14:42,00:14:48,about um like a tire and stuff when they when they were recording uh in radio early radio about
00:14:48,00:14:56,what they have to wear I do remember yes in the 30s the British news readers had to wear
00:14:56,00:15:00,dennesuit even though you couldn't see them when they were reading the news on the radio I really
00:15:00,00:15:03,like that you can tell though you can tell with the voice when they're sitting up properly it won't
00:15:03,00:15:10,be slouching like that is that why was that they're just yeah I think it gives you a better you know
00:15:10,00:15:14,posture a better accent just you know they're just being being annoying about it sure yeah
00:15:14,00:15:18,for anyone listening we're all wearing dinner jackets now
00:15:18,00:15:24,um some animals have accents don't they but not all what I'm trying to just think which
00:15:24,00:15:29,which animal's doing which don't so so people tend to think that like hardly animal
00:15:29,00:15:33,hardly any animals have accents like animals it's in their dreams the way the way they speak but
00:15:33,00:15:38,then farmers in the north of England reported that I think it was that I think this might have been
00:15:38,00:15:42,where I just read Somerset it was a Somerset farmer who said that his cows had a different accent to
00:15:42,00:15:48,the farmers in surrounding counties oh they do they move in accents that want to that want
00:15:48,00:15:55,an ignoble price didn't it yeah cows move in regional access yeah a very appeared review scientific
00:15:55,00:15:59,paper that um and yeah and babies as well babies have regional access they move in different
00:15:59,00:16:05,uh no babies go French and German babies have different ways of saying
00:16:07,00:16:14,neither of them sound like that German ones go and I'm paraphrasing and French babies go
00:16:14,00:16:19,okay there is a difference a machines can hear it my dad if he was
00:16:19,00:16:26,we should we should wrap up on our first facts we got anything else anyone want to add anything
00:16:26,00:16:31,uh apparently the announcers on the BBC if they would cough during a broadcast they would be
00:16:31,00:16:36,inundated with cough cough lozenges and wallen underwear because everyone was scared that they had a
00:16:36,00:16:42,call so guys whenever you want to start throwing oh that's really good okay um oh yeah yeah go
00:16:42,00:16:46,for just go to the case we don't come back onto the subject of radio for loads of podcasts um when
00:16:46,00:16:53,woman's up again in 1946 it was hosted by a man early early items on the show included
00:16:53,00:16:59,cooking with whale meat I married a lion tamer and how to hang your husband's suit
00:17:01,00:17:11,true great and fact okay um time for fact number two uh and that is my fact and my fact this week
00:17:11,00:17:16,is that in china if you want to empty a building of people a building full of people if you want
00:17:16,00:17:28,to empty it you play this song don't get up and leave it here there's it doesn't work apparently
00:17:28,00:17:39,so this is a song does anyone know what that is no one okay you can even guess the artist
00:17:40,00:17:47,yes five points yeah now i've this is a weird thing no one in this country in the uk seems to know
00:17:47,00:17:54,who kene g is kene g is one of the biggest artists in the world and in my heart uh he's sold 75
00:17:54,00:18:01,million albums uh worldwide he uh played at the inauguration of bill clinton he worked on the body
00:18:01,00:18:05,guard soundtrack if you watch the Grammys in the 90s and variably at some point Michael Bolton would
00:18:05,00:18:11,rock on stage next to kene g and they would own it uh and the interesting thing is that since the year
00:18:11,00:18:16,2000 in 1989 this song came out and it got really big it's called going home by kene g
00:18:16,00:18:21,and for some reason it got adopted and no one really knows why in china as the going home song
00:18:21,00:18:27,so at the end of the day i think because it's called going home yeah why did they choose it
00:18:29,00:18:38,why didn't they choose melody and be wake me up before you go go what so they basically it's a tune
00:18:38,00:18:43,that just gets played everywhere at schools at the end of school they play it to kids to go home
00:18:43,00:18:49,if you're on a train that's entering the final stop of its destination the terminal uh they play that
00:18:49,00:18:53,song everywhere in china in a marketplace they'll play it on loop for an hour and a half to tell
00:18:53,00:18:58,you to get out and kene g people are really getting the hint if you have to play it for an hour and a
00:18:58,00:19:03,half at the end of a party presumably you play that when you want every well when because as a result
00:19:03,00:19:07,this song he doesn't get any royalties from it but he plays a lot of gigs in china now he had to
00:19:07,00:19:11,make sure that he put that song at the end otherwise people still playing during the gig but this
00:19:11,00:19:16,is this is an insane thing if he did get royalties though he will be richer than bill gays if they
00:19:16,00:19:20,play it for an hour and a half at every day at the closing of a month not only that when tv used to
00:19:20,00:19:26,end at say like 12 a.m. or 11 p.m. whenever it is in china up until six a.m. when it came back on it
00:19:26,00:19:32,would be on loop that was the song that played kene g is massive in china i i i have i read a few
00:19:32,00:19:39,accounts from chinese people saying i'm pretty sick of this song that i liked it the first time i
00:19:39,00:19:45,heard it and now i really don't so i think so i had an heard of kene g oh no i had heard of him i
00:19:45,00:19:48,didn't know what he was but i think that's us being musically illiterate i think everyone else in
00:19:48,00:19:50,"and Britain, I think you're touring British people"
00:19:50,00:19:52,with our brush by saying no one's heard of Kenny G.
00:19:52,00:19:54,"- No, no, no one in this room except one person, right?"
00:19:54,00:19:56,"- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:19:56,00:19:58,"- Okay, so well done. - So the only thing, so I was like,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"I'd haven't heard of this guy,"
00:19:59,00:20:00,"I don't really listen to music,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,it was made in the last 40 years.
00:20:02,00:20:05,"So I just decided, I'll look up something about music."
00:20:05,00:20:07,I know he's kind of jazz.
00:20:07,00:20:09,Let's look up a circular breathing.
00:20:09,00:20:13,The longest musical note ever held lasted 45 minutes
00:20:13,00:20:16,"and 47 seconds, and the record was set by Kenny G."
00:20:16,00:20:20,- Yeah. - This guy is phenomenal about him.
00:20:20,00:20:22,"- Yeah. - Well, I like playing golf"
00:20:22,00:20:25,and I looked up who's the best musician who plays golf
00:20:25,00:20:27,and it's Kenny G. (laughing)
00:20:27,00:20:30,- He's everywhere. - He's off plus 0.8.
00:20:30,00:20:32,"- And many years ago, Kenny G woke up one morning"
00:20:32,00:20:36,"when his uncle said, ""I have a business."
00:20:36,00:20:38,My friend is running and I think you might be interested.
00:20:38,00:20:40,You should buy some stocks into it.
00:20:40,00:20:42,"They make coffee and he went, ""I'll buy some stocks."""
00:20:42,00:20:46,And he now has made almost as much money off the back
00:20:46,00:20:48,of the fact that he put stocks into Starbucks
00:20:48,00:20:51,"before it launched, as much as he's made"
00:20:51,00:20:52,from his 75 million albums.
00:20:52,00:20:54,- So should we boycott him now?
00:20:54,00:20:57,(laughing)
00:20:57,00:20:58,- I have been doing an unconscious boycott
00:20:58,00:21:01,"of him all my life, but I don't know who he was."
00:21:01,00:21:03,(laughing)
00:21:03,00:21:05,"- No, I didn't know who Kenny G was either"
00:21:05,00:21:09,"and I Googled Kenny G is and the first to our,"
00:21:09,00:21:11,Kenny G is my imaginary friend.
00:21:11,00:21:13,(laughing)
00:21:13,00:21:16,And Kenny G is Katie Perry's uncle
00:21:16,00:21:18,and I looked it up and he isn't.
00:21:18,00:21:19,(laughing)
00:21:19,00:21:22,I have no idea what that's about at all.
00:21:22,00:21:23,And then I spent the rest of the afternoon
00:21:23,00:21:25,Googling Katie Perry's uncle
00:21:25,00:21:27,who is even less interesting than Kenny G.
00:21:27,00:21:29,(laughing)
00:21:29,00:21:30,- What's he do?
00:21:30,00:21:31,Who is he?
00:21:31,00:21:32,- He's a director of movies.
00:21:32,00:21:33,He's dead now.
00:21:33,00:21:34,"- Oh, okay."
00:21:34,00:21:37,"- Oh, a bit of a downer."
00:21:37,00:21:39,- You didn't even know him.
00:21:39,00:21:40,"- And in fairness, guys, he was a robot."
00:21:40,00:21:43,(laughing)
00:21:43,00:21:46,"- Circular breathing, there was a thing in Greece"
00:21:46,00:21:49,called the Disfigurement of Athens
00:21:49,00:21:51,and it's written about by some Greek crisis
00:21:51,00:21:54,and apparently that was a weird facial disfigurement
00:21:54,00:21:56,you would get if you did too much circular breathing.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"- I really, what's that like?"
00:21:58,00:21:58,- I don't know.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- I don't really know how you do it.
00:22:00,00:22:02,"- No, how you do circular breathing?"
00:22:02,00:22:03,"- No, I read about how to do it the other day"
00:22:03,00:22:06,"and I still, I can't do it."
00:22:06,00:22:08,- You save a little bit of air in your mouth
00:22:08,00:22:10,and then you breathe through your nose.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"- Does it help people beat box, is that it's beat box?"
00:22:12,00:22:14,- And it's to help you sustain notes.
00:22:14,00:22:15,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- So jazz, he's jazz, right?"
00:22:16,00:22:17,That's what he does.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Otherwise, I've been reading mother rums."
00:22:19,00:22:20,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:20,00:22:22,- Let's say he's jazz anyway.
00:22:22,00:22:23,- I see he plays his saxophone.
00:22:23,00:22:24,"Does he go, let's be round for president?"
00:22:24,00:22:25,Did you know that?
00:22:25,00:22:26,- What?
00:22:26,00:22:27,- Of America.
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Of America.
00:22:28,00:22:31,"In 1964, he ran a joke campaign for president."
00:22:31,00:22:32,"He promised to rename the White House,"
00:22:32,00:22:34,"the Blues House, and a point."
00:22:34,00:22:35,(laughing)
00:22:35,00:22:37,- And he was going to appoint Duke Ellington
00:22:37,00:22:39,as his secretary of state and Miles Davis
00:22:39,00:22:40,as head of the CIA.
00:22:40,00:22:41,- Which would have been--
00:22:41,00:22:42,- Miles Davis.
00:22:42,00:22:43,- Who are you from?
00:22:43,00:22:43,(laughing)
00:22:43,00:22:48,"- He also, does he, Lesby, couldn't hit since 1949,"
00:22:48,00:22:51,he was unable to hit the B-flat above high sea on his trumpet
00:22:51,00:22:54,"'cause he had a very, very minor bicycling accident."
00:22:54,00:22:57,"But he got $1,000, which I think was quite a lot in 1949."
00:22:57,00:22:58,- Sure.
00:22:58,00:23:01,- And compensation for it because it's damaged his art.
00:23:01,00:23:02,I could never hit that high B-flat.
00:23:02,00:23:04,- Yeah.
00:23:04,00:23:06,"Wait, a minor cycling accident."
00:23:06,00:23:07,"- Just a twisted ankle, yeah."
00:23:07,00:23:09,- He stopped him from being able to hit a high--
00:23:09,00:23:10,- Weird.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"- Yeah, maybe it was winded or something."
00:23:12,00:23:15,- You can sue for damaging your art.
00:23:15,00:23:16,- You'll want your art.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"- Down, I don't think he's got a case."
00:23:17,00:23:20,(laughing)
00:23:20,00:23:24,- Just checking.
00:23:24,00:23:27,- Another influential jazz person.
00:23:27,00:23:30,Most influential guitarist of all time.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- Jimmy Hendrix.
00:23:31,00:23:33,- I was gonna go with Django Reinhart.
00:23:33,00:23:35,Maybe it wasn't like jazz guitar.
00:23:35,00:23:37,"- Was missing the two main guitar playing fingers,"
00:23:37,00:23:38,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:23:38,00:23:40,- So it only ever did solos on two fingers.
00:23:40,00:23:42,- Didn't he die because he refused to go to a doctor?
00:23:42,00:23:44,"- Yes, I think he did."
00:23:44,00:23:45,"- Yeah, he had a minor medical condition."
00:23:45,00:23:48,He didn't go to a doctor and then it got bad and then he died.
00:23:48,00:23:50,Does anyone know what Knitt will remember what he had?
00:23:50,00:23:51,"- I don't remember, no."
00:23:51,00:23:54,"- Just speaking of Django, this is a very weird link,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,but it's something I was when I was looking into
00:23:56,00:23:57,all the stuff about Michael Bolt.
00:23:57,00:23:59,"I'm sorry, Kenny G being massive in China."
00:23:59,00:24:01,It is curious when you find out about people
00:24:01,00:24:04,"who are big in other countries,"
00:24:04,00:24:07,who aren't sort of as like Norman Wisdom being massive
00:24:07,00:24:09,in Albania.
00:24:09,00:24:11,Norman Wisdom is huge still to this day in Albania.
00:24:11,00:24:13,"When he died, it was almost a national holiday"
00:24:13,00:24:14,"and they just, and they have."
00:24:14,00:24:15,- That's the holiday.
00:24:15,00:24:16,(laughing)
00:24:16,00:24:19,"- So, that's the day of my life, thank you again."
00:24:19,00:24:23,"- Good boy, finally, that hated Wisdom is removed."
00:24:23,00:24:25,(laughing)
00:24:25,00:24:28,"- When Kenny G dies, a lot of Chinese society"
00:24:28,00:24:31,will celebrate not having to listen to this song anymore.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"- That's true, that's true."
00:24:32,00:24:33,"Oh, come on."
00:24:34,00:24:36,- There's a lot of Kenny G lovely in the room.
00:24:36,00:24:39,"- Yeah, it's a lot of people more famous in other countries."
00:24:39,00:24:41,"- Yeah, yeah, so I was reading about people who are more famous."
00:24:41,00:24:44,"The list of Americans, or just a people foreign people"
00:24:44,00:24:46,to China being big there.
00:24:46,00:24:47,"It's quite, it's quite interesting."
00:24:47,00:24:50,"The most famous person in China is Kobe Bryant,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,"who's a basketball player, which I did not expect."
00:24:52,00:24:54,- The most famous person in all of China.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"- Well, my theory is that it's actually Mr. Bean,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"which, and then, in at number three,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,Mao Zedong.
00:25:00,00:25:03,(laughing)
00:25:03,00:25:09,"- Yeah, it's a phrase that done."
00:25:09,00:25:10,"- Oh, it's the most famous foreigner."
00:25:10,00:25:11,- Okay.
00:25:11,00:25:12,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:25:12,00:25:13,- It's not fun.
00:25:13,00:25:18,- So these people are getting bigger and bigger.
00:25:18,00:25:21,"And as a result, there's a really interesting thing going on"
00:25:21,00:25:22,"with the movie world at the moment,"
00:25:22,00:25:24,which is that the Chinese movie world
00:25:24,00:25:25,has now overtaken Bollywood.
00:25:25,00:25:27,It's taken over everything except America.
00:25:27,00:25:29,They're the second largest movie makers in the world.
00:25:29,00:25:32,"And so as a result of these people's names getting quite big,"
00:25:32,00:25:35,they're getting put into movies now and being sold to China.
00:25:35,00:25:37,"And as a result, so the top film in China last year"
00:25:37,00:25:40,"was Transformers, above anything in the world, right?"
00:25:40,00:25:41,They absolutely loved it.
00:25:41,00:25:43,The latest Transformers movie that came out.
00:25:43,00:25:45,But they do this really interesting thing
00:25:45,00:25:48,where they have to edit out certain bits of the movie
00:25:48,00:25:50,as it exists because it turns out there's a lot
00:25:50,00:25:52,of anti-Chinese government stuff in movies
00:25:52,00:25:53,that we don't realize.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"So when movies go out, suddenly there's a missing five minutes"
00:25:56,00:25:58,where a character has been taken out
00:25:58,00:26:00,and it suddenly just doesn't make sense.
00:26:00,00:26:03,"Cloud Atlas, they took out 43 minutes of the movie"
00:26:03,00:26:04,when they took to China.
00:26:04,00:26:07,That you can argue that it could miss 43 minutes.
00:26:07,00:26:07,Couldn't do that.
00:26:07,00:26:08,I haven't seen it.
00:26:08,00:26:10,I haven't seen it.
00:26:10,00:26:12,"When the sound of music came out in South Korea,"
00:26:12,00:26:13,"it was really, really popular."
00:26:13,00:26:16,And like Cinemas were playing it four or five times a day.
00:26:16,00:26:18,And one cinema owner wanted to work out a way
00:26:18,00:26:20,that he could play it more times a day
00:26:20,00:26:22,to get more customers in.
00:26:22,00:26:23,So he edited out all the songs.
00:26:23,00:26:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:25,00:26:26,Amazing.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"That's like, if anyone heard an episode"
00:26:28,00:26:30,"that we did, I think it was last week of the week before,"
00:26:30,00:26:34,"Chuck Norris, when he plays his movies to his kids,"
00:26:34,00:26:36,doesn't like the idea of his kids seeing the fight scenes
00:26:36,00:26:37,and the Chuck Norris movies.
00:26:37,00:26:40,So he personally edits out all the fight scenes
00:26:40,00:26:42,from his movies and his kids just watch it.
00:26:42,00:26:45,And I cannot think of a worse experience than watching
00:26:45,00:26:45,a fight with--
00:26:45,00:26:47,Sound of music without any songs.
00:26:47,00:26:48,Yeah.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"It's just called ""of."""
00:26:49,00:26:50,I can.
00:26:50,00:26:52,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:52,00:26:58,People must have loved Cinemas so confused.
00:26:58,00:27:01,What was with the title of it?
00:27:01,00:27:04,"Just to qualify, when I said Django, the reason I said that"
00:27:04,00:27:07,"is Django Unchained, the Quentin Tarantino movie,"
00:27:07,00:27:10,went into China and was pulled minutes from all of the cinemas
00:27:10,00:27:11,"when it started, because I had a nude scene."
00:27:11,00:27:14,And they don't allow nudity in movies now.
00:27:14,00:27:16,That's not anti-China propaganda to be fair to Django.
00:27:16,00:27:18,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:27:18,00:27:21,"No, it's just they have strict law still with Serious."
00:27:21,00:27:24,The other thing is that China is the biggest
00:27:24,00:27:25,"as in the amount of money they take,"
00:27:25,00:27:28,"not the number of movies they make, I think."
00:27:28,00:27:30,"Yeah, because it's the side of the world, yeah."
00:27:30,00:27:32,Which is not the only way.
00:27:32,00:27:33,"Yeah, they do this thing as well now."
00:27:33,00:27:36,"So you know, when we watch a James Bond movie, how they take out--"
00:27:36,00:27:39,"you just see Richard Branson suddenly, and it's obviously"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"a virgin ad, or it's just product placement the whole way"
00:27:41,00:27:42,through.
00:27:42,00:27:45,They re-shoot scenes with Chinese product placement.
00:27:45,00:27:46,So which movie was it here?
00:27:46,00:27:51,"It was ""During World Wars"" Z. Oh, great movie."
00:27:51,00:27:51,Great film.
00:27:51,00:27:53,Great movie.
00:27:53,00:27:54,It is a great film.
00:27:54,00:27:55,"What's it, World Wars?"
00:27:55,00:27:58,You like Pacific Rim as your greatest ever.
00:27:58,00:27:58,I love the Pacific Rim.
00:27:58,00:28:00,Come on.
00:28:00,00:28:01,Thank you.
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Oh, my goodness."
00:28:02,00:28:03,"Yeah, it goes forever."
00:28:03,00:28:04,All right.
00:28:04,00:28:07,"I saw an edited version of ""Wobble Z,"""
00:28:07,00:28:09,"because I was on a plane watching it,"
00:28:09,00:28:11,"because that's when you should watch ""Wobble Z."""
00:28:11,00:28:15,And they edited out the bit with the enormous plane zombie
00:28:15,00:28:18,"scene, which ends with the plane crashing."
00:28:18,00:28:18,Really?
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Yeah, weird, right?"
00:28:20,00:28:21,We censors.
00:28:21,00:28:24,Let us watch the scene.
00:28:24,00:28:25,That's fair.
00:28:25,00:28:26,We should move on.
00:28:26,00:28:27,We don't quite want to start.
00:28:27,00:28:28,"Oh, I just want to say one more thing."
00:28:28,00:28:32,"So this, Kenny G's real name is."
00:28:32,00:28:33,Kenneth Gorelic.
00:28:33,00:28:35,Kenneth Gorelic.
00:28:35,00:28:37,And I thought I'd check and see if I had anything on him
00:28:37,00:28:39,in my files on my computer.
00:28:39,00:28:40,And I didn't have anything on him.
00:28:40,00:28:43,But I did have something on another Kenneth Gorelic.
00:28:43,00:28:44,And this is--
00:28:44,00:28:46,That is weird.
00:28:46,00:28:47,Go into the basement.
00:28:47,00:28:49,"Kenneth J. Gorelic, this is."
00:28:49,00:28:52,"He's a medic, and he wrote a paper called"
00:28:52,00:28:55,"""A four letter word in the medical literature."""
00:28:55,00:28:56,And he went through all medical literature looking
00:28:56,00:28:59,"for instances of the word ""fuck."""
00:28:59,00:29:00,OK?
00:29:00,00:29:04,He found 17 instances since the 1960s.
00:29:04,00:29:06,"Four were about a fungus called ""fuck."""
00:29:06,00:29:09,Two were sexual.
00:29:09,00:29:11,And six were the author.
00:29:11,00:29:13,OK?
00:29:13,00:29:14,What do you mean?
00:29:14,00:29:15,As in the name of the author?
00:29:15,00:29:15,"Oh, right, sorry."
00:29:15,00:29:18,"So here, the most prolific single contributor"
00:29:18,00:29:22,"was Dr. E. Fuck, whose four German language publications"
00:29:22,00:29:27,on the Malik acid metabolism of saccharolytices constitute
00:29:27,00:29:29,a major contribution to the field.
00:29:29,00:29:32,This may be about to change with the emergence
00:29:32,00:29:37,of Dr. L. Fuck as a co-author of a publication in 1999.
00:29:37,00:29:39,So look out for those new fucks.
00:29:39,00:29:45,"OK, let's move on to fact number three,"
00:29:45,00:29:47,and that is Chazinski.
00:29:47,00:29:49,"Uh, yeah, it is."
00:29:49,00:29:55,My fact is that the two leading paleontologists
00:29:55,00:29:58,in the 19th century used to destroy their fossil sites
00:29:58,00:30:01,after excavating them so that their rival
00:30:01,00:30:03,wasn't able to find anything on them.
00:30:03,00:30:04,That's insane.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"And so, and these really were the two"
00:30:06,00:30:08,"by far and away, the leading paleontologist."
00:30:08,00:30:11,"So they were Edward Drinker, Cope, and Othnial, Charles, Marsh."
00:30:11,00:30:12,Othnial.
00:30:12,00:30:12,Othnial?
00:30:12,00:30:14,"Yep, that's right, that's his name."
00:30:14,00:30:15,Got a problem with that?
00:30:15,00:30:16,No.
00:30:16,00:30:18,"No, ma'am."
00:30:18,00:30:20,It's just a brilliant name.
00:30:20,00:30:20,"It's good, yeah."
00:30:20,00:30:22,"So before they came along, there were nine species"
00:30:22,00:30:24,of dinosaur had been discovered and named.
00:30:24,00:30:27,"And between the two of them, by the time they both died,"
00:30:27,00:30:29,"they'd named 136 species between them,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"including all the ones you've heard of,"
00:30:31,00:30:33,"all the big ones, stegosaurus, diplodocus, triceratops,"
00:30:33,00:30:34,all those guys.
00:30:34,00:30:36,And they kind of liked each other at first.
00:30:36,00:30:39,"So they met in 1867, and they named species"
00:30:39,00:30:39,after one another.
00:30:39,00:30:43,So a giant serpent from New Jersey
00:30:43,00:30:47,was called Mossosaurus Copianus after Cope and vice versa.
00:30:47,00:30:49,"Yeah, but I'm not sure that was because he liked him,"
00:30:49,00:30:52,because it's actually his copianus.
00:30:52,00:30:53,"Copianus, isn't it?"
00:30:53,00:30:54,That's what it is.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"Yeah, so I think that might have been an insult."
00:30:56,00:30:57,No.
00:30:57,00:30:58,For only you've been there to tell him.
00:30:58,00:31:00,He thought he were best friends.
00:31:00,00:31:02,I think this is why he was so upset.
00:31:02,00:31:04,"And Dick had a Soros, what is that?"
00:31:04,00:31:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:07,00:31:10,"So, relationship went sour when Cope showed off"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"this fossil of an elasmosaurus, and a big, like,"
00:31:12,00:31:13,showing a new fossil.
00:31:13,00:31:15,Classic faux pas.
00:31:15,00:31:17,Yeah.
00:31:17,00:31:19,Not at the end yet.
00:31:19,00:31:21,Did that put the head on the wrong end of it?
00:31:21,00:31:24,"And Marsh said, I think you put the head on the tail."
00:31:24,00:31:26,"And Cope was like, no, haven't, you're wrong."
00:31:26,00:31:29,"And they called in the museum curator, the academy curator,"
00:31:29,00:31:31,"who said, yeah, you put the head on the wrong end."
00:31:31,00:31:33,"And he was so humiliated by that, that Marsh wrote,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,"that after that, he's been my bitter enemy."
00:31:36,00:31:37,And it was so extreme.
00:31:37,00:31:40,They spent 25 years stealing each other's fossils.
00:31:40,00:31:43,They both employed teams of sort of spies to go
00:31:43,00:31:44,and jeopardize each other's sight.
00:31:44,00:31:47,So they'd steal and break each other's fossils.
00:31:47,00:31:48,"One of them, Marsh, got into government"
00:31:48,00:31:52,so that he could withdraw funding from the other guy.
00:31:52,00:31:54,"It comes in exchange of letters, where one would say,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,some of my fossils are damaged and have disappeared.
00:31:56,00:31:57,I know you're responsible.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"And the other one would write back going,"
00:31:59,00:32:00,it's outrageous that you'd accuse me of that.
00:32:00,00:32:02,"But since you mentioned it, some of my fossils"
00:32:02,00:32:06,"were gone and I thought, at least just 25 years of this."
00:32:06,00:32:06,Wow.
00:32:06,00:32:07,It was called the Bone Wars.
00:32:07,00:32:08,The Bone Wars.
00:32:08,00:32:11,How would they destroy each other's sort of--
00:32:11,00:32:14,"Well, Dynamite was how Marsh did it."
00:32:14,00:32:14,Dynamite.
00:32:14,00:32:15,Yeah.
00:32:15,00:32:18,"So they would find their bit and then go,"
00:32:18,00:32:19,there may be lots more here.
00:32:19,00:32:20,But I'm just going to--
00:32:20,00:32:21,"Yeah, just in case there is."
00:32:21,00:32:23,"Or I think if they couldn't carry stuff back,"
00:32:23,00:32:25,or if they'd found the thing they needed to find.
00:32:25,00:32:28,"They couldn't carry stuff back, yeah."
00:32:28,00:32:32,"Well, that's all I can say about that."
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Well, maybe they thought they would"
00:32:33,00:32:37,propel it back with the dynamite.
00:32:37,00:32:39,"I read that, on one occasion, there"
00:32:39,00:32:40,"are two teams of researchers, even"
00:32:40,00:32:43,had a stone throwing battle against each other.
00:32:43,00:32:44,They stayed from--
00:32:44,00:32:45,Yeah.
00:32:45,00:32:46,They hated each other.
00:32:46,00:32:48,They were throwing fossils at each other.
00:32:48,00:32:48,Yeah?
00:32:48,00:32:50,"No, I think they're still just--"
00:32:50,00:32:51,Yeah.
00:32:51,00:32:53,And it was quite-- even though they were obviously
00:32:53,00:32:55,"really successful, A, what were we missing that we could have?"
00:32:55,00:32:57,"And B, it was quite damaging to their--"
00:32:57,00:32:58,"like, how good they were at their work,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,because they constantly rushed to have stuff published
00:33:00,00:33:01,before the other person.
00:33:01,00:33:04,And this is when the Brondosaurus cock up came about.
00:33:04,00:33:08,"So Marsh, off Neil Marsh, named the Apatosaurus."
00:33:08,00:33:10,"And then he thought he'd found a different dinosaur,"
00:33:10,00:33:11,and he named it the Brondosaurus.
00:33:11,00:33:13,"And that was really catchy name, because it means thunder"
00:33:13,00:33:15,horse or something.
00:33:15,00:33:17,And it turned out that it wasn't a Brondosaurus.
00:33:17,00:33:19,It was just another Apatosaurus.
00:33:19,00:33:22,"And that was just because he'd sped it through,"
00:33:22,00:33:23,because he must publish more papers than--
00:33:23,00:33:25,"and he won the Bone Wars in the end,"
00:33:25,00:33:29,"because he named 18 new species, and Copen named 56."
00:33:29,00:33:31,"I don't think there were that many winners in this, really,"
00:33:31,00:33:35,"there, there."
00:33:35,00:33:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:38,00:33:41,"Well, are you my teacher?"
00:33:41,00:33:45,"When bones fight each other, nobody wins."
00:33:45,00:33:48,I've read that they died--
00:33:48,00:33:50,I guess they did.
00:33:50,00:33:51,That was us.
00:33:51,00:33:53,"Yeah, they've gone--"
00:33:53,00:33:54,I've got a great fact about that.
00:33:54,00:33:55,How about you're a fact next week?
00:33:55,00:33:58,Ah!
00:33:58,00:34:04,"So yeah, so after Copen, Marsh, when he got into government,"
00:34:04,00:34:08,"he divided his-- yeah, as you say, he made himself hugely"
00:34:08,00:34:10,powerful just so he could fight the other guy.
00:34:10,00:34:14,But then he tried to take Copen's fossils away from him.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"And that was his crucial misstep, because he said,"
00:34:17,00:34:18,"these were found with government money,"
00:34:18,00:34:21,"and dug up with government money, therefore, the government"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"owns them, and we're going to take your collection away from you."
00:34:23,00:34:25,But Copen proved that he paid for all of his own.
00:34:25,00:34:27,"Yeah, the receipts, kept the receipts, right?"
00:34:27,00:34:29,"Yeah, and he destroyed Marsh's reputation"
00:34:29,00:34:31,by showing that Marsh had behaved so unethically.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"So then Marsh lost his job in government, lost all his income,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,lost everything.
00:34:35,00:34:38,"Cope died 56 years old, penniless,"
00:34:38,00:34:42,"Marsh died two years after that, and he had $186 left."
00:34:42,00:34:43,"You see, Anna, no winners."
00:34:43,00:34:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:47,00:34:48,I've learned my lessons.
00:34:48,00:34:49,The dinosaurs are all--
00:34:49,00:34:52,"they named 142 dinosaurs, but only 30--"
00:34:52,00:34:53,That is true.
00:34:53,00:34:54,--are actual-- they're still dinosaurs.
00:34:54,00:34:56,They got overexcited.
00:34:56,00:34:57,A lot of them were mistakes.
00:34:57,00:35:02,They made 110 fake dinosaurs and rushed to beat the other guy.
00:35:02,00:35:02,They're not fake.
00:35:02,00:35:05,We just weren't as good a classifying species then.
00:35:05,00:35:07,Cool dinosaur thing.
00:35:07,00:35:10,The most complete or one of the most complete fossils we have
00:35:10,00:35:14,"of a T-Rex was wrapped around, and with its teeth embedded"
00:35:14,00:35:17,in the most complete fossil we have of a triceratops.
00:35:17,00:35:17,Wow.
00:35:17,00:35:19,It's really cool.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"So annoyingly, it went straight to Bonham's,"
00:35:20,00:35:24,and they're trying to sell it for something like $10 million or something.
00:35:24,00:35:26,So they haven't got scientists into verifying it.
00:35:26,00:35:27,But recently--
00:35:27,00:35:28,"Yeah, it was last year, but it didn't go."
00:35:28,00:35:32,"And they were saying about how T-Rexes would have eaten them,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,and they would have taken their head off
00:35:34,00:35:35,like a tin opener kind of thing.
00:35:35,00:35:36,Is that all?
00:35:36,00:35:38,Because his teeth were embedded in its neck.
00:35:38,00:35:41,"The teeth have come out of the T-Rex, and were in this sort of net."
00:35:41,00:35:42,So that was the theory that they would just
00:35:42,00:35:44,"cut around the neck, and they'd take the head off and eat the inside."
00:35:44,00:35:46,"So then it was doing this, and there was an earthquake,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"they think, and which caused Santa fall on top of them,"
00:35:49,00:35:51,and they sort of sunk into the sinking sand.
00:35:51,00:35:52,And they were forever--
00:35:52,00:35:55,"Right, for 60 million years, they've been embraced."
00:35:55,00:35:57,"I see if it wasn't exciting enough with dinosaurs fighting,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,then there was an earthquake.
00:35:59,00:36:00,"Ah, that's amazing."
00:36:00,00:36:01,That's incredible.
00:36:01,00:36:05,You don't get that kind of entertainment anymore.
00:36:05,00:36:09,I read the very first dinosaur bone that was ever found was--
00:36:09,00:36:11,"at the time, it not thought to be a dinosaur bone."
00:36:11,00:36:14,It was in retrospective kind of looking at the drawings
00:36:14,00:36:16,of the thing that was described.
00:36:16,00:36:17,And it was a guy called Robert Plott.
00:36:17,00:36:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:18,00:36:22,"And Robert Plott, he thought what he'd found"
00:36:22,00:36:25,"was not a dinosaur, but a giant, which is incredible."
00:36:25,00:36:27,"He thought he was looking at this bone,"
00:36:27,00:36:29,"and he was like, this must be a giant man."
00:36:29,00:36:31,And so he told everyone that that's what he thought it was.
00:36:31,00:36:33,"Yeah, it was actually--"
00:36:33,00:36:36,it was a top of the thigh bone.
00:36:36,00:36:39,"Because of the shape of the top of the thigh bone of a dinosaur,"
00:36:39,00:36:40,it's quite hard to imagine that.
00:36:40,00:36:44,"But because of its shape, they called it scrotum humanum,"
00:36:44,00:36:46,because it looked like a giant scrotum.
00:36:46,00:36:48,And the thing is that they--
00:36:48,00:36:50,Giant balls.
00:36:50,00:36:51,Is that what he thought it was?
00:36:51,00:36:52,That wasn't him.
00:36:52,00:36:53,That was Richard Brooks who thought that.
00:36:53,00:36:55,But he came a little bit later.
00:36:55,00:36:58,He thought it was a giant elephant or something like that.
00:36:58,00:37:01,But then they came along called it scrotum humanum.
00:37:01,00:37:03,And then they realized it was a megalosaurus bone.
00:37:03,00:37:06,"But according to the rules of nomenclature,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,they should keep the first thing that it was called.
00:37:08,00:37:12,So the megalosaurus should really be called scrotum humanum.
00:37:12,00:37:13,That's so good.
00:37:13,00:37:16,"So the thing I really liked about this guy, though, Robert Plott."
00:37:16,00:37:18,He was quite an influential character back in the day
00:37:18,00:37:21,when it came to science and classifying things
00:37:21,00:37:22,and pushing forward ideas.
00:37:22,00:37:24,He also wrote about-- and I'd not
00:37:24,00:37:27,heard about this until today when I was looking into him--
00:37:27,00:37:31,he wrote about the first ever noted double sunset.
00:37:31,00:37:31,What?
00:37:31,00:37:32,Yeah.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Have you heard about this?
00:37:33,00:37:36,"OK, so he noticed it in leak, which I've not heard of either."
00:37:36,00:37:37,I don't know what that is.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"No, it's famous for it."
00:37:38,00:37:40,"I think if you're from anywhere near leak,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,they're known for the double sunset.
00:37:41,00:37:42,They're known for the double sunset.
00:37:42,00:37:42,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:37:42,00:37:43,What is it then?
00:37:43,00:37:44,"No, no, it's a real thing."
00:37:44,00:37:45,It's a real thing.
00:37:45,00:37:47,It's just where the contours of the earth
00:37:47,00:37:49,"aligns such that when the sun sets on a certain day of the year,"
00:37:49,00:37:53,"I think it's on the solstice, it looks like it's set over one hill."
00:37:53,00:37:56,And then because of the distance a certain hill behind it
00:37:56,00:37:59,is it rises up again and sets again.
00:37:59,00:38:00,It's just look at it on YouTube.
00:38:00,00:38:01,It's a real phenomenon.
00:38:01,00:38:02,It's a double sunset.
00:38:02,00:38:03,It's not magic.
00:38:03,00:38:06,"It's just the angle of the sun, compared to the mountains."
00:38:06,00:38:07,And it's in England.
00:38:07,00:38:07,It's a double sunset.
00:38:07,00:38:08,It's really-- it's really cool.
00:38:08,00:38:09,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:38:09,00:38:11,Another thing just on rivalries that I really like
00:38:11,00:38:15,is that there's so much academic warfare that goes on.
00:38:15,00:38:17,It's not just with the dinosaur hunters.
00:38:17,00:38:19,You look through any bit of history up until now.
00:38:19,00:38:21,"I tweeted once saying, where does outer space begin?"
00:38:21,00:38:24,And that sparked a huge debate on Twitter for ages.
00:38:24,00:38:27,Where no one knew where outer space technically began.
00:38:27,00:38:28,So I love collecting these little things.
00:38:28,00:38:31,And I found this thing that the first mobile phone call ever
00:38:31,00:38:33,placed was in April the 3rd--
00:38:33,00:38:35,"on April the 3rd, 1973."
00:38:35,00:38:37,I was a guy called Martin Cooper.
00:38:37,00:38:38,He invented it.
00:38:38,00:38:41,And he basically worked for Motorola.
00:38:41,00:38:43,And his very first phone call--
00:38:43,00:38:45,"when he was like, we've made the mobile phone."
00:38:45,00:38:46,Let's do this.
00:38:46,00:38:48,His very first phone call was to the rivals at AT&T
00:38:48,00:38:50,to say that they got their first.
00:38:50,00:38:51,How cool is that?
00:38:51,00:38:52,He called them.
00:38:52,00:38:53,We got their suckers.
00:38:53,00:38:54,Bye!
00:38:54,00:38:55,I got it.
00:38:55,00:38:59,"That was the very first mobile phone call ever made, 1973."
00:38:59,00:39:00,"We need to move on, by the way."
00:39:00,00:39:03,"Oh, so we just quickly talked about the bastard Edison was."
00:39:03,00:39:03,Go for it.
00:39:03,00:39:04,Yeah.
00:39:04,00:39:05,What?
00:39:05,00:39:06,It's about bloody time.
00:39:06,00:39:07,I think it is.
00:39:07,00:39:10,So obviously Edison is credited with a great deal.
00:39:10,00:39:12,He was propaganda Maestro.
00:39:12,00:39:14,And he came up with DC Current.
00:39:14,00:39:16,"Well, Tesla was coming up with AC Current,"
00:39:16,00:39:19,"which is what is used most mostly around the world now,"
00:39:19,00:39:21,"because it's much more useful, it travels longer distances,"
00:39:21,00:39:22,et cetera.
00:39:22,00:39:25,But Edison waged such a strong campaign against Tesla
00:39:25,00:39:27,and against AC Current.
00:39:27,00:39:29,"To the extent that, he wrote to the Society"
00:39:29,00:39:32,"for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the US,"
00:39:32,00:39:36,"and asked them to send him a bunch of dogs, cats, sheep, horses,"
00:39:36,00:39:39,and elephants to electrocute using AC Current
00:39:39,00:39:41,to prove that it was dangerous.
00:39:41,00:39:42,And the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
00:39:42,00:39:45,"So I said, yeah, of course, here you have some animals."
00:39:45,00:39:50,Feel free to electrocute them at your convenience.
00:39:50,00:39:51,"I'm not really doing the job, are they?"
00:39:51,00:39:54,"We did that in public, something was going on there."
00:39:54,00:39:56,"Yeah, and the electrocute to tops of the elephant."
00:39:56,00:39:59,"The electrocute topsi, which is the most traumatic thing."
00:39:59,00:40:04,"Topsi was a circus elephant, who basically she killed one guy"
00:40:04,00:40:05,who poked her in the face or something.
00:40:05,00:40:09,And so she was supposed to be hanged as elephants tended
00:40:09,00:40:10,to be when they were executed.
00:40:10,00:40:11,Hanged.
00:40:11,00:40:13,They used to hang elephants.
00:40:13,00:40:14,What?
00:40:14,00:40:15,That's the way to do it.
00:40:15,00:40:16,It's not the best way to do it.
00:40:16,00:40:19,I mean.
00:40:19,00:40:21,This is a source of a lot of content in the QI office.
00:40:21,00:40:24,"You're the Kenji song, that's right."
00:40:24,00:40:27,"On the normal circumstances, we would have caught that big animal."
00:40:27,00:40:29,But we--
00:40:29,00:40:31,It's live.
00:40:31,00:40:35,I've just made it to hanging elephants.
00:40:35,00:40:40,"OK, time to move on to our final facts."
00:40:40,00:40:42,Andy Murray.
00:40:42,00:40:45,My fact is that Mozilla Firefox translates
00:40:45,00:40:48,its computer systems into hundreds of different languages.
00:40:48,00:40:50,But lots of the metaphors don't translate.
00:40:50,00:40:54,"So things like cookies or files or mouse, things like that."
00:40:54,00:40:56,"So in Senegal, in the Fula language,"
00:40:56,00:40:58,"a computer crash is known as a hooky, which"
00:40:58,00:41:03,means a cow falling over but not dying.
00:41:03,00:41:04,Isn't that good?
00:41:04,00:41:06,And they have all of these things.
00:41:06,00:41:09,They're translating them using local idioms and local
00:41:09,00:41:09,languages.
00:41:09,00:41:13,"So a timeout is a Hanama, which means your fish has gone away."
00:41:13,00:41:19,And I don't really get this one.
00:41:19,00:41:23,"But aspect ratio is translated as Jean Dondero,"
00:41:23,00:41:27,which is a rebuke from elders when a fishing net is wrongly woven.
00:41:27,00:41:28,You don't get that?
00:41:28,00:41:29,I don't know.
00:41:29,00:41:30,Do you know what aspect ratio is?
00:41:30,00:41:33,Not really.
00:41:33,00:41:34,I'm thinking about it now.
00:41:34,00:41:35,I do get it.
00:41:35,00:41:36,I think that's quite good.
00:41:36,00:41:38,"It's kind of like a fishing net, isn't it?"
00:41:38,00:41:39,When it's wrongly woven.
00:41:39,00:41:39,I'm laughing.
00:41:39,00:41:41,I'd still don't know what it is.
00:41:41,00:41:42,Never mind.
00:41:42,00:41:43,I do like it when--
00:41:43,00:41:47,"Yeah, so when interesting linguistic metaphors, I guess."
00:41:47,00:41:49,And I think we might have been more fun with them
00:41:49,00:41:50,in the olden days.
00:41:50,00:41:54,"So in the 1800s, they referred to ducks or any birds"
00:41:54,00:41:57,with feet quite close to their buns as ass feet.
00:41:57,00:42:01,"And if you read natural science journals and stuff,"
00:42:01,00:42:04,"they'll say the ass foot duck present here,"
00:42:04,00:42:05,"or the ass foot present here, was--"
00:42:05,00:42:08,Wasn't the Grieb formally known as an ass foot?
00:42:08,00:42:09,"It would have been, yeah, yeah, Grieb."
00:42:09,00:42:11,Which one is known as a windfucker?
00:42:11,00:42:14,"That's a kestrel, or a kite."
00:42:14,00:42:16,Because they stay hovering against the wind.
00:42:16,00:42:17,Yeah.
00:42:17,00:42:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:42:19,00:42:23,"So ""computer"" words in Hawaiian, the word for ""computer"""
00:42:23,00:42:26,"literally means ""electric brain."""
00:42:26,00:42:27,"That's ""lala-ulah."""
00:42:27,00:42:30,"Yeah, and in Iceland, the computer is known as a ""tulah,"""
00:42:30,00:42:33,"which means ""number prophetess."""
00:42:33,00:42:34,"Oh, that's good, isn't it?"
00:42:34,00:42:35,That's really nice.
00:42:35,00:42:37,I like-- it's a female as well.
00:42:37,00:42:38,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:38,00:42:40,And they-- they're older--
00:42:40,00:42:42,Standard.
00:42:42,00:42:46,"They're old words for a page that was, oh, I can't pronounce that,"
00:42:46,00:42:50,"""frifluothur,"" which means ""feeth of the peace."""
00:42:50,00:42:52,Wow.
00:42:52,00:42:53,"That's good, though, isn't it?"
00:42:53,00:42:55,That's incredible.
00:42:55,00:42:57,"Yeah, so speaking of women and computers,"
00:42:57,00:42:59,"first person to write ""computer code"" was a woman, right?"
00:42:59,00:43:01,"Who I think we've talked to, yeah?"
00:43:01,00:43:03,She's here tonight.
00:43:03,00:43:07,"Welcome to the stage, the 150-year-old from ""Come Up."""
00:43:07,00:43:10,"Ada Lovelace, or Lovelace, I never know how to say that."
00:43:10,00:43:11,Byron's daughter.
00:43:11,00:43:11,Byron's daughter.
00:43:11,00:43:12,Byron's only legitimate daughter.
00:43:12,00:43:14,Although she was never allowed to see him
00:43:14,00:43:17,"because her understandably, her mum hated him so much."
00:43:17,00:43:19,Yeah.
00:43:19,00:43:24,"Yeah, so she wrote the world's first ""computer code"" in 1842,"
00:43:24,00:43:25,"and it was because she worked with Charles Papish,"
00:43:25,00:43:28,"didn't she, who made the analytical engine?"
00:43:28,00:43:29,Is that what it was called?
00:43:29,00:43:30,Yeah.
00:43:30,00:43:31,"And it wasn't called a computer,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,because originally computers were people who did sums.
00:43:33,00:43:34,Yes.
00:43:34,00:43:36,"You would say, ""I'll just go and turn on the computer."""
00:43:36,00:43:38,"No, you wouldn't say that."
00:43:38,00:43:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:41,00:43:44,That's too wrong in too many ways.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"My mum always-- you know, in parents,"
00:43:46,00:43:47,I've like really lame jokes.
00:43:47,00:43:48,They do your whole life.
00:43:48,00:43:50,"Whenever you say to her, ""Can you turn on the lights, please?"""
00:43:50,00:43:51,"She starts flirting with the lights, well."
00:43:51,00:43:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:55,00:43:57,I wonder if everyone here has shown.
00:43:57,00:43:58,"That's not a lame joke, actually."
00:43:58,00:43:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:43:59,00:44:00,That's pretty good.
00:44:00,00:44:01,She'll be thrilled.
00:44:01,00:44:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:44:03,00:44:06,The first search engine was called Archie.
00:44:06,00:44:07,"Oh, that's it."
00:44:07,00:44:08,"Oh, yeah."
00:44:08,00:44:11,And so it was set up by this guy called Alan M. Taj.
00:44:11,00:44:12,"It was in the '80s, in 1983."
00:44:12,00:44:15,"And he was Barbadian, or Bayesian, whatever,"
00:44:15,00:44:16,whichever we're going to call it.
00:44:16,00:44:18,"And yeah, so he set up this search engine."
00:44:18,00:44:19,He did computer science.
00:44:19,00:44:20,And it was called Archie.
00:44:20,00:44:24,And because I think comic book fans overlap quite a lot
00:44:24,00:44:27,with computer geek people sometimes.
00:44:27,00:44:29,"And so everyone assumed it was named after Archie,"
00:44:29,00:44:30,the comic book guy.
00:44:30,00:44:32,And so eventually he did an interview where he came out.
00:44:32,00:44:34,"And he said, it's not named after Archie."
00:44:34,00:44:35,It's named after Archive.
00:44:35,00:44:36,And I took the V out.
00:44:36,00:44:41,"Archie, the comics are the most insipid thing I've ever read."
00:44:41,00:44:44,"He was not invited back to Comic Con the next year, wasn't he?"
00:44:44,00:44:47,"Anyway, he hasn't owned a computer since 1983."
00:44:47,00:44:49,Probably I haven't let him have one.
00:44:49,00:44:50,So rude about them.
00:44:50,00:44:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:44:53,00:44:55,"The word bug, supposedly, was coined in 1946"
00:44:55,00:44:58,when a lady called Grace Hopper found a moth
00:44:58,00:45:00,trapped in a relay at Harvard University.
00:45:00,00:45:01,And she freed them off.
00:45:01,00:45:03,And then she taped it into a book.
00:45:03,00:45:05,"But still, the computer then worked again."
00:45:05,00:45:08,And that's where people thought we got the word bug from.
00:45:08,00:45:09,But it's not true.
00:45:09,00:45:11,It's been in use since at least the 1870s.
00:45:11,00:45:12,"However, she is amazing."
00:45:12,00:45:14,"She is not only a great computer scientist,"
00:45:14,00:45:17,she was also a US Navy rear admiral.
00:45:17,00:45:18,Wow.
00:45:18,00:45:18,She's badass.
00:45:18,00:45:21,There are photos of this little lady in an enormous rack
00:45:21,00:45:22,of medals on her chest.
00:45:22,00:45:25,And she's got the proper naval admiral hat.
00:45:25,00:45:25,Amazing.
00:45:25,00:45:26,"Yeah, very cool."
00:45:26,00:45:28,In the what year?
00:45:28,00:45:32,She died in about 1980 or 1990.
00:45:32,00:45:34,"So in the mid '40s, '50s, '60s was when"
00:45:34,00:45:36,she was in her admiral and computer heyday.
00:45:36,00:45:37,Right.
00:45:37,00:45:37,"Yeah, look her up."
00:45:37,00:45:38,Grace Hopper.
00:45:38,00:45:38,Very cool.
00:45:38,00:45:39,Brilliant.
00:45:39,00:45:41,I was looking at language because of the language part
00:45:41,00:45:44,of the fact.
00:45:44,00:45:45,"I was looking at the language of Vanuatu,"
00:45:45,00:45:47,which is called Bislama.
00:45:47,00:45:49,And this was brought to the islands by sailors.
00:45:49,00:45:53,"So they're a bit, you know, a bit racy, the words."
00:45:53,00:45:56,And a lot of their words have the word shit in them.
00:45:56,00:45:57,Their word for shit is sit.
00:45:57,00:46:00,So sit-belong fire is ash.
00:46:00,00:46:03,"So it's the ship, which is left over after a fire's burned,"
00:46:03,00:46:04,which is quite good.
00:46:04,00:46:07,"Sit water, obviously, is diarrhea."
00:46:07,00:46:10,And sit-belong spider is--
00:46:10,00:46:11,Spider shit.
00:46:11,00:46:12,A spider web.
00:46:12,00:46:14,"Oh, I fell into that one."
00:46:14,00:46:15,Yeah.
00:46:15,00:46:18,That's an innocent one.
00:46:18,00:46:21,"And then I spent all afternoon looking at Vanuatu, basically--"
00:46:21,00:46:23,What have you found?
00:46:23,00:46:26,I found that they have pseudo-hermaphroditic pigs
00:46:26,00:46:27,on the island.
00:46:27,00:46:29,And these are the pigs that they've--
00:46:29,00:46:32,bred and bred and bred to have less and less testosterone.
00:46:32,00:46:35,So the penises have got smaller and smaller and smaller.
00:46:35,00:46:37,And now you can't even tell they have penises.
00:46:37,00:46:39,And they're pseudo-hermaphrodites.
00:46:39,00:46:41,And they're so precious on the island
00:46:41,00:46:43,that they're used as currency.
00:46:43,00:46:47,"So they use pseudo-hermaphroditic pigs as currency, which"
00:46:47,00:46:51,is the best sentence I've ever heard.
00:46:51,00:46:52,Do they carry around in wallet?
00:46:52,00:46:54,"No, it's just like owning it."
00:46:54,00:46:55,And then you would--
00:46:55,00:46:56,if you wanted to buy a house in your tent.
00:46:56,00:46:58,You would like a house in your house.
00:46:58,00:47:00,I think they use tusks as currency as well.
00:47:00,00:47:03,So it takes seven years for a tusk to grow in a full circle.
00:47:03,00:47:05,At which point it is valuable after the pig--
00:47:05,00:47:07,"it's removed from the pig, obviously, or taken."
00:47:07,00:47:10,"But if you get a double tusker, that's 14 years worth"
00:47:10,00:47:11,of accumulated money.
00:47:11,00:47:15,So that's how they calculate what's worth more.
00:47:15,00:47:16,I was looking at language as well.
00:47:16,00:47:19,And so fun words that exist in other languages
00:47:19,00:47:20,that we didn't have words for in English.
00:47:20,00:47:22,I think we should.
00:47:22,00:47:26,So I think my favorites are-- which one?
00:47:26,00:47:29,"""Jayus"" or ""Jayus"" in Indonesian is a joke so unfunny"
00:47:29,00:47:32,"that you have to laugh at it, which is weird with that, yeah."
00:47:32,00:47:33,That's my next edit and brush out title.
00:47:33,00:47:37,If anyone wants to come along.
00:47:37,00:47:41,"""Mangata"" in Sweden literally means ""Moon Street."""
00:47:41,00:47:43,"So it's guessable, actually."
00:47:43,00:47:45,But it's the-- do you know what it is?
00:47:45,00:47:47,No.
00:47:47,00:47:49,"It's the-- so when the moon's reflecting over a lake,"
00:47:49,00:47:51,it's the reflection of the moon.
00:47:51,00:47:53,It looks like a road.
00:47:53,00:47:55,"And then ""Sobre Mesa"" in Spanish"
00:47:55,00:47:57,is the time spent in conversation after a meal.
00:47:57,00:47:59,And it literally means over the table.
00:47:59,00:48:02,But I really like that because that turns it into an activity
00:48:02,00:48:06,"that's then justified in spending six hours doing, right?"
00:48:06,00:48:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:07,00:48:09,"""Sobre Mesa""-- post-burning or washing up, basically."
00:48:09,00:48:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:11,00:48:12,No.
00:48:12,00:48:14,The word-- this is a great-- it's a Swiss word.
00:48:14,00:48:19,"And it's ""Altos on Tinta Lassena Versicharung."""
00:48:19,00:48:20,And it's the Swiss word for a pension.
00:48:20,00:48:22,"And they just say ""ahv."""
00:48:22,00:48:25,But what it means is old age and survivors insurance.
00:48:25,00:48:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:26,00:48:28,How cool is that?
00:48:28,00:48:29,"OK, just one more thing about Senegal,"
00:48:29,00:48:30,because that was--
00:48:30,00:48:31,"Yeah, the original fact."
00:48:31,00:48:32,The original fact.
00:48:32,00:48:34,All the way back was about Senegal.
00:48:34,00:48:36,"The main language in Senegal is ""Woloff."""
00:48:36,00:48:40,"And the ""Woloff"" language doesn't really have words"
00:48:40,00:48:40,for colors.
00:48:40,00:48:42,"It does have them, but they don't use them."
00:48:42,00:48:44,So they don't have the word for blue and orange
00:48:44,00:48:45,and red.
00:48:45,00:48:46,They use the French.
00:48:46,00:48:49,But they do have lots of words for shades of gray.
00:48:49,00:48:51,Loads and loads and loads.
00:48:51,00:48:51,"No, really."
00:48:51,00:48:52,How many?
00:48:52,00:48:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:55,00:48:56,We don't know.
00:48:56,00:48:57,I don't know.
00:48:57,00:48:58,The reason they have so many shades of gray
00:48:58,00:49:00,is because of their cast system.
00:49:00,00:49:04,Because the shade of your skin matters so much to them
00:49:04,00:49:06,that the different shades between black and white
00:49:06,00:49:08,"are really, really important to you."
00:49:08,00:49:09,And that's why they have so many shades of gray.
00:49:09,00:49:12,And the good thing about it is if you're a person
00:49:12,00:49:16,"who does a lot of art with pencils, especially in Africa,"
00:49:16,00:49:18,they use all these different shades of gray
00:49:18,00:49:20,when you're deciding how much you shade things in.
00:49:20,00:49:22,So they are actually useful as well as--
00:49:22,00:49:23,as well as a bit racist.
00:49:23,00:49:24,Yeah.
00:49:24,00:49:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:25,00:49:27,"I'm so excited that you've mentioned ""Wall-Off"""
00:49:27,00:49:29,"because when I was reading about jazz,"
00:49:29,00:49:32,"it's in the ""Wall-Off"" language that they think the word ""hip"""
00:49:32,00:49:33,comes from.
00:49:33,00:49:35,"And it's a word in the ""Wall-Off"" language"
00:49:35,00:49:36,"called ""Hepicat."""
00:49:36,00:49:40,And obviously so it's like a black culture thing jazz.
00:49:40,00:49:41,"And so they think ""hip"" comes from ""Hepicat."""
00:49:41,00:49:43,And then a bunch of other etymologists
00:49:43,00:49:44,think that that's rubbish.
00:49:44,00:49:46,And that's just sort of post-talk rationalization.
00:49:46,00:49:48,And they say there's no actual evidence
00:49:48,00:49:49,"that it comes from ""Hepicat."""
00:49:49,00:49:51,"And so apparently, among etymologists,"
00:49:51,00:49:55,"instead of saying ""to cry wolf,"" you say, ""to cry wall-off."""
00:49:55,00:49:57,And this is etymologist banter.
00:49:57,00:49:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:49:58,00:50:00,To cry wall-off.
00:50:00,00:50:03,"Start using it, guys."
00:50:03,00:50:05,OK.
00:50:05,00:50:05,That's it.
00:50:05,00:50:07,That's all our facts.
