 Welcome to another episode of No Such Things A Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you this week

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,560
 from the Aces & 8 bar in Tuppnell Park. This is our first ever live recording. My name is

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,840
 Dan Schroiber. Please welcome to the stage the three regular elves Andy Murray, Anna Chazinski and

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:24,320
 James Horkin. Once again we have gathered around with our four favorite facts from the last seven

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,800
 days and in no particular order here we go. Fact number one and beginning with you,

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,520
 James. Okay my fact this week is that the first BBC radio presenter with a northern accent

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
 was given the job to make it more difficult for the Nazis to impersonate news readers.

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,600
 So why were the Nazis impersonating newsreaders? They thought that if they could pretend to be newsreaders

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,280
 over the radio then people would believe anything they said and they'd be able to say oh we've

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,440
 got such a strong army and people would just believe it. So they let raid the BBC? It was just

17
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,320
 propaganda really. They would pretend to be BBC newsreaders. And so people wore horror and people

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:11,840
 like that. But yeah. It's also why we've got James on the podcast. James a Nazi. No this was a guy

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,280
 called Wilfrid Pickles. He was the first northern newsreader from 1941. He was from Yorkshire

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,640
 and a lot of people didn't believe the news when he read it out because he had a northern accent.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,200
 Apparently. What did they think? They thought that's a Nazi trying to do a British accent.

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 No I don't know what they thought really. They just thought this guy's uneducated he

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,880
 can't possibly know what the news is. That's what they I read this thing about in the early days

24
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,160
 of news reporting particularly on radio that they never it was all male presenters and they said

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,800
 that they wouldn't allow female presenters on because they didn't want them to have to go through

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,600
 reading bad news like upsetting news stories. Yeah. They just thought they're not going to like that. That

27
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,960
 would be too emotional. And it's true. It's a BBC thing where they announced that they said we're

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,120
 not going to allow wind to do that. They'll be too upset when they hear this bad news. No. It's

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,280
 terrible. They did have one in 1933 the first female newsreader. She was called Mrs. Giles Borrett.

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
 I don't know what her real first name was. It doesn't seem to come up any more.

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
 Have you seen a picture of that? Mrs. Giles Borrett. Yeah, as he named after her husband. We were asked

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,560
 holes to women back in the day. We still are but like I mean doubly so. That's terrible.

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,960
 There were complaints she was there for two months and the BBC took her off the air for technical

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:38,240
 reasons. She's technically a gender is wrong. Did you know that all newsreaders were originally

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,440
 anonymous? No. So they didn't give their names on air. It was just the voice of the BBC news.

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
 And so we have the Nazis to thank the named newsreaders because during the war people said that they

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,320
 should be able to listen and kind of authenticate who they were listening to. So the first one was

38
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,920
 Frank Phillips and he said in July 1940 battle of Britain time this is Frank Phillips from the BBC

39
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,880
 so that again you couldn't be impersonated. So today we might have Hugh Edwards just being a man

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,360
 on a screen. Wow. That's kind of used to me. Yeah. Isn't that weird though that none of them

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,560
 identified themselves? Do you guys know about the very first ever BBC news report on the radio?

42
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,120
 No. Okay. It's great. It basically was on the 14th of November and I forgot to look up the date.

43
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,520
 But it's on the 14th of November so we're coming up to the anniversary. Very exciting.

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:32,480
 And basically he read out the news. It was a guy called Arthur Burrows and he read it out

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,080
 but he read it twice once quickly and then once slowly and then asked the listeners which to do

46
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,760
 proper. Just for future recordings to know which way they go. And the wish did they go with?

47
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,280
 I think it's not been recorded. I don't know the answer. So we didn't know if now we have quick

48
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,560
 news or slow news. I have no idea. I have no idea. Also it was really weird because when they started

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,920
 doing the news they did it post 7pm and Lord Reath joined. So Lord Reath if you don't know his name

50
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,360
 he's the guy who in the BBC they have a big kind of saying which is to entertain and form and

51
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,440
 educate. That's the Lord Reath philosophy for BBC that everyone's tried to stick to. He joined

52
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,520
 the week after the very first broadcast of a radio announcement telling the news on the BBC.

53
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,320
 And he had this thing where he said we don't want anyone to be doing news bulletins before 6pm

54
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,840
 because the newspapers will be hurt as a result of it. And so no one was allowed to do anything

55
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,440
 in terms of announcing any news to the point that when they showed horse racing on the

56
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,160
 news they couldn't have commentators commentating on the horse race so you listen to hooves

57
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,280
 and people cheering at like 4pm and then at 7pm they go and blitzer one. They would wait till the

58
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,840
 7 o'clock news. Was there a pause in between the end of the hoose? I think so. And blitzer one.

59
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,920
 So you were speaking of radio though. Do you know what they did in 1955 when ITV started? I think

60
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,280
 it was 1955 wasn't it? And what the BBC did to try and jeopardize ITV's chances? No.

61
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,760
 It wasn't actually on TV because radio was the more popular medium at that time. They killed off

62
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,760
 Grace Archer in the Archer's gas. 20 million people tuned in. The population of Britain was 40

63
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,320
 million at the time. Half the country tuned in to listen to Grace get killed off from the Archer.

64
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,240
 The Archer's fans really hate you don't they don't they? We make I so outside anyone who

65
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,680
 listens to this podcast might know that we also the four of us work for QI and one of the QI

66
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
 things is a radio show called Museum of Curiosity. And Museum of Curiosity is played at 630 every

67
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,920
 evening on a Monday and Archer's follows immediately and we get the shit ripped out of us by the Archer's

68
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,640
 fans they hate us and they just they don't even they just they say how much they hate us and then

69
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:56,000
 they do hashtag the archers and so everyone they catch the last five minutes of Museum of Curiosity

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
 and we're usually talking about pubic lies or something like that and this it doesn't come up on

71
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,920
 the Archer's apparently. No it doesn't there was a great there was a fantastic one this week though

72
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,680
 there was someone who actually tweeted what is this garbage I absolutely hate it hashtag the

73
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,040
 Archer's someone wrote back going I know this program sucks they should cancel it the Archer's is

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:20,080
 terrible lovely confusion I have a fact about Lord wreath John wreath as he was then when he applied

75
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,640
 for the post of general manager of the British broadcasting company he did not know what broadcasting

76
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,040
 was and he wrote in his diary that when he was called to an interview he quote still hadn't the

77
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,880
 remotest idea as to what broadcasting was I hadn't trouble to find out and they gave him the job

78
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,520
 and when so do you know where remote controls were for what was the main attraction of them

79
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,760
 how they were marketed remote controls what for TV yeah is that I'm calling them you don't have to

80
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:54,000
 get up and walk over to the thing presumably it is that but their main strategy in the marketing

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,360
 was it was after ITV came about and Adverts came about and remote controls were just volume controls

82
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,800
 and they looked like one of those rotary phones so they were like a a dial which you just dialed

83
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,560
 up or down and it was they can meet the Adverts so Adverts came onto TV and immediately they marked

84
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,440
 something that could make them shut there was one really early there was one really early remote

85
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,560
 control that was done by light the problem with it was that when the sun shot on it it would turn

86
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:26,000
 the channel over there's a great I was talking about this in the office a few days ago and I can't

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,360
 verify this fact and I really want to really go anyone knows this show I'm known as the dubious one

88
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,840
 on the show not just on the show just in life the way I do any research for this show is to put in the

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,880
 fact and then put plus Yeti that's my kind of research of this show that's how bad I am at it but

90
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,680
 I read a fact in a book years ago when I first moved to England and it was a fact that when they

91
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,920
 doing when they did live TV dramas they would have a thing where obviously it was black and white

92
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,480
 everything had to be done live as they were going along and the actors if they forgot their lines

93
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,880
 as they were doing this play live they would mind speaking and then the other actor would mind

94
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
 speaking back at them so that while the production we're quickly trying to find cards that could show

95
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,680
 them what the next line was the people at home were going what the hell's wrong with the TV are

96
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,920
 sounds gone again and get up and hit it and then by the time they remember the line they'd be like

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
 we should go to the shops and then they're back into the play but I can't prove this as a fact so

98
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,760
 if anyone listening or anyone in this room tonight knows it please let me know yeah don't wait

99
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,800
 up for the post accents oh go on what no what was yours well I've got to max and go on yeah talk

100
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,040
 about you know for an accent syndrome oh yeah what's that what's that the real thing so it's not

101
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,480
 just mad people making it up you know when someone wakes up and you make that terrible

102
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,760
 self-hyros accent yeah I would but yeah it's a real thing so it happens if you have a particularly

103
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,920
 bad migraine you can get for an accent syndrome but it's not where you wake up with a specific

104
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,360
 for an accent it's just where you wake up with an accent that sounds kind of like for an accent

105
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
 so there's like an interview with this woman Julie Matthias who just had a migraine and now speaks in

106
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,880
 this bizarre kind of Scandinavian Indian South African hybrid and I think it's really horrible

107
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,240
 for her is it it must be tough right also cat breasts syndrome do you know that one it's where you

108
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,160
 believe that one of your loved ones has actually been has died and been replaced by a robot or

109
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:24,400
 something like that once the real yeah yeah yeah what like we all had it like that time when my dad

110
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,600
 died and was replaced by a robot yeah but that actually happened yeah but for people with a

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 syndrome yeah yeah but if you google this and look for examples of it happening there's like one

112
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,400
 pretty much one or two examples on the BBC news and the most famous person to have it done it was

113
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,640
 called Alan Davis really yeah and I always wanted to run that on cue I but thought no not really

114
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,560
 it's just in case it's actually him yeah all right come if you're mocking me on cue I do you

115
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,640
 want to hear something cool about the Queen's accent yeah so they've done a study on her but without

116
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,800
 and okay they've they've listened to the Queen's speech from three from different decades so they

117
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,400
 listened to loads from the 1950s and then they listened to loads from the 1980s and they found

118
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,040
 that she no longer speaks the Queen's English so they measured loads of her sounds surely by

119
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,480
 definition what she says is a good thing that's true but they it was a study at Macquarie University

120
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,600
 on Australia and they said that her accent has drifted a bit so she sounds a bit like some younger

121
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,720
 and I'm using their words she sounds Jamaican now she sounds Jamaican they said she has

122
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,440
 Cockney influences now apparently yeah I mean you can't tell apparently most of the changes it

123
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,440
 was 12 or 13 vowel sounds she says you get me yeah why can't we tell if she has it

124
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:50,720
 where machines can hear it apparently computers can hear machines yes my dad my dad but they

125
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,960
 they they were so happy to study her because and these are the words she hasn't lived and lived

126
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:01,760
 in different communities that might alter her accent yeah no kidding so you reckon she got

127
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,880
 it off TV or something I don't know maybe yeah she is a fact she's a huge fan of I think

128
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,720
 the other things of the archers yeah it's a miracle museum is still going you should say

129
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,960
 your tweets to me the terrible and she didn't do a speech in 1969 there was no Queen's speech

130
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:23,040
 on TV and the reason was she had already done one interview that year in the summer for a documentary

131
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,320
 and it changed her accent so much she couldn't bear does she just said that's enough you get one

132
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,080
 dose a queen a year and that was it for 1969 so she didn't know that's great and we used to speak

133
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,240
 rotec English didn't we which is how the American speak English show the way American speak is the

134
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,960
 way that is proper English is the English that we were speaking in the 17th century yeah we didn't

135
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,400
 pronounce our arse and that's wrong and that's because spelling hasn't kept up with the way we speak

136
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,160
 what do you mean don't pronounce her like oh god I'm not going to be able to think of any

137
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,120
 examples now so you know if we said I've just got the word Somerset written down here so if we say

138
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,840
 Somerset they'd say Somerset or that she just sounds like a Somerset

139
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:10,640
 to sound like 40 say Somerset Dan you've got a Somerset yeah exactly like cover and garden

140
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,280
 cover what there's no or in cover but he's he's got it wrong this is the biggest content should say

141
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,480
 I have a messed up accent I know I have a messed up accent the main tweet outside of archers hatred

142
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,920
 towards me that I get is people listening to our show saying why are you saying

143
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,880
 cover and garden like I get so much what about the what about the child who listens to the podcast oh

144
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,280
 there's a child who listens to our podcast they're three four years old yeah three four years old the

145
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,280
 godmother wrote into us to say that James every time uh you're you talk my my my my little goddaughter

146
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,960
 she smiles and she's how happy how nice yeah and then when Dan comes on she frowns and looks

147
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:57,200
 disappointed in Southwest really splitting accent well okay let's go back to the point in hand

148
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,680
 yeah I want to speak about Wilfred Pickles so this was the guy with a northern accent who read the

149
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,520
 news uh he also was the host of the first British quiz show to give away prizes it was called

150
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,640
 Hava Go and the jackpot was three pounds wow let's see what was more than I suppose but still

151
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:24,720
 yeah it's not who wants to be a million who wants to own three pounds but they got an audience of

152
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:33,840
 26 million yeah if you think about what uh break off got what 13 million this was uh up to 1967 he

153
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,920
 did it yeah a lot more people used to watch yeah but they didn't make up they didn't have beg off back

154
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,240
 then so you know what was what was the what was the fact that you told me in the office the other day

155
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,640
 about um like a tire and stuff when they when they were recording uh in radio early radio about

156
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,160
 what they have to wear I do remember yes in the 30s the British news readers had to wear

157
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,160
 dennesuit even though you couldn't see them when they were reading the news on the radio I really

158
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,600
 like that you can tell though you can tell with the voice when they're sitting up properly it won't

159
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,000
 be slouching like that is that why was that they're just yeah I think it gives you a better you know

160
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,800
 posture a better accent just you know they're just being being annoying about it sure yeah

161
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,080
 for anyone listening we're all wearing dinner jackets now

162
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,400
 um some animals have accents don't they but not all what I'm trying to just think which

163
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,520
 which animal's doing which don't so so people tend to think that like hardly animal

164
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,680
 hardly any animals have accents like animals it's in their dreams the way the way they speak but

165
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
 then farmers in the north of England reported that I think it was that I think this might have been

166
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,240
 where I just read Somerset it was a Somerset farmer who said that his cows had a different accent to

167
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,720
 the farmers in surrounding counties oh they do they move in accents that want to that want

168
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,040
 an ignoble price didn't it yeah cows move in regional access yeah a very appeared review scientific

169
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,920
 paper that um and yeah and babies as well babies have regional access they move in different

170
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:05,120
 uh no babies go French and German babies have different ways of saying

171
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,000
 neither of them sound like that German ones go and I'm paraphrasing and French babies go

172
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,200
 okay there is a difference a machines can hear it my dad if he was

173
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:26,480
 we should we should wrap up on our first facts we got anything else anyone want to add anything

174
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,600
 uh apparently the announcers on the BBC if they would cough during a broadcast they would be

175
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,160
 inundated with cough cough lozenges and wallen underwear because everyone was scared that they had a

176
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,480
 call so guys whenever you want to start throwing oh that's really good okay um oh yeah yeah go

177
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,880
 for just go to the case we don't come back onto the subject of radio for loads of podcasts um when

178
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,520
 woman's up again in 1946 it was hosted by a man early early items on the show included

179
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,280
 cooking with whale meat I married a lion tamer and how to hang your husband's suit

180
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:11,920
 true great and fact okay um time for fact number two uh and that is my fact and my fact this week

181
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,960
 is that in china if you want to empty a building of people a building full of people if you want

182
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:28,880
 to empty it you play this song don't get up and leave it here there's it doesn't work apparently

183
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:39,280
 so this is a song does anyone know what that is no one okay you can even guess the artist

184
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,600
 yes five points yeah now i've this is a weird thing no one in this country in the uk seems to know

185
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,720
 who kene g is kene g is one of the biggest artists in the world and in my heart uh he's sold 75

186
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,040
 million albums uh worldwide he uh played at the inauguration of bill clinton he worked on the body

187
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,840
 guard soundtrack if you watch the Grammys in the 90s and variably at some point Michael Bolton would

188
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,520
 rock on stage next to kene g and they would own it uh and the interesting thing is that since the year

189
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,800
 2000 in 1989 this song came out and it got really big it's called going home by kene g

190
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,760
 and for some reason it got adopted and no one really knows why in china as the going home song

191
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,680
 so at the end of the day i think because it's called going home yeah why did they choose it

192
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:38,880
 why didn't they choose melody and be wake me up before you go go what so they basically it's a tune

193
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,360
 that just gets played everywhere at schools at the end of school they play it to kids to go home

194
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:49,360
 if you're on a train that's entering the final stop of its destination the terminal uh they play that

195
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,680
 song everywhere in china in a marketplace they'll play it on loop for an hour and a half to tell

196
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,320
 you to get out and kene g people are really getting the hint if you have to play it for an hour and a

197
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,360
 half at the end of a party presumably you play that when you want every well when because as a result

198
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,120
 this song he doesn't get any royalties from it but he plays a lot of gigs in china now he had to

199
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,920
 make sure that he put that song at the end otherwise people still playing during the gig but this

200
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:16,000
 is this is an insane thing if he did get royalties though he will be richer than bill gays if they

201
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
 play it for an hour and a half at every day at the closing of a month not only that when tv used to

202
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,800
 end at say like 12 a.m. or 11 p.m. whenever it is in china up until six a.m. when it came back on it

203
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,880
 would be on loop that was the song that played kene g is massive in china i i i have i read a few

204
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,600
 accounts from chinese people saying i'm pretty sick of this song that i liked it the first time i

205
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,040
 heard it and now i really don't so i think so i had an heard of kene g oh no i had heard of him i

206
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,160
 didn't know what he was but i think that's us being musically illiterate i think everyone else in

207
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,220
 and Britain, I think you're touring British people

208
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,600
 with our brush by saying no one's heard of Kenny G.

209
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,700
 - No, no, no one in this room except one person, right?

210
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,640
 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,740
 - Okay, so well done. - So the only thing, so I was like,

212
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,840
 I'd haven't heard of this guy,

213
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 I don't really listen to music,

214
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,920
 it was made in the last 40 years.

215
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,920
 So I just decided, I'll look up something about music.

216
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,240
 I know he's kind of jazz.

217
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,400
 Let's look up a circular breathing.

218
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,800
 The longest musical note ever held lasted 45 minutes

219
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,920
 and 47 seconds, and the record was set by Kenny G.

220
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,680
 - Yeah. - This guy is phenomenal about him.

221
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,600
 - Yeah. - Well, I like playing golf

222
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,520
 and I looked up who's the best musician who plays golf

223
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,800
 and it's Kenny G. (laughing)

224
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,360
 - He's everywhere. - He's off plus 0.8.

225
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,800
 - And many years ago, Kenny G woke up one morning

226
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,600
 when his uncle said, "I have a business.

227
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,920
 My friend is running and I think you might be interested.

228
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
 You should buy some stocks into it.

229
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
 They make coffee and he went, "I'll buy some stocks."

230
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,200
 And he now has made almost as much money off the back

231
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,360
 of the fact that he put stocks into Starbucks

232
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,160
 before it launched, as much as he's made

233
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,920
 from his 75 million albums.

234
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,720
 - So should we boycott him now?

235
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,120
 (laughing)

236
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,720
 - I have been doing an unconscious boycott

237
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,120
 of him all my life, but I don't know who he was.

238
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,720
 (laughing)

239
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,360
 - No, I didn't know who Kenny G was either

240
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,680
 and I Googled Kenny G is and the first to our,

241
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,920
 Kenny G is my imaginary friend.

242
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,440
 (laughing)

243
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,440
 And Kenny G is Katie Perry's uncle

244
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
 and I looked it up and he isn't.

245
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,760
 (laughing)

246
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,040
 I have no idea what that's about at all.

247
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,680
 And then I spent the rest of the afternoon

248
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,400
 Googling Katie Perry's uncle

249
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,800
 who is even less interesting than Kenny G.

250
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,520
 (laughing)

251
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
 - What's he do?

252
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,200
 Who is he?

253
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,880
 - He's a director of movies.

254
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
 He's dead now.

255
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 - Oh, okay.

256
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,080
 - Oh, a bit of a downer.

257
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,000
 - You didn't even know him.

258
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,840
 - And in fairness, guys, he was a robot.

259
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,760
 (laughing)

260
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,720
 - Circular breathing, there was a thing in Greece

261
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,240
 called the Disfigurement of Athens

262
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,800
 and it's written about by some Greek crisis

263
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,080
 and apparently that was a weird facial disfigurement

264
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,920
 you would get if you did too much circular breathing.

265
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,000
 - I really, what's that like?

266
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,960
 - I don't know.

267
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,440
 - I don't really know how you do it.

268
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,000
 - No, how you do circular breathing?

269
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,880
 - No, I read about how to do it the other day

270
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
 and I still, I can't do it.

271
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
 - You save a little bit of air in your mouth

272
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,240
 and then you breathe through your nose.

273
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,680
 - Does it help people beat box, is that it's beat box?

274
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,160
 - And it's to help you sustain notes.

275
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
 - Yeah, yeah.

276
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,960
 - So jazz, he's jazz, right?

277
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,800
 That's what he does.

278
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,560
 Otherwise, I've been reading mother rums.

279
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,880
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

280
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,200
 - Let's say he's jazz anyway.

281
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,280
 - I see he plays his saxophone.

282
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
 Does he go, let's be round for president?

283
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,720
 Did you know that?

284
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,560
 - What?

285
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,400
 - Of America.

286
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
 - Of America.

287
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,600
 In 1964, he ran a joke campaign for president.

288
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,880
 He promised to rename the White House,

289
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
 the Blues House, and a point.

290
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,600
 (laughing)

291
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,320
 - And he was going to appoint Duke Ellington

292
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,240
 as his secretary of state and Miles Davis

293
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
 as head of the CIA.

294
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
 - Which would have been--

295
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,120
 - Miles Davis.

296
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
 - Who are you from?

297
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
 (laughing)

298
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,800
 - He also, does he, Lesby, couldn't hit since 1949,

299
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,480
 he was unable to hit the B-flat above high sea on his trumpet

300
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,720
 'cause he had a very, very minor bicycling accident.

301
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
 But he got $1,000, which I think was quite a lot in 1949.

302
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,680
 - Sure.

303
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,560
 - And compensation for it because it's damaged his art.

304
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
 I could never hit that high B-flat.

305
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,000
 - Yeah.

306
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,360
 Wait, a minor cycling accident.

307
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,720
 - Just a twisted ankle, yeah.

308
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,520
 - He stopped him from being able to hit a high--

309
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,680
 - Weird.

310
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,920
 - Yeah, maybe it was winded or something.

311
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,280
 - You can sue for damaging your art.

312
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,360
 - You'll want your art.

313
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,880
 - Down, I don't think he's got a case.

314
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,240
 (laughing)

315
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,360
 - Just checking.

316
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,520
 - Another influential jazz person.

317
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,840
 Most influential guitarist of all time.

318
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,880
 - Jimmy Hendrix.

319
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,360
 - I was gonna go with Django Reinhart.

320
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,200
 Maybe it wasn't like jazz guitar.

321
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
 - Was missing the two main guitar playing fingers,

322
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,480
 - So it only ever did solos on two fingers.

324
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,840
 - Didn't he die because he refused to go to a doctor?

325
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,280
 - Yes, I think he did.

326
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,840
 - Yeah, he had a minor medical condition.

327
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,000
 He didn't go to a doctor and then it got bad and then he died.

328
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 Does anyone know what Knitt will remember what he had?

329
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,160
 - I don't remember, no.

330
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,560
 - Just speaking of Django, this is a very weird link,

331
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,400
 but it's something I was when I was looking into

332
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
 all the stuff about Michael Bolt.

333
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,840
 I'm sorry, Kenny G being massive in China.

334
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,880
 It is curious when you find out about people

335
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,240
 who are big in other countries,

336
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,800
 who aren't sort of as like Norman Wisdom being massive

337
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,040
 in Albania.

338
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,560
 Norman Wisdom is huge still to this day in Albania.

339
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,200
 When he died, it was almost a national holiday

340
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 and they just, and they have.

341
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,200
 - That's the holiday.

342
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,320
 (laughing)

343
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,560
 - So, that's the day of my life, thank you again.

344
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,040
 - Good boy, finally, that hated Wisdom is removed.

345
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,840
 (laughing)

346
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,800
 - When Kenny G dies, a lot of Chinese society

347
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
 will celebrate not having to listen to this song anymore.

348
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,360
 - That's true, that's true.

349
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,200
 Oh, come on.

350
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,400
 - There's a lot of Kenny G lovely in the room.

351
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,160
 - Yeah, it's a lot of people more famous in other countries.

352
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,080
 - Yeah, yeah, so I was reading about people who are more famous.

353
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,600
 The list of Americans, or just a people foreign people

354
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,440
 to China being big there.

355
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,600
 It's quite, it's quite interesting.

356
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,040
 The most famous person in China is Kobe Bryant,

357
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,360
 who's a basketball player, which I did not expect.

358
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,200
 - The most famous person in all of China.

359
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,560
 - Well, my theory is that it's actually Mr. Bean,

360
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,480
 which, and then, in at number three,

361
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,480
 Mao Zedong.

362
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,040
 (laughing)

363
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,160
 - Yeah, it's a phrase that done.

364
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,840
 - Oh, it's the most famous foreigner.

365
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,680
 - Okay.

366
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

367
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,680
 - It's not fun.

368
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,160
 - So these people are getting bigger and bigger.

369
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,040
 And as a result, there's a really interesting thing going on

370
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,280
 with the movie world at the moment,

371
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,040
 which is that the Chinese movie world

372
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,440
 has now overtaken Bollywood.

373
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,240
 It's taken over everything except America.

374
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,440
 They're the second largest movie makers in the world.

375
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,120
 And so as a result of these people's names getting quite big,

376
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,080
 they're getting put into movies now and being sold to China.

377
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,640
 And as a result, so the top film in China last year

378
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,200
 was Transformers, above anything in the world, right?

379
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,040
 They absolutely loved it.

380
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,480
 The latest Transformers movie that came out.

381
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,000
 But they do this really interesting thing

382
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,240
 where they have to edit out certain bits of the movie

383
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
 as it exists because it turns out there's a lot

384
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
 of anti-Chinese government stuff in movies

385
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
 that we don't realize.

386
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,920
 So when movies go out, suddenly there's a missing five minutes

387
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,960
 where a character has been taken out

388
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,560
 and it suddenly just doesn't make sense.

389
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,040
 Cloud Atlas, they took out 43 minutes of the movie

390
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,560
 when they took to China.

391
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,440
 That you can argue that it could miss 43 minutes.

392
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:07,960
 Couldn't do that.

393
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,880
 I haven't seen it.

394
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
 I haven't seen it.

395
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
 When the sound of music came out in South Korea,

396
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,960
 it was really, really popular.

397
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,480
 And like Cinemas were playing it four or five times a day.

398
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,760
 And one cinema owner wanted to work out a way

399
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,080
 that he could play it more times a day

400
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,040
 to get more customers in.

401
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,880
 So he edited out all the songs.

402
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,040
 [LAUGHTER]

403
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,640
 Amazing.

404
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 That's like, if anyone heard an episode

405
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,800
 that we did, I think it was last week of the week before,

406
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,000
 Chuck Norris, when he plays his movies to his kids,

407
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,400
 doesn't like the idea of his kids seeing the fight scenes

408
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,760
 and the Chuck Norris movies.

409
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,120
 So he personally edits out all the fight scenes

410
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,080
 from his movies and his kids just watch it.

411
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,040
 And I cannot think of a worse experience than watching

412
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,880
 a fight with--

413
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,600
 Sound of music without any songs.

414
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,600
 Yeah.

415
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,680
 It's just called "of."

416
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
 I can.

417
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
 [LAUGHTER]

418
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,400
 People must have loved Cinemas so confused.

419
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,880
 What was with the title of it?

420
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,840
 Just to qualify, when I said Django, the reason I said that

421
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,440
 is Django Unchained, the Quentin Tarantino movie,

422
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,080
 went into China and was pulled minutes from all of the cinemas

423
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
 when it started, because I had a nude scene.

424
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,240
 And they don't allow nudity in movies now.

425
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,920
 That's not anti-China propaganda to be fair to Django.

426
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

427
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,440
 No, it's just they have strict law still with Serious.

428
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,160
 The other thing is that China is the biggest

429
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,680
 as in the amount of money they take,

430
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,160
 not the number of movies they make, I think.

431
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,800
 Yeah, because it's the side of the world, yeah.

432
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,400
 Which is not the only way.

433
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,880
 Yeah, they do this thing as well now.

434
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,800
 So you know, when we watch a James Bond movie, how they take out--

435
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,400
 you just see Richard Branson suddenly, and it's obviously

436
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,520
 a virgin ad, or it's just product placement the whole way

437
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,040
 through.

438
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,080
 They re-shoot scenes with Chinese product placement.

439
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,920
 So which movie was it here?

440
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,360
 It was "During World Wars" Z. Oh, great movie.

441
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:51,920
 Great film.

442
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,280
 Great movie.

443
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,080
 It is a great film.

444
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,440
 What's it, World Wars?

445
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,080
 You like Pacific Rim as your greatest ever.

446
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,840
 I love the Pacific Rim.

447
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,480
 Come on.

448
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,240
 Thank you.

449
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,080
 Oh, my goodness.

450
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,000
 Yeah, it goes forever.

451
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,400
 All right.

452
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,560
 I saw an edited version of "Wobble Z,"

453
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,080
 because I was on a plane watching it,

454
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,320
 because that's when you should watch "Wobble Z."

455
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,480
 And they edited out the bit with the enormous plane zombie

456
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,120
 scene, which ends with the plane crashing.

457
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,960
 Really?

458
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,000
 Yeah, weird, right?

459
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,360
 We censors.

460
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,920
 Let us watch the scene.

461
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,880
 That's fair.

462
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,680
 We should move on.

463
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
 We don't quite want to start.

464
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
 Oh, I just want to say one more thing.

465
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
 So this, Kenny G's real name is.

466
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,520
 Kenneth Gorelic.

467
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,160
 Kenneth Gorelic.

468
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,680
 And I thought I'd check and see if I had anything on him

469
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,120
 in my files on my computer.

470
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,760
 And I didn't have anything on him.

471
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,520
 But I did have something on another Kenneth Gorelic.

472
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
 And this is--

473
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,280
 That is weird.

474
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,600
 Go into the basement.

475
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
 Kenneth J. Gorelic, this is.

476
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,120
 He's a medic, and he wrote a paper called

477
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
 "A four letter word in the medical literature."

478
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,960
 And he went through all medical literature looking

479
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,720
 for instances of the word "fuck."

480
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,400
 OK?

481
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,120
 He found 17 instances since the 1960s.

482
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,600
 Four were about a fungus called "fuck."

483
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,440
 Two were sexual.

484
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,800
 And six were the author.

485
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,200
 OK?

486
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,120
 What do you mean?

487
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,240
 As in the name of the author?

488
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:15,920
 Oh, right, sorry.

489
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,600
 So here, the most prolific single contributor

490
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,560
 was Dr. E. Fuck, whose four German language publications

491
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,320
 on the Malik acid metabolism of saccharolytices constitute

492
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,800
 a major contribution to the field.

493
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
 This may be about to change with the emergence

494
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,480
 of Dr. L. Fuck as a co-author of a publication in 1999.

495
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,120
 So look out for those new fucks.

496
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,240
 OK, let's move on to fact number three,

497
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,120
 and that is Chazinski.

498
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,480
 Uh, yeah, it is.

499
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,840
 My fact is that the two leading paleontologists

500
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,600
 in the 19th century used to destroy their fossil sites

501
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,240
 after excavating them so that their rival

502
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,080
 wasn't able to find anything on them.

503
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,080
 That's insane.

504
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,920
 And so, and these really were the two

505
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,760
 by far and away, the leading paleontologist.

506
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,760
 So they were Edward Drinker, Cope, and Othnial, Charles, Marsh.

507
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,280
 Othnial.

508
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,760
 Othnial?

509
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,160
 Yep, that's right, that's his name.

510
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
 Got a problem with that?

511
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
 No.

512
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
 No, ma'am.

513
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,080
 It's just a brilliant name.

514
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,880
 It's good, yeah.

515
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,640
 So before they came along, there were nine species

516
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,600
 of dinosaur had been discovered and named.

517
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
 And between the two of them, by the time they both died,

518
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,240
 they'd named 136 species between them,

519
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
 including all the ones you've heard of,

520
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,880
 all the big ones, stegosaurus, diplodocus, triceratops,

521
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
 all those guys.

522
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,360
 And they kind of liked each other at first.

523
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,120
 So they met in 1867, and they named species

524
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,920
 after one another.

525
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,280
 So a giant serpent from New Jersey

526
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,560
 was called Mossosaurus Copianus after Cope and vice versa.

527
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,720
 Yeah, but I'm not sure that was because he liked him,

528
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,320
 because it's actually his copianus.

529
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,440
 Copianus, isn't it?

530
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,160
 That's what it is.

531
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,560
 Yeah, so I think that might have been an insult.

532
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,560
 No.

533
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,960
 For only you've been there to tell him.

534
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,400
 He thought he were best friends.

535
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,200
 I think this is why he was so upset.

536
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,000
 And Dick had a Soros, what is that?

537
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,040
 [LAUGHTER]

538
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,160
 So, relationship went sour when Cope showed off

539
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,920
 this fossil of an elasmosaurus, and a big, like,

540
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,880
 showing a new fossil.

541
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,160
 Classic faux pas.

542
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,680
 Yeah.

543
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,360
 Not at the end yet.

544
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,880
 Did that put the head on the wrong end of it?

545
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,120
 And Marsh said, I think you put the head on the tail.

546
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,320
 And Cope was like, no, haven't, you're wrong.

547
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,120
 And they called in the museum curator, the academy curator,

548
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,280
 who said, yeah, you put the head on the wrong end.

549
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,600
 And he was so humiliated by that, that Marsh wrote,

550
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,120
 that after that, he's been my bitter enemy.

551
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,560
 And it was so extreme.

552
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,520
 They spent 25 years stealing each other's fossils.

553
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,320
 They both employed teams of sort of spies to go

554
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,520
 and jeopardize each other's sight.

555
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,280
 So they'd steal and break each other's fossils.

556
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,680
 One of them, Marsh, got into government

557
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,080
 so that he could withdraw funding from the other guy.

558
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,400
 It comes in exchange of letters, where one would say,

559
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,480
 some of my fossils are damaged and have disappeared.

560
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
 I know you're responsible.

561
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,000
 And the other one would write back going,

562
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,520
 it's outrageous that you'd accuse me of that.

563
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,600
 But since you mentioned it, some of my fossils

564
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,000
 were gone and I thought, at least just 25 years of this.

565
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,480
 Wow.

566
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,760
 It was called the Bone Wars.

567
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,840
 The Bone Wars.

568
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,920
 How would they destroy each other's sort of--

569
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,080
 Well, Dynamite was how Marsh did it.

570
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,800
 Dynamite.

571
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 Yeah.

572
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,480
 So they would find their bit and then go,

573
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,520
 there may be lots more here.

574
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
 But I'm just going to--

575
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,680
 Yeah, just in case there is.

576
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,360
 Or I think if they couldn't carry stuff back,

577
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
 or if they'd found the thing they needed to find.

578
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,600
 They couldn't carry stuff back, yeah.

579
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,040
 Well, that's all I can say about that.

580
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,000
 Well, maybe they thought they would

581
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,320
 propel it back with the dynamite.

582
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,280
 I read that, on one occasion, there

583
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,720
 are two teams of researchers, even

584
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,600
 had a stone throwing battle against each other.

585
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,720
 They stayed from--

586
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,480
 Yeah.

587
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,720
 They hated each other.

588
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,360
 They were throwing fossils at each other.

589
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:48,960
 Yeah?

590
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,600
 No, I think they're still just--

591
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
 Yeah.

592
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,080
 And it was quite-- even though they were obviously

593
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,480
 really successful, A, what were we missing that we could have?

594
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,280
 And B, it was quite damaging to their--

595
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,560
 like, how good they were at their work,

596
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,120
 because they constantly rushed to have stuff published

597
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,120
 before the other person.

598
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,760
 And this is when the Brondosaurus cock up came about.

599
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,800
 So Marsh, off Neil Marsh, named the Apatosaurus.

600
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,440
 And then he thought he'd found a different dinosaur,

601
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,800
 and he named it the Brondosaurus.

602
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,920
 And that was really catchy name, because it means thunder

603
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,000
 horse or something.

604
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,840
 And it turned out that it wasn't a Brondosaurus.

605
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,480
 It was just another Apatosaurus.

606
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,000
 And that was just because he'd sped it through,

607
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,920
 because he must publish more papers than--

608
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,440
 and he won the Bone Wars in the end,

609
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,320
 because he named 18 new species, and Copen named 56.

610
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
 I don't think there were that many winners in this, really,

611
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:35,240
 there, there.

612
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,320
 [LAUGHTER]

613
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,640
 Well, are you my teacher?

614
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,840
 When bones fight each other, nobody wins.

615
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,840
 I've read that they died--

616
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,280
 I guess they did.

617
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 That was us.

618
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,200
 Yeah, they've gone--

619
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,160
 I've got a great fact about that.

620
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,360
 How about you're a fact next week?

621
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
 Ah!

622
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,840
 So yeah, so after Copen, Marsh, when he got into government,

623
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,000
 he divided his-- yeah, as you say, he made himself hugely

624
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,280
 powerful just so he could fight the other guy.

625
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,000
 But then he tried to take Copen's fossils away from him.

626
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,240
 And that was his crucial misstep, because he said,

627
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,800
 these were found with government money,

628
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,120
 and dug up with government money, therefore, the government

629
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,360
 owns them, and we're going to take your collection away from you.

630
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,520
 But Copen proved that he paid for all of his own.

631
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,200
 Yeah, the receipts, kept the receipts, right?

632
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,800
 Yeah, and he destroyed Marsh's reputation

633
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,840
 by showing that Marsh had behaved so unethically.

634
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,600
 So then Marsh lost his job in government, lost all his income,

635
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,560
 lost everything.

636
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,440
 Cope died 56 years old, penniless,

637
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,360
 Marsh died two years after that, and he had $186 left.

638
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,760
 You see, Anna, no winners.

639
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,080
 [LAUGHTER]

640
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,200
 I've learned my lessons.

641
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,680
 The dinosaurs are all--

642
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,280
 they named 142 dinosaurs, but only 30--

643
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,040
 That is true.

644
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,840
 --are actual-- they're still dinosaurs.

645
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,000
 They got overexcited.

646
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
 A lot of them were mistakes.

647
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,320
 They made 110 fake dinosaurs and rushed to beat the other guy.

648
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,920
 They're not fake.

649
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,760
 We just weren't as good a classifying species then.

650
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,320
 Cool dinosaur thing.

651
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,600
 The most complete or one of the most complete fossils we have

652
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,240
 of a T-Rex was wrapped around, and with its teeth embedded

653
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,160
 in the most complete fossil we have of a triceratops.

654
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,680
 Wow.

655
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,160
 It's really cool.

656
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,960
 So annoyingly, it went straight to Bonham's,

657
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,520
 and they're trying to sell it for something like $10 million or something.

658
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,320
 So they haven't got scientists into verifying it.

659
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,080
 But recently--

660
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,880
 Yeah, it was last year, but it didn't go.

661
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,520
 And they were saying about how T-Rexes would have eaten them,

662
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,360
 and they would have taken their head off

663
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,960
 like a tin opener kind of thing.

664
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,800
 Is that all?

665
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
 Because his teeth were embedded in its neck.

666
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
 The teeth have come out of the T-Rex, and were in this sort of net.

667
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,560
 So that was the theory that they would just

668
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
 cut around the neck, and they'd take the head off and eat the inside.

669
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
 So then it was doing this, and there was an earthquake,

670
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,720
 they think, and which caused Santa fall on top of them,

671
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,200
 and they sort of sunk into the sinking sand.

672
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
 And they were forever--

673
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,880
 Right, for 60 million years, they've been embraced.

674
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,960
 I see if it wasn't exciting enough with dinosaurs fighting,

675
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
 then there was an earthquake.

676
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,600
 Ah, that's amazing.

677
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,440
 That's incredible.

678
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,480
 You don't get that kind of entertainment anymore.

679
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,600
 I read the very first dinosaur bone that was ever found was--

680
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,800
 at the time, it not thought to be a dinosaur bone.

681
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,680
 It was in retrospective kind of looking at the drawings

682
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,160
 of the thing that was described.

683
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,920
 And it was a guy called Robert Plott.

684
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,680
 Oh, yeah.

685
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,080
 And Robert Plott, he thought what he'd found

686
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,680
 was not a dinosaur, but a giant, which is incredible.

687
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,040
 He thought he was looking at this bone,

688
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,000
 and he was like, this must be a giant man.

689
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,680
 And so he told everyone that that's what he thought it was.

690
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,200
 Yeah, it was actually--

691
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,040
 it was a top of the thigh bone.

692
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,040
 Because of the shape of the top of the thigh bone of a dinosaur,

693
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,320
 it's quite hard to imagine that.

694
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,600
 But because of its shape, they called it scrotum humanum,

695
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 because it looked like a giant scrotum.

696
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,000
 And the thing is that they--

697
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,040
 Giant balls.

698
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,440
 Is that what he thought it was?

699
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,280
 That wasn't him.

700
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
 That was Richard Brooks who thought that.

701
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,000
 But he came a little bit later.

702
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,480
 He thought it was a giant elephant or something like that.

703
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,000
 But then they came along called it scrotum humanum.

704
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,720
 And then they realized it was a megalosaurus bone.

705
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,360
 But according to the rules of nomenclature,

706
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,320
 they should keep the first thing that it was called.

707
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,480
 So the megalosaurus should really be called scrotum humanum.

708
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
 That's so good.

709
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,320
 So the thing I really liked about this guy, though, Robert Plott.

710
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,800
 He was quite an influential character back in the day

711
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
 when it came to science and classifying things

712
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,840
 and pushing forward ideas.

713
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,960
 He also wrote about-- and I'd not

714
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,160
 heard about this until today when I was looking into him--

715
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:31,000
 he wrote about the first ever noted double sunset.

716
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,600
 What?

717
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 Yeah.

718
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,560
 Have you heard about this?

719
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,960
 OK, so he noticed it in leak, which I've not heard of either.

720
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,760
 I don't know what that is.

721
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,240
 No, it's famous for it.

722
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
 I think if you're from anywhere near leak,

723
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
 they're known for the double sunset.

724
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
 They're known for the double sunset.

725
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,760
 Yeah, it's amazing.

726
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,600
 What is it then?

727
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,720
 No, no, it's a real thing.

728
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,240
 It's a real thing.

729
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
 It's just where the contours of the earth

730
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,760
 aligns such that when the sun sets on a certain day of the year,

731
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,960
 I think it's on the solstice, it looks like it's set over one hill.

732
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,320
 And then because of the distance a certain hill behind it

733
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,040
 is it rises up again and sets again.

734
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
 It's just look at it on YouTube.

735
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,840
 It's a real phenomenon.

736
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
 It's a double sunset.

737
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,640
 It's not magic.

738
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,000
 It's just the angle of the sun, compared to the mountains.

739
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 And it's in England.

740
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,840
 It's a double sunset.

741
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,680
 It's really-- it's really cool.

742
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,440
 Yeah, it's amazing.

743
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,840
 Another thing just on rivalries that I really like

744
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,160
 is that there's so much academic warfare that goes on.

745
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,320
 It's not just with the dinosaur hunters.

746
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,520
 You look through any bit of history up until now.

747
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,800
 I tweeted once saying, where does outer space begin?

748
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,160
 And that sparked a huge debate on Twitter for ages.

749
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,000
 Where no one knew where outer space technically began.

750
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,320
 So I love collecting these little things.

751
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,360
 And I found this thing that the first mobile phone call ever

752
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,400
 placed was in April the 3rd--

753
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,520
 on April the 3rd, 1973.

754
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,000
 I was a guy called Martin Cooper.

755
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
 He invented it.

756
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,560
 And he basically worked for Motorola.

757
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,760
 And his very first phone call--

758
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,440
 when he was like, we've made the mobile phone.

759
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,000
 Let's do this.

760
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,720
 His very first phone call was to the rivals at AT&T

761
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,160
 to say that they got their first.

762
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,480
 How cool is that?

763
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,160
 He called them.

764
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,480
 We got their suckers.

765
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
 Bye!

766
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
 I got it.

767
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,520
 That was the very first mobile phone call ever made, 1973.

768
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,760
 We need to move on, by the way.

769
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,040
 Oh, so we just quickly talked about the bastard Edison was.

770
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,400
 Go for it.

771
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,240
 Yeah.

772
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
 What?

773
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,600
 It's about bloody time.

774
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,640
 I think it is.

775
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,560
 So obviously Edison is credited with a great deal.

776
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,760
 He was propaganda Maestro.

777
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,760
 And he came up with DC Current.

778
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
 Well, Tesla was coming up with AC Current,

779
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,760
 which is what is used most mostly around the world now,

780
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,440
 because it's much more useful, it travels longer distances,

781
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,160
 et cetera.

782
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,640
 But Edison waged such a strong campaign against Tesla

783
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,040
 and against AC Current.

784
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,680
 To the extent that, he wrote to the Society

785
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,000
 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in the US,

786
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
 and asked them to send him a bunch of dogs, cats, sheep, horses,

787
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,920
 and elephants to electrocute using AC Current

788
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,480
 to prove that it was dangerous.

789
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,760
 And the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

790
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,000
 So I said, yeah, of course, here you have some animals.

791
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,360
 Feel free to electrocute them at your convenience.

792
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,960
 I'm not really doing the job, are they?

793
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,160
 We did that in public, something was going on there.

794
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,240
 Yeah, and the electrocute to tops of the elephant.

795
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,160
 The electrocute topsi, which is the most traumatic thing.

796
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,000
 Topsi was a circus elephant, who basically she killed one guy

797
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,640
 who poked her in the face or something.

798
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,000
 And so she was supposed to be hanged as elephants tended

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,320
 to be when they were executed.

800
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
 Hanged.

801
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,040
 They used to hang elephants.

802
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
 What?

803
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,200
 That's the way to do it.

804
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,480
 It's not the best way to do it.

805
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,400
 I mean.

806
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,960
 This is a source of a lot of content in the QI office.

807
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,200
 You're the Kenji song, that's right.

808
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,840
 On the normal circumstances, we would have caught that big animal.

809
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,800
 But we--

810
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,640
 It's live.

811
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,640
 I've just made it to hanging elephants.

812
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,880
 OK, time to move on to our final facts.

813
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,080
 Andy Murray.

814
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,120
 My fact is that Mozilla Firefox translates

815
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,120
 its computer systems into hundreds of different languages.

816
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,280
 But lots of the metaphors don't translate.

817
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,360
 So things like cookies or files or mouse, things like that.

818
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,160
 So in Senegal, in the Fula language,

819
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,920
 a computer crash is known as a hooky, which

820
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,080
 means a cow falling over but not dying.

821
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,160
 Isn't that good?

822
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,080
 And they have all of these things.

823
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,040
 They're translating them using local idioms and local

824
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,560
 languages.

825
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,040
 So a timeout is a Hanama, which means your fish has gone away.

826
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,040
 And I don't really get this one.

827
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,840
 But aspect ratio is translated as Jean Dondero,

828
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,240
 which is a rebuke from elders when a fishing net is wrongly woven.

829
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,400
 You don't get that?

830
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
 I don't know.

831
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,640
 Do you know what aspect ratio is?

832
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,120
 Not really.

833
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,080
 I'm thinking about it now.

834
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
 I do get it.

835
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,640
 I think that's quite good.

836
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,120
 It's kind of like a fishing net, isn't it?

837
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,280
 When it's wrongly woven.

838
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,960
 I'm laughing.

839
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,880
 I'd still don't know what it is.

840
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:42,720
 Never mind.

841
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,800
 I do like it when--

842
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,400
 Yeah, so when interesting linguistic metaphors, I guess.

843
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,160
 And I think we might have been more fun with them

844
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,600
 in the olden days.

845
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,400
 So in the 1800s, they referred to ducks or any birds

846
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,680
 with feet quite close to their buns as ass feet.

847
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,880
 And if you read natural science journals and stuff,

848
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,160
 they'll say the ass foot duck present here,

849
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,720
 or the ass foot present here, was--

850
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,200
 Wasn't the Grieb formally known as an ass foot?

851
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,840
 It would have been, yeah, yeah, Grieb.

852
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,760
 Which one is known as a windfucker?

853
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,480
 That's a kestrel, or a kite.

854
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,760
 Because they stay hovering against the wind.

855
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
 Yeah.

856
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,960
 [LAUGHTER]

857
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,600
 So "computer" words in Hawaiian, the word for "computer"

858
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,080
 literally means "electric brain."

859
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,680
 That's "lala-ulah."

860
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,720
 Yeah, and in Iceland, the computer is known as a "tulah,"

861
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,040
 which means "number prophetess."

862
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,800
 Oh, that's good, isn't it?

863
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
 That's really nice.

864
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,360
 I like-- it's a female as well.

865
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,600
 Yeah, yeah.

866
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,920
 And they-- they're older--

867
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,560
 Standard.

868
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,200
 They're old words for a page that was, oh, I can't pronounce that,

869
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,840
 "frifluothur," which means "feeth of the peace."

870
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,440
 Wow.

871
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,720
 That's good, though, isn't it?

872
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,240
 That's incredible.

873
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,440
 Yeah, so speaking of women and computers,

874
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,760
 first person to write "computer code" was a woman, right?

875
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,560
 Who I think we've talked to, yeah?

876
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,400
 She's here tonight.

877
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,640
 Welcome to the stage, the 150-year-old from "Come Up."

878
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,000
 Ada Lovelace, or Lovelace, I never know how to say that.

879
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
 Byron's daughter.

880
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,600
 Byron's daughter.

881
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,880
 Byron's only legitimate daughter.

882
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,440
 Although she was never allowed to see him

883
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,720
 because her understandably, her mum hated him so much.

884
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,080
 Yeah.

885
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:24,080
 Yeah, so she wrote the world's first "computer code" in 1842,

886
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,320
 and it was because she worked with Charles Papish,

887
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,240
 didn't she, who made the analytical engine?

888
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,280
 Is that what it was called?

889
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
 Yeah.

890
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,520
 And it wasn't called a computer,

891
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,960
 because originally computers were people who did sums.

892
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,800
 Yes.

893
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
 You would say, "I'll just go and turn on the computer."

894
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,400
 No, you wouldn't say that.

895
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,480
 [LAUGHTER]

896
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,560
 That's too wrong in too many ways.

897
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,160
 My mum always-- you know, in parents,

898
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,320
 I've like really lame jokes.

899
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,120
 They do your whole life.

900
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,240
 Whenever you say to her, "Can you turn on the lights, please?"

901
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,760
 She starts flirting with the lights, well.

902
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,760
 [LAUGHTER]

903
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,400
 I wonder if everyone here has shown.

904
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,960
 That's not a lame joke, actually.

905
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,760
 [LAUGHTER]

906
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,680
 That's pretty good.

907
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,760
 She'll be thrilled.

908
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,880
 [LAUGHTER]

909
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,640
 The first search engine was called Archie.

910
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,280
 Oh, that's it.

911
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,240
 Oh, yeah.

912
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,120
 And so it was set up by this guy called Alan M. Taj.

913
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,880
 It was in the '80s, in 1983.

914
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,200
 And he was Barbadian, or Bayesian, whatever,

915
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,280
 whichever we're going to call it.

916
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,240
 And yeah, so he set up this search engine.

917
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,480
 He did computer science.

918
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,600
 And it was called Archie.

919
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,360
 And because I think comic book fans overlap quite a lot

920
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,520
 with computer geek people sometimes.

921
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,560
 And so everyone assumed it was named after Archie,

922
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,480
 the comic book guy.

923
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,680
 And so eventually he did an interview where he came out.

924
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,480
 And he said, it's not named after Archie.

925
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,880
 It's named after Archive.

926
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,960
 And I took the V out.

927
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,080
 Archie, the comics are the most insipid thing I've ever read.

928
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:44,960
 He was not invited back to Comic Con the next year, wasn't he?

929
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,920
 Anyway, he hasn't owned a computer since 1983.

930
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,640
 Probably I haven't let him have one.

931
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,520
 So rude about them.

932
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,240
 [LAUGHTER]

933
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,960
 The word bug, supposedly, was coined in 1946

934
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,840
 when a lady called Grace Hopper found a moth

935
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,560
 trapped in a relay at Harvard University.

936
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,960
 And she freed them off.

937
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,240
 And then she taped it into a book.

938
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,720
 But still, the computer then worked again.

939
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,240
 And that's where people thought we got the word bug from.

940
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,160
 But it's not true.

941
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,360
 It's been in use since at least the 1870s.

942
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,480
 However, she is amazing.

943
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,600
 She is not only a great computer scientist,

944
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:17,640
 she was also a US Navy rear admiral.

945
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,160
 Wow.

946
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:18,680
 She's badass.

947
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,360
 There are photos of this little lady in an enormous rack

948
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,720
 of medals on her chest.

949
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,080
 And she's got the proper naval admiral hat.

950
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,920
 Amazing.

951
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,520
 Yeah, very cool.

952
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,400
 In the what year?

953
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,200
 She died in about 1980 or 1990.

954
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,480
 So in the mid '40s, '50s, '60s was when

955
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,840
 she was in her admiral and computer heyday.

956
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,360
 Right.

957
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:37,880
 Yeah, look her up.

958
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,360
 Grace Hopper.

959
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:38,880
 Very cool.

960
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,200
 Brilliant.

961
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,560
 I was looking at language because of the language part

962
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:44,040
 of the fact.

963
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,720
 I was looking at the language of Vanuatu,

964
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,400
 which is called Bislama.

965
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,640
 And this was brought to the islands by sailors.

966
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,320
 So they're a bit, you know, a bit racy, the words.

967
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,000
 And a lot of their words have the word shit in them.

968
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,600
 Their word for shit is sit.

969
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,480
 So sit-belong fire is ash.

970
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,120
 So it's the ship, which is left over after a fire's burned,

971
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,320
 which is quite good.

972
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,960
 Sit water, obviously, is diarrhea.

973
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,320
 And sit-belong spider is--

974
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,160
 Spider shit.

975
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,480
 A spider web.

976
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,480
 Oh, I fell into that one.

977
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,480
 Yeah.

978
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,400
 That's an innocent one.

979
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,880
 And then I spent all afternoon looking at Vanuatu, basically--

980
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,320
 What have you found?

981
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,280
 I found that they have pseudo-hermaphroditic pigs

982
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,320
 on the island.

983
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,800
 And these are the pigs that they've--

984
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,680
 bred and bred and bred to have less and less testosterone.

985
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,120
 So the penises have got smaller and smaller and smaller.

986
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,480
 And now you can't even tell they have penises.

987
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,680
 And they're pseudo-hermaphrodites.

988
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,400
 And they're so precious on the island

989
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,400
 that they're used as currency.

990
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,400
 So they use pseudo-hermaphroditic pigs as currency, which

991
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,320
 is the best sentence I've ever heard.

992
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,840
 Do they carry around in wallet?

993
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,120
 No, it's just like owning it.

994
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,120
 And then you would--

995
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,960
 if you wanted to buy a house in your tent.

996
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,160
 You would like a house in your house.

997
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,440
 I think they use tusks as currency as well.

998
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,320
 So it takes seven years for a tusk to grow in a full circle.

999
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,840
 At which point it is valuable after the pig--

1000
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,400
 it's removed from the pig, obviously, or taken.

1001
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,800
 But if you get a double tusker, that's 14 years worth

1002
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,600
 of accumulated money.

1003
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,040
 So that's how they calculate what's worth more.

1004
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,400
 I was looking at language as well.

1005
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,440
 And so fun words that exist in other languages

1006
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,680
 that we didn't have words for in English.

1007
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,040
 I think we should.

1008
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,480
 So I think my favorites are-- which one?

1009
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,640
 "Jayus" or "Jayus" in Indonesian is a joke so unfunny

1010
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,600
 that you have to laugh at it, which is weird with that, yeah.

1011
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,960
 That's my next edit and brush out title.

1012
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,400
 If anyone wants to come along.

1013
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,480
 "Mangata" in Sweden literally means "Moon Street."

1014
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,480
 So it's guessable, actually.

1015
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,400
 But it's the-- do you know what it is?

1016
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,680
 No.

1017
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,800
 It's the-- so when the moon's reflecting over a lake,

1018
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,200
 it's the reflection of the moon.

1019
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,000
 It looks like a road.

1020
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,400
 And then "Sobre Mesa" in Spanish

1021
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,600
 is the time spent in conversation after a meal.

1022
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,880
 And it literally means over the table.

1023
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,960
 But I really like that because that turns it into an activity

1024
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,520
 that's then justified in spending six hours doing, right?

1025
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,320
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,760
 "Sobre Mesa"-- post-burning or washing up, basically.

1027
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,400
 [LAUGHTER]

1028
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,200
 No.

1029
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,480
 The word-- this is a great-- it's a Swiss word.

1030
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,080
 And it's "Altos on Tinta Lassena Versicharung."

1031
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,800
 And it's the Swiss word for a pension.

1032
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,040
 And they just say "ahv."

1033
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:25,040
 But what it means is old age and survivors insurance.

1034
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,480
 [LAUGHTER]

1035
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,040
 How cool is that?

1036
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,720
 OK, just one more thing about Senegal,

1037
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,840
 because that was--

1038
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,880
 Yeah, the original fact.

1039
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,400
 The original fact.

1040
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
 All the way back was about Senegal.

1041
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,960
 The main language in Senegal is "Woloff."

1042
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,120
 And the "Woloff" language doesn't really have words

1043
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,960
 for colors.

1044
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,200
 It does have them, but they don't use them.

1045
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,760
 So they don't have the word for blue and orange

1046
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,080
 and red.

1047
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,360
 They use the French.

1048
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,200
 But they do have lots of words for shades of gray.

1049
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,080
 Loads and loads and loads.

1050
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,880
 No, really.

1051
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
 How many?

1052
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,440
 [LAUGHTER]

1053
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,040
 We don't know.

1054
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,040
 I don't know.

1055
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,720
 The reason they have so many shades of gray

1056
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,200
 is because of their cast system.

1057
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:04,000
 Because the shade of your skin matters so much to them

1058
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,200
 that the different shades between black and white

1059
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,040
 are really, really important to you.

1060
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,880
 And that's why they have so many shades of gray.

1061
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,000
 And the good thing about it is if you're a person

1062
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,160
 who does a lot of art with pencils, especially in Africa,

1063
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,200
 they use all these different shades of gray

1064
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,160
 when you're deciding how much you shade things in.

1065
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,520
 So they are actually useful as well as--

1066
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
 as well as a bit racist.

1067
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,520
 Yeah.

1068
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,480
 [LAUGHTER]

1069
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,400
 I'm so excited that you've mentioned "Wall-Off"

1070
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,240
 because when I was reading about jazz,

1071
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:32,880
 it's in the "Wall-Off" language that they think the word "hip"

1072
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,800
 comes from.

1073
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,880
 And it's a word in the "Wall-Off" language

1074
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,720
 called "Hepicat."

1075
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,120
 And obviously so it's like a black culture thing jazz.

1076
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,800
 And so they think "hip" comes from "Hepicat."

1077
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,200
 And then a bunch of other etymologists

1078
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,280
 think that that's rubbish.

1079
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,640
 And that's just sort of post-talk rationalization.

1080
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,440
 And they say there's no actual evidence

1081
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,760
 that it comes from "Hepicat."

1082
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,720
 And so apparently, among etymologists,

1083
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,200
 instead of saying "to cry wolf," you say, "to cry wall-off."

1084
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,880
 And this is etymologist banter.

1085
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:58,720
 [LAUGHTER]

1086
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,960
 To cry wall-off.

1087
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,880
 Start using it, guys.

1088
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,240
 OK.

1089
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:05,760
 That's it.

1090
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,200
 That's all our facts.

1091
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,840
