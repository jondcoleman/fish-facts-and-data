1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 *sigh*

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,800
 *laughs*

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,360
 *whistling*

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,880
 (in foreign language)

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,520
 (in foreign language)

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,600
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,560
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,080
 Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,460
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,520
 My fact is that the world record for the longest time spent holding one's breath is exactly

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
 the same length as this podcast episode.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,160
 Wow.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,800
 How left can we possibly know how long this episode is going to be?

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 I have my magic powers and knowledge that you're a good editor have told me.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,280
 So tell me how long do we have to edit two?

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,880
 So you have to edit to 24 minutes and three seconds, is that okay?

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,040
 And this is a record that was set by Alex Segura in 2016 and he's a champion in the sport

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,280
 of static apnea.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,960
 I can't believe it's a sport.

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 It's a sport.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
 It's a sport.

23
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,280
 It's the sport of lying face down in a swimming pool and holding your breath while remaining

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,280
 still.

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,200
 I can get on board with for the Olympics.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,640
 We should say that this record that he broke is looked down upon by some static apneasts,

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,120
 including himself actually, because this one involved him inhaling pure oxygen.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,520
 That means you can hold your breath for much, much longer.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,840
 So that doubles the volume of oxygen that you can store in your lungs.

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,760
 So you breathe oxygen for something like 30 minutes before you go for the record attempt?

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
 Yes.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,340
 So 24 minutes, that's the length of a sitcom episode if you were watching an American sitcom

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
 without adverts.

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
 Well, is it though?

35
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:52,340
 Yeah.

36
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,700
 Well, not the new Netflix series style sitcoms, but if you go classic Seinfeld or Friends

37
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,700
 episode.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
 Specifically Seinfeld.

39
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,100
 Seinfeld is getting shorter.

40
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,100
 What?

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:08,300
 So the TBS have been caught broadcasting episodes of Seinfeld in fast forward, 9% faster than

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,300
 the original record.

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,300
 So does he sound like a chipmunk?

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,940
 No, weirdly he doesn't, because you can get away with maybe up to about 15% without really

45
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
 noticing it.

46
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,860
 But if you put them side by side, obviously, you notice, but who does that?

47
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,540
 Was Alfred and the chipmunks originally like four hours long, which I'll tell you?

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,580
 I was sort of still on while.

49
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
 That is amazing.

50
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,580
 So you lose what?

51
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
 Six minutes an hour?

52
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
 Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
 Exactly.

54
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,780
 So you get an extra minute or so of adverts for each episode?

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,100
 On sitcoms, do you know that the world's first sitcom, No Episodes Survive of it?

56
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
 This is just a kind of, I've only mentioned this because it's the kind of thing that makes

57
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:46,900
 Alex really angry, but it was on the BBC and it was broadcast from 1946 to '47, it was

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,980
 called 'Pinwrights Progress', and I was just really excited to see it because it stars

59
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,620
 someone called James Hater, who played Friar Tuck in a Robin Hood film that I swear no one

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,300
 else on Earth has ever seen except me, and I recognised him.

61
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,380
 Oh, I thought it was because you're a James Hater.

62
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,500
 And that subconsciously, I think, was the reason that I pursued this fact further.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,820
 There was a footballer called James Hater, and my brother used to always like him because

64
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,580
 my brother's also a James Hater.

65
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,220
 There's, we've got a big club, but yeah, they've lost all the episodes.

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,620
 James Hater was also, by the way, the original voice of Mr. Kippling makes exceedingly good

67
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,620
 cakes.

68
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
 That's very cool.

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:26,100
 The thing I love about this breathing thing is, people who do it without oxygen have gone

70
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,860
 for about half as long as Alex Segura, but whoever does it, if you really push yourself

71
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,100
 to the limit, when you come up, would you have thought you'd breathe in or out?

72
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
 You always breathe out.

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,500
 You always breathe out, right?

74
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,140
 Despite where there's no oxygen now, what do you do?

75
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,140
 No, because you're well.

76
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,220
 Well, so we always breathe out, right?

77
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,900
 Because when you suddenly start getting out of breath underwater, it's because your body

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,100
 has this automatic response to having too much buildup of carbon dioxide, which is an emergency

79
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,060
 response, which says, "Get up, get up, breathe, breathe, breathe," because if you've got too

80
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,900
 much carbon dioxide, it knows you're going to run out of oxygen.

81
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,620
 But all these champion static atmonists have learned to totally override that response.

82
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,540
 So they go underwater, they hold their breaths, and the oxygen just gets absorbed and absorbed

83
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
 and absorbed.

84
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,420
 So by the time they come up, they need to breathe in straight away.

85
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,980
 So that's how you spot the difference between an expert and an amateur.

86
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,260
 We breathe out and they breathe in.

87
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,580
 I suppose the other way of spotting an amateur versus expert is the expert comes up 24 minutes

88
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,580
 later.

89
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:27,380
 I was reading that insects often hold their breath, and they do it for hours and even days

90
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,380
 at a time.

91
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,460
 And the reason is, is that too much air would actually kill them, so they're actually stopping

92
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:36,780
 air from coming in to save their lives, because too much of it damages their tissues.

93
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,700
 So it's simply a process of stopping.

94
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,220
 So too much oxygen damages them?

95
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
 Yeah.

96
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
 Exactly.

97
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,220
 Sometimes.

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,220
 Sometimes do they like rust?

99
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,220
 Yes.

100
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,220
 That's why they're all a bit brown.

101
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,220
 Is that what I'm saying?

102
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
 Yeah.

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
 They're all rusty.

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
 They're all just rusty.

105
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,220
 Yeah.

106
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,180
 But yeah, if you see an insect, it's most likely holding its breath.

107
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
 That's so cool.

108
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,860
 I was reading a 2016 Savage University study about sighing, and sighing is really interesting,

109
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,140
 so sighing is basically just a breathing in, and they're breathing in again instead

110
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,140
 of breathing out.

111
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,140
 You're just taking in twice as much air, and the reason you do it, or one of the reasons

112
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,860
 you do it, is to inflate the alveoli more than it usually gets, because your alveoli always

113
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,860
 sort of collapsing.

114
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:16,860
 Yeah.

115
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,100
 The alveoli, the tiny little sacks on the edge of your lungs that absorb the oxygen into

116
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
 the rest of your body, aren't they?

117
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
 Yeah.

118
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,740
 Lots of different alveoli edges collapsing on their own.

119
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,500
 And so they periodically need to just be reinflated with a massive amount of air in your

120
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 lungs, and that's what's sighing.

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
 Really?

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,460
 I always thought I sighed, because I was really fed up with the 29th pun in a row that

123
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,460
 James had told.

124
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,340
 And it's actually just all about my alveoli.

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,980
 I always thought James had to go back to your club.

126
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,260
 And what's really interesting is that when they originally built iron lungs, which are the

127
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,020
 coffin, like, things that you put people in when they're having breathing difficulties,

128
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,540
 and it's basically a pressure chamber that forces people to breathe from the outside,

129
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,460
 the mechanism didn't account for sighing, as in the iron lung didn't sigh, it only did

130
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,500
 normal breathing in and out, and people kept dying.

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,260
 And this is when they realized this is what it counted for it, because they're

132
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
 loving themselves to death.

133
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,740
 No, they didn't sigh themselves to death, because they weren't sighing, because the iron

134
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,260
 lung was only doing normal breathing for them, and it wasn't doing some sort of sigh.

135
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
 Wait, so if we didn't sigh, we'd die.

136
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,260
 If you don't sigh, you'd die.

137
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,260
 Yeah.

138
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,260
 That should be on signs everywhere.

139
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
 Just in case.

140
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,260
 It is a subconscious reflex, man.

141
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
 You don't usually do other signs, though.

142
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,260
 I don't have signs everywhere.

143
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
 Don't forget to breathe it.

144
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,260
 Keep blinking.

145
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:28,260
 No, as I need these things.

146
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:41,820
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

147
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:47,020
 My fact this week is that Nicola Tesla was one of the guests at the first ever party with

148
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,540
 a stripper jumping out of a cake.

149
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,540
 Amazing.

150
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,540
 Incredible.

151
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
 It's a really cool party.

152
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
 What was he doing there?

153
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,300
 Well, he was just one of several quite prominent guests.

154
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,900
 This was a party thrown by a guy called Stanford White, who was a member of the New York

155
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,540
 Elite at the end of the 19th century, a really interesting character himself, actually.

156
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,460
 Controversial character as well.

157
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,100
 So he threw all sorts of exciting dinner parties and drinks parties like this, and this one

158
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:22,580
 was on May the 20th, 1895, and one of the attractors of this party was a scantily-clad

159
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,700
 girl called Susie Johnson, and we actually know her name, emerging from a pie made from galvanised

160
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,140
 iron accompanied by a recitation of singer-song of six-pins.

161
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
 Yeah.

162
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,140
 Well, plus birds, right?

163
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,140
 I think birds flew out along with her, didn't they?

164
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
 I think more than sense.

165
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,140
 The birds that came out were canaries, and in the movie of this, which I watched the other

166
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,060
 night for research purposes, is called The Girl and the Velvet Swing, starring John Collins

167
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,220
 as the character who is basically Susie Johnson.

168
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,340
 The guy comes in and he's like, "Oh, sorry, I couldn't find any black birds, but I've got

169
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,340
 canaries."

170
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,340
 Oh, really?

171
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
 The girl?

172
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,340
 Was it also like, "I couldn't find a velvet swing, but I've got a cast iron cake."

173
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,540
 Well, we'll probably get to this in a bit, right?

174
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,660
 I was just saying it was like sexy, like singer-song of six-pins, because I can't work

175
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
 at how you think of that.

176
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:10,980
 To be honest, the bit with the pie, I kind of left the room and went to my kitchen to

177
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,940
 get a drink, and when I came back, I think I missed the pie, but the rest of it is all

178
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,020
 about this guy, Stanford White, who, like, Dan's about say, is very controversial.

179
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
 Yeah.

180
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
 Very controversial.

181
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,380
 The reason for the title of The Velvet Swing is to do with his controversiality.

182
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:31,820
 He used to like to sneak girls back to a house of his in Manhattan, and no good way of

183
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
 saying it.

184
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
 Drug and rape them.

185
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:39,500
 That was his very bad human, and the girl on The Velvet Swing refers to a girl who he

186
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,220
 did this to when she was age 16.

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,580
 Yes, because her husband, who I think his name was Thor, or something like that, not

188
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,420
 Thor as in The Norse Guard Thor, as in what happens to snow when it's warm.

189
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
 He then shot...

190
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,420
 That's a bit very confused in the cinema.

191
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,300
 I saw a very boring film that I was in the woods.

192
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,580
 The Marvel movie where it's just snow melting.

193
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,500
 He was at a theatre performance of Man was L Champagne's "I Could Love A Million Girls",

194
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
 and then Thor came over and shot Stanford White in the face.

195
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,620
 Yeah, and this was about 1905, wasn't it?

196
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,620
 That's right.

197
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,140
 But this is why this whole jumping out of cake thing became well-known, because in the

198
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,700
 court case, everyone suddenly read about this amazing cake woman party, and then I guess

199
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
 it became a thing.

200
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,340
 Imagine that's a bit of your obituary that sticks out, so you've just been murdered by

201
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,980
 a millionaire in a public space, and then everyone goes, "Hey, what's this cake bit?"

202
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
 That sounds pretty cool.

203
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,020
 He made history in the sort of industry of raunchy parties.

204
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,060
 Yeah, he's done the world of service in his murder.

205
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,260
 But he did the world of disservice because there were more repercussions afterwards, so

206
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,940
 the whole thing was covered by a journalist called Meryl Goddard.

207
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,380
 And then Meryl Goddard was so good at covering this case that Randolph Hearst, who was a newspaper

208
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,820
 proprietor, decided to take her for his newspaper.

209
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:02,020
 She was working with Pulitzer, and then Hearst and Pulitzer had a massive competition against

210
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,380
 each other for who could get the most readers for their newspaper.

211
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,820
 And that turned into sensational journalism, and that's why we have red top journalists

212
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,820
 in today.

213
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
 Wow.

214
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,780
 So, your fact says she jumped out of a cake, there's a pie.

215
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
 Sorry.

216
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
 When did it become cake?

217
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
 It was a pie.

218
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,260
 I mean, that was like a crusted top pie.

219
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
 In the movie, it looks like one of those.

220
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,940
 You know where it's got criss-cross of pastry on the top of it, but that might just be for

221
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,940
 the movies.

222
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:34,100
 I guess it makes sense that what traditionally there's like in banquets and stuff in sort

223
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,700
 of medieval times, you've got very elaborate pies and things come out of pies, and then

224
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,620
 it becomes more of a tradition to do things at parties.

225
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,620
 We now have cakes, so they just said, "Well, why don't we have people jumping out of cakes?"

226
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,780
 This is a bit weird to have a pie, like a birthday party, but I guess cakes are more practical

227
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,180
 to jump out of and to hide and hide in, really, because it can be taller.

228
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
 You can have a tall pie.

229
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,180
 Yeah.

230
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
 I don't think so.

231
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
 I think they can just go as high as you want.

232
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,500
 I'd be suspicious if I saw a really tall pie, like there's a person in there, whereas

233
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
 you can have a big cake.

234
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
 Why do you just have no idea this person?

235
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
 Hang on, hang on.

236
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
 You can feel like it's a huge cake.

237
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,820
 If you saw a giant cake coming, you would suspend suspicion that there's a human in

238
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,260
 there and think this is probably all cake.

239
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,980
 It could be, it could be, it could be, it could be cake.

240
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,020
 Can I give my favourite jumping out of a pie incident?

241
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,020
 Yes, please.

242
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,260
 So this was one of the earliest ones I think it was in 1454, and it was when things being

243
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,660
 hidden in pies was used as a rallying cry of the Christians against the Ottomans.

244
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,180
 So this was kind of during the era of the Crusades.

245
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,460
 It was King Philip, who through this really, really elaborate banquet was sort of jousting

246
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,740
 and these amazing table decorations that we've talked about before, and then he led everyone

247
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,900
 into this really long table, and on the table he had this giant pie, and the pie opened

248
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,660
 up mechanically to reveal 28 playing musicians, so an orchestra of 28 people who leapt out

249
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,660
 of the pie and played.

250
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,860
 Do you think if you saw a cake that size, you'd think just a normal cake?

251
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,100
 Well, if it had music coming out of it, I'd be like, there's something else going on.

252
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,620
 Maybe you're not people inside, but you know.

253
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,380
 We don't know what song they played.

254
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
 We don't know what song they played.

255
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,500
 Although we do know at that same party, there was a statue of a beautiful woman who had

256
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,980
 wine springing from her breast that people could drink from.

257
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,020
 At this party, Stavford White's party, he was serving wine, but he had a blonde waitress

258
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,660
 who only served white wine and a brunette who only served red wine.

259
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,660
 Really?

260
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,660
 That's quite nice.

261
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,980
 It's like having a lid to match the bottle kind of thing.

262
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,460
 I know what you're saying, but then on the other hand, it's not very well, is it?

263
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,260
 It's slightly objectifying these women.

264
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
 I'll give you that.

265
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
 That's what we've established.

266
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,500
 This guy doesn't have the best track record with, with, with, with, Suzy Johnson.

267
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,620
 The lady who jumped out of the pie cake.

268
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,340
 She don't know what happened to her.

269
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,820
 She's another mystery in the whole story.

270
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
 She disappeared.

271
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,060
 People tried to track her down.

272
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,380
 Because she became, as you say, we know her name.

273
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,380
 Did they just check every cake?

274
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
 She's not in this one.

275
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,900
 It's the Mr. Kippling Factory, not in this one.

276
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:46,460
 Multiple weddings ruined once again.

277
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,820
 The cake police swoop in.

278
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:59,580
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

279
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:05,100
 My fact this week is that when in London, Queen Louise of Sweden always carried a card saying,

280
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,180
 "I am the queen of Sweden in case she was hit by a bus."

281
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,660
 It's cocky.

282
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
 Yeah.

283
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,980
 Well, she used to travel around London as it were in disguise.

284
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,380
 She didn't go around with a non-terrah.

285
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,900
 She loved shopping, and so she would just go on her own.

286
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,220
 And one time she was almost hit by a bus.

287
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,900
 As a result, she decided, God, if I was hit by this bus, how would people know who I was?

288
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,740
 I don't know, I carry a card inside my handbag that says, "I am the queen of Sweden."

289
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,380
 And then they'll be like, "We know who she is."

290
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,340
 And then the people who found her, rather than going, "I guess we'll just leave her there.

291
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,340
 We don't really care."

292
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,340
 We'll go, "Oh, hang on.

293
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,340
 She's the queen.

294
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,100
 We'd better sort out this car accident situation."

295
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,620
 Also, it's a really weird reaction to having her about to hit by a bus.

296
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,140
 The normal reaction is, "Wow, I should be more careful across on the road."

297
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,380
 When that inevitably happens again, I better make sure I'm properly labored.

298
00:13:48,380 --> 00:14:03,060
 "Oh, you're the only one that I know of who's a tone, almost, been hit by a bus. How did you react?"

299
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,300
 He shouted at the bus.

300
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
 "What did you shout?"

301
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
 "Go back to bus school."

302
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
 This is one of the greatest anecdotes of QI history.

303
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,300
 It comes up basically every week in shock.

304
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
 "I'll come back to bus school."

305
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
 It's the greatest line ever.

306
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
 Would you keep that card in your handbag?

307
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,100
 Just hand it out to the bus driver.

308
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,180
 Wouldn't have been amazing though, if whenever you called 999, if you find someone unconscious

309
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:24,420
 on the floor, you call 999 and they say, "Okay, so first things first, have you looked

310
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,780
 at their handbag and have you checked their business cards?

311
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,780
 Is it the Queen of Sweden?

312
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,780
 Okay."

313
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,020
 "This has happened before."

314
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,180
 She was really great that Queen Louise have seen this actually.

315
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,460
 In her first passport, it had a thing called special peculiarities where you put things

316
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,540
 about your face, if you have a scar or whatever, and she wrote, "Walks like a parrot."

317
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,220
 "Prinely."

318
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,620
 She's just to put her into a bit of context.

319
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,300
 She is the auntie of Prince Philip.

320
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
 Yes.

321
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,820
 She was the mountain-battern family.

322
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,340
 Formerly, Battenburgs wasn't she.

323
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,340
 That's right.

324
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
 Battenburgs who hurriedly changed their name to mountain-battern when the Germans became

325
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,340
 the bad guys.

326
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,340
 Yeah.

327
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
 Yeah.

328
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,740
 And she was the great granddaughter of Queen Victoria, I think.

329
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
 Yes.

330
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,900
 But all the European royal families are all just related to each other, aren't they?

331
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
 They are.

332
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
 Really?

333
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,740
 Not two, because all of the royal families are all related to each other, but then they

334
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,220
 were in all in countries that were all fighting against each other.

335
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,020
 She works as a messenger, kind of, giving messages between all of her family who weren't

336
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
 allowed to talk to each other.

337
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,340
 Not a spy.

338
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,020
 I suppose you could call it a spy, couldn't you?

339
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:30,060
 I mean, it's pretty much basically a double agent, but I think she was doing it quite

340
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
 explicitly and not...

341
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,100
 I'm not saying on a bench, handing over a message and they're like, "I am the Queen of

342
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
 Sweden.

343
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
 What does this mean?"

344
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,100
 "Oh, sorry.

345
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,940
 I'm presumably it was more like Bobby just had a baby rather than the Nazis around their

346
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
 way across the channel."

347
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
 Yeah.

348
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,500
 And the Swedish royal family is quite interesting, though, and the modern Swedish royal family

349
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
 is as well.

350
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:53,260
 So there's Karl XVI who's King now, who I don't think we've ever said on the podcast, is

351
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,380
 the 10th King, Karl of Sweden.

352
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,140
 Who did they miss out?

353
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,460
 They added lots.

354
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,740
 It goes back to the 15th century when a guy called Johann Magnus wrote this sort of fanciful

355
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,860
 history of all the Swedish kings, and he just added a whole bunch of kings.

356
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,580
 So he made up six erics and six calls, and they've kept that numerical system ever since.

357
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,980
 But why were they referring to this fictional account as history?

358
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
 Because it really is.

359
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,620
 Because it became really popular as a bit like the Saga's, you know, became a thing that

360
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
 was always read.

361
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,620
 But I think it's like we have King Arthur for instance.

362
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
 King Arthur.

363
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,420
 And so if we were to have a new King Arthur, we would probably call him Arthur the Second,

364
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,420
 wouldn't we?

365
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,420
 Oh, I'd love to see.

366
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,660
 And if Prince Harry became King, he would be Henry the Ninth.

367
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,260
 He'd be our first Henry since the dreaded Henry the Eight.

368
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,620
 If he kept the name right, although sometimes you take on a different name when you become

369
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,620
 royal.

370
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
 Because Prince Charles will.

371
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
 Yes.

372
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,620
 We think.

373
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,620
 Become Henry.

374
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,620
 He won't become Charles.

375
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,620
 No, we were discussing this.

376
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,620
 We were.

377
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,460
 We had a party last week at my place, which you were advised to, but you didn't come.

378
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,100
 And it was so exciting that we started talking about the regular numbers of the King's

379
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 and Queen's England.

380
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 I'm so sorry.

381
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,100
 I couldn't make it.

382
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,100
 He's going to be great.

383
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
 He's going to be great.

384
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
 He's going to be great.

385
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
 Edward the Ninth, I think we found.

386
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
 That was what you thought that was.

387
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
 That's what the book he's reckon.

388
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
 Is it?

389
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
 I think so.

390
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,500
 The main fact itself, I've read this in a few places, found a few sources, but nothing that

391
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,220
 I would say is concrete enough that I truly, I want to see the card.

392
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,180
 And if anyone knows if the card exists.

393
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,980
 So the source for this, the original source was Queen Louise's niece Dollar, who was the

394
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,980
 Margraveen of Baden.

395
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,980
 I don't know what that means.

396
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,340
 But anyway, it was a relative who first said this.

397
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
 Yeah.

398
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
 Okay.

399
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
 There's a good source.

400
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
 Thank you.

401
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
 Thank you all for helping me out.

402
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:42,460
 It's been reset.

403
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,460
 Okay.

404
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,100
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

405
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,100
 And that is James.

406
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,100
 Okay.

407
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:52,900
 My fact this week is that last year in the UK, two eight-year-olds were caught speeding.

408
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,780
 This came from a freedom of information question that was posed to the driver and vehicle licensing

409
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
 agency.

410
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,100
 They asked for all of the different statistics and they also found out that 900 people in their

411
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,700
 90s got penalty points for speeding last year, including three people aged 99.

412
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,420
 Although I reckon 99.

413
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,780
 That's the oldest, but it's quite coincidence that it's 99 and not 100 and something.

414
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,980
 So I reckon anyone that's over 99, they just put 99, maybe there's only two spaces in

415
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,980
 the farm.

416
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
 Oh yeah.

417
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
 I reckon.

418
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,540
 Or you just don't find someone who's 100 or more for speeding.

419
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,540
 No.

420
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,540
 I don't fare enough, mate.

421
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,260
 On further, you docked the 99-year-old though.

422
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,260
 Well, you know.

423
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,780
 One more year in your home.

424
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,220
 Yeah, you've got to hang on to your 100th birthday.

425
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,620
 That's like saying on further, you won't let the 15-year-olds smoke when the 16-year-olds

426
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
 allowed to.

427
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,060
 I mean, you've got to draw the line somewhere, haven't you?

428
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,060
 Okay, sure.

429
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,060
 That's a line.

430
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,060
 That's a line.

431
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,900
 Sorry, I also think the smoking age might have gone up since I was a smoker.

432
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,260
 So 16-year-olds, if it's illegal, just check.

433
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,820
 Or, you know, whatever, don't smoke, consider that.

434
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:03,420
 There have been quite a lot of weird speeding fines and driving fines this year, so there

435
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,220
 have been two instances of people getting caught driving to the hospital because their wives

436
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,460
 were in labour and getting stopped for speeding.

437
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,700
 And so one was in the UK going at 101 miles an hour, and then there was another guy in

438
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,620
 the US who missed the birth of his child because he was taken to a cell.

439
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,620
 Oh, no.

440
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
 Yeah.

441
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
 Oh, that's hard.

442
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
 Wow.

443
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

444
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
 Yeah.

445
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,620
 I don't think so.

446
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
 Yeah.

447
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

448
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

449
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

450
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

451
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

452
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

453
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,620
 Yeah, it's really rough, isn't it?

454
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

455
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

456
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

457
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

458
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

459
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

460
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

461
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

462
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:40,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

463
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

464
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

465
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:49,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

466
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

467
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

468
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

469
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

470
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

471
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

472
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

473
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

474
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

475
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

476
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:00,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

477
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

478
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

479
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

480
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

481
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

482
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

483
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

484
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

485
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
 Wow, that's good.

486
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,620
 I really hope he did the names Bond James Bond.

487
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
 But I'm going to show you your license.

488
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,620
 Two kills.

489
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,620
 And any actual license.

490
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,620
 We have in our book, we've got a similar sort of story.

491
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,620
 What book's that done?

492
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,620
 It's called The Book of the Year 2018.

493
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,620
 You're a definitive guide to the world's weirdest news.

494
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,620
 Do you know when it comes out?

495
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,620
 Yeah, October the 18th.

496
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,620
 Okay, where's it available?

497
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
 It's going to be in bookshops.

498
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
 It's going to be online.

499
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,620
 Yeah, it's...

500
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
 And at least not here, we can say Amazon.

501
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
 Amazon, it's going to be on Amazon.

502
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
 Yes, this is the first time I've heard of it.

503
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,620
 Remember we found that thing of the guy who was done for drink driving?

504
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,620
 But it's claimed that he wasn't drink driving,

505
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,620
 because he was only drinking every time he got to a traffic stop site.

506
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,620
 So it stopped ever swig.

507
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
 Are they going to go?

508
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,620
 We're going to go.

509
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
 This is...

510
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,620
 Sorry, go on.

511
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
 No, you can if I was just sighing.

512
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
 I just want to stay alive.

513
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,620
 Did you know the first person to pass a driving test was called Mr. Beer?

514
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
 No, I didn't know that.

515
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,620
 So in 1935, he paid 37.5P, just found that out.

516
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,620
 And also found out this weird thing that driving tests were suspended in the second world war, which makes sense.

517
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,620
 And they were suspended again during the Suez crisis, which is quite weird.

518
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,620
 And especially given that during the Suez crisis, learners were allowed to drive on a company.

519
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,620
 And then...

520
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,620
 And I think I don't know about Suez crisis, but it's definitely true of the second world war,

521
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,620
 that if you learn to drive during the war, they just gave you a license.

522
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
 You didn't need to take a test at all.

523
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:36,620
 Oh, just because you've been through the war and how to drive.

524
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,620
 If you could drive enough to defeat the Nazis, then you could drive enough to go to the shop.

525
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,620
 If you can drive a tank through a minefield and not get blown up, I think you can manage the M25.

526
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,620
 Speaking of tanks, I read this yesterday.

527
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,620
 So you're allowed to drive a tank on the road in the UK.

528
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,620
 You need a special license.

529
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,620
 But if you could get a provisional license, which is really easy, a provisional tank license,

530
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,620
 then as long as there's someone sat next to you who can drive a tank, then you can drive a tank

531
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,620
 through the streets of the UK at any time.

532
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,620
 But you need to have learner plates on the tank.

533
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
 But you will be at the school.

534
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,620
 I knew that because the QIs production coordinator was telling me a great story about how she had to get James Blunt

535
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,620
 to drive a tank through the BBC.

536
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,620
 That was...

537
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,620
 Because he was an army guy, so he knows how to drive a tank.

538
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,620
 But where do you get a tank?

539
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,620
 This still feels like the main stomping block.

540
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,620
 Yeah, she just knew a guy.

541
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,620
 Who's your buddy?

542
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,620
 You've met Ed once, we met him outside Bergershire.

543
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
 Oh, you have a tank?

544
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
 Yes.

545
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,620
 It's a superior.

546
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,620
 He's just trying to find someone to park.

547
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,620
 He used to have it parked outside Ash Gardner of Empress's house.

548
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
 They were neighbours and outside was his tank.

549
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,620
 We used to go and sit inside it.

550
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,620
 He made it into this really nice sort of, you know, where you have Netflix nights.

551
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,620
 Oh, it was a hipster tank.

552
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,620
 It was a long time.

553
00:22:56,620 --> 00:23:04,620
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

554
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,620
