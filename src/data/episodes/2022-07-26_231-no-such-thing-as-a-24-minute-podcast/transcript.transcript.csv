00:00:08,00:00:17,(in foreign language)
00:00:17,00:00:23,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming"
00:00:23,00:00:26,to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:26,00:00:31,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James"
00:00:31,00:00:36,Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts
00:00:36,00:00:42,"from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski."
00:00:42,00:00:47,My fact is that the world record for the longest time spent holding one's breath is exactly
00:00:47,00:00:50,the same length as this podcast episode.
00:00:50,00:00:51,Wow.
00:00:51,00:00:53,How left can we possibly know how long this episode is going to be?
00:00:53,00:00:58,I have my magic powers and knowledge that you're a good editor have told me.
00:00:58,00:01:01,So tell me how long do we have to edit two?
00:01:01,00:01:05,"So you have to edit to 24 minutes and three seconds, is that okay?"
00:01:05,00:01:11,And this is a record that was set by Alex Segura in 2016 and he's a champion in the sport
00:01:11,00:01:12,of static apnea.
00:01:12,00:01:13,I can't believe it's a sport.
00:01:13,00:01:14,It's a sport.
00:01:14,00:01:15,It's a sport.
00:01:15,00:01:20,It's the sport of lying face down in a swimming pool and holding your breath while remaining
00:01:20,00:01:21,still.
00:01:21,00:01:24,I can get on board with for the Olympics.
00:01:24,00:01:29,"We should say that this record that he broke is looked down upon by some static apneasts,"
00:01:29,00:01:34,"including himself actually, because this one involved him inhaling pure oxygen."
00:01:34,00:01:35,"That means you can hold your breath for much, much longer."
00:01:35,00:01:37,So that doubles the volume of oxygen that you can store in your lungs.
00:01:37,00:01:41,So you breathe oxygen for something like 30 minutes before you go for the record attempt?
00:01:41,00:01:42,Yes.
00:01:42,00:01:49,"So 24 minutes, that's the length of a sitcom episode if you were watching an American sitcom"
00:01:49,00:01:50,without adverts.
00:01:50,00:01:51,"Well, is it though?"
00:01:51,00:01:52,Yeah.
00:01:52,00:01:55,"Well, not the new Netflix series style sitcoms, but if you go classic Seinfeld or Friends"
00:01:55,00:01:56,episode.
00:01:56,00:01:57,Specifically Seinfeld.
00:01:57,00:01:59,Seinfeld is getting shorter.
00:01:59,00:02:00,What?
00:02:00,00:02:08,"So the TBS have been caught broadcasting episodes of Seinfeld in fast forward, 9% faster than"
00:02:08,00:02:09,the original record.
00:02:09,00:02:10,So does he sound like a chipmunk?
00:02:10,00:02:15,"No, weirdly he doesn't, because you can get away with maybe up to about 15% without really"
00:02:15,00:02:16,noticing it.
00:02:16,00:02:20,"But if you put them side by side, obviously, you notice, but who does that?"
00:02:20,00:02:24,"Was Alfred and the chipmunks originally like four hours long, which I'll tell you?"
00:02:24,00:02:27,I was sort of still on while.
00:02:27,00:02:28,That is amazing.
00:02:28,00:02:29,So you lose what?
00:02:29,00:02:30,Six minutes an hour?
00:02:30,00:02:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:02:31,00:02:32,Exactly.
00:02:32,00:02:34,So you get an extra minute or so of adverts for each episode?
00:02:34,00:02:39,"On sitcoms, do you know that the world's first sitcom, No Episodes Survive of it?"
00:02:39,00:02:41,"This is just a kind of, I've only mentioned this because it's the kind of thing that makes"
00:02:41,00:02:46,"Alex really angry, but it was on the BBC and it was broadcast from 1946 to '47, it was"
00:02:46,00:02:50,"called 'Pinwrights Progress', and I was just really excited to see it because it stars"
00:02:50,00:02:55,"someone called James Hater, who played Friar Tuck in a Robin Hood film that I swear no one"
00:02:55,00:02:58,"else on Earth has ever seen except me, and I recognised him."
00:02:58,00:03:01,"Oh, I thought it was because you're a James Hater."
00:03:01,00:03:04,"And that subconsciously, I think, was the reason that I pursued this fact further."
00:03:04,00:03:07,"There was a footballer called James Hater, and my brother used to always like him because"
00:03:07,00:03:09,my brother's also a James Hater.
00:03:09,00:03:14,"There's, we've got a big club, but yeah, they've lost all the episodes."
00:03:14,00:03:18,"James Hater was also, by the way, the original voice of Mr. Kippling makes exceedingly good"
00:03:18,00:03:19,cakes.
00:03:19,00:03:20,That's very cool.
00:03:20,00:03:26,"The thing I love about this breathing thing is, people who do it without oxygen have gone"
00:03:26,00:03:31,"for about half as long as Alex Segura, but whoever does it, if you really push yourself"
00:03:31,00:03:35,"to the limit, when you come up, would you have thought you'd breathe in or out?"
00:03:35,00:03:36,You always breathe out.
00:03:36,00:03:37,"You always breathe out, right?"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"Despite where there's no oxygen now, what do you do?"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"No, because you're well."
00:03:41,00:03:45,"Well, so we always breathe out, right?"
00:03:45,00:03:48,"Because when you suddenly start getting out of breath underwater, it's because your body"
00:03:48,00:03:53,"has this automatic response to having too much buildup of carbon dioxide, which is an emergency"
00:03:53,00:03:56,"response, which says, ""Get up, get up, breathe, breathe, breathe,"" because if you've got too"
00:03:56,00:03:58,"much carbon dioxide, it knows you're going to run out of oxygen."
00:03:58,00:04:03,But all these champion static atmonists have learned to totally override that response.
00:04:03,00:04:07,"So they go underwater, they hold their breaths, and the oxygen just gets absorbed and absorbed"
00:04:07,00:04:08,and absorbed.
00:04:08,00:04:11,"So by the time they come up, they need to breathe in straight away."
00:04:11,00:04:13,So that's how you spot the difference between an expert and an amateur.
00:04:13,00:04:15,We breathe out and they breathe in.
00:04:15,00:04:19,I suppose the other way of spotting an amateur versus expert is the expert comes up 24 minutes
00:04:19,00:04:20,later.
00:04:20,00:04:27,"I was reading that insects often hold their breath, and they do it for hours and even days"
00:04:27,00:04:28,at a time.
00:04:28,00:04:32,"And the reason is, is that too much air would actually kill them, so they're actually stopping"
00:04:32,00:04:36,"air from coming in to save their lives, because too much of it damages their tissues."
00:04:36,00:04:38,So it's simply a process of stopping.
00:04:38,00:04:40,So too much oxygen damages them?
00:04:40,00:04:41,Yeah.
00:04:41,00:04:42,Exactly.
00:04:42,00:04:43,Sometimes.
00:04:43,00:04:44,Sometimes do they like rust?
00:04:44,00:04:45,Yes.
00:04:45,00:04:46,That's why they're all a bit brown.
00:04:46,00:04:47,Is that what I'm saying?
00:04:47,00:04:48,Yeah.
00:04:48,00:04:49,They're all rusty.
00:04:49,00:04:50,They're all just rusty.
00:04:50,00:04:51,Yeah.
00:04:51,00:04:54,"But yeah, if you see an insect, it's most likely holding its breath."
00:04:54,00:04:56,That's so cool.
00:04:56,00:05:00,"I was reading a 2016 Savage University study about sighing, and sighing is really interesting,"
00:05:00,00:05:05,"so sighing is basically just a breathing in, and they're breathing in again instead"
00:05:05,00:05:06,of breathing out.
00:05:06,00:05:09,"You're just taking in twice as much air, and the reason you do it, or one of the reasons"
00:05:09,00:05:14,"you do it, is to inflate the alveoli more than it usually gets, because your alveoli always"
00:05:14,00:05:15,sort of collapsing.
00:05:15,00:05:16,Yeah.
00:05:16,00:05:20,"The alveoli, the tiny little sacks on the edge of your lungs that absorb the oxygen into"
00:05:20,00:05:21,"the rest of your body, aren't they?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,Yeah.
00:05:22,00:05:23,Lots of different alveoli edges collapsing on their own.
00:05:23,00:05:27,And so they periodically need to just be reinflated with a massive amount of air in your
00:05:27,00:05:28,"lungs, and that's what's sighing."
00:05:28,00:05:29,Really?
00:05:29,00:05:32,"I always thought I sighed, because I was really fed up with the 29th pun in a row that"
00:05:32,00:05:33,James had told.
00:05:33,00:05:36,And it's actually just all about my alveoli.
00:05:36,00:05:40,I always thought James had to go back to your club.
00:05:40,00:05:44,"And what's really interesting is that when they originally built iron lungs, which are the"
00:05:44,00:05:49,"coffin, like, things that you put people in when they're having breathing difficulties,"
00:05:49,00:05:54,"and it's basically a pressure chamber that forces people to breathe from the outside,"
00:05:54,00:05:58,"the mechanism didn't account for sighing, as in the iron lung didn't sigh, it only did"
00:05:58,00:06:00,"normal breathing in and out, and people kept dying."
00:06:00,00:06:03,"And this is when they realized this is what it counted for it, because they're"
00:06:03,00:06:04,loving themselves to death.
00:06:04,00:06:07,"No, they didn't sigh themselves to death, because they weren't sighing, because the iron"
00:06:07,00:06:11,"lung was only doing normal breathing for them, and it wasn't doing some sort of sigh."
00:06:11,00:06:12,"Wait, so if we didn't sigh, we'd die."
00:06:12,00:06:13,"If you don't sigh, you'd die."
00:06:13,00:06:14,Yeah.
00:06:14,00:06:15,That should be on signs everywhere.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Just in case.
00:06:16,00:06:17,"It is a subconscious reflex, man."
00:06:17,00:06:18,"You don't usually do other signs, though."
00:06:18,00:06:19,I don't have signs everywhere.
00:06:19,00:06:20,Don't forget to breathe it.
00:06:20,00:06:21,Keep blinking.
00:06:21,00:06:28,"No, as I need these things."
00:06:28,00:06:41,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex."
00:06:41,00:06:47,My fact this week is that Nicola Tesla was one of the guests at the first ever party with
00:06:47,00:06:49,a stripper jumping out of a cake.
00:06:49,00:06:50,Amazing.
00:06:50,00:06:51,Incredible.
00:06:51,00:06:52,It's a really cool party.
00:06:52,00:06:53,What was he doing there?
00:06:53,00:06:57,"Well, he was just one of several quite prominent guests."
00:06:57,00:07:01,"This was a party thrown by a guy called Stanford White, who was a member of the New York"
00:07:01,00:07:06,"Elite at the end of the 19th century, a really interesting character himself, actually."
00:07:06,00:07:09,Controversial character as well.
00:07:09,00:07:14,"So he threw all sorts of exciting dinner parties and drinks parties like this, and this one"
00:07:14,00:07:22,"was on May the 20th, 1895, and one of the attractors of this party was a scantily-clad"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"girl called Susie Johnson, and we actually know her name, emerging from a pie made from galvanised"
00:07:27,00:07:31,iron accompanied by a recitation of singer-song of six-pins.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Yeah.
00:07:32,00:07:33,"Well, plus birds, right?"
00:07:33,00:07:35,"I think birds flew out along with her, didn't they?"
00:07:35,00:07:36,I think more than sense.
00:07:36,00:07:42,"The birds that came out were canaries, and in the movie of this, which I watched the other"
00:07:42,00:07:47,"night for research purposes, is called The Girl and the Velvet Swing, starring John Collins"
00:07:47,00:07:50,as the character who is basically Susie Johnson.
00:07:50,00:07:53,"The guy comes in and he's like, ""Oh, sorry, I couldn't find any black birds, but I've got"
00:07:53,00:07:54,"canaries."""
00:07:54,00:07:55,"Oh, really?"
00:07:55,00:07:56,The girl?
00:07:56,00:08:00,"Was it also like, ""I couldn't find a velvet swing, but I've got a cast iron cake."""
00:08:00,00:08:02,"Well, we'll probably get to this in a bit, right?"
00:08:02,00:08:05,"I was just saying it was like sexy, like singer-song of six-pins, because I can't work"
00:08:05,00:08:06,at how you think of that.
00:08:06,00:08:10,"To be honest, the bit with the pie, I kind of left the room and went to my kitchen to"
00:08:10,00:08:14,"get a drink, and when I came back, I think I missed the pie, but the rest of it is all"
00:08:14,00:08:19,"about this guy, Stanford White, who, like, Dan's about say, is very controversial."
00:08:19,00:08:20,Yeah.
00:08:20,00:08:21,Very controversial.
00:08:21,00:08:25,The reason for the title of The Velvet Swing is to do with his controversiality.
00:08:25,00:08:31,"He used to like to sneak girls back to a house of his in Manhattan, and no good way of"
00:08:31,00:08:32,saying it.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Drug and rape them.
00:08:33,00:08:39,"That was his very bad human, and the girl on The Velvet Swing refers to a girl who he"
00:08:39,00:08:41,did this to when she was age 16.
00:08:41,00:08:46,"Yes, because her husband, who I think his name was Thor, or something like that, not"
00:08:46,00:08:51,"Thor as in The Norse Guard Thor, as in what happens to snow when it's warm."
00:08:51,00:08:52,He then shot...
00:08:52,00:08:53,That's a bit very confused in the cinema.
00:08:53,00:08:56,I saw a very boring film that I was in the woods.
00:08:56,00:09:00,The Marvel movie where it's just snow melting.
00:09:00,00:09:06,"He was at a theatre performance of Man was L Champagne's ""I Could Love A Million Girls"","
00:09:06,00:09:09,and then Thor came over and shot Stanford White in the face.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"Yeah, and this was about 1905, wasn't it?"
00:09:11,00:09:12,That's right.
00:09:12,00:09:16,"But this is why this whole jumping out of cake thing became well-known, because in the"
00:09:16,00:09:21,"court case, everyone suddenly read about this amazing cake woman party, and then I guess"
00:09:21,00:09:22,it became a thing.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"Imagine that's a bit of your obituary that sticks out, so you've just been murdered by"
00:09:26,00:09:31,"a millionaire in a public space, and then everyone goes, ""Hey, what's this cake bit?"""
00:09:31,00:09:33,That sounds pretty cool.
00:09:33,00:09:38,He made history in the sort of industry of raunchy parties.
00:09:38,00:09:41,"Yeah, he's done the world of service in his murder."
00:09:41,00:09:45,"But he did the world of disservice because there were more repercussions afterwards, so"
00:09:45,00:09:48,the whole thing was covered by a journalist called Meryl Goddard.
00:09:48,00:09:54,"And then Meryl Goddard was so good at covering this case that Randolph Hearst, who was a newspaper"
00:09:54,00:09:57,"proprietor, decided to take her for his newspaper."
00:09:57,00:10:02,"She was working with Pulitzer, and then Hearst and Pulitzer had a massive competition against"
00:10:02,00:10:05,each other for who could get the most readers for their newspaper.
00:10:05,00:10:08,"And that turned into sensational journalism, and that's why we have red top journalists"
00:10:08,00:10:09,in today.
00:10:09,00:10:10,Wow.
00:10:10,00:10:15,"So, your fact says she jumped out of a cake, there's a pie."
00:10:15,00:10:16,Sorry.
00:10:16,00:10:17,When did it become cake?
00:10:17,00:10:18,It was a pie.
00:10:18,00:10:21,"I mean, that was like a crusted top pie."
00:10:21,00:10:23,"In the movie, it looks like one of those."
00:10:23,00:10:26,"You know where it's got criss-cross of pastry on the top of it, but that might just be for"
00:10:26,00:10:27,the movies.
00:10:27,00:10:34,I guess it makes sense that what traditionally there's like in banquets and stuff in sort
00:10:34,00:10:37,"of medieval times, you've got very elaborate pies and things come out of pies, and then"
00:10:37,00:10:39,it becomes more of a tradition to do things at parties.
00:10:39,00:10:43,"We now have cakes, so they just said, ""Well, why don't we have people jumping out of cakes?"""
00:10:43,00:10:47,"This is a bit weird to have a pie, like a birthday party, but I guess cakes are more practical"
00:10:47,00:10:51,"to jump out of and to hide and hide in, really, because it can be taller."
00:10:51,00:10:52,You can have a tall pie.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:54,I don't think so.
00:10:54,00:10:55,I think they can just go as high as you want.
00:10:55,00:10:57,"I'd be suspicious if I saw a really tall pie, like there's a person in there, whereas"
00:10:57,00:10:58,you can have a big cake.
00:10:58,00:10:59,Why do you just have no idea this person?
00:10:59,00:11:00,"Hang on, hang on."
00:11:00,00:11:01,You can feel like it's a huge cake.
00:11:01,00:11:05,"If you saw a giant cake coming, you would suspend suspicion that there's a human in"
00:11:05,00:11:07,there and think this is probably all cake.
00:11:07,00:11:09,"It could be, it could be, it could be, it could be cake."
00:11:09,00:11:12,Can I give my favourite jumping out of a pie incident?
00:11:12,00:11:13,"Yes, please."
00:11:13,00:11:17,"So this was one of the earliest ones I think it was in 1454, and it was when things being"
00:11:17,00:11:21,hidden in pies was used as a rallying cry of the Christians against the Ottomans.
00:11:21,00:11:24,So this was kind of during the era of the Crusades.
00:11:24,00:11:28,"It was King Philip, who through this really, really elaborate banquet was sort of jousting"
00:11:28,00:11:31,"and these amazing table decorations that we've talked about before, and then he led everyone"
00:11:31,00:11:35,"into this really long table, and on the table he had this giant pie, and the pie opened"
00:11:35,00:11:41,"up mechanically to reveal 28 playing musicians, so an orchestra of 28 people who leapt out"
00:11:41,00:11:42,of the pie and played.
00:11:42,00:11:45,"Do you think if you saw a cake that size, you'd think just a normal cake?"
00:11:45,00:11:50,"Well, if it had music coming out of it, I'd be like, there's something else going on."
00:11:50,00:11:51,"Maybe you're not people inside, but you know."
00:11:51,00:11:53,We don't know what song they played.
00:11:53,00:11:54,We don't know what song they played.
00:11:54,00:11:57,"Although we do know at that same party, there was a statue of a beautiful woman who had"
00:11:57,00:12:00,wine springing from her breast that people could drink from.
00:12:00,00:12:07,"At this party, Stavford White's party, he was serving wine, but he had a blonde waitress"
00:12:07,00:12:10,who only served white wine and a brunette who only served red wine.
00:12:10,00:12:11,Really?
00:12:11,00:12:12,That's quite nice.
00:12:12,00:12:15,It's like having a lid to match the bottle kind of thing.
00:12:15,00:12:19,"I know what you're saying, but then on the other hand, it's not very well, is it?"
00:12:19,00:12:21,It's slightly objectifying these women.
00:12:21,00:12:22,I'll give you that.
00:12:22,00:12:23,That's what we've established.
00:12:23,00:12:27,"This guy doesn't have the best track record with, with, with, with, Suzy Johnson."
00:12:27,00:12:29,The lady who jumped out of the pie cake.
00:12:29,00:12:31,She don't know what happened to her.
00:12:31,00:12:32,She's another mystery in the whole story.
00:12:32,00:12:33,She disappeared.
00:12:33,00:12:35,People tried to track her down.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"Because she became, as you say, we know her name."
00:12:36,00:12:38,Did they just check every cake?
00:12:38,00:12:39,She's not in this one.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"It's the Mr. Kippling Factory, not in this one."
00:12:42,00:12:46,Multiple weddings ruined once again.
00:12:46,00:12:50,The cake police swoop in.
00:12:50,00:12:59,"Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact."
00:12:59,00:13:05,"My fact this week is that when in London, Queen Louise of Sweden always carried a card saying,"
00:13:05,00:13:09,"""I am the queen of Sweden in case she was hit by a bus."""
00:13:09,00:13:10,It's cocky.
00:13:10,00:13:11,Yeah.
00:13:11,00:13:15,"Well, she used to travel around London as it were in disguise."
00:13:15,00:13:17,She didn't go around with a non-terrah.
00:13:17,00:13:19,"She loved shopping, and so she would just go on her own."
00:13:19,00:13:22,And one time she was almost hit by a bus.
00:13:22,00:13:26,"As a result, she decided, God, if I was hit by this bus, how would people know who I was?"
00:13:26,00:13:30,"I don't know, I carry a card inside my handbag that says, ""I am the queen of Sweden."""
00:13:30,00:13:32,"And then they'll be like, ""We know who she is."""
00:13:32,00:13:35,"And then the people who found her, rather than going, ""I guess we'll just leave her there."
00:13:35,00:13:36,"We don't really care."""
00:13:36,00:13:37,"We'll go, ""Oh, hang on."
00:13:37,00:13:38,She's the queen.
00:13:38,00:13:40,"We'd better sort out this car accident situation."""
00:13:40,00:13:42,"Also, it's a really weird reaction to having her about to hit by a bus."
00:13:42,00:13:45,"The normal reaction is, ""Wow, I should be more careful across on the road."""
00:13:45,00:13:48,"When that inevitably happens again, I better make sure I'm properly labored."
00:13:48,00:14:03,"""Oh, you're the only one that I know of who's a tone, almost, been hit by a bus. How did you react?"""
00:14:03,00:14:04,He shouted at the bus.
00:14:04,00:14:05,"""What did you shout?"""
00:14:05,00:14:06,"""Go back to bus school."""
00:14:06,00:14:07,This is one of the greatest anecdotes of QI history.
00:14:07,00:14:08,It comes up basically every week in shock.
00:14:08,00:14:09,"""I'll come back to bus school."""
00:14:09,00:14:10,It's the greatest line ever.
00:14:10,00:14:13,Would you keep that card in your handbag?
00:14:13,00:14:17,Just hand it out to the bus driver.
00:14:17,00:14:21,"Wouldn't have been amazing though, if whenever you called 999, if you find someone unconscious"
00:14:21,00:14:24,"on the floor, you call 999 and they say, ""Okay, so first things first, have you looked"
00:14:24,00:14:27,at their handbag and have you checked their business cards?
00:14:27,00:14:28,Is it the Queen of Sweden?
00:14:28,00:14:29,"Okay."""
00:14:29,00:14:33,"""This has happened before."""
00:14:33,00:14:36,She was really great that Queen Louise have seen this actually.
00:14:36,00:14:40,"In her first passport, it had a thing called special peculiarities where you put things"
00:14:40,00:14:44,"about your face, if you have a scar or whatever, and she wrote, ""Walks like a parrot."""
00:14:44,00:14:47,"""Prinely."""
00:14:47,00:14:49,She's just to put her into a bit of context.
00:14:49,00:14:52,She is the auntie of Prince Philip.
00:14:52,00:14:53,Yes.
00:14:53,00:14:54,She was the mountain-battern family.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"Formerly, Battenburgs wasn't she."
00:14:56,00:14:57,That's right.
00:14:57,00:14:59,Battenburgs who hurriedly changed their name to mountain-battern when the Germans became
00:14:59,00:15:00,the bad guys.
00:15:00,00:15:01,Yeah.
00:15:01,00:15:02,Yeah.
00:15:02,00:15:04,"And she was the great granddaughter of Queen Victoria, I think."
00:15:04,00:15:05,Yes.
00:15:05,00:15:08,"But all the European royal families are all just related to each other, aren't they?"
00:15:08,00:15:09,They are.
00:15:09,00:15:10,Really?
00:15:10,00:15:14,"Not two, because all of the royal families are all related to each other, but then they"
00:15:14,00:15:17,were in all in countries that were all fighting against each other.
00:15:17,00:15:22,"She works as a messenger, kind of, giving messages between all of her family who weren't"
00:15:22,00:15:23,allowed to talk to each other.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Not a spy.
00:15:24,00:15:26,"I suppose you could call it a spy, couldn't you?"
00:15:26,00:15:30,"I mean, it's pretty much basically a double agent, but I think she was doing it quite"
00:15:30,00:15:31,explicitly and not...
00:15:31,00:15:34,"I'm not saying on a bench, handing over a message and they're like, ""I am the Queen of"
00:15:34,00:15:35,Sweden.
00:15:35,00:15:36,"What does this mean?"""
00:15:36,00:15:37,"""Oh, sorry."
00:15:37,00:15:41,I'm presumably it was more like Bobby just had a baby rather than the Nazis around their
00:15:41,00:15:42,"way across the channel."""
00:15:42,00:15:43,Yeah.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"And the Swedish royal family is quite interesting, though, and the modern Swedish royal family"
00:15:46,00:15:47,is as well.
00:15:47,00:15:53,"So there's Karl XVI who's King now, who I don't think we've ever said on the podcast, is"
00:15:53,00:15:55,"the 10th King, Karl of Sweden."
00:15:55,00:15:57,Who did they miss out?
00:15:57,00:15:58,They added lots.
00:15:58,00:16:03,It goes back to the 15th century when a guy called Johann Magnus wrote this sort of fanciful
00:16:03,00:16:06,"history of all the Swedish kings, and he just added a whole bunch of kings."
00:16:06,00:16:13,"So he made up six erics and six calls, and they've kept that numerical system ever since."
00:16:13,00:16:16,But why were they referring to this fictional account as history?
00:16:16,00:16:17,Because it really is.
00:16:17,00:16:20,"Because it became really popular as a bit like the Saga's, you know, became a thing that"
00:16:20,00:16:21,was always read.
00:16:21,00:16:23,But I think it's like we have King Arthur for instance.
00:16:23,00:16:24,King Arthur.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"And so if we were to have a new King Arthur, we would probably call him Arthur the Second,"
00:16:27,00:16:28,wouldn't we?
00:16:28,00:16:29,"Oh, I'd love to see."
00:16:29,00:16:32,"And if Prince Harry became King, he would be Henry the Ninth."
00:16:32,00:16:36,He'd be our first Henry since the dreaded Henry the Eight.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"If he kept the name right, although sometimes you take on a different name when you become"
00:16:39,00:16:40,royal.
00:16:40,00:16:41,Because Prince Charles will.
00:16:41,00:16:42,Yes.
00:16:42,00:16:43,We think.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Become Henry.
00:16:44,00:16:45,He won't become Charles.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"No, we were discussing this."
00:16:46,00:16:47,We were.
00:16:47,00:16:50,"We had a party last week at my place, which you were advised to, but you didn't come."
00:16:50,00:16:54,And it was so exciting that we started talking about the regular numbers of the King's
00:16:54,00:16:55,and Queen's England.
00:16:55,00:16:56,I'm so sorry.
00:16:56,00:16:57,I couldn't make it.
00:16:57,00:16:58,He's going to be great.
00:16:58,00:16:59,He's going to be great.
00:16:59,00:17:00,He's going to be great.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"Edward the Ninth, I think we found."
00:17:01,00:17:02,That was what you thought that was.
00:17:02,00:17:03,That's what the book he's reckon.
00:17:03,00:17:04,Is it?
00:17:04,00:17:05,I think so.
00:17:05,00:17:10,"The main fact itself, I've read this in a few places, found a few sources, but nothing that"
00:17:10,00:17:14,"I would say is concrete enough that I truly, I want to see the card."
00:17:14,00:17:16,And if anyone knows if the card exists.
00:17:16,00:17:21,"So the source for this, the original source was Queen Louise's niece Dollar, who was the"
00:17:21,00:17:23,Margraveen of Baden.
00:17:23,00:17:24,I don't know what that means.
00:17:24,00:17:27,"But anyway, it was a relative who first said this."
00:17:27,00:17:28,Yeah.
00:17:28,00:17:29,Okay.
00:17:29,00:17:30,There's a good source.
00:17:30,00:17:31,Thank you.
00:17:31,00:17:32,Thank you all for helping me out.
00:17:32,00:17:42,It's been reset.
00:17:42,00:17:43,Okay.
00:17:43,00:17:45,It is time for our final fact of the show.
00:17:45,00:17:46,And that is James.
00:17:46,00:17:47,Okay.
00:17:47,00:17:52,"My fact this week is that last year in the UK, two eight-year-olds were caught speeding."
00:17:52,00:17:57,This came from a freedom of information question that was posed to the driver and vehicle licensing
00:17:57,00:17:58,agency.
00:17:58,00:18:03,They asked for all of the different statistics and they also found out that 900 people in their
00:18:03,00:18:09,"90s got penalty points for speeding last year, including three people aged 99."
00:18:09,00:18:11,Although I reckon 99.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"That's the oldest, but it's quite coincidence that it's 99 and not 100 and something."
00:18:14,00:18:18,"So I reckon anyone that's over 99, they just put 99, maybe there's only two spaces in"
00:18:18,00:18:19,the farm.
00:18:19,00:18:20,Oh yeah.
00:18:20,00:18:21,I reckon.
00:18:21,00:18:25,Or you just don't find someone who's 100 or more for speeding.
00:18:25,00:18:26,No.
00:18:26,00:18:28,"I don't fare enough, mate."
00:18:28,00:18:31,"On further, you docked the 99-year-old though."
00:18:31,00:18:32,"Well, you know."
00:18:32,00:18:33,One more year in your home.
00:18:33,00:18:36,"Yeah, you've got to hang on to your 100th birthday."
00:18:36,00:18:39,"That's like saying on further, you won't let the 15-year-olds smoke when the 16-year-olds"
00:18:39,00:18:40,allowed to.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"I mean, you've got to draw the line somewhere, haven't you?"
00:18:42,00:18:43,"Okay, sure."
00:18:43,00:18:44,That's a line.
00:18:44,00:18:45,That's a line.
00:18:45,00:18:46,"Sorry, I also think the smoking age might have gone up since I was a smoker."
00:18:46,00:18:52,"So 16-year-olds, if it's illegal, just check."
00:18:52,00:18:57,"Or, you know, whatever, don't smoke, consider that."
00:18:57,00:19:03,"There have been quite a lot of weird speeding fines and driving fines this year, so there"
00:19:03,00:19:07,have been two instances of people getting caught driving to the hospital because their wives
00:19:07,00:19:09,were in labour and getting stopped for speeding.
00:19:09,00:19:13,"And so one was in the UK going at 101 miles an hour, and then there was another guy in"
00:19:13,00:19:16,the US who missed the birth of his child because he was taken to a cell.
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Oh, no."
00:19:17,00:19:18,Yeah.
00:19:18,00:19:19,"Oh, that's hard."
00:19:19,00:19:20,Wow.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:21,00:19:22,Yeah.
00:19:22,00:19:23,I don't think so.
00:19:23,00:19:24,Yeah.
00:19:24,00:19:25,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:25,00:19:26,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:26,00:19:27,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:28,00:19:29,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:29,00:19:30,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:30,00:19:31,"Yeah, it's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:31,00:19:32,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:32,00:19:33,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:33,00:19:34,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:34,00:19:35,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:35,00:19:36,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:36,00:19:37,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:37,00:19:38,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:38,00:19:39,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:39,00:19:40,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:40,00:19:41,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:41,00:19:42,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:42,00:19:49,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:49,00:19:50,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:50,00:19:51,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:51,00:19:52,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:52,00:19:53,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:53,00:19:54,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:54,00:19:55,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:55,00:19:56,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:56,00:19:57,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:57,00:19:58,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:19:59,00:20:00,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:00,00:20:01,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:01,00:20:02,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:02,00:20:03,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:03,00:20:04,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:04,00:20:05,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:05,00:20:06,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:06,00:20:07,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:07,00:20:08,"It's really rough, isn't it?"
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Wow, that's good."
00:20:10,00:20:14,I really hope he did the names Bond James Bond.
00:20:14,00:20:15,But I'm going to show you your license.
00:20:15,00:20:16,Two kills.
00:20:16,00:20:20,And any actual license.
00:20:20,00:20:26,"We have in our book, we've got a similar sort of story."
00:20:26,00:20:27,What book's that done?
00:20:27,00:20:28,It's called The Book of the Year 2018.
00:20:28,00:20:31,You're a definitive guide to the world's weirdest news.
00:20:31,00:20:32,Do you know when it comes out?
00:20:32,00:20:33,"Yeah, October the 18th."
00:20:33,00:20:34,"Okay, where's it available?"
00:20:34,00:20:35,It's going to be in bookshops.
00:20:35,00:20:36,It's going to be online.
00:20:36,00:20:37,"Yeah, it's..."
00:20:37,00:20:39,"And at least not here, we can say Amazon."
00:20:39,00:20:40,"Amazon, it's going to be on Amazon."
00:20:40,00:20:42,"Yes, this is the first time I've heard of it."
00:20:42,00:20:46,Remember we found that thing of the guy who was done for drink driving?
00:20:46,00:20:48,"But it's claimed that he wasn't drink driving,"
00:20:48,00:20:51,because he was only drinking every time he got to a traffic stop site.
00:20:51,00:20:54,So it stopped ever swig.
00:20:54,00:20:55,Are they going to go?
00:20:55,00:20:56,We're going to go.
00:20:56,00:20:57,This is...
00:20:57,00:20:58,"Sorry, go on."
00:20:58,00:20:59,"No, you can if I was just sighing."
00:20:59,00:21:00,I just want to stay alive.
00:21:00,00:21:05,Did you know the first person to pass a driving test was called Mr. Beer?
00:21:05,00:21:07,"No, I didn't know that."
00:21:07,00:21:11,"So in 1935, he paid 37.5P, just found that out."
00:21:11,00:21:15,"And also found out this weird thing that driving tests were suspended in the second world war, which makes sense."
00:21:15,00:21:19,"And they were suspended again during the Suez crisis, which is quite weird."
00:21:19,00:21:23,"And especially given that during the Suez crisis, learners were allowed to drive on a company."
00:21:23,00:21:24,And then...
00:21:24,00:21:27,"And I think I don't know about Suez crisis, but it's definitely true of the second world war,"
00:21:27,00:21:31,"that if you learn to drive during the war, they just gave you a license."
00:21:31,00:21:32,You didn't need to take a test at all.
00:21:32,00:21:36,"Oh, just because you've been through the war and how to drive."
00:21:36,00:21:40,"If you could drive enough to defeat the Nazis, then you could drive enough to go to the shop."
00:21:40,00:21:44,"If you can drive a tank through a minefield and not get blown up, I think you can manage the M25."
00:21:44,00:21:48,"Speaking of tanks, I read this yesterday."
00:21:48,00:21:52,So you're allowed to drive a tank on the road in the UK.
00:21:52,00:21:55,You need a special license.
00:21:55,00:21:59,"But if you could get a provisional license, which is really easy, a provisional tank license,"
00:21:59,00:22:03,"then as long as there's someone sat next to you who can drive a tank, then you can drive a tank"
00:22:03,00:22:06,through the streets of the UK at any time.
00:22:06,00:22:09,But you need to have learner plates on the tank.
00:22:09,00:22:11,But you will be at the school.
00:22:11,00:22:15,I knew that because the QIs production coordinator was telling me a great story about how she had to get James Blunt
00:22:15,00:22:17,to drive a tank through the BBC.
00:22:17,00:22:19,That was...
00:22:19,00:22:21,"Because he was an army guy, so he knows how to drive a tank."
00:22:21,00:22:23,But where do you get a tank?
00:22:23,00:22:25,This still feels like the main stomping block.
00:22:25,00:22:29,"Yeah, she just knew a guy."
00:22:29,00:22:31,Who's your buddy?
00:22:31,00:22:33,"You've met Ed once, we met him outside Bergershire."
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Oh, you have a tank?"
00:22:35,00:22:37,Yes.
00:22:37,00:22:39,It's a superior.
00:22:39,00:22:41,He's just trying to find someone to park.
00:22:41,00:22:44,He used to have it parked outside Ash Gardner of Empress's house.
00:22:44,00:22:46,They were neighbours and outside was his tank.
00:22:46,00:22:48,We used to go and sit inside it.
00:22:48,00:22:52,"He made it into this really nice sort of, you know, where you have Netflix nights."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"Oh, it was a hipster tank."
00:22:54,00:22:56,It was a long time.
00:22:56,00:23:04,"Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts."
