00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 *sigh*

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.800
 *laughs*

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.360
 *whistling*

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.880
 (in foreign language)

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.520
 (in foreign language)

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.600
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.560
 My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Alex Bell and James

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.080
 Harkin and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.460
 from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go, starting with you Chazinski.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.520
 My fact is that the world record for the longest time spent holding one's breath is exactly

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.160
 the same length as this podcast episode.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.160
 Wow.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.800
 How left can we possibly know how long this episode is going to be?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 I have my magic powers and knowledge that you're a good editor have told me.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.280
 So tell me how long do we have to edit two?

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 So you have to edit to 24 minutes and three seconds, is that okay?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 And this is a record that was set by Alex Segura in 2016 and he's a champion in the sport

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.280
 of static apnea.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.960
 I can't believe it's a sport.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 It's a sport.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960
 It's a sport.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.280
 It's the sport of lying face down in a swimming pool and holding your breath while remaining

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
 still.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.200
 I can get on board with for the Olympics.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.640
 We should say that this record that he broke is looked down upon by some static apneasts,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.120
 including himself actually, because this one involved him inhaling pure oxygen.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520
 That means you can hold your breath for much, much longer.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.840
 So that doubles the volume of oxygen that you can store in your lungs.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.760
 So you breathe oxygen for something like 30 minutes before you go for the record attempt?

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.760
 Yes.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.340
 So 24 minutes, that's the length of a sitcom episode if you were watching an American sitcom

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.340
 without adverts.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 Well, is it though?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 Yeah.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.700
 Well, not the new Netflix series style sitcoms, but if you go classic Seinfeld or Friends

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 episode.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 Specifically Seinfeld.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.100
 Seinfeld is getting shorter.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.100
 What?

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.300
 So the TBS have been caught broadcasting episodes of Seinfeld in fast forward, 9% faster than

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300
 the original record.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.300
 So does he sound like a chipmunk?

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.940
 No, weirdly he doesn't, because you can get away with maybe up to about 15% without really

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.940
 noticing it.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.860
 But if you put them side by side, obviously, you notice, but who does that?

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.540
 Was Alfred and the chipmunks originally like four hours long, which I'll tell you?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.580
 I was sort of still on while.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 That is amazing.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.580
 So you lose what?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.580
 Six minutes an hour?

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.580
 Yeah, yeah.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.580
 Exactly.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.780
 So you get an extra minute or so of adverts for each episode?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.100
 On sitcoms, do you know that the world's first sitcom, No Episodes Survive of it?

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 This is just a kind of, I've only mentioned this because it's the kind of thing that makes

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.900
 Alex really angry, but it was on the BBC and it was broadcast from 1946 to '47, it was

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.980
 called 'Pinwrights Progress', and I was just really excited to see it because it stars

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.620
 someone called James Hater, who played Friar Tuck in a Robin Hood film that I swear no one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.300
 else on Earth has ever seen except me, and I recognised him.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.380
 Oh, I thought it was because you're a James Hater.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.500
 And that subconsciously, I think, was the reason that I pursued this fact further.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.820
 There was a footballer called James Hater, and my brother used to always like him because

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.580
 my brother's also a James Hater.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.220
 There's, we've got a big club, but yeah, they've lost all the episodes.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.620
 James Hater was also, by the way, the original voice of Mr. Kippling makes exceedingly good

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.620
 cakes.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.620
 That's very cool.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.100
 The thing I love about this breathing thing is, people who do it without oxygen have gone

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.860
 for about half as long as Alex Segura, but whoever does it, if you really push yourself

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.100
 to the limit, when you come up, would you have thought you'd breathe in or out?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.100
 You always breathe out.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500
 You always breathe out, right?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.140
 Despite where there's no oxygen now, what do you do?

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
 No, because you're well.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.220
 Well, so we always breathe out, right?

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.900
 Because when you suddenly start getting out of breath underwater, it's because your body

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.100
 has this automatic response to having too much buildup of carbon dioxide, which is an emergency

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.060
 response, which says, "Get up, get up, breathe, breathe, breathe," because if you've got too

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.900
 much carbon dioxide, it knows you're going to run out of oxygen.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.620
 But all these champion static atmonists have learned to totally override that response.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.540
 So they go underwater, they hold their breaths, and the oxygen just gets absorbed and absorbed

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.540
 and absorbed.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.420
 So by the time they come up, they need to breathe in straight away.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.980
 So that's how you spot the difference between an expert and an amateur.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.260
 We breathe out and they breathe in.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.580
 I suppose the other way of spotting an amateur versus expert is the expert comes up 24 minutes

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:20.580
 later.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.380
 I was reading that insects often hold their breath, and they do it for hours and even days

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.380
 at a time.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.460
 And the reason is, is that too much air would actually kill them, so they're actually stopping

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.780
 air from coming in to save their lives, because too much of it damages their tissues.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.700
 So it's simply a process of stopping.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.220
 So too much oxygen damages them?

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.220
 Yeah.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220
 Exactly.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220
 Sometimes.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.220
 Sometimes do they like rust?

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220
 Yes.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.220
 That's why they're all a bit brown.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.220
 Is that what I'm saying?

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.220
 Yeah.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 They're all rusty.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.220
 They're all just rusty.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.220
 Yeah.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.180
 But yeah, if you see an insect, it's most likely holding its breath.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.940
 That's so cool.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.860
 I was reading a 2016 Savage University study about sighing, and sighing is really interesting,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.140
 so sighing is basically just a breathing in, and they're breathing in again instead

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.140
 of breathing out.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.140
 You're just taking in twice as much air, and the reason you do it, or one of the reasons

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.860
 you do it, is to inflate the alveoli more than it usually gets, because your alveoli always

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.860
 sort of collapsing.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.860
 Yeah.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.100
 The alveoli, the tiny little sacks on the edge of your lungs that absorb the oxygen into

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.100
 the rest of your body, aren't they?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.100
 Yeah.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.740
 Lots of different alveoli edges collapsing on their own.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.500
 And so they periodically need to just be reinflated with a massive amount of air in your

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 lungs, and that's what's sighing.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.500
 Really?

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.460
 I always thought I sighed, because I was really fed up with the 29th pun in a row that

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.460
 James had told.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.340
 And it's actually just all about my alveoli.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.980
 I always thought James had to go back to your club.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.260
 And what's really interesting is that when they originally built iron lungs, which are the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.020
 coffin, like, things that you put people in when they're having breathing difficulties,

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.540
 and it's basically a pressure chamber that forces people to breathe from the outside,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.460
 the mechanism didn't account for sighing, as in the iron lung didn't sigh, it only did

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.500
 normal breathing in and out, and people kept dying.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.260
 And this is when they realized this is what it counted for it, because they're

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.260
 loving themselves to death.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.740
 No, they didn't sigh themselves to death, because they weren't sighing, because the iron

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.260
 lung was only doing normal breathing for them, and it wasn't doing some sort of sigh.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.260
 Wait, so if we didn't sigh, we'd die.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.260
 If you don't sigh, you'd die.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.260
 Yeah.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.260
 That should be on signs everywhere.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.260
 Just in case.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260
 It is a subconscious reflex, man.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.260
 You don't usually do other signs, though.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.260
 I don't have signs everywhere.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.260
 Don't forget to breathe it.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.260
 Keep blinking.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:28.260
 No, as I need these things.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:41.820
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Alex.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.020
 My fact this week is that Nicola Tesla was one of the guests at the first ever party with

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.540
 a stripper jumping out of a cake.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.540
 Amazing.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.540
 Incredible.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.540
 It's a really cool party.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.540
 What was he doing there?

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.300
 Well, he was just one of several quite prominent guests.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.900
 This was a party thrown by a guy called Stanford White, who was a member of the New York

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.540
 Elite at the end of the 19th century, a really interesting character himself, actually.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.460
 Controversial character as well.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.100
 So he threw all sorts of exciting dinner parties and drinks parties like this, and this one

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:22.580
 was on May the 20th, 1895, and one of the attractors of this party was a scantily-clad

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.700
 girl called Susie Johnson, and we actually know her name, emerging from a pie made from galvanised

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.140
 iron accompanied by a recitation of singer-song of six-pins.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.140
 Yeah.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.140
 Well, plus birds, right?

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.140
 I think birds flew out along with her, didn't they?

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.140
 I think more than sense.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.140
 The birds that came out were canaries, and in the movie of this, which I watched the other

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.060
 night for research purposes, is called The Girl and the Velvet Swing, starring John Collins

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.220
 as the character who is basically Susie Johnson.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.340
 The guy comes in and he's like, "Oh, sorry, I couldn't find any black birds, but I've got

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.340
 canaries."

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.340
 Oh, really?

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.340
 The girl?

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.340
 Was it also like, "I couldn't find a velvet swing, but I've got a cast iron cake."

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.540
 Well, we'll probably get to this in a bit, right?

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.660
 I was just saying it was like sexy, like singer-song of six-pins, because I can't work

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660
 at how you think of that.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:10.980
 To be honest, the bit with the pie, I kind of left the room and went to my kitchen to

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.940
 get a drink, and when I came back, I think I missed the pie, but the rest of it is all

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.020
 about this guy, Stanford White, who, like, Dan's about say, is very controversial.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.020
 Yeah.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.020
 Very controversial.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:25.380
 The reason for the title of The Velvet Swing is to do with his controversiality.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:31.820
 He used to like to sneak girls back to a house of his in Manhattan, and no good way of

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.820
 saying it.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.820
 Drug and rape them.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.500
 That was his very bad human, and the girl on The Velvet Swing refers to a girl who he

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.220
 did this to when she was age 16.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:46.580
 Yes, because her husband, who I think his name was Thor, or something like that, not

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.420
 Thor as in The Norse Guard Thor, as in what happens to snow when it's warm.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.420
 He then shot...

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:53.420
 That's a bit very confused in the cinema.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.300
 I saw a very boring film that I was in the woods.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.580
 The Marvel movie where it's just snow melting.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:06.500
 He was at a theatre performance of Man was L Champagne's "I Could Love A Million Girls",

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.500
 and then Thor came over and shot Stanford White in the face.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.620
 Yeah, and this was about 1905, wasn't it?

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.620
 That's right.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.140
 But this is why this whole jumping out of cake thing became well-known, because in the

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.700
 court case, everyone suddenly read about this amazing cake woman party, and then I guess

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.700
 it became a thing.

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.340
 Imagine that's a bit of your obituary that sticks out, so you've just been murdered by

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.980
 a millionaire in a public space, and then everyone goes, "Hey, what's this cake bit?"

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.980
 That sounds pretty cool.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.020
 He made history in the sort of industry of raunchy parties.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.060
 Yeah, he's done the world of service in his murder.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:45.260
 But he did the world of disservice because there were more repercussions afterwards, so

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.940
 the whole thing was covered by a journalist called Meryl Goddard.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.380
 And then Meryl Goddard was so good at covering this case that Randolph Hearst, who was a newspaper

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.820
 proprietor, decided to take her for his newspaper.

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.020
 She was working with Pulitzer, and then Hearst and Pulitzer had a massive competition against

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.380
 each other for who could get the most readers for their newspaper.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.820
 And that turned into sensational journalism, and that's why we have red top journalists

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.820
 in today.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.820
 Wow.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.780
 So, your fact says she jumped out of a cake, there's a pie.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.780
 Sorry.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.780
 When did it become cake?

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:18.780
 It was a pie.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.260
 I mean, that was like a crusted top pie.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.260
 In the movie, it looks like one of those.

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:26.940
 You know where it's got criss-cross of pastry on the top of it, but that might just be for

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.940
 the movies.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:34.100
 I guess it makes sense that what traditionally there's like in banquets and stuff in sort

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.700
 of medieval times, you've got very elaborate pies and things come out of pies, and then

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.620
 it becomes more of a tradition to do things at parties.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.620
 We now have cakes, so they just said, "Well, why don't we have people jumping out of cakes?"

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:47.780
 This is a bit weird to have a pie, like a birthday party, but I guess cakes are more practical

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.180
 to jump out of and to hide and hide in, really, because it can be taller.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.180
 You can have a tall pie.

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.180
 Yeah.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180
 I don't think so.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.180
 I think they can just go as high as you want.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.500
 I'd be suspicious if I saw a really tall pie, like there's a person in there, whereas

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500
 you can have a big cake.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.500
 Why do you just have no idea this person?

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.500
 Hang on, hang on.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.500
 You can feel like it's a huge cake.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.820
 If you saw a giant cake coming, you would suspend suspicion that there's a human in

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:07.260
 there and think this is probably all cake.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.980
 It could be, it could be, it could be, it could be cake.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.020
 Can I give my favourite jumping out of a pie incident?

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:13.020
 Yes, please.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.260
 So this was one of the earliest ones I think it was in 1454, and it was when things being

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:21.660
 hidden in pies was used as a rallying cry of the Christians against the Ottomans.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.180
 So this was kind of during the era of the Crusades.

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.460
 It was King Philip, who through this really, really elaborate banquet was sort of jousting

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.740
 and these amazing table decorations that we've talked about before, and then he led everyone

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.900
 into this really long table, and on the table he had this giant pie, and the pie opened

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:41.660
 up mechanically to reveal 28 playing musicians, so an orchestra of 28 people who leapt out

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:42.660
 of the pie and played.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.860
 Do you think if you saw a cake that size, you'd think just a normal cake?

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.100
 Well, if it had music coming out of it, I'd be like, there's something else going on.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.620
 Maybe you're not people inside, but you know.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.380
 We don't know what song they played.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:54.380
 We don't know what song they played.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.500
 Although we do know at that same party, there was a statue of a beautiful woman who had

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.980
 wine springing from her breast that people could drink from.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:07.020
 At this party, Stavford White's party, he was serving wine, but he had a blonde waitress

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.660
 who only served white wine and a brunette who only served red wine.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660
 Really?

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.660
 That's quite nice.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.980
 It's like having a lid to match the bottle kind of thing.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.460
 I know what you're saying, but then on the other hand, it's not very well, is it?

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.260
 It's slightly objectifying these women.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.260
 I'll give you that.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.260
 That's what we've established.

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:27.500
 This guy doesn't have the best track record with, with, with, with, Suzy Johnson.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.620
 The lady who jumped out of the pie cake.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.340
 She don't know what happened to her.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.820
 She's another mystery in the whole story.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.820
 She disappeared.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.060
 People tried to track her down.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.380
 Because she became, as you say, we know her name.

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.380
 Did they just check every cake?

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.380
 She's not in this one.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.900
 It's the Mr. Kippling Factory, not in this one.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.460
 Multiple weddings ruined once again.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.820
 The cake police swoop in.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:59.580
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is my fact.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.100
 My fact this week is that when in London, Queen Louise of Sweden always carried a card saying,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.180
 "I am the queen of Sweden in case she was hit by a bus."

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.660
 It's cocky.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.660
 Yeah.

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.980
 Well, she used to travel around London as it were in disguise.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.380
 She didn't go around with a non-terrah.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.900
 She loved shopping, and so she would just go on her own.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.220
 And one time she was almost hit by a bus.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.900
 As a result, she decided, God, if I was hit by this bus, how would people know who I was?

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:30.740
 I don't know, I carry a card inside my handbag that says, "I am the queen of Sweden."

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.380
 And then they'll be like, "We know who she is."

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.340
 And then the people who found her, rather than going, "I guess we'll just leave her there.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.340
 We don't really care."

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.340
 We'll go, "Oh, hang on.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:38.340
 She's the queen.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.100
 We'd better sort out this car accident situation."

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.620
 Also, it's a really weird reaction to having her about to hit by a bus.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.140
 The normal reaction is, "Wow, I should be more careful across on the road."

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.380
 When that inevitably happens again, I better make sure I'm properly labored.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:14:03.060
 "Oh, you're the only one that I know of who's a tone, almost, been hit by a bus. How did you react?"

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.300
 He shouted at the bus.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.300
 "What did you shout?"

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.300
 "Go back to bus school."

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.300
 This is one of the greatest anecdotes of QI history.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.300
 It comes up basically every week in shock.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.300
 "I'll come back to bus school."

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.300
 It's the greatest line ever.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.300
 Would you keep that card in your handbag?

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.100
 Just hand it out to the bus driver.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:21.180
 Wouldn't have been amazing though, if whenever you called 999, if you find someone unconscious

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.420
 on the floor, you call 999 and they say, "Okay, so first things first, have you looked

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.780
 at their handbag and have you checked their business cards?

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:28.780
 Is it the Queen of Sweden?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:29.780
 Okay."

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.020
 "This has happened before."

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.180
 She was really great that Queen Louise have seen this actually.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:40.460
 In her first passport, it had a thing called special peculiarities where you put things

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.540
 about your face, if you have a scar or whatever, and she wrote, "Walks like a parrot."

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:47.220
 "Prinely."

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.620
 She's just to put her into a bit of context.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.300
 She is the auntie of Prince Philip.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300
 Yes.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.820
 She was the mountain-battern family.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.340
 Formerly, Battenburgs wasn't she.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.340
 That's right.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.340
 Battenburgs who hurriedly changed their name to mountain-battern when the Germans became

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340
 the bad guys.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.340
 Yeah.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.340
 Yeah.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.740
 And she was the great granddaughter of Queen Victoria, I think.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:05.740
 Yes.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.900
 But all the European royal families are all just related to each other, aren't they?

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.900
 They are.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900
 Really?

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.740
 Not two, because all of the royal families are all related to each other, but then they

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.220
 were in all in countries that were all fighting against each other.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.020
 She works as a messenger, kind of, giving messages between all of her family who weren't

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.020
 allowed to talk to each other.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.340
 Not a spy.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.020
 I suppose you could call it a spy, couldn't you?

00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.060
 I mean, it's pretty much basically a double agent, but I think she was doing it quite

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.060
 explicitly and not...

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.100
 I'm not saying on a bench, handing over a message and they're like, "I am the Queen of

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.100
 Sweden.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100
 What does this mean?"

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.100
 "Oh, sorry.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.940
 I'm presumably it was more like Bobby just had a baby rather than the Nazis around their

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.940
 way across the channel."

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:43.940
 Yeah.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.500
 And the Swedish royal family is quite interesting, though, and the modern Swedish royal family

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:47.500
 is as well.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:53.260
 So there's Karl XVI who's King now, who I don't think we've ever said on the podcast, is

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.380
 the 10th King, Karl of Sweden.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.140
 Who did they miss out?

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.460
 They added lots.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.740
 It goes back to the 15th century when a guy called Johann Magnus wrote this sort of fanciful

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.860
 history of all the Swedish kings, and he just added a whole bunch of kings.

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:13.580
 So he made up six erics and six calls, and they've kept that numerical system ever since.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.980
 But why were they referring to this fictional account as history?

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.980
 Because it really is.

00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.620
 Because it became really popular as a bit like the Saga's, you know, became a thing that

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.620
 was always read.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.620
 But I think it's like we have King Arthur for instance.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620
 King Arthur.

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:27.420
 And so if we were to have a new King Arthur, we would probably call him Arthur the Second,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.420
 wouldn't we?

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.420
 Oh, I'd love to see.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.660
 And if Prince Harry became King, he would be Henry the Ninth.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.260
 He'd be our first Henry since the dreaded Henry the Eight.

00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.620
 If he kept the name right, although sometimes you take on a different name when you become

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620
 royal.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620
 Because Prince Charles will.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:42.620
 Yes.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.620
 We think.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.620
 Become Henry.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:45.620
 He won't become Charles.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:46.620
 No, we were discussing this.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.620
 We were.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.460
 We had a party last week at my place, which you were advised to, but you didn't come.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.100
 And it was so exciting that we started talking about the regular numbers of the King's

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:55.100
 and Queen's England.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.100
 I'm so sorry.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.100
 I couldn't make it.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.100
 He's going to be great.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.100
 He's going to be great.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100
 He's going to be great.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.100
 Edward the Ninth, I think we found.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.100
 That was what you thought that was.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.100
 That's what the book he's reckon.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:04.100
 Is it?

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:05.100
 I think so.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:10.500
 The main fact itself, I've read this in a few places, found a few sources, but nothing that

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.220
 I would say is concrete enough that I truly, I want to see the card.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.180
 And if anyone knows if the card exists.

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:21.980
 So the source for this, the original source was Queen Louise's niece Dollar, who was the

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.980
 Margraveen of Baden.

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.980
 I don't know what that means.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.340
 But anyway, it was a relative who first said this.

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.340
 Yeah.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.340
 Okay.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.340
 There's a good source.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.340
 Thank you.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.340
 Thank you all for helping me out.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:42.460
 It's been reset.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460
 Okay.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.100
 It is time for our final fact of the show.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.100
 And that is James.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.100
 Okay.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.900
 My fact this week is that last year in the UK, two eight-year-olds were caught speeding.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.780
 This came from a freedom of information question that was posed to the driver and vehicle licensing

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.780
 agency.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.100
 They asked for all of the different statistics and they also found out that 900 people in their

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:09.700
 90s got penalty points for speeding last year, including three people aged 99.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.420
 Although I reckon 99.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.780
 That's the oldest, but it's quite coincidence that it's 99 and not 100 and something.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.980
 So I reckon anyone that's over 99, they just put 99, maybe there's only two spaces in

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.980
 the farm.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:20.980
 Oh yeah.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.980
 I reckon.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.540
 Or you just don't find someone who's 100 or more for speeding.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.540
 No.

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.540
 I don't fare enough, mate.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.260
 On further, you docked the 99-year-old though.

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.260
 Well, you know.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:33.780
 One more year in your home.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.220
 Yeah, you've got to hang on to your 100th birthday.

00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.620
 That's like saying on further, you won't let the 15-year-olds smoke when the 16-year-olds

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.620
 allowed to.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.060
 I mean, you've got to draw the line somewhere, haven't you?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.060
 Okay, sure.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:44.060
 That's a line.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.060
 That's a line.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:46.900
 Sorry, I also think the smoking age might have gone up since I was a smoker.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:52.260
 So 16-year-olds, if it's illegal, just check.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:57.820
 Or, you know, whatever, don't smoke, consider that.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:03.420
 There have been quite a lot of weird speeding fines and driving fines this year, so there

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.220
 have been two instances of people getting caught driving to the hospital because their wives

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.460
 were in labour and getting stopped for speeding.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.700
 And so one was in the UK going at 101 miles an hour, and then there was another guy in

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.620
 the US who missed the birth of his child because he was taken to a cell.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.620
 Oh, no.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.620
 Yeah.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.620
 Oh, that's hard.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.620
 Wow.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:22.620
 Yeah.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.620
 I don't think so.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:24.620
 Yeah.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:31.620
 Yeah, it's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:32.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:39.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:49.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:55.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:00.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:03.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:08.620
 It's really rough, isn't it?

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.620
 Wow, that's good.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.620
 I really hope he did the names Bond James Bond.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.620
 But I'm going to show you your license.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.620
 Two kills.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.620
 And any actual license.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:26.620
 We have in our book, we've got a similar sort of story.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:27.620
 What book's that done?

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.620
 It's called The Book of the Year 2018.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.620
 You're a definitive guide to the world's weirdest news.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.620
 Do you know when it comes out?

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.620
 Yeah, October the 18th.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.620
 Okay, where's it available?

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.620
 It's going to be in bookshops.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.620
 It's going to be online.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.620
 Yeah, it's...

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.620
 And at least not here, we can say Amazon.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.620
 Amazon, it's going to be on Amazon.

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.620
 Yes, this is the first time I've heard of it.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:46.620
 Remember we found that thing of the guy who was done for drink driving?

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.620
 But it's claimed that he wasn't drink driving,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.620
 because he was only drinking every time he got to a traffic stop site.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:54.620
 So it stopped ever swig.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:55.620
 Are they going to go?

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620
 We're going to go.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.620
 This is...

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:58.620
 Sorry, go on.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:20:59.620
 No, you can if I was just sighing.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:00.620
 I just want to stay alive.

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.620
 Did you know the first person to pass a driving test was called Mr. Beer?

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.620
 No, I didn't know that.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.620
 So in 1935, he paid 37.5P, just found that out.

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:15.620
 And also found out this weird thing that driving tests were suspended in the second world war, which makes sense.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.620
 And they were suspended again during the Suez crisis, which is quite weird.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.620
 And especially given that during the Suez crisis, learners were allowed to drive on a company.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.620
 And then...

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.620
 And I think I don't know about Suez crisis, but it's definitely true of the second world war,

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.620
 that if you learn to drive during the war, they just gave you a license.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.620
 You didn't need to take a test at all.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.620
 Oh, just because you've been through the war and how to drive.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.620
 If you could drive enough to defeat the Nazis, then you could drive enough to go to the shop.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.620
 If you can drive a tank through a minefield and not get blown up, I think you can manage the M25.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.620
 Speaking of tanks, I read this yesterday.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:52.620
 So you're allowed to drive a tank on the road in the UK.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.620
 You need a special license.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.620
 But if you could get a provisional license, which is really easy, a provisional tank license,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.620
 then as long as there's someone sat next to you who can drive a tank, then you can drive a tank

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.620
 through the streets of the UK at any time.

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.620
 But you need to have learner plates on the tank.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.620
 But you will be at the school.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.620
 I knew that because the QIs production coordinator was telling me a great story about how she had to get James Blunt

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.620
 to drive a tank through the BBC.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:19.620
 That was...

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.620
 Because he was an army guy, so he knows how to drive a tank.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.620
 But where do you get a tank?

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.620
 This still feels like the main stomping block.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.620
 Yeah, she just knew a guy.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.620
 Who's your buddy?

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.620
 You've met Ed once, we met him outside Bergershire.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.620
 Oh, you have a tank?

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:37.620
 Yes.

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.620
 It's a superior.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.620
 He's just trying to find someone to park.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.620
 He used to have it parked outside Ash Gardner of Empress's house.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.620
 They were neighbours and outside was his tank.

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.620
 We used to go and sit inside it.

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.620
 He made it into this really nice sort of, you know, where you have Netflix nights.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.620
 Oh, it was a hipster tank.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:56.620
 It was a long time.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:04.620
 Okay, that is it. That is all of our facts.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:06.620

 It looks awesome.

00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:37.620
 Back off speed up.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.620
 Okay, that's it.
