 Hi guys, just to let you know it is our hundredth episode coming up this Friday
 So to celebrate that this Thursday the 11th of February we're going to do an AMA on Reddit and ask me anything
 Where you can rock up and ask us anything will be there for a couple of hours
 Whatever you've ever wanted to ask us do it there. It's going to be 5 p.m. This Thursday 5 p.m. G.m. T
 That is midday Eastern standard time and if you go to qi.com for us that reddit you'll be able to find it easily. See you there
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Birmingham Mac
 My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to the stage. It's the other three elves Andy Murray James Arkin and Anna Chazinski
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order
 Here we go starting with you Andrew Montemorey my fact this week is that a New Zealand firm has developed an
 irrationally angry robot to train tell us ale stuff so it's so it calls the telly sale staff
 Yeah, I mean it has to be programmed to do it. It can't just regular at night time or something
 Oh, okay. So yeah, the firm is called touchpoint and basically they've developed this
 machine which can simulate an angry customer and it takes data from all the worst
 customer calls where people are really furious and then they sort of determine the factors which you
 know you could be set off by and then the telly sales person who's being trained has to try and calm the machine down
 Do we know how the anger manifests itself? Does it start a tap physically? It's nothing physical it's mind games
 A lot of passive aggressiveness. How twisted are people? I think it's a lot of shouting at insults basically
 Wow does it sound like a robot? I suspect not because that would negate the point of it being a training thing
 But then they so they must have someone recording all the audio to then yeah, I think so yeah
 Wow, yeah, it is irrational anger right and people go mad about cold callers
 And the thing apparently so there's a survey done recently and cold calling was voted the most
 annoying thing about the UK which I mean there's some bad stuff going on in this country
 Everyone calm down
 But the most annoying thing about cold calling is
 Cold-cola chaminas the false chaminas that you get I got a call call this morning
 Someone who said did you have an accident in the car that wasn't your fault? Okay, did you?
 And what I played along for a moment I said yes, I did
 Oh, and then she said did you?
 Not literally the first person
 Yeah, she was really it took her ages to say anything because she was so surprised
 And she said did you and I said no not really
 I got one last night and
 It's so it said hi we understand that you've had an accident recently and and you should be making a claim on it
 And I thought oh this is a robot so I just went and stayed silent yeah, and then it went
 Hello, and I went and then it went hi you still there. I thought oh god, it's an actual human
 Oh, it's sorry, and then it started talking and I was like it got me
 Hey, I is so good now that it yeah, yeah, they predicted that moment
 Yeah, so it's like the the Turing test where if you can have a conversation with a machine
 But you think it's a human then that the machines have won as the
 I'm not the bar
 So there is a software that can tell from my voice when I'm on the phone whether I'm angry or not
 Okay, and they use these and tell ourselves and so they'll have a computer in front of them
 And I'll ring them up and get really angry and passive aggressive and then their computer will say he's getting angry
 He's getting really angry. You better do something about this. Oh wow
 And then they have to keep it below a certain level as if they don't know that you're angry. Yeah
 I did quite well
 Telling salesperson on the floor just sobbing and they're in the computer's helpfully saying he's a little bit pissed off of you
 But it's amazing that computers can tell if you're angry. Yeah, that's very good
 There's apparently you can tell if someone's angry by the way they use their mouse
 Um to an 80% accuracy you can like smashing you around the head with it
 But I think just how you click on the things and stuff like that they can tell
 You click on I'm really angry
 They can tell frustration, sadness, fear and depression with more than 80% accuracy just by the way you use your mouse
 Wow
 Yeah, so there is a thing about the computers being angry and whether they should be made whether we should make angry
 Machines basically because one one school of thought is that it's quite a good idea to make computers that can simulate anger
 And that the ones you would need to worry about are the ones that don't simulate anger
 That's not one of the movies tell me but if robots take over the world they're usually pretty angry
 Think about the terminator robots. They're not angry. They're just doing a job
 Whereas if Arnie was really emotional in terminator then you'd know
 He's vulnerable you can you've got a weakness you can play with
 Yeah, but we can't really make them angry at the moment because we just we're just programming
 Angry sounding responses into them um
 And you know doesn't swear at you when you're not telling it to
 Send you poo in the post or something
 That's your program
 Which is which is the only reason I can assume that I keep receiving it
 There was a really creepy robot telemarketer that lots of people were writing online about called Samantha West
 And this was in the US and I think she was selling health insurance and she denied
 Vassiferously that she was a robot and so Pete these and I think it was the Washington Post or one of the US newspapers got
 Realized this got a call from her and they all called has said are you a robot?
 And she kept on saying no, I'm a real person. Maybe there's something wrong with the line
 Can you hear me? Okay, and they go you'd really sound like a robot and she'd say I understand
 But perhaps there's a fault with the line and they eventually called and like pressed all the buttons until they got through to a real person and said look
 That's a robot claiming to be a person working. I know I'm not into that at all. It's really weird
 And uh the person said we do not have any robots here. There's no robot working here
 And the next day the number of hers have been discontinued
 But I do wonder maybe that just was a real person on their first day
 Who was like, I didn't want to deviate from the scripts
 That was really really nervous and sent all these people going you're a fucking robot, okay
 Oh, no, and that's why I should quit the next day. Oh, there was a guy who got fired because he put on a robotic sounding
 boys
 To get through his calls faster because people assume if they're talking to a machine
 They'll just say yes, no and uh option C and he didn't want to do any of the fake chaminous
 So he just put on a metallic voice. Yeah, but he got fired for it
 So ironically his job will have now gone to a machine
 So you can get therapeutic robots have you seen this?
 It's quite normal. There's one in particular is called paro
 And they've made this robot to help people who are suffering from they've had some trauma
 And it's shaped like a seal
 And the reason it's shaped like a seal is because the guy who invented it says people are unlikely to have had bad memories of real
 Seals
 It's fair enough I think but seals are quite you know, they can attack people so it's just that most people don't come up against seals that often
 There are so many things that fall into that category
 Every if you bad memories of octopuses or the planet Mars
 Arnold Schwarzenegger actually, I mean while we're on robots, there is one subject. I think we've been dancing around
 Which is sex with robots
 Just all right, maybe maybe I'm the only one who's been dancing around it
 I just wanted to tell you about a story from Malaysia
 This is from the newspaper free Malaysia today from October
 and
 It goes like this this proposed conference on love and sex with robots is illegal
 Inspector general of police
 Khalid Abu Bakar told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur and action will be taken against the organizers if they go ahead
 There's nothing scientific about sex and robots
 It's an offense to have extra marital sex in Malaysia, especially with robots
 It's true. It was called the Congress on love and sex with robots
 And I think people just saw the title and just saw the last three words sex with robots. It's a word congress
 Congress
 That's true. There's a group called the campaign against sex robots
 They're a growing group to stop people from actually having sex with robots in the future
 And there are people who are saying, you know, we should make laws against this right now
 And there was an article about it and there was some people who commented on the bottom of it
 One person Chrysler Harper said if I want to have sex with my robot then I will
 My husband is always willing, but he isn't always that this idea is stupid
 The most advanced rebel, most people have is a hoover which I bet was what she's talking about
 And then someone called Manjeet replied to that saying sex robots would at least not be as destructive as an atomic bomb
 Very true. A lot of scientists do say, oh, we'll be having sex with robots
 We get a couple of hours
 As soon as you guys leave the press conference actually
 It's true though. There was there was a very famous book sex and robots or sex with robots and
 They say roughly the year 2050 will be when we'll be properly getting into bad wood robots
 There's a reason to stay healthy for all of us
 Hold on tight guys
 Only 35 more years
 Another creepy robot is this robot called pepper which was made in Japan is like most of the most advanced robots are and
 So a thousand versions of pepper went up for sale last year
 And they went on for sale for a thousand pounds each equivalent and they sold out within a minute
 So very sought after and I was watching a video of the woman who's explaining what's so good about pepper
 And it's a robot for your house who can be your friend
 So it's an emotional social robot who can kind of respond to your emotions sense your emotions calm you down
 Make you feel better and she said
 One of the things she said was it will introduce games into the family that you can play together or take pictures of your children when you're not at home
 One of the games it plays is um
 So then there's an example of this robot interacting and it decides to play a game with someone. So it says uh
 On three we each take a deep breath and see who can hold it the longest
 I saw when I was in Australia there was an ad on tv for a new tracking device called trackoo
 And the idea is that trackoo can be put it's got magnetic little bits
 So you can put on the inside of a car or you can put it in your grandfather's pocket
 Or you can put it in it's saying
 Basically it was an advert saying you can stalk you can stalk and no one will know
 But they kept going trackoo
 This is like this little cute thing and there was a grandfather going where are I am?
 It goes on cars you can put it in a wallet you can put someone's hair you can put it in a fish tank
 You can put it in a commission
 trackoo
 He's put it in a fish tank
 Just in case your fish goes missing
 In case your fish goes missing and takes the tracking device away
 We're having that poor dentist in Nemo
 It's such a good point
 That would have been a much shorter film if they'd had your ingenious trackoo
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski
 Yep, my fact is that a fifth of America's meals are eaten in cars
 That's so interesting
 Yeah, it's really interesting isn't it
 But yes, it's study done and another thing that this either this study or another study at the same time found
 Was that 31% of people in America say they have never eaten a meal in their cars
 So there's obviously some people really bringing up that average
 Who were just like every single time they cook a roast they go to their car
 A lot of themselves in
 Well, it's a big drive-through nation isn't it?
 Yeah, I think it's that, yeah
 Do they say if that's actually what it is?
 That is what it is, yeah, so it's eating fast
 But it's the next address and I'll say okay, so it must be the roasts going into the night
 There's a national drive-through day in America
 Yeah, it's July 24th and it's it's one of those ones that isn't obviously officially recognized
 But it's one it will sort of trend on Twitter and everyone be going
 Celebrate it like international potato day or whatever
 I think it was made up by I comment what the first the company that pioneered drive-through was
 But it went out of business in the 80s
 But I think it was them that made up national drive-through day in order to
 boost their business, wasn't it?
 Yeah, was it the in-and-out trade?
 No, I think that's one of those robot dolls
 So this is a thing, this is in the UK actually
 Two-thirds of motorists say they've eaten while driving
 And 55% of motorists think that eating while driving should be illegal
 So obviously most of the people who are eating while driving are going I wish they'd ban this
 I think it kind of is illegal, isn't it?
 It might be, yeah, I think if you're not in full control of the car
 It's up to the police really but if they see you eating a kick out or something or a banana
 And then I'm sorry
 Ah, just two of the many wonderful foods you've been enjoying this great mission
 James, I genuinely yesterday read a story of a lady who got a ticket for peeling up a banana while she was driving so you're on it
 Thanks, Dan
 Yeah, so if they think that by doing that you're not in full control then they can pull you over
 It depends on how you're peeling a banana or it depends on if you're going at 90 miles an hour on the motorway
 And you think that banana is looking a bit too rap for my liking
 And they're enough, you're not in full control
 Do you know the bananas used to come wrapped in foil?
 Did they?
 Yes, considering they have their own wrapping already
 Yeah, when they first came over here they were wrapped
 Oh my god, yeah, that's kind of like past the parcel then
 Well, the worst getting the past parcel
 There's only two rappings and it's always up and up
 Maybe people used to eat the skin
 Until we saw monkeys taking it off and then we realised
 Um, fewer the dry-through things
 Oh yeah
 So the first ever dry-through, do you know what it was?
 It was a bank
 Ah, really?
 It was in Chicago, it was in 1946
 I have another one from 5,200 years ago
 Well, okay
 So I'm going to say that's the second ever dry-through
 No, there's like an old kind of place in Iran called Godin Tepe
 And they're not 100% sure that it was a dry-through
 But they think it was because of-
 I'm going to be all over this, James
 I'm going to give this fact a very hard time in these
 Well, it's because of the height of the window
 And because the rooms seem to have been used as a place to keep things
 And it was for bullets and ammunition
 That soldiers would go through
 5,000 years ago, they had bullets
 Yeah, what?
 Bullets were invented way before guns, because bullets is just-
 What did you just throw at people?
 Well, before-
 Come on, wait till I have something to put this in, you're in trouble
 Well, before they invented guns, the work bullet was just a projectile
 A stone, it was a stone
 Check out my drill and make it a pebble
 So there's like room
 There's like noises as they throw them
 There's a room with some stones in it
 And you're claiming it's a dry-through view
 That sounds like an archaeologist
 who needs more funding and is going nothing is right
 We found some bullets for a drive-through
 Okay, let's hear about your bank
 They found a room with a loaded money here
 That's it, you just drove up and took money out or deposited it
 But it was in Chicago
 Did you have to show any identification or anything?
 Or it was just a free one on a business very fast
 First, well, the first restaurant was in 1947
 Oh, okay
 And they used to, instead of driving through, you would just drive up
 Well, you would drive through, but they would have waiters outside taking your order
 and carrying them inside
 And bringing your food out to your car
 It's quite nice
 It's just a way of getting your staff cold
 I've found a few weird drive-thrues that actually exist in America at the moment
 I think a couple of them have gone defunct
 but if they have it only in the last few years
 So these are for people who just wanted to make life easier for everyone
 There's a drive-thru funeral parlor
 And this is genuinely real
 You drive up and the person of your who you love is just in a window
 As you go by and you pay respects as you go by in the window
 And you form a queue with the cars
 And you just sort of go by and then drive on
 So there's a drive-thru, I swear to God it's real
 Are they wearing one of those McDonald's outfits?
 No, I don't think so
 Helled up my strings
 My chicken sandwich in one hand
 No, it's a yeah, it's a funeral parlor drive-thru
 There's an emergency services drive-thru
 So you just come up in the car and a doctor quickly comes and helps you with any problem that you have
 So that you're sick, but you're still driving
 When they're maybe so badly sick that you have to go to the car
 Yeah, yeah, so you drive through and they can quickly just help you out
 And that is really bad, they put you in the funeral once
 And this one's amazing, there's a drive-thru bar
 That's sort of you alcohol, but you can take it
 Really? I don't think they've thought that one properly through
 Yeah, you just buy, I'll just have a pint of vodka
 Just a normal drink
 This is when they want more, you know when the police want to get more ticks on their people arrested
 They just plant policemen, two yards up the road presumably
 And then, I guess so
 They've got some arrests under their belt
 I was just looking at fast food
 Have you guys ever heard of a yalc?
 No
 A yoke? Oh, I just realized I've just got what it's called that and it's a yoke
 Is it a part of an egg?
 Yeah, I did come across them
 No, we're the W
 So this is the latest fast food and it's a runny pre-cooked boiled egg with pre-cut soldiers in it
 And a spoof, which is a spoon that includes a tooth to help you crack the shell
 And you say, wow, this is what you have to do
 You buy the package with the egg in it, you open the egg, you pour boiling water on it, leave it for five minutes
 And then you've got your egg
 It's amazing because that takes longer to make than in actual way
 It literally takes longer to make
 Yeah, the guy said all you need is access to boiling water
 And now you can enjoy a delicious yoke wherever you want in just five minutes
 That's yeah, that's just a boiled egg, isn't it?
 Yeah, it comes with toe soldiers
 It does come with soldiers, yeah
 But do you have to toast them?
 I think the soldiers are not toasted
 But I don't toast my soldiers anyway, so that's not a problem for me
 Well, then they're not toe soldiers
 I call them soldiers
 They're brits of aliens
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number three
 And that is James
 Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous job in Britain is that of a hairdresser
 Why?
 So this isn't the most people that die
 It's most kind of accidents or injuries
 And hairdressers and beauticians are by far the most likely to suffer an accident
 Most commonly cutting themselves
 But it's construction which kills most people
 Definitely by the most by absolute numbers
 I would say like if you're a trollerman or something
 Probably a lot of people die with that as well
 But I'm going from accident only and that is hairdresser
 There is actually one
 Genuinely quite dangerous hairdresser
 Oh yeah
 Albert Olmeido
 And he's in Madrid
 And he only cuts hair with samurai swords or a blowtorch
 Wow
 Does it give you the option when you come in?
 Will it be today the blowtorch or the samurai sword?
 I think we'll be able to pay extra for the blowtorch
 I don't know but he swipes
 It looks really cool actually
 He swipes he has two samurai swords that he cuts your hair with
 And he swipes them in opposite directions
 At the back of your head
 And he says it's useful because you can do both sides at once
 Wow
 That sounds incredibly dangerous
 Yeah, that doesn't it
 Because what if you mistorch someone's head
 Under the hair and they have a really protruberant back of the head
 It's when you ask for a bit off the top and he literally takes you in the top
 I think there might be a slightly more dangerous hairdresser out there
 He's a Chinese hairdresser called Tianhao
 And how he does it is he likes to to feel the energy of the hair
 And not have any influence of say sight
 So he closes his eyes
 And he starts chopping hair with his eyes closed
 So he'll just feel it
 And he's very popular in China
 Yeah, yeah, he does really well
 Yeah, good Jedi hairdresser
 Yes, exactly
 So there was a rumor going around Cambodia
 A few dozen years ago
 And that was that the president who's called Nora Damishihunuk
 He'd had a dream in which all the long-haired virgins in the country
 Will be taken to hell by an evil god
 Okay, he was kind of quite revered or at least feared at the time
 And everyone kind of half believed this thing that all the long-haired virgins would be taken to hell
 And so all the virgins with long hair caught all their hair
 And all the people who wanted people to think they were virgins and had long-haired
 They had their hair caught as well
 Okay, so there's a massive kind of epidemic of women having their hair caught in Cambodia
 And according to the police at the time
 They said that it was a rumor started by corrupt hairdressers
 Wow
 Very clever
 So hairdressers are very widely trusted
 Supposedly, this has been in the news in the last two days, there's been a big survey
 By Ipsosmore, so it's a legit one
 And it's their veracity index, which they do over a year
 And apparently the most trusted profession is hairdressers
 69% of people would trust their hairdresser to tell the truth
 Really?
 68% for the police
 And newsreaders are only on 65 and then journalists and politicians are way down
 They're on the 20s of percent
 That's so weird
 I don't think I trust my hairdresser to tell the truth
 Really?
 Well they've been saying I look great
 Their job is to get to the end of a cut and go
 Yeah, that's fantastic
 You know it can't, they can't have got to write every time
 Yeah, you never hear them going
 Oh, I've really cocked this up
 There's actually a hairdressing Cardiff now, a Bauhaus hairdresser
 I think it is, which offers a special quiet chair that you can nominate to be
 And if you don't fancy the terrible hairdresser's small talk
 If you don't have a holiday book about year or
 Yeah, yeah, didn't go on one last year
 Yeah, and the person the manager is so he's very relaxed about it
 He says they can change their mind to any time
 Halfway through the cut if they feel suddenly feel like a chinwag
 But if you're in that chair, they will not say a word to you
 The the owner of that one is I think he's called Scott Miller
 And he said I always say if you're asking your client where they're going on a holiday, you've lost
 So I think they're quite nice standards for hairdressing compensation these days
 Yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, where am I going to get to brag about my holidays
 The last time I had my hair cut, it was by, I was in a city that I don't live in
 And the woman who caught my hair was a regional finalist in that national hairdressing championships
 Really?
 Yeah, yeah, really?
 I mean, she was a finalist, she wasn't a winner
 But she told me all sorts of stuff about the history of hairdressing
 And she told me that there's a UK president of hairdressing
 Oh, is that?
 Yeah
 And there's a fellowship of British hairdressing, which I didn't know either
 Yeah, there's also a male hairdresser of the year
 There's also female hairdresser of the year
 It's the big hairdresser awards that happened at the end of the year each year
 And in 2005, I was looking through the list of all the people at one
 2005, the winner was a guy called Brent Barber
 Wow
 That's a cool name
 That's a really cool name
 And this is, this is interesting
 I was reading about different kinds of hair that get done that aren't on human heads
 And Madame Two Swords have hairdressers that actually do the hair of the wax works
 And in fact, the twiggy wax work that was done, the hairdresser who does twiggy's hair
 came in to do twiggy's wax work hair as well
 To give it the cut, to make it look like it would on twiggy
 Which is quite cool
 Did you know it was wax work?
 Or did you go away like twiggy's in a bad mood today?
 I said, what are you going on your holidays?
 But just as a sideline fact, I discovered that
 when Madame Two Swords wax works are made now
 And I think this has always been the case, they make them two inches bigger
 The whole body two inches bigger because the wax shrinks over time
 And that brings them to the actual size of the person
 And you were telling me today that after the age of 30 you shrink
 by one-sixteenth of an inch every year
 Every year, yep
 So they'd have to shave bits off the wax works as well every year
 Another one-sixteenth off
 Yes, although I learned that on Oprah about 15 years ago
 And it's just one of those facts that stays with you
 And I haven't checked it
 So they're in all now
 So
 It's true though, it's the discs in between your back vertebrae
 It could be true
 In ancient Rome, they had a job called an onatrix
 And this was a lady who would look after the hair of another lady
 And it would be coloring a lot of the thing that they did was coloring
 So if you wanted black hair
 Then you had to put a mixture of bile rotten leeches
 And squid ink
 And your hair would make it go black
 Cool
 And if you wanted blonde, it was a mixture of pigeon poo and ashes
 I think I'll stay with a natural dude, actually
 Barbers used to offer castrations as well
 Is that true?
 Well there's medieval China
 Oh
 So
 Yes
 Friggin family of true
 Yes
 No, it was, they did Unix
 Yeah
 Sure, the Unix are the ones that don't need it
 Sorry
 They need components
 We say that if we said before that Chinese Unix would carry around the testicles
 To be realising with them in the afterlife
 Yes, I think so
 And there was one of the most famous Unix
 Who was one of the last Unix
 To punish him for something they stole his bits
 And it was like, he just thought it was the end of the world for him
 Because he would never be able to be brought back
 What?
 As a whole
 That is mean
 Real mean
 Do you know the first ever proper QI fact that I ever found when I was working on the TV show
 It's actually to do with Chinese hairdressers
 And it was Malsi Tong's hairdresser
 Yeah, I was reading a biography and it turned out that his hairdresser was called Big Beard Wang
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show
 And that is my fact
 My fact this week is that Elvis Presley once started a riot
 At the end of his show by saying to the crowd
 Girls, I'll see you all backstage
 Wow, yeah, I know you all went
 They all went
 In that moment, so this was back in 1955
 This was kind of just as he was reaching
 His first sort of wave of popularity
 And he, he didn't realize that that would be the reaction once he said it
 So he just said this line girls, I'll see you all backstage
 And they literally just fled on to stage
 Just like they just went right on
 And he got scared and he had to run off to his little green room
 They were ripping off his clothes
 He was missing a shoe, he was missing the side of his shirt
 And they locked him inside the back room and no one could get to him
 And eventually when it calmed down and he went to his car
 His car in the side metal of the car
 There were names and numbers scratched into the side
 And they couldn't see through the windscreen
 Because so much lipstick was on it
 With names and numbers for him to call
 And also 500 truckos
 Wow, that was the moment that his manager
 "Okay, we've got a massive star on our hands here"
 And yeah, that's when he got really promoted
 Wow, I remember when we were filming QI once
 And Justin Bieber was in the studios
 He was doing something next star
 And it was crazy
 Though it was just unbelievable
 They had so much security there
 Every time you walked past a window
 All they had to do was see a little bit of hair
 And they would scream
 It was great fun because you just kind of peek your head around
 And then they got...
 And you were a powerful physical resemblance to the bearded
 This was with Justin Bieber
 They did experience serious problems with that
 When the concerts would happen
 Because if he arrived late
 Or if they told that they were told it was too chaotic
 Because actually so many fans were coming to the show
 They would say, "Okay, we're cutting this short
 Or Justin's not going to be able to appear
 And they would start rioting
 And unlike a normal show where people would riot
 Who are of adult age
 The police just had no idea
 What do you do when you're being attacked by children?
 You can't do anything, you just have to accept it
 That's what you need the robots, probably
 Yeah, take photos of them
 I don't know
 I'll just shut them up
 Did you guys hear about David Spargo?
 I bet you must have done that
 Okay, he's a super fan of the Australian band "Peaking Duck"
 Who I assume are some kind of
 Popular beatcom though, aren't they?
 But they were playing in Melbourne
 And he decided that he wanted to get backstage and meet his heroes
 And so he went backstage and the security said to him
 "No, you can't come in"
 And he's like, "No, I've got to come in, I'm the lead singer's stepbrother
 And they're like, "Well, do you have any proof?"
 He said, "Yeah, yeah, look on Wikipedia"
 And he brought it up
 And he just changed Wikipedia
 Two minutes earlier to say that he was that guy
 Is that stepbrother?
 And he got in
 And he got some meters
 Heroes
 Wow, that is nice
 Okay, yeah, have you heard of...
 There's a Beatles fan called Jan Myers
 And she was a super fan in the days when they were first becoming popular
 And she crawled through the sewers under Abbey Road
 To hear them recording "Rubba Soul"
 Through the wall
 Oh, wow
 Yeah, I think she's writing a book now about being a super fan
 But at the time she was a fan
 They weren't super famous here
 And the first time she got an autograph from Paul McCartney
 He wrote Paul McCartney brackets the Beatles
 Yeah, so he really won't well known
 They actually met Elvis once, didn't they?
 And it sounds like the most awkward occasion ever
 So yeah, yeah, and apparently they just had nothing to talk about
 Their press officer wrote about it years later
 I said it was incredibly awkward
 They had this weird small talk
 There were long, long silences
 And eventually someone obviously freaking out
 Maybe the press officer freaked out
 I thought I've got to do something
 So he brought in a load of guitars
 And the Beatles just started playing some music
 And everything calmed down a bit
 And then later on Elvis bitched about the Beatles, I think
 To Nixon
 Yeah, oh, that's what
 Yeah, he didn't bitch to Nixon
 That'll see you
 That's a big bitch
 He said he thought the Beatles were un-American
 Because of their stance on Vietnam
 Yeah, it's true, no, it's bitching
 Yeah, I guess so
 He didn't mean un-American and that's a good thing
 He's talking to the president of the US
 I found this fact, by the way, about the backstage thing with Elvis
 And weirdly not in an Elvis Presley book
 But I've been reading a biography on David Bowie
 Called "Ziggyology" and a big influence on David Bowie was Elvis
 And there was incredible facts in this book
 I just kept coming across amazing little nuggets about Elvis
 This is my favorite one and this is the exact wording
 Elvis' conception was so seismic
 His father blacked out after the moment of climax
 Do you mean "Fell asleep" because it's
 No, apparently you just blacked out
 And "Fell" had to be sort of brought to...brought to
 I think it was Elvis's mother that said that
 And she should know
 Yeah, that's true
 So he was mental, I didn't quite realise how mental Elvis was
 Although I guess maybe everyone else did
 But for instance, the time he met Nixon was because
 He was determined that he collected police badges
 And he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
 And I think he thought that meant that he could cross any borders
 With any substances at all and he's wearing the badge and that was fine
 So he got one of those off Nixon
 That's the only reason for meeting the president
 He used to visit one of his favourite past times apparently
 He was visiting the Memphis Mork to look at corpses
 Was that a drive-through one or was that...
 He wants...oh I like this image
 He was once with Tom Jones backstage
 And he serenaded Tom Jones while Tom Jones was naked in the shower
 So Tom Jones said I think he was checking me out
 So that could have been a romance that never happened
 Wow, wow
 We need to wrap up fairly soon, I've got just a couple more things
 A slightly side-tracking but as I say I got this fact from a Ziggy Stardust book
 And I found out this really great fact that I think people should know about
 David Bowie, that's not his real name
 His real name is David Jones
 And the reason he had to change his name from David Jones to David Bowie
 Is because of the Monkeys
 Yes, David Jones from the Monkeys
 David Jones from the Monkeys
 So he was trying to make it bigger as a musician
 Didn't work, so he went to David Bowie
 But David Bowie wasn't the first name that he went to before he went to David Bowie
 The first name he picked after David Jones was Tom Jones
 And then a couple of weeks later this new singer came along
 And he went, oh Jesus Christ, and then had to change it to David Bowie
 He went on someone else called Tom Jones would come along
 Yeah, and they'd do a murder name
 No, BING, NO!
 And the riot begins
