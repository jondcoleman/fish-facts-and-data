00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi guys, just to let you know it is our hundredth episode coming up this Friday"
00:00:04,00:00:10,So to celebrate that this Thursday the 11th of February we're going to do an AMA on Reddit and ask me anything
00:00:10,00:00:14,Where you can rock up and ask us anything will be there for a couple of hours
00:00:14,00:00:21,Whatever you've ever wanted to ask us do it there. It's going to be 5 p.m. This Thursday 5 p.m. G.m. T
00:00:21,00:00:28,That is midday Eastern standard time and if you go to qi.com for us that reddit you'll be able to find it easily. See you there
00:00:28,00:00:47,"Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Birmingham Mac"
00:00:47,00:00:53,My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to the stage. It's the other three elves Andy Murray James Arkin and Anna Chazinski
00:00:53,00:01:08,And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order
00:01:08,00:01:15,Here we go starting with you Andrew Montemorey my fact this week is that a New Zealand firm has developed an
00:01:15,00:01:25,irrationally angry robot to train tell us ale stuff so it's so it calls the telly sale staff
00:01:25,00:01:31,"Yeah, I mean it has to be programmed to do it. It can't just regular at night time or something"
00:01:31,00:01:36,"Oh, okay. So yeah, the firm is called touchpoint and basically they've developed this"
00:01:36,00:01:42,machine which can simulate an angry customer and it takes data from all the worst
00:01:42,00:01:48,customer calls where people are really furious and then they sort of determine the factors which you
00:01:48,00:01:55,know you could be set off by and then the telly sales person who's being trained has to try and calm the machine down
00:01:55,00:02:06,Do we know how the anger manifests itself? Does it start a tap physically? It's nothing physical it's mind games
00:02:08,00:02:14,A lot of passive aggressiveness. How twisted are people? I think it's a lot of shouting at insults basically
00:02:14,00:02:22,Wow does it sound like a robot? I suspect not because that would negate the point of it being a training thing
00:02:22,00:02:28,"But then they so they must have someone recording all the audio to then yeah, I think so yeah"
00:02:28,00:02:32,"Wow, yeah, it is irrational anger right and people go mad about cold callers"
00:02:32,00:02:37,And the thing apparently so there's a survey done recently and cold calling was voted the most
00:02:37,00:02:42,annoying thing about the UK which I mean there's some bad stuff going on in this country
00:02:42,00:02:44,Everyone calm down
00:02:44,00:02:48,But the most annoying thing about cold calling is
00:02:48,00:02:53,Cold-cola chaminas the false chaminas that you get I got a call call this morning
00:02:53,00:02:59,"Someone who said did you have an accident in the car that wasn't your fault? Okay, did you?"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"And what I played along for a moment I said yes, I did"
00:03:02,00:03:04,"Oh, and then she said did you?"
00:03:04,00:03:08,Not literally the first person
00:03:08,00:03:13,"Yeah, she was really it took her ages to say anything because she was so surprised"
00:03:13,00:03:15,And she said did you and I said no not really
00:03:15,00:03:19,I got one last night and
00:03:19,00:03:25,It's so it said hi we understand that you've had an accident recently and and you should be making a claim on it
00:03:25,00:03:30,"And I thought oh this is a robot so I just went and stayed silent yeah, and then it went"
00:03:31,00:03:37,"Hello, and I went and then it went hi you still there. I thought oh god, it's an actual human"
00:03:37,00:03:40,"Oh, it's sorry, and then it started talking and I was like it got me"
00:03:40,00:03:45,"Hey, I is so good now that it yeah, yeah, they predicted that moment"
00:03:45,00:03:51,"Yeah, so it's like the the Turing test where if you can have a conversation with a machine"
00:03:51,00:03:54,But you think it's a human then that the machines have won as the
00:03:54,00:03:58,I'm not the bar
00:03:59,00:04:04,So there is a software that can tell from my voice when I'm on the phone whether I'm angry or not
00:04:04,00:04:09,"Okay, and they use these and tell ourselves and so they'll have a computer in front of them"
00:04:09,00:04:14,And I'll ring them up and get really angry and passive aggressive and then their computer will say he's getting angry
00:04:14,00:04:17,He's getting really angry. You better do something about this. Oh wow
00:04:17,00:04:21,And then they have to keep it below a certain level as if they don't know that you're angry. Yeah
00:04:21,00:04:24,I did quite well
00:04:25,00:04:31,Telling salesperson on the floor just sobbing and they're in the computer's helpfully saying he's a little bit pissed off of you
00:04:31,00:04:37,"But it's amazing that computers can tell if you're angry. Yeah, that's very good"
00:04:37,00:04:41,There's apparently you can tell if someone's angry by the way they use their mouse
00:04:41,00:04:45,Um to an 80% accuracy you can like smashing you around the head with it
00:04:45,00:04:49,But I think just how you click on the things and stuff like that they can tell
00:04:49,00:04:53,You click on I'm really angry
00:04:53,00:05:02,"They can tell frustration, sadness, fear and depression with more than 80% accuracy just by the way you use your mouse"
00:05:02,00:05:03,Wow
00:05:03,00:05:08,"Yeah, so there is a thing about the computers being angry and whether they should be made whether we should make angry"
00:05:08,00:05:16,Machines basically because one one school of thought is that it's quite a good idea to make computers that can simulate anger
00:05:16,00:05:19,And that the ones you would need to worry about are the ones that don't simulate anger
00:05:19,00:05:24,That's not one of the movies tell me but if robots take over the world they're usually pretty angry
00:05:24,00:05:26,Think about the terminator robots. They're not angry. They're just doing a job
00:05:26,00:05:31,Whereas if Arnie was really emotional in terminator then you'd know
00:05:31,00:05:34,He's vulnerable you can you've got a weakness you can play with
00:05:34,00:05:38,"Yeah, but we can't really make them angry at the moment because we just we're just programming"
00:05:38,00:05:40,Angry sounding responses into them um
00:05:40,00:05:44,And you know doesn't swear at you when you're not telling it to
00:05:44,00:05:47,Send you poo in the post or something
00:05:48,00:05:50,That's your program
00:05:50,00:05:52,Which is which is the only reason I can assume that I keep receiving it
00:05:52,00:06:02,There was a really creepy robot telemarketer that lots of people were writing online about called Samantha West
00:06:02,00:06:06,And this was in the US and I think she was selling health insurance and she denied
00:06:06,00:06:13,Vassiferously that she was a robot and so Pete these and I think it was the Washington Post or one of the US newspapers got
00:06:13,00:06:17,Realized this got a call from her and they all called has said are you a robot?
00:06:17,00:06:21,"And she kept on saying no, I'm a real person. Maybe there's something wrong with the line"
00:06:21,00:06:25,"Can you hear me? Okay, and they go you'd really sound like a robot and she'd say I understand"
00:06:25,00:06:32,But perhaps there's a fault with the line and they eventually called and like pressed all the buttons until they got through to a real person and said look
00:06:32,00:06:36,That's a robot claiming to be a person working. I know I'm not into that at all. It's really weird
00:06:36,00:06:40,And uh the person said we do not have any robots here. There's no robot working here
00:06:40,00:06:44,And the next day the number of hers have been discontinued
00:06:44,00:06:48,But I do wonder maybe that just was a real person on their first day
00:06:48,00:06:52,"Who was like, I didn't want to deviate from the scripts"
00:06:52,00:06:57,"That was really really nervous and sent all these people going you're a fucking robot, okay"
00:06:57,00:07:04,"Oh, no, and that's why I should quit the next day. Oh, there was a guy who got fired because he put on a robotic sounding"
00:07:04,00:07:05,boys
00:07:05,00:07:09,To get through his calls faster because people assume if they're talking to a machine
00:07:09,00:07:13,"They'll just say yes, no and uh option C and he didn't want to do any of the fake chaminous"
00:07:14,00:07:17,"So he just put on a metallic voice. Yeah, but he got fired for it"
00:07:17,00:07:21,So ironically his job will have now gone to a machine
00:07:21,00:07:26,So you can get therapeutic robots have you seen this?
00:07:26,00:07:29,It's quite normal. There's one in particular is called paro
00:07:29,00:07:34,And they've made this robot to help people who are suffering from they've had some trauma
00:07:34,00:07:36,And it's shaped like a seal
00:07:36,00:07:43,And the reason it's shaped like a seal is because the guy who invented it says people are unlikely to have had bad memories of real
00:07:43,00:07:45,Seals
00:07:45,00:07:53,"It's fair enough I think but seals are quite you know, they can attack people so it's just that most people don't come up against seals that often"
00:07:53,00:07:55,There are so many things that fall into that category
00:07:55,00:07:59,Every if you bad memories of octopuses or the planet Mars
00:07:59,00:08:06,"Arnold Schwarzenegger actually, I mean while we're on robots, there is one subject. I think we've been dancing around"
00:08:06,00:08:09,Which is sex with robots
00:08:10,00:08:13,"Just all right, maybe maybe I'm the only one who's been dancing around it"
00:08:13,00:08:18,I just wanted to tell you about a story from Malaysia
00:08:18,00:08:21,This is from the newspaper free Malaysia today from October
00:08:21,00:08:23,and
00:08:23,00:08:28,It goes like this this proposed conference on love and sex with robots is illegal
00:08:28,00:08:30,Inspector general of police
00:08:30,00:08:35,Khalid Abu Bakar told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur and action will be taken against the organizers if they go ahead
00:08:35,00:08:38,There's nothing scientific about sex and robots
00:08:38,00:08:42,"It's an offense to have extra marital sex in Malaysia, especially with robots"
00:08:42,00:08:48,It's true. It was called the Congress on love and sex with robots
00:08:48,00:08:53,And I think people just saw the title and just saw the last three words sex with robots. It's a word congress
00:08:53,00:08:55,Congress
00:08:55,00:09:00,That's true. There's a group called the campaign against sex robots
00:09:00,00:09:05,They're a growing group to stop people from actually having sex with robots in the future
00:09:05,00:09:10,"And there are people who are saying, you know, we should make laws against this right now"
00:09:10,00:09:14,And there was an article about it and there was some people who commented on the bottom of it
00:09:14,00:09:19,One person Chrysler Harper said if I want to have sex with my robot then I will
00:09:19,00:09:26,"My husband is always willing, but he isn't always that this idea is stupid"
00:09:26,00:09:30,"The most advanced rebel, most people have is a hoover which I bet was what she's talking about"
00:09:32,00:09:39,And then someone called Manjeet replied to that saying sex robots would at least not be as destructive as an atomic bomb
00:09:39,00:09:45,"Very true. A lot of scientists do say, oh, we'll be having sex with robots"
00:09:45,00:09:47,We get a couple of hours
00:09:47,00:09:49,As soon as you guys leave the press conference actually
00:09:49,00:09:56,It's true though. There was there was a very famous book sex and robots or sex with robots and
00:09:57,00:10:03,They say roughly the year 2050 will be when we'll be properly getting into bad wood robots
00:10:03,00:10:06,There's a reason to stay healthy for all of us
00:10:06,00:10:09,Hold on tight guys
00:10:09,00:10:10,Only 35 more years
00:10:10,00:10:17,Another creepy robot is this robot called pepper which was made in Japan is like most of the most advanced robots are and
00:10:17,00:10:20,So a thousand versions of pepper went up for sale last year
00:10:20,00:10:24,And they went on for sale for a thousand pounds each equivalent and they sold out within a minute
00:10:24,00:10:29,So very sought after and I was watching a video of the woman who's explaining what's so good about pepper
00:10:29,00:10:31,And it's a robot for your house who can be your friend
00:10:31,00:10:36,So it's an emotional social robot who can kind of respond to your emotions sense your emotions calm you down
00:10:36,00:10:38,Make you feel better and she said
00:10:38,00:10:45,One of the things she said was it will introduce games into the family that you can play together or take pictures of your children when you're not at home
00:10:45,00:10:51,One of the games it plays is um
00:10:51,00:10:55,So then there's an example of this robot interacting and it decides to play a game with someone. So it says uh
00:10:55,00:10:59,On three we each take a deep breath and see who can hold it the longest
00:10:59,00:11:12,I saw when I was in Australia there was an ad on tv for a new tracking device called trackoo
00:11:12,00:11:16,And the idea is that trackoo can be put it's got magnetic little bits
00:11:16,00:11:20,So you can put on the inside of a car or you can put it in your grandfather's pocket
00:11:20,00:11:21,Or you can put it in it's saying
00:11:21,00:11:26,Basically it was an advert saying you can stalk you can stalk and no one will know
00:11:26,00:11:28,But they kept going trackoo
00:11:28,00:11:32,This is like this little cute thing and there was a grandfather going where are I am?
00:11:32,00:11:36,It goes on cars you can put it in a wallet you can put someone's hair you can put it in a fish tank
00:11:36,00:11:37,You can put it in a commission
00:11:37,00:11:39,trackoo
00:11:39,00:11:41,He's put it in a fish tank
00:11:41,00:11:44,Just in case your fish goes missing
00:11:45,00:11:48,In case your fish goes missing and takes the tracking device away
00:11:48,00:11:51,We're having that poor dentist in Nemo
00:11:51,00:11:52,It's such a good point
00:11:52,00:11:55,That would have been a much shorter film if they'd had your ingenious trackoo
00:11:55,00:12:03,"Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski"
00:12:03,00:12:08,"Yep, my fact is that a fifth of America's meals are eaten in cars"
00:12:08,00:12:11,That's so interesting
00:12:11,00:12:12,"Yeah, it's really interesting isn't it"
00:12:13,00:12:19,"But yes, it's study done and another thing that this either this study or another study at the same time found"
00:12:19,00:12:24,Was that 31% of people in America say they have never eaten a meal in their cars
00:12:24,00:12:27,So there's obviously some people really bringing up that average
00:12:27,00:12:30,Who were just like every single time they cook a roast they go to their car
00:12:30,00:12:33,A lot of themselves in
00:12:33,00:12:36,"Well, it's a big drive-through nation isn't it?"
00:12:36,00:12:37,"Yeah, I think it's that, yeah"
00:12:37,00:12:39,Do they say if that's actually what it is?
00:12:39,00:12:41,"That is what it is, yeah, so it's eating fast"
00:12:41,00:12:45,"But it's the next address and I'll say okay, so it must be the roasts going into the night"
00:12:45,00:12:48,There's a national drive-through day in America
00:12:48,00:12:55,"Yeah, it's July 24th and it's it's one of those ones that isn't obviously officially recognized"
00:12:55,00:12:57,But it's one it will sort of trend on Twitter and everyone be going
00:12:57,00:13:01,Celebrate it like international potato day or whatever
00:13:01,00:13:06,I think it was made up by I comment what the first the company that pioneered drive-through was
00:13:06,00:13:08,But it went out of business in the 80s
00:13:08,00:13:11,But I think it was them that made up national drive-through day in order to
00:13:11,00:13:12,"boost their business, wasn't it?"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"Yeah, was it the in-and-out trade?"
00:13:14,00:13:17,"No, I think that's one of those robot dolls"
00:13:17,00:13:22,"So this is a thing, this is in the UK actually"
00:13:22,00:13:25,Two-thirds of motorists say they've eaten while driving
00:13:25,00:13:30,And 55% of motorists think that eating while driving should be illegal
00:13:30,00:13:34,So obviously most of the people who are eating while driving are going I wish they'd ban this
00:13:34,00:13:38,"I think it kind of is illegal, isn't it?"
00:13:38,00:13:41,"It might be, yeah, I think if you're not in full control of the car"
00:13:41,00:13:45,It's up to the police really but if they see you eating a kick out or something or a banana
00:13:45,00:13:47,And then I'm sorry
00:13:47,00:13:50,"Ah, just two of the many wonderful foods you've been enjoying this great mission"
00:13:50,00:13:57,"James, I genuinely yesterday read a story of a lady who got a ticket for peeling up a banana while she was driving so you're on it"
00:13:57,00:13:57,"Thanks, Dan"
00:13:57,00:14:04,"Yeah, so if they think that by doing that you're not in full control then they can pull you over"
00:14:04,00:14:11,It depends on how you're peeling a banana or it depends on if you're going at 90 miles an hour on the motorway
00:14:11,00:14:14,And you think that banana is looking a bit too rap for my liking
00:14:14,00:14:15,"And they're enough, you're not in full control"
00:14:15,00:14:18,Do you know the bananas used to come wrapped in foil?
00:14:18,00:14:19,Did they?
00:14:19,00:14:21,"Yes, considering they have their own wrapping already"
00:14:21,00:14:24,"Yeah, when they first came over here they were wrapped"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Oh my god, yeah, that's kind of like past the parcel then"
00:14:26,00:14:29,"Well, the worst getting the past parcel"
00:14:29,00:14:31,There's only two rappings and it's always up and up
00:14:33,00:14:35,Maybe people used to eat the skin
00:14:35,00:14:38,Until we saw monkeys taking it off and then we realised
00:14:38,00:14:40,"Um, fewer the dry-through things"
00:14:40,00:14:40,Oh yeah
00:14:40,00:14:42,"So the first ever dry-through, do you know what it was?"
00:14:42,00:14:44,It was a bank
00:14:44,00:14:46,"Ah, really?"
00:14:46,00:14:49,"It was in Chicago, it was in 1946"
00:14:49,00:14:52,"I have another one from 5,200 years ago"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"Well, okay"
00:14:53,00:14:58,So I'm going to say that's the second ever dry-through
00:15:00,00:15:06,"No, there's like an old kind of place in Iran called Godin Tepe"
00:15:06,00:15:08,And they're not 100% sure that it was a dry-through
00:15:08,00:15:10,But they think it was because of-
00:15:10,00:15:12,"I'm going to be all over this, James"
00:15:12,00:15:16,I'm going to give this fact a very hard time in these
00:15:16,00:15:18,"Well, it's because of the height of the window"
00:15:18,00:15:22,And because the rooms seem to have been used as a place to keep things
00:15:22,00:15:23,And it was for bullets and ammunition
00:15:23,00:15:25,That soldiers would go through
00:15:25,00:15:27,"5,000 years ago, they had bullets"
00:15:27,00:15:28,"Yeah, what?"
00:15:28,00:15:31,"Bullets were invented way before guns, because bullets is just-"
00:15:31,00:15:32,What did you just throw at people?
00:15:32,00:15:34,"Well, before-"
00:15:34,00:15:37,"Come on, wait till I have something to put this in, you're in trouble"
00:15:37,00:15:44,"Well, before they invented guns, the work bullet was just a projectile"
00:15:44,00:15:46,"A stone, it was a stone"
00:15:46,00:15:49,Check out my drill and make it a pebble
00:15:49,00:15:50,So there's like room
00:15:50,00:15:51,There's like noises as they throw them
00:15:51,00:15:53,There's a room with some stones in it
00:15:53,00:15:55,And you're claiming it's a dry-through view
00:15:55,00:15:58,That sounds like an archaeologist
00:15:58,00:16:00,who needs more funding and is going nothing is right
00:16:00,00:16:03,We found some bullets for a drive-through
00:16:03,00:16:07,"Okay, let's hear about your bank"
00:16:07,00:16:10,They found a room with a loaded money here
00:16:10,00:16:15,"That's it, you just drove up and took money out or deposited it"
00:16:15,00:16:17,But it was in Chicago
00:16:17,00:16:18,Did you have to show any identification or anything?
00:16:18,00:16:22,Or it was just a free one on a business very fast
00:16:22,00:16:26,"First, well, the first restaurant was in 1947"
00:16:26,00:16:27,"Oh, okay"
00:16:27,00:16:30,"And they used to, instead of driving through, you would just drive up"
00:16:30,00:16:35,"Well, you would drive through, but they would have waiters outside taking your order"
00:16:35,00:16:37,and carrying them inside
00:16:37,00:16:39,And bringing your food out to your car
00:16:39,00:16:40,It's quite nice
00:16:40,00:16:41,It's just a way of getting your staff cold
00:16:41,00:16:47,I've found a few weird drive-thrues that actually exist in America at the moment
00:16:47,00:16:49,I think a couple of them have gone defunct
00:16:49,00:16:51,but if they have it only in the last few years
00:16:51,00:16:55,So these are for people who just wanted to make life easier for everyone
00:16:55,00:16:58,There's a drive-thru funeral parlor
00:16:58,00:17:00,And this is genuinely real
00:17:00,00:17:05,You drive up and the person of your who you love is just in a window
00:17:05,00:17:09,As you go by and you pay respects as you go by in the window
00:17:09,00:17:10,And you form a queue with the cars
00:17:10,00:17:12,And you just sort of go by and then drive on
00:17:12,00:17:15,"So there's a drive-thru, I swear to God it's real"
00:17:15,00:17:17,Are they wearing one of those McDonald's outfits?
00:17:17,00:17:18,"No, I don't think so"
00:17:18,00:17:21,Helled up my strings
00:17:21,00:17:24,My chicken sandwich in one hand
00:17:25,00:17:28,"No, it's a yeah, it's a funeral parlor drive-thru"
00:17:28,00:17:31,There's an emergency services drive-thru
00:17:31,00:17:36,So you just come up in the car and a doctor quickly comes and helps you with any problem that you have
00:17:36,00:17:39,"So that you're sick, but you're still driving"
00:17:39,00:17:43,When they're maybe so badly sick that you have to go to the car
00:17:43,00:17:46,"Yeah, yeah, so you drive through and they can quickly just help you out"
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And that is really bad, they put you in the funeral once"
00:17:48,00:17:53,"And this one's amazing, there's a drive-thru bar"
00:17:53,00:17:55,"That's sort of you alcohol, but you can take it"
00:17:55,00:17:58,Really? I don't think they've thought that one properly through
00:17:58,00:18:01,"Yeah, you just buy, I'll just have a pint of vodka"
00:18:01,00:18:04,Just a normal drink
00:18:04,00:18:10,"This is when they want more, you know when the police want to get more ticks on their people arrested"
00:18:10,00:18:13,"They just plant policemen, two yards up the road presumably"
00:18:13,00:18:14,"And then, I guess so"
00:18:14,00:18:15,They've got some arrests under their belt
00:18:15,00:18:18,I was just looking at fast food
00:18:18,00:18:20,Have you guys ever heard of a yalc?
00:18:20,00:18:20,No
00:18:20,00:18:24,"A yoke? Oh, I just realized I've just got what it's called that and it's a yoke"
00:18:24,00:18:25,Is it a part of an egg?
00:18:25,00:18:28,"Yeah, I did come across them"
00:18:28,00:18:31,"No, we're the W"
00:18:31,00:18:37,So this is the latest fast food and it's a runny pre-cooked boiled egg with pre-cut soldiers in it
00:18:37,00:18:42,"And a spoof, which is a spoon that includes a tooth to help you crack the shell"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"And you say, wow, this is what you have to do"
00:18:45,00:18:50,"You buy the package with the egg in it, you open the egg, you pour boiling water on it, leave it for five minutes"
00:18:50,00:18:52,And then you've got your egg
00:18:52,00:18:55,It's amazing because that takes longer to make than in actual way
00:18:55,00:18:57,It literally takes longer to make
00:18:57,00:19:00,"Yeah, the guy said all you need is access to boiling water"
00:19:00,00:19:04,And now you can enjoy a delicious yoke wherever you want in just five minutes
00:19:04,00:19:07,"That's yeah, that's just a boiled egg, isn't it?"
00:19:07,00:19:10,"Yeah, it comes with toe soldiers"
00:19:10,00:19:11,"It does come with soldiers, yeah"
00:19:11,00:19:12,But do you have to toast them?
00:19:12,00:19:14,I think the soldiers are not toasted
00:19:14,00:19:16,"But I don't toast my soldiers anyway, so that's not a problem for me"
00:19:16,00:19:17,"Well, then they're not toe soldiers"
00:19:19,00:19:20,I call them soldiers
00:19:20,00:19:21,They're brits of aliens
00:19:21,00:19:30,"Okay, it's time to move on to fact number three"
00:19:30,00:19:31,And that is James
00:19:31,00:19:37,"Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous job in Britain is that of a hairdresser"
00:19:37,00:19:39,Why?
00:19:39,00:19:42,So this isn't the most people that die
00:19:42,00:19:45,It's most kind of accidents or injuries
00:19:46,00:19:50,And hairdressers and beauticians are by far the most likely to suffer an accident
00:19:50,00:19:52,Most commonly cutting themselves
00:19:52,00:19:55,But it's construction which kills most people
00:19:55,00:20:00,Definitely by the most by absolute numbers
00:20:00,00:20:02,I would say like if you're a trollerman or something
00:20:02,00:20:03,Probably a lot of people die with that as well
00:20:03,00:20:06,But I'm going from accident only and that is hairdresser
00:20:06,00:20:08,There is actually one
00:20:08,00:20:11,Genuinely quite dangerous hairdresser
00:20:11,00:20:12,Oh yeah
00:20:12,00:20:14,Albert Olmeido
00:20:14,00:20:15,And he's in Madrid
00:20:15,00:20:19,And he only cuts hair with samurai swords or a blowtorch
00:20:19,00:20:20,Wow
00:20:20,00:20:23,Does it give you the option when you come in?
00:20:23,00:20:27,Will it be today the blowtorch or the samurai sword?
00:20:27,00:20:30,I think we'll be able to pay extra for the blowtorch
00:20:30,00:20:31,I don't know but he swipes
00:20:31,00:20:33,It looks really cool actually
00:20:33,00:20:35,He swipes he has two samurai swords that he cuts your hair with
00:20:35,00:20:37,And he swipes them in opposite directions
00:20:37,00:20:38,At the back of your head
00:20:38,00:20:40,And he says it's useful because you can do both sides at once
00:20:40,00:20:42,Wow
00:20:42,00:20:43,That sounds incredibly dangerous
00:20:43,00:20:44,"Yeah, that doesn't it"
00:20:44,00:20:46,Because what if you mistorch someone's head
00:20:46,00:20:50,Under the hair and they have a really protruberant back of the head
00:20:50,00:20:54,It's when you ask for a bit off the top and he literally takes you in the top
00:20:54,00:20:58,I think there might be a slightly more dangerous hairdresser out there
00:20:58,00:21:01,He's a Chinese hairdresser called Tianhao
00:21:01,00:21:06,And how he does it is he likes to to feel the energy of the hair
00:21:06,00:21:10,And not have any influence of say sight
00:21:10,00:21:11,So he closes his eyes
00:21:11,00:21:14,And he starts chopping hair with his eyes closed
00:21:14,00:21:16,So he'll just feel it
00:21:16,00:21:17,And he's very popular in China
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Yeah, yeah, he does really well"
00:21:19,00:21:20,"Yeah, good Jedi hairdresser"
00:21:20,00:21:21,"Yes, exactly"
00:21:21,00:21:25,So there was a rumor going around Cambodia
00:21:25,00:21:28,A few dozen years ago
00:21:28,00:21:32,And that was that the president who's called Nora Damishihunuk
00:21:32,00:21:37,He'd had a dream in which all the long-haired virgins in the country
00:21:37,00:21:40,Will be taken to hell by an evil god
00:21:40,00:21:44,"Okay, he was kind of quite revered or at least feared at the time"
00:21:44,00:21:49,And everyone kind of half believed this thing that all the long-haired virgins would be taken to hell
00:21:49,00:21:52,And so all the virgins with long hair caught all their hair
00:21:52,00:21:56,And all the people who wanted people to think they were virgins and had long-haired
00:21:56,00:21:57,They had their hair caught as well
00:21:57,00:22:02,"Okay, so there's a massive kind of epidemic of women having their hair caught in Cambodia"
00:22:02,00:22:05,And according to the police at the time
00:22:05,00:22:08,They said that it was a rumor started by corrupt hairdressers
00:22:09,00:22:10,Wow
00:22:10,00:22:12,Very clever
00:22:12,00:22:15,So hairdressers are very widely trusted
00:22:15,00:22:18,"Supposedly, this has been in the news in the last two days, there's been a big survey"
00:22:18,00:22:21,"By Ipsosmore, so it's a legit one"
00:22:21,00:22:25,"And it's their veracity index, which they do over a year"
00:22:25,00:22:27,And apparently the most trusted profession is hairdressers
00:22:27,00:22:31,69% of people would trust their hairdresser to tell the truth
00:22:31,00:22:32,Really?
00:22:32,00:22:38,68% for the police
00:22:38,00:22:42,And newsreaders are only on 65 and then journalists and politicians are way down
00:22:42,00:22:44,They're on the 20s of percent
00:22:44,00:22:45,That's so weird
00:22:45,00:22:47,I don't think I trust my hairdresser to tell the truth
00:22:47,00:22:48,Really?
00:22:48,00:22:49,Well they've been saying I look great
00:22:49,00:22:54,Their job is to get to the end of a cut and go
00:22:54,00:22:55,"Yeah, that's fantastic"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"You know it can't, they can't have got to write every time"
00:22:57,00:22:58,"Yeah, you never hear them going"
00:22:58,00:23:00,"Oh, I've really cocked this up"
00:23:00,00:23:05,"There's actually a hairdressing Cardiff now, a Bauhaus hairdresser"
00:23:05,00:23:08,"I think it is, which offers a special quiet chair that you can nominate to be"
00:23:08,00:23:11,And if you don't fancy the terrible hairdresser's small talk
00:23:11,00:23:13,If you don't have a holiday book about year or
00:23:13,00:23:15,"Yeah, yeah, didn't go on one last year"
00:23:15,00:23:19,"Yeah, and the person the manager is so he's very relaxed about it"
00:23:19,00:23:21,He says they can change their mind to any time
00:23:21,00:23:24,Halfway through the cut if they feel suddenly feel like a chinwag
00:23:24,00:23:27,"But if you're in that chair, they will not say a word to you"
00:23:27,00:23:31,The the owner of that one is I think he's called Scott Miller
00:23:31,00:23:36,"And he said I always say if you're asking your client where they're going on a holiday, you've lost"
00:23:36,00:23:41,So I think they're quite nice standards for hairdressing compensation these days
00:23:41,00:23:44,"Yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, where am I going to get to brag about my holidays"
00:23:44,00:23:49,"The last time I had my hair cut, it was by, I was in a city that I don't live in"
00:23:49,00:23:55,And the woman who caught my hair was a regional finalist in that national hairdressing championships
00:23:55,00:23:55,Really?
00:23:55,00:23:57,"Yeah, yeah, really?"
00:23:57,00:24:03,"I mean, she was a finalist, she wasn't a winner"
00:24:03,00:24:09,But she told me all sorts of stuff about the history of hairdressing
00:24:09,00:24:12,And she told me that there's a UK president of hairdressing
00:24:12,00:24:12,"Oh, is that?"
00:24:12,00:24:13,Yeah
00:24:13,00:24:17,"And there's a fellowship of British hairdressing, which I didn't know either"
00:24:17,00:24:20,"Yeah, there's also a male hairdresser of the year"
00:24:20,00:24:22,There's also female hairdresser of the year
00:24:22,00:24:25,It's the big hairdresser awards that happened at the end of the year each year
00:24:25,00:24:28,"And in 2005, I was looking through the list of all the people at one"
00:24:28,00:24:31,"2005, the winner was a guy called Brent Barber"
00:24:31,00:24:32,Wow
00:24:32,00:24:34,That's a cool name
00:24:34,00:24:36,That's a really cool name
00:24:36,00:24:38,"And this is, this is interesting"
00:24:38,00:24:44,I was reading about different kinds of hair that get done that aren't on human heads
00:24:44,00:24:50,And Madame Two Swords have hairdressers that actually do the hair of the wax works
00:24:51,00:24:56,"And in fact, the twiggy wax work that was done, the hairdresser who does twiggy's hair"
00:24:56,00:24:59,came in to do twiggy's wax work hair as well
00:24:59,00:25:03,"To give it the cut, to make it look like it would on twiggy"
00:25:03,00:25:03,Which is quite cool
00:25:03,00:25:05,Did you know it was wax work?
00:25:05,00:25:07,Or did you go away like twiggy's in a bad mood today?
00:25:07,00:25:12,"I said, what are you going on your holidays?"
00:25:12,00:25:18,"But just as a sideline fact, I discovered that"
00:25:18,00:25:21,when Madame Two Swords wax works are made now
00:25:21,00:25:25,"And I think this has always been the case, they make them two inches bigger"
00:25:25,00:25:28,The whole body two inches bigger because the wax shrinks over time
00:25:28,00:25:31,And that brings them to the actual size of the person
00:25:31,00:25:36,And you were telling me today that after the age of 30 you shrink
00:25:36,00:25:38,by one-sixteenth of an inch every year
00:25:38,00:25:39,"Every year, yep"
00:25:39,00:25:42,So they'd have to shave bits off the wax works as well every year
00:25:42,00:25:44,Another one-sixteenth off
00:25:44,00:25:46,"Yes, although I learned that on Oprah about 15 years ago"
00:25:47,00:25:50,And it's just one of those facts that stays with you
00:25:50,00:25:51,And I haven't checked it
00:25:51,00:25:53,So they're in all now
00:25:53,00:25:54,So
00:25:54,00:25:58,"It's true though, it's the discs in between your back vertebrae"
00:25:58,00:25:59,It could be true
00:25:59,00:26:02,"In ancient Rome, they had a job called an onatrix"
00:26:02,00:26:06,And this was a lady who would look after the hair of another lady
00:26:06,00:26:10,And it would be coloring a lot of the thing that they did was coloring
00:26:10,00:26:11,So if you wanted black hair
00:26:11,00:26:15,Then you had to put a mixture of bile rotten leeches
00:26:15,00:26:17,And squid ink
00:26:17,00:26:19,And your hair would make it go black
00:26:19,00:26:19,Cool
00:26:19,00:26:23,"And if you wanted blonde, it was a mixture of pigeon poo and ashes"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"I think I'll stay with a natural dude, actually"
00:26:25,00:26:30,Barbers used to offer castrations as well
00:26:30,00:26:30,Is that true?
00:26:30,00:26:32,Well there's medieval China
00:26:32,00:26:33,Oh
00:26:33,00:26:33,So
00:26:33,00:26:34,Yes
00:26:34,00:26:36,Friggin family of true
00:26:36,00:26:36,Yes
00:26:36,00:26:39,"No, it was, they did Unix"
00:26:39,00:26:40,Yeah
00:26:40,00:26:41,"Sure, the Unix are the ones that don't need it"
00:26:41,00:26:43,Sorry
00:26:43,00:26:45,They need components
00:26:45,00:26:50,We say that if we said before that Chinese Unix would carry around the testicles
00:26:50,00:26:53,To be realising with them in the afterlife
00:26:53,00:26:54,"Yes, I think so"
00:26:54,00:26:56,And there was one of the most famous Unix
00:26:56,00:26:57,Who was one of the last Unix
00:26:57,00:27:02,To punish him for something they stole his bits
00:27:02,00:27:04,"And it was like, he just thought it was the end of the world for him"
00:27:04,00:27:07,Because he would never be able to be brought back
00:27:07,00:27:07,What?
00:27:07,00:27:07,As a whole
00:27:07,00:27:09,That is mean
00:27:09,00:27:10,Real mean
00:27:11,00:27:16,Do you know the first ever proper QI fact that I ever found when I was working on the TV show
00:27:16,00:27:19,It's actually to do with Chinese hairdressers
00:27:19,00:27:20,And it was Malsi Tong's hairdresser
00:27:20,00:27:24,"Yeah, I was reading a biography and it turned out that his hairdresser was called Big Beard Wang"
00:27:24,00:27:30,"Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show"
00:27:30,00:27:32,And that is my fact
00:27:32,00:27:35,My fact this week is that Elvis Presley once started a riot
00:27:35,00:27:38,At the end of his show by saying to the crowd
00:27:38,00:27:40,"Girls, I'll see you all backstage"
00:27:41,00:27:42,"Wow, yeah, I know you all went"
00:27:42,00:27:43,They all went
00:27:43,00:27:46,"In that moment, so this was back in 1955"
00:27:46,00:27:48,This was kind of just as he was reaching
00:27:48,00:27:51,His first sort of wave of popularity
00:27:51,00:27:56,"And he, he didn't realize that that would be the reaction once he said it"
00:27:56,00:27:59,"So he just said this line girls, I'll see you all backstage"
00:27:59,00:28:02,And they literally just fled on to stage
00:28:02,00:28:04,Just like they just went right on
00:28:04,00:28:07,And he got scared and he had to run off to his little green room
00:28:07,00:28:08,They were ripping off his clothes
00:28:08,00:28:12,"He was missing a shoe, he was missing the side of his shirt"
00:28:12,00:28:15,And they locked him inside the back room and no one could get to him
00:28:15,00:28:18,And eventually when it calmed down and he went to his car
00:28:18,00:28:21,His car in the side metal of the car
00:28:21,00:28:23,There were names and numbers scratched into the side
00:28:23,00:28:25,And they couldn't see through the windscreen
00:28:25,00:28:27,Because so much lipstick was on it
00:28:27,00:28:29,With names and numbers for him to call
00:28:29,00:28:31,And also 500 truckos
00:28:31,00:28:37,"Wow, that was the moment that his manager"
00:28:37,00:28:39,"""Okay, we've got a massive star on our hands here"""
00:28:39,00:28:42,"And yeah, that's when he got really promoted"
00:28:42,00:28:45,"Wow, I remember when we were filming QI once"
00:28:45,00:28:49,And Justin Bieber was in the studios
00:28:49,00:28:51,He was doing something next star
00:28:51,00:28:52,And it was crazy
00:28:52,00:28:54,Though it was just unbelievable
00:28:54,00:28:55,They had so much security there
00:28:55,00:28:57,Every time you walked past a window
00:28:57,00:28:59,All they had to do was see a little bit of hair
00:28:59,00:29:00,And they would scream
00:29:00,00:29:03,It was great fun because you just kind of peek your head around
00:29:03,00:29:04,And then they got...
00:29:06,00:29:09,And you were a powerful physical resemblance to the bearded
00:29:09,00:29:14,This was with Justin Bieber
00:29:14,00:29:16,They did experience serious problems with that
00:29:16,00:29:18,When the concerts would happen
00:29:18,00:29:19,Because if he arrived late
00:29:19,00:29:22,Or if they told that they were told it was too chaotic
00:29:22,00:29:24,Because actually so many fans were coming to the show
00:29:24,00:29:26,"They would say, ""Okay, we're cutting this short"
00:29:26,00:29:28,Or Justin's not going to be able to appear
00:29:28,00:29:29,And they would start rioting
00:29:29,00:29:32,And unlike a normal show where people would riot
00:29:32,00:29:33,Who are of adult age
00:29:33,00:29:35,The police just had no idea
00:29:35,00:29:38,What do you do when you're being attacked by children?
00:29:38,00:29:41,"You can't do anything, you just have to accept it"
00:29:41,00:29:43,"That's what you need the robots, probably"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"Yeah, take photos of them"
00:29:45,00:29:47,I don't know
00:29:47,00:29:48,I'll just shut them up
00:29:48,00:29:51,Did you guys hear about David Spargo?
00:29:51,00:29:52,I bet you must have done that
00:29:52,00:29:56,"Okay, he's a super fan of the Australian band ""Peaking Duck"""
00:29:56,00:29:59,Who I assume are some kind of
00:29:59,00:30:01,"Popular beatcom though, aren't they?"
00:30:01,00:30:03,But they were playing in Melbourne
00:30:03,00:30:07,And he decided that he wanted to get backstage and meet his heroes
00:30:07,00:30:11,And so he went backstage and the security said to him
00:30:11,00:30:12,"""No, you can't come in"""
00:30:12,00:30:15,"And he's like, ""No, I've got to come in, I'm the lead singer's stepbrother"
00:30:15,00:30:17,"And they're like, ""Well, do you have any proof?"""
00:30:17,00:30:19,"He said, ""Yeah, yeah, look on Wikipedia"""
00:30:19,00:30:20,And he brought it up
00:30:20,00:30:22,And he just changed Wikipedia
00:30:22,00:30:24,Two minutes earlier to say that he was that guy
00:30:24,00:30:25,Is that stepbrother?
00:30:25,00:30:26,And he got in
00:30:26,00:30:27,And he got some meters
00:30:27,00:30:28,Heroes
00:30:28,00:30:30,"Wow, that is nice"
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Okay, yeah, have you heard of..."
00:30:32,00:30:35,There's a Beatles fan called Jan Myers
00:30:35,00:30:39,And she was a super fan in the days when they were first becoming popular
00:30:39,00:30:42,And she crawled through the sewers under Abbey Road
00:30:42,00:30:44,"To hear them recording ""Rubba Soul"""
00:30:44,00:30:45,Through the wall
00:30:45,00:30:46,"Oh, wow"
00:30:46,00:30:49,"Yeah, I think she's writing a book now about being a super fan"
00:30:49,00:30:50,But at the time she was a fan
00:30:50,00:30:51,They weren't super famous here
00:30:51,00:30:54,And the first time she got an autograph from Paul McCartney
00:30:54,00:30:56,He wrote Paul McCartney brackets the Beatles
00:30:56,00:30:59,"Yeah, so he really won't well known"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"They actually met Elvis once, didn't they?"
00:31:02,00:31:08,And it sounds like the most awkward occasion ever
00:31:08,00:31:10,"So yeah, yeah, and apparently they just had nothing to talk about"
00:31:10,00:31:13,Their press officer wrote about it years later
00:31:13,00:31:14,I said it was incredibly awkward
00:31:14,00:31:15,They had this weird small talk
00:31:15,00:31:17,"There were long, long silences"
00:31:17,00:31:19,And eventually someone obviously freaking out
00:31:19,00:31:21,Maybe the press officer freaked out
00:31:21,00:31:21,I thought I've got to do something
00:31:21,00:31:23,So he brought in a load of guitars
00:31:23,00:31:25,And the Beatles just started playing some music
00:31:25,00:31:26,And everything calmed down a bit
00:31:26,00:31:29,"And then later on Elvis bitched about the Beatles, I think"
00:31:29,00:31:30,To Nixon
00:31:30,00:31:33,"Yeah, oh, that's what"
00:31:33,00:31:34,"Yeah, he didn't bitch to Nixon"
00:31:34,00:31:35,That'll see you
00:31:35,00:31:37,That's a big bitch
00:31:37,00:31:38,He said he thought the Beatles were un-American
00:31:38,00:31:40,Because of their stance on Vietnam
00:31:40,00:31:42,"Yeah, it's true, no, it's bitching"
00:31:42,00:31:43,"Yeah, I guess so"
00:31:43,00:31:45,He didn't mean un-American and that's a good thing
00:31:45,00:31:47,He's talking to the president of the US
00:31:47,00:31:51,"I found this fact, by the way, about the backstage thing with Elvis"
00:31:51,00:31:53,And weirdly not in an Elvis Presley book
00:31:53,00:31:56,But I've been reading a biography on David Bowie
00:31:56,00:32:01,"Called ""Ziggyology"" and a big influence on David Bowie was Elvis"
00:32:01,00:32:03,And there was incredible facts in this book
00:32:03,00:32:07,I just kept coming across amazing little nuggets about Elvis
00:32:07,00:32:09,This is my favorite one and this is the exact wording
00:32:09,00:32:12,Elvis' conception was so seismic
00:32:12,00:32:15,His father blacked out after the moment of climax
00:32:15,00:32:18,"Do you mean ""Fell asleep"" because it's"
00:32:18,00:32:22,"No, apparently you just blacked out"
00:32:22,00:32:26,"And ""Fell"" had to be sort of brought to...brought to"
00:32:26,00:32:30,I think it was Elvis's mother that said that
00:32:30,00:32:32,And she should know
00:32:32,00:32:33,"Yeah, that's true"
00:32:33,00:32:36,"So he was mental, I didn't quite realise how mental Elvis was"
00:32:36,00:32:38,Although I guess maybe everyone else did
00:32:38,00:32:40,"But for instance, the time he met Nixon was because"
00:32:40,00:32:43,He was determined that he collected police badges
00:32:43,00:32:47,And he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
00:32:47,00:32:50,And I think he thought that meant that he could cross any borders
00:32:50,00:32:53,With any substances at all and he's wearing the badge and that was fine
00:32:53,00:32:55,So he got one of those off Nixon
00:32:55,00:32:57,That's the only reason for meeting the president
00:32:57,00:33:01,He used to visit one of his favourite past times apparently
00:33:01,00:33:03,He was visiting the Memphis Mork to look at corpses
00:33:03,00:33:05,Was that a drive-through one or was that...
00:33:05,00:33:09,He wants...oh I like this image
00:33:09,00:33:11,He was once with Tom Jones backstage
00:33:11,00:33:14,And he serenaded Tom Jones while Tom Jones was naked in the shower
00:33:14,00:33:18,So Tom Jones said I think he was checking me out
00:33:18,00:33:20,So that could have been a romance that never happened
00:33:20,00:33:21,"Wow, wow"
00:33:21,00:33:25,"We need to wrap up fairly soon, I've got just a couple more things"
00:33:25,00:33:31,A slightly side-tracking but as I say I got this fact from a Ziggy Stardust book
00:33:31,00:33:34,And I found out this really great fact that I think people should know about
00:33:34,00:33:37,"David Bowie, that's not his real name"
00:33:37,00:33:39,His real name is David Jones
00:33:39,00:33:42,And the reason he had to change his name from David Jones to David Bowie
00:33:42,00:33:43,Is because of the Monkeys
00:33:43,00:33:44,"Yes, David Jones from the Monkeys"
00:33:44,00:33:45,David Jones from the Monkeys
00:33:45,00:33:47,So he was trying to make it bigger as a musician
00:33:47,00:33:49,"Didn't work, so he went to David Bowie"
00:33:49,00:33:54,But David Bowie wasn't the first name that he went to before he went to David Bowie
00:33:54,00:33:59,The first name he picked after David Jones was Tom Jones
00:33:59,00:34:03,And then a couple of weeks later this new singer came along
00:34:03,00:34:07,"And he went, oh Jesus Christ, and then had to change it to David Bowie"
00:34:07,00:34:10,He went on someone else called Tom Jones would come along
00:34:10,00:34:11,"Yeah, and they'd do a murder name"
00:34:15,00:34:17,"No, BING, NO!"
00:34:17,00:34:22,And the riot begins
00:34:22,00:34:26,"Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts"
