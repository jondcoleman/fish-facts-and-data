00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi guys, just to let you know it is our hundredth episode coming up this Friday

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.520
 So to celebrate that this Thursday the 11th of February we're going to do an AMA on Reddit and ask me anything

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.320
 Where you can rock up and ask us anything will be there for a couple of hours

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.320
 Whatever you've ever wanted to ask us do it there. It's going to be 5 p.m. This Thursday 5 p.m. G.m. T

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.600
 That is midday Eastern standard time and if you go to qi.com for us that reddit you'll be able to find it easily. See you there

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:47.360
 Hello, and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast this week coming to you from the Birmingham Mac

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.720
 My name is Dan Shriver and please welcome to the stage. It's the other three elves Andy Murray James Arkin and Anna Chazinski

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:08.440
 And once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.480
 Here we go starting with you Andrew Montemorey my fact this week is that a New Zealand firm has developed an

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:25.560
 irrationally angry robot to train tell us ale stuff so it's so it calls the telly sale staff

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 Yeah, I mean it has to be programmed to do it. It can't just regular at night time or something

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 Oh, okay. So yeah, the firm is called touchpoint and basically they've developed this

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 machine which can simulate an angry customer and it takes data from all the worst

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.120
 customer calls where people are really furious and then they sort of determine the factors which you

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.720
 know you could be set off by and then the telly sales person who's being trained has to try and calm the machine down

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.760
 Do we know how the anger manifests itself? Does it start a tap physically? It's nothing physical it's mind games

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.600
 A lot of passive aggressiveness. How twisted are people? I think it's a lot of shouting at insults basically

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:22.920
 Wow does it sound like a robot? I suspect not because that would negate the point of it being a training thing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.360
 But then they so they must have someone recording all the audio to then yeah, I think so yeah

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.920
 Wow, yeah, it is irrational anger right and people go mad about cold callers

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 And the thing apparently so there's a survey done recently and cold calling was voted the most

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.120
 annoying thing about the UK which I mean there's some bad stuff going on in this country

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 Everyone calm down

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.360
 But the most annoying thing about cold calling is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.240
 Cold-cola chaminas the false chaminas that you get I got a call call this morning

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.800
 Someone who said did you have an accident in the car that wasn't your fault? Okay, did you?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.360
 And what I played along for a moment I said yes, I did

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.040
 Oh, and then she said did you?

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.520
 Not literally the first person

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.560
 Yeah, she was really it took her ages to say anything because she was so surprised

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.560
 And she said did you and I said no not really

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 I got one last night and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.640
 It's so it said hi we understand that you've had an accident recently and and you should be making a claim on it

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 And I thought oh this is a robot so I just went and stayed silent yeah, and then it went

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.320
 Hello, and I went and then it went hi you still there. I thought oh god, it's an actual human

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.040
 Oh, it's sorry, and then it started talking and I was like it got me

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.480
 Hey, I is so good now that it yeah, yeah, they predicted that moment

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.400
 Yeah, so it's like the the Turing test where if you can have a conversation with a machine

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.760
 But you think it's a human then that the machines have won as the

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.360
 I'm not the bar

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.440
 So there is a software that can tell from my voice when I'm on the phone whether I'm angry or not

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.000
 Okay, and they use these and tell ourselves and so they'll have a computer in front of them

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.280
 And I'll ring them up and get really angry and passive aggressive and then their computer will say he's getting angry

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.880
 He's getting really angry. You better do something about this. Oh wow

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.480
 And then they have to keep it below a certain level as if they don't know that you're angry. Yeah

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.280
 I did quite well

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.720
 Telling salesperson on the floor just sobbing and they're in the computer's helpfully saying he's a little bit pissed off of you

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.320
 But it's amazing that computers can tell if you're angry. Yeah, that's very good

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.000
 There's apparently you can tell if someone's angry by the way they use their mouse

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.640
 Um to an 80% accuracy you can like smashing you around the head with it

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.960
 But I think just how you click on the things and stuff like that they can tell

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.000
 You click on I'm really angry

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:02.200
 They can tell frustration, sadness, fear and depression with more than 80% accuracy just by the way you use your mouse

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.720
 Wow

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.840
 Yeah, so there is a thing about the computers being angry and whether they should be made whether we should make angry

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:16.040
 Machines basically because one one school of thought is that it's quite a good idea to make computers that can simulate anger

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.080
 And that the ones you would need to worry about are the ones that don't simulate anger

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.120
 That's not one of the movies tell me but if robots take over the world they're usually pretty angry

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.360
 Think about the terminator robots. They're not angry. They're just doing a job

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.560
 Whereas if Arnie was really emotional in terminator then you'd know

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.440
 He's vulnerable you can you've got a weakness you can play with

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.360
 Yeah, but we can't really make them angry at the moment because we just we're just programming

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.600
 Angry sounding responses into them um

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.120
 And you know doesn't swear at you when you're not telling it to

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.400
 Send you poo in the post or something

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040
 That's your program

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.600
 Which is which is the only reason I can assume that I keep receiving it

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:02.120
 There was a really creepy robot telemarketer that lots of people were writing online about called Samantha West

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.920
 And this was in the US and I think she was selling health insurance and she denied

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.000
 Vassiferously that she was a robot and so Pete these and I think it was the Washington Post or one of the US newspapers got

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.560
 Realized this got a call from her and they all called has said are you a robot?

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.160
 And she kept on saying no, I'm a real person. Maybe there's something wrong with the line

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.720
 Can you hear me? Okay, and they go you'd really sound like a robot and she'd say I understand

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.120
 But perhaps there's a fault with the line and they eventually called and like pressed all the buttons until they got through to a real person and said look

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.840
 That's a robot claiming to be a person working. I know I'm not into that at all. It's really weird

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.840
 And uh the person said we do not have any robots here. There's no robot working here

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.200
 And the next day the number of hers have been discontinued

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.840
 But I do wonder maybe that just was a real person on their first day

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.200
 Who was like, I didn't want to deviate from the scripts

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.080
 That was really really nervous and sent all these people going you're a fucking robot, okay

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.280
 Oh, no, and that's why I should quit the next day. Oh, there was a guy who got fired because he put on a robotic sounding

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.720
 boys

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.160
 To get through his calls faster because people assume if they're talking to a machine

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.880
 They'll just say yes, no and uh option C and he didn't want to do any of the fake chaminous

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.560
 So he just put on a metallic voice. Yeah, but he got fired for it

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.000
 So ironically his job will have now gone to a machine

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.440
 So you can get therapeutic robots have you seen this?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.800
 It's quite normal. There's one in particular is called paro

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.120
 And they've made this robot to help people who are suffering from they've had some trauma

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.840
 And it's shaped like a seal

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:43.560
 And the reason it's shaped like a seal is because the guy who invented it says people are unlikely to have had bad memories of real

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.640
 Seals

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:53.240
 It's fair enough I think but seals are quite you know, they can attack people so it's just that most people don't come up against seals that often

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.240
 There are so many things that fall into that category

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.560
 Every if you bad memories of octopuses or the planet Mars

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:06.600
 Arnold Schwarzenegger actually, I mean while we're on robots, there is one subject. I think we've been dancing around

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.240
 Which is sex with robots

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.720
 Just all right, maybe maybe I'm the only one who's been dancing around it

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.120
 I just wanted to tell you about a story from Malaysia

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.880
 This is from the newspaper free Malaysia today from October

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.160
 and

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.280
 It goes like this this proposed conference on love and sex with robots is illegal

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.040
 Inspector general of police

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.640
 Khalid Abu Bakar told a press conference in Kuala Lumpur and action will be taken against the organizers if they go ahead

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.280
 There's nothing scientific about sex and robots

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.680
 It's an offense to have extra marital sex in Malaysia, especially with robots

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:48.520
 It's true. It was called the Congress on love and sex with robots

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.480
 And I think people just saw the title and just saw the last three words sex with robots. It's a word congress

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.720
 Congress

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.280
 That's true. There's a group called the campaign against sex robots

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.160
 They're a growing group to stop people from actually having sex with robots in the future

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.280
 And there are people who are saying, you know, we should make laws against this right now

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.520
 And there was an article about it and there was some people who commented on the bottom of it

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.000
 One person Chrysler Harper said if I want to have sex with my robot then I will

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.040
 My husband is always willing, but he isn't always that this idea is stupid

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.920
 The most advanced rebel, most people have is a hoover which I bet was what she's talking about

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:39.160
 And then someone called Manjeet replied to that saying sex robots would at least not be as destructive as an atomic bomb

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.080
 Very true. A lot of scientists do say, oh, we'll be having sex with robots

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.960
 We get a couple of hours

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960
 As soon as you guys leave the press conference actually

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.680
 It's true though. There was there was a very famous book sex and robots or sex with robots and

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.720
 They say roughly the year 2050 will be when we'll be properly getting into bad wood robots

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.200
 There's a reason to stay healthy for all of us

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.000
 Hold on tight guys

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.520
 Only 35 more years

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:17.320
 Another creepy robot is this robot called pepper which was made in Japan is like most of the most advanced robots are and

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.600
 So a thousand versions of pepper went up for sale last year

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.600
 And they went on for sale for a thousand pounds each equivalent and they sold out within a minute

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.400
 So very sought after and I was watching a video of the woman who's explaining what's so good about pepper

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.560
 And it's a robot for your house who can be your friend

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.600
 So it's an emotional social robot who can kind of respond to your emotions sense your emotions calm you down

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.840
 Make you feel better and she said

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.880
 One of the things she said was it will introduce games into the family that you can play together or take pictures of your children when you're not at home

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:51.480
 One of the games it plays is um

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.640
 So then there's an example of this robot interacting and it decides to play a game with someone. So it says uh

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.800
 On three we each take a deep breath and see who can hold it the longest

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:12.360
 I saw when I was in Australia there was an ad on tv for a new tracking device called trackoo

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.200
 And the idea is that trackoo can be put it's got magnetic little bits

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.040
 So you can put on the inside of a car or you can put it in your grandfather's pocket

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.640
 Or you can put it in it's saying

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.520
 Basically it was an advert saying you can stalk you can stalk and no one will know

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.520
 But they kept going trackoo

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.040
 This is like this little cute thing and there was a grandfather going where are I am?

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.840
 It goes on cars you can put it in a wallet you can put someone's hair you can put it in a fish tank

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.800
 You can put it in a commission

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.240
 trackoo

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880
 He's put it in a fish tank

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.840
 Just in case your fish goes missing

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.200
 In case your fish goes missing and takes the tracking device away

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.400
 We're having that poor dentist in Nemo

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.760
 It's such a good point

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.480
 That would have been a much shorter film if they'd had your ingenious trackoo

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:03.320
 Okay, it's time for fact number two and that is Chazinski

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.440
 Yep, my fact is that a fifth of America's meals are eaten in cars

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.080
 That's so interesting

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.680
 Yeah, it's really interesting isn't it

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.080
 But yes, it's study done and another thing that this either this study or another study at the same time found

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:24.200
 Was that 31% of people in America say they have never eaten a meal in their cars

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.640
 So there's obviously some people really bringing up that average

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.760
 Who were just like every single time they cook a roast they go to their car

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.480
 A lot of themselves in

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.120
 Well, it's a big drive-through nation isn't it?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.640
 Yeah, I think it's that, yeah

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.640
 Do they say if that's actually what it is?

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.640
 That is what it is, yeah, so it's eating fast

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.160
 But it's the next address and I'll say okay, so it must be the roasts going into the night

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.680
 There's a national drive-through day in America

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:55.080
 Yeah, it's July 24th and it's it's one of those ones that isn't obviously officially recognized

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.960
 But it's one it will sort of trend on Twitter and everyone be going

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.800
 Celebrate it like international potato day or whatever

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.520
 I think it was made up by I comment what the first the company that pioneered drive-through was

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.200
 But it went out of business in the 80s

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.320
 But I think it was them that made up national drive-through day in order to

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.600
 boost their business, wasn't it?

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.840
 Yeah, was it the in-and-out trade?

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.000
 No, I think that's one of those robot dolls

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.920
 So this is a thing, this is in the UK actually

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.960
 Two-thirds of motorists say they've eaten while driving

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.040
 And 55% of motorists think that eating while driving should be illegal

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.120
 So obviously most of the people who are eating while driving are going I wish they'd ban this

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:38.120
 I think it kind of is illegal, isn't it?

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.160
 It might be, yeah, I think if you're not in full control of the car

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.160
 It's up to the police really but if they see you eating a kick out or something or a banana

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.160
 And then I'm sorry

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.600
 Ah, just two of the many wonderful foods you've been enjoying this great mission

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:57.480
 James, I genuinely yesterday read a story of a lady who got a ticket for peeling up a banana while she was driving so you're on it

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:57.880
 Thanks, Dan

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:04.040
 Yeah, so if they think that by doing that you're not in full control then they can pull you over

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.000
 It depends on how you're peeling a banana or it depends on if you're going at 90 miles an hour on the motorway

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.040
 And you think that banana is looking a bit too rap for my liking

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.880
 And they're enough, you're not in full control

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.360
 Do you know the bananas used to come wrapped in foil?

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.000
 Did they?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.720
 Yes, considering they have their own wrapping already

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.040
 Yeah, when they first came over here they were wrapped

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.760
 Oh my god, yeah, that's kind of like past the parcel then

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.560
 Well, the worst getting the past parcel

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.800
 There's only two rappings and it's always up and up

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.640
 Maybe people used to eat the skin

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.360
 Until we saw monkeys taking it off and then we realised

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.520
 Um, fewer the dry-through things

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:40.840
 Oh yeah

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:42.920
 So the first ever dry-through, do you know what it was?

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.920
 It was a bank

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.840
 Ah, really?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.240
 It was in Chicago, it was in 1946

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.040
 I have another one from 5,200 years ago

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.640
 Well, okay

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.520
 So I'm going to say that's the second ever dry-through

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:06.600
 No, there's like an old kind of place in Iran called Godin Tepe

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.840
 And they're not 100% sure that it was a dry-through

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.200
 But they think it was because of-

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.920
 I'm going to be all over this, James

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.440
 I'm going to give this fact a very hard time in these

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.600
 Well, it's because of the height of the window

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.040
 And because the rooms seem to have been used as a place to keep things

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.880
 And it was for bullets and ammunition

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.400
 That soldiers would go through

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.560
 5,000 years ago, they had bullets

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.520
 Yeah, what?

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.080
 Bullets were invented way before guns, because bullets is just-

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.760
 What did you just throw at people?

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.440
 Well, before-

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.000
 Come on, wait till I have something to put this in, you're in trouble

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:44.040
 Well, before they invented guns, the work bullet was just a projectile

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.600
 A stone, it was a stone

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.400
 Check out my drill and make it a pebble

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.280
 So there's like room

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.400
 There's like noises as they throw them

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.000
 There's a room with some stones in it

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.240
 And you're claiming it's a dry-through view

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.040
 That sounds like an archaeologist

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.600
 who needs more funding and is going nothing is right

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.720
 We found some bullets for a drive-through

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.080
 Okay, let's hear about your bank

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.200
 They found a room with a loaded money here

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.400
 That's it, you just drove up and took money out or deposited it

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.000
 But it was in Chicago

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.840
 Did you have to show any identification or anything?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.520
 Or it was just a free one on a business very fast

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.120
 First, well, the first restaurant was in 1947

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.000
 Oh, okay

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.200
 And they used to, instead of driving through, you would just drive up

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:35.560
 Well, you would drive through, but they would have waiters outside taking your order

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.000
 and carrying them inside

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.240
 And bringing your food out to your car

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.040
 It's quite nice

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.720
 It's just a way of getting your staff cold

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.960
 I've found a few weird drive-thrues that actually exist in America at the moment

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.720
 I think a couple of them have gone defunct

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.880
 but if they have it only in the last few years

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.720
 So these are for people who just wanted to make life easier for everyone

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.120
 There's a drive-thru funeral parlor

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.680
 And this is genuinely real

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:05.400
 You drive up and the person of your who you love is just in a window

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.080
 As you go by and you pay respects as you go by in the window

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.680
 And you form a queue with the cars

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.840
 And you just sort of go by and then drive on

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.480
 So there's a drive-thru, I swear to God it's real

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.560
 Are they wearing one of those McDonald's outfits?

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.520
 No, I don't think so

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.960
 Helled up my strings

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.520
 My chicken sandwich in one hand

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:28.920
 No, it's a yeah, it's a funeral parlor drive-thru

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:31.320
 There's an emergency services drive-thru

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.680
 So you just come up in the car and a doctor quickly comes and helps you with any problem that you have

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.880
 So that you're sick, but you're still driving

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.080
 When they're maybe so badly sick that you have to go to the car

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.280
 Yeah, yeah, so you drive through and they can quickly just help you out

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.840
 And that is really bad, they put you in the funeral once

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.400
 And this one's amazing, there's a drive-thru bar

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.800
 That's sort of you alcohol, but you can take it

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.040
 Really? I don't think they've thought that one properly through

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.400
 Yeah, you just buy, I'll just have a pint of vodka

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.680
 Just a normal drink

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.120
 This is when they want more, you know when the police want to get more ticks on their people arrested

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.080
 They just plant policemen, two yards up the road presumably

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.040
 And then, I guess so

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.480
 They've got some arrests under their belt

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.040
 I was just looking at fast food

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.040
 Have you guys ever heard of a yalc?

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:20.840
 No

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.280
 A yoke? Oh, I just realized I've just got what it's called that and it's a yoke

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.320
 Is it a part of an egg?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.520
 Yeah, I did come across them

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.320
 No, we're the W

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:37.800
 So this is the latest fast food and it's a runny pre-cooked boiled egg with pre-cut soldiers in it

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.120
 And a spoof, which is a spoon that includes a tooth to help you crack the shell

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.320
 And you say, wow, this is what you have to do

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:50.440
 You buy the package with the egg in it, you open the egg, you pour boiling water on it, leave it for five minutes

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.200
 And then you've got your egg

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.720
 It's amazing because that takes longer to make than in actual way

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.720
 It literally takes longer to make

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.600
 Yeah, the guy said all you need is access to boiling water

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.680
 And now you can enjoy a delicious yoke wherever you want in just five minutes

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.720
 That's yeah, that's just a boiled egg, isn't it?

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.200
 Yeah, it comes with toe soldiers

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.560
 It does come with soldiers, yeah

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.920
 But do you have to toast them?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.680
 I think the soldiers are not toasted

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.760
 But I don't toast my soldiers anyway, so that's not a problem for me

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.960
 Well, then they're not toe soldiers

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.520
 I call them soldiers

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.720
 They're brits of aliens

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:30.040
 Okay, it's time to move on to fact number three

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.560
 And that is James

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.480
 Okay, my fact this week is that the most dangerous job in Britain is that of a hairdresser

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.800
 Why?

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.280
 So this isn't the most people that die

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.960
 It's most kind of accidents or injuries

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.520
 And hairdressers and beauticians are by far the most likely to suffer an accident

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.360
 Most commonly cutting themselves

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.400
 But it's construction which kills most people

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.040
 Definitely by the most by absolute numbers

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.040
 I would say like if you're a trollerman or something

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.880
 Probably a lot of people die with that as well

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.920
 But I'm going from accident only and that is hairdresser

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.440
 There is actually one

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.720
 Genuinely quite dangerous hairdresser

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.680
 Oh yeah

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.600
 Albert Olmeido

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.720
 And he's in Madrid

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.960
 And he only cuts hair with samurai swords or a blowtorch

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:20.520
 Wow

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.400
 Does it give you the option when you come in?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.160
 Will it be today the blowtorch or the samurai sword?

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.200
 I think we'll be able to pay extra for the blowtorch

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.640
 I don't know but he swipes

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.000
 It looks really cool actually

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.640
 He swipes he has two samurai swords that he cuts your hair with

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.240
 And he swipes them in opposite directions

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.760
 At the back of your head

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.840
 And he says it's useful because you can do both sides at once

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:42.040
 Wow

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.240
 That sounds incredibly dangerous

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.040
 Yeah, that doesn't it

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:46.600
 Because what if you mistorch someone's head

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.200
 Under the hair and they have a really protruberant back of the head

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.520
 It's when you ask for a bit off the top and he literally takes you in the top

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.280
 I think there might be a slightly more dangerous hairdresser out there

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.560
 He's a Chinese hairdresser called Tianhao

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.680
 And how he does it is he likes to to feel the energy of the hair

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.200
 And not have any influence of say sight

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.480
 So he closes his eyes

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.760
 And he starts chopping hair with his eyes closed

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.280
 So he'll just feel it

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.800
 And he's very popular in China

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.560
 Yeah, yeah, he does really well

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.920
 Yeah, good Jedi hairdresser

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.800
 Yes, exactly

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.000
 So there was a rumor going around Cambodia

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.680
 A few dozen years ago

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:32.920
 And that was that the president who's called Nora Damishihunuk

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.800
 He'd had a dream in which all the long-haired virgins in the country

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.120
 Will be taken to hell by an evil god

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:44.440
 Okay, he was kind of quite revered or at least feared at the time

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.320
 And everyone kind of half believed this thing that all the long-haired virgins would be taken to hell

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.760
 And so all the virgins with long hair caught all their hair

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.120
 And all the people who wanted people to think they were virgins and had long-haired

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.720
 They had their hair caught as well

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.520
 Okay, so there's a massive kind of epidemic of women having their hair caught in Cambodia

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.080
 And according to the police at the time

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.680
 They said that it was a rumor started by corrupt hairdressers

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.680
 Wow

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.520
 Very clever

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.000
 So hairdressers are very widely trusted

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.280
 Supposedly, this has been in the news in the last two days, there's been a big survey

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:21.400
 By Ipsosmore, so it's a legit one

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:25.240
 And it's their veracity index, which they do over a year

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.720
 And apparently the most trusted profession is hairdressers

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.080
 69% of people would trust their hairdresser to tell the truth

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.680
 Really?

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.280
 68% for the police

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.760
 And newsreaders are only on 65 and then journalists and politicians are way down

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.440
 They're on the 20s of percent

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.480
 That's so weird

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.880
 I don't think I trust my hairdresser to tell the truth

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.360
 Really?

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.880
 Well they've been saying I look great

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.120
 Their job is to get to the end of a cut and go

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.480
 Yeah, that's fantastic

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.640
 You know it can't, they can't have got to write every time

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.600
 Yeah, you never hear them going

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.120
 Oh, I've really cocked this up

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.080
 There's actually a hairdressing Cardiff now, a Bauhaus hairdresser

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.440
 I think it is, which offers a special quiet chair that you can nominate to be

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.480
 And if you don't fancy the terrible hairdresser's small talk

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.480
 If you don't have a holiday book about year or

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.720
 Yeah, yeah, didn't go on one last year

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.880
 Yeah, and the person the manager is so he's very relaxed about it

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.880
 He says they can change their mind to any time

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.920
 Halfway through the cut if they feel suddenly feel like a chinwag

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.720
 But if you're in that chair, they will not say a word to you

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.320
 The the owner of that one is I think he's called Scott Miller

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.120
 And he said I always say if you're asking your client where they're going on a holiday, you've lost

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.480
 So I think they're quite nice standards for hairdressing compensation these days

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.520
 Yeah, yeah, good. Yeah, where am I going to get to brag about my holidays

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.960
 The last time I had my hair cut, it was by, I was in a city that I don't live in

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:55.480
 And the woman who caught my hair was a regional finalist in that national hairdressing championships

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:55.960
 Really?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.480
 Yeah, yeah, really?

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:03.960
 I mean, she was a finalist, she wasn't a winner

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:09.160
 But she told me all sorts of stuff about the history of hairdressing

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.040
 And she told me that there's a UK president of hairdressing

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:12.680
 Oh, is that?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:13.960
 Yeah

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.480
 And there's a fellowship of British hairdressing, which I didn't know either

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.920
 Yeah, there's also a male hairdresser of the year

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.520
 There's also female hairdresser of the year

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.480
 It's the big hairdresser awards that happened at the end of the year each year

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.680
 And in 2005, I was looking through the list of all the people at one

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.320
 2005, the winner was a guy called Brent Barber

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.920
 Wow

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.680
 That's a cool name

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.520
 That's a really cool name

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.120
 And this is, this is interesting

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:44.040
 I was reading about different kinds of hair that get done that aren't on human heads

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.920
 And Madame Two Swords have hairdressers that actually do the hair of the wax works

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.680
 And in fact, the twiggy wax work that was done, the hairdresser who does twiggy's hair

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.640
 came in to do twiggy's wax work hair as well

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.000
 To give it the cut, to make it look like it would on twiggy

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.800
 Which is quite cool

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800
 Did you know it was wax work?

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.960
 Or did you go away like twiggy's in a bad mood today?

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.840
 I said, what are you going on your holidays?

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:18.040
 But just as a sideline fact, I discovered that

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.880
 when Madame Two Swords wax works are made now

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.480
 And I think this has always been the case, they make them two inches bigger

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.600
 The whole body two inches bigger because the wax shrinks over time

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.560
 And that brings them to the actual size of the person

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:36.200
 And you were telling me today that after the age of 30 you shrink

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.760
 by one-sixteenth of an inch every year

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:39.720
 Every year, yep

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.760
 So they'd have to shave bits off the wax works as well every year

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.280
 Another one-sixteenth off

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.840
 Yes, although I learned that on Oprah about 15 years ago

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.520
 And it's just one of those facts that stays with you

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.720
 And I haven't checked it

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.320
 So they're in all now

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.440
 So

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.120
 It's true though, it's the discs in between your back vertebrae

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.320
 It could be true

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.920
 In ancient Rome, they had a job called an onatrix

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.520
 And this was a lady who would look after the hair of another lady

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.040
 And it would be coloring a lot of the thing that they did was coloring

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.880
 So if you wanted black hair

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:15.400
 Then you had to put a mixture of bile rotten leeches

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.160
 And squid ink

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.320
 And your hair would make it go black

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:19.720
 Cool

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.160
 And if you wanted blonde, it was a mixture of pigeon poo and ashes

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:25.960
 I think I'll stay with a natural dude, actually

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.360
 Barbers used to offer castrations as well

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.920
 Is that true?

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.600
 Well there's medieval China

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.080
 Oh

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.800
 So

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.920
 Yes

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.120
 Friggin family of true

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:36.920
 Yes

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.640
 No, it was, they did Unix

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.040
 Yeah

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.480
 Sure, the Unix are the ones that don't need it

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.640
 Sorry

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.240
 They need components

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:50.200
 We say that if we said before that Chinese Unix would carry around the testicles

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.240
 To be realising with them in the afterlife

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.200
 Yes, I think so

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.120
 And there was one of the most famous Unix

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.320
 Who was one of the last Unix

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.120
 To punish him for something they stole his bits

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.680
 And it was like, he just thought it was the end of the world for him

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.160
 Because he would never be able to be brought back

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.320
 What?

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.880
 As a whole

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.560
 That is mean

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.360
 Real mean

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.920
 Do you know the first ever proper QI fact that I ever found when I was working on the TV show

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.000
 It's actually to do with Chinese hairdressers

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.840
 And it was Malsi Tong's hairdresser

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:24.840
 Yeah, I was reading a biography and it turned out that his hairdresser was called Big Beard Wang

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.760
 Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.200
 And that is my fact

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.720
 My fact this week is that Elvis Presley once started a riot

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.200
 At the end of his show by saying to the crowd

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.040
 Girls, I'll see you all backstage

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.760
 Wow, yeah, I know you all went

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.960
 They all went

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.440
 In that moment, so this was back in 1955

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.360
 This was kind of just as he was reaching

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.800
 His first sort of wave of popularity

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.520
 And he, he didn't realize that that would be the reaction once he said it

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.400
 So he just said this line girls, I'll see you all backstage

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.040
 And they literally just fled on to stage

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.360
 Just like they just went right on

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.080
 And he got scared and he had to run off to his little green room

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.520
 They were ripping off his clothes

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.040
 He was missing a shoe, he was missing the side of his shirt

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:15.880
 And they locked him inside the back room and no one could get to him

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.680
 And eventually when it calmed down and he went to his car

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.240
 His car in the side metal of the car

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.800
 There were names and numbers scratched into the side

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.320
 And they couldn't see through the windscreen

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.320
 Because so much lipstick was on it

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.160
 With names and numbers for him to call

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.160
 And also 500 truckos

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:37.400
 Wow, that was the moment that his manager

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.960
 "Okay, we've got a massive star on our hands here"

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.760
 And yeah, that's when he got really promoted

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.560
 Wow, I remember when we were filming QI once

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.400
 And Justin Bieber was in the studios

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.240
 He was doing something next star

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.200
 And it was crazy

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.120
 Though it was just unbelievable

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.880
 They had so much security there

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.320
 Every time you walked past a window

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.160
 All they had to do was see a little bit of hair

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.680
 And they would scream

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.400
 It was great fun because you just kind of peek your head around

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.360
 And then they got...

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.400
 And you were a powerful physical resemblance to the bearded

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:14.680
 This was with Justin Bieber

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.840
 They did experience serious problems with that

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.040
 When the concerts would happen

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.800
 Because if he arrived late

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.200
 Or if they told that they were told it was too chaotic

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.680
 Because actually so many fans were coming to the show

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.360
 They would say, "Okay, we're cutting this short

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.360
 Or Justin's not going to be able to appear

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.560
 And they would start rioting

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.760
 And unlike a normal show where people would riot

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.960
 Who are of adult age

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.560
 The police just had no idea

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.120
 What do you do when you're being attacked by children?

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:41.000
 You can't do anything, you just have to accept it

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.160
 That's what you need the robots, probably

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160
 Yeah, take photos of them

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.960
 I don't know

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.920
 I'll just shut them up

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.320
 Did you guys hear about David Spargo?

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.760
 I bet you must have done that

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.520
 Okay, he's a super fan of the Australian band "Peaking Duck"

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.400
 Who I assume are some kind of

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.640
 Popular beatcom though, aren't they?

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.160
 But they were playing in Melbourne

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.080
 And he decided that he wanted to get backstage and meet his heroes

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.400
 And so he went backstage and the security said to him

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.280
 "No, you can't come in"

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.880
 And he's like, "No, I've got to come in, I'm the lead singer's stepbrother

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.480
 And they're like, "Well, do you have any proof?"

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.320
 He said, "Yeah, yeah, look on Wikipedia"

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.280
 And he brought it up

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.040
 And he just changed Wikipedia

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.520
 Two minutes earlier to say that he was that guy

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.480
 Is that stepbrother?

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.280
 And he got in

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.480
 And he got some meters

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.680
 Heroes

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.120
 Wow, that is nice

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.680
 Okay, yeah, have you heard of...

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.080
 There's a Beatles fan called Jan Myers

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.640
 And she was a super fan in the days when they were first becoming popular

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.600
 And she crawled through the sewers under Abbey Road

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.440
 To hear them recording "Rubba Soul"

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.240
 Through the wall

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.440
 Oh, wow

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.400
 Yeah, I think she's writing a book now about being a super fan

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.600
 But at the time she was a fan

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.960
 They weren't super famous here

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.680
 And the first time she got an autograph from Paul McCartney

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.920
 He wrote Paul McCartney brackets the Beatles

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.880
 Yeah, so he really won't well known

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.680
 They actually met Elvis once, didn't they?

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:08.120
 And it sounds like the most awkward occasion ever

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.760
 So yeah, yeah, and apparently they just had nothing to talk about

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.000
 Their press officer wrote about it years later

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.520
 I said it was incredibly awkward

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.800
 They had this weird small talk

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.800
 There were long, long silences

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.960
 And eventually someone obviously freaking out

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.160
 Maybe the press officer freaked out

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:21.960
 I thought I've got to do something

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.800
 So he brought in a load of guitars

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.640
 And the Beatles just started playing some music

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.920
 And everything calmed down a bit

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.640
 And then later on Elvis bitched about the Beatles, I think

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.680
 To Nixon

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.160
 Yeah, oh, that's what

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.920
 Yeah, he didn't bitch to Nixon

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.960
 That'll see you

00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.160
 That's a big bitch

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.920
 He said he thought the Beatles were un-American

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.280
 Because of their stance on Vietnam

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:42.280
 Yeah, it's true, no, it's bitching

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.400
 Yeah, I guess so

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.560
 He didn't mean un-American and that's a good thing

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.160
 He's talking to the president of the US

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.400
 I found this fact, by the way, about the backstage thing with Elvis

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.640
 And weirdly not in an Elvis Presley book

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.520
 But I've been reading a biography on David Bowie

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:01.640
 Called "Ziggyology" and a big influence on David Bowie was Elvis

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.240
 And there was incredible facts in this book

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.320
 I just kept coming across amazing little nuggets about Elvis

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.960
 This is my favorite one and this is the exact wording

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:12.680
 Elvis' conception was so seismic

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.320
 His father blacked out after the moment of climax

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.760
 Do you mean "Fell asleep" because it's

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.680
 No, apparently you just blacked out

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.600
 And "Fell" had to be sort of brought to...brought to

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.840
 I think it was Elvis's mother that said that

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.120
 And she should know

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.000
 Yeah, that's true

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.280
 So he was mental, I didn't quite realise how mental Elvis was

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.120
 Although I guess maybe everyone else did

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.280
 But for instance, the time he met Nixon was because

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.560
 He was determined that he collected police badges

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.880
 And he wanted a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.520
 And I think he thought that meant that he could cross any borders

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.880
 With any substances at all and he's wearing the badge and that was fine

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.640
 So he got one of those off Nixon

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.800
 That's the only reason for meeting the president

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.080
 He used to visit one of his favourite past times apparently

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.640
 He was visiting the Memphis Mork to look at corpses

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.880
 Was that a drive-through one or was that...

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.080
 He wants...oh I like this image

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.720
 He was once with Tom Jones backstage

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.760
 And he serenaded Tom Jones while Tom Jones was naked in the shower

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:18.680
 So Tom Jones said I think he was checking me out

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.680
 So that could have been a romance that never happened

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:21.400
 Wow, wow

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.640
 We need to wrap up fairly soon, I've got just a couple more things

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:31.080
 A slightly side-tracking but as I say I got this fact from a Ziggy Stardust book

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.360
 And I found out this really great fact that I think people should know about

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.400
 David Bowie, that's not his real name

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.240
 His real name is David Jones

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.680
 And the reason he had to change his name from David Jones to David Bowie

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.640
 Is because of the Monkeys

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.920
 Yes, David Jones from the Monkeys

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.960
 David Jones from the Monkeys

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.560
 So he was trying to make it bigger as a musician

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.480
 Didn't work, so he went to David Bowie

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.120
 But David Bowie wasn't the first name that he went to before he went to David Bowie

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.160
 The first name he picked after David Jones was Tom Jones

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:03.480
 And then a couple of weeks later this new singer came along

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.320
 And he went, oh Jesus Christ, and then had to change it to David Bowie

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.120
 He went on someone else called Tom Jones would come along

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.640
 Yeah, and they'd do a murder name

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.240
 No, BING, NO!

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.360
 And the riot begins

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.200
