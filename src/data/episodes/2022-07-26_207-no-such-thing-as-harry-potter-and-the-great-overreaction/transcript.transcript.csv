00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(tapping sound)
00:00:07,00:00:09,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:09,00:00:11,(upbeat music)
00:00:11,00:00:21,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:21,00:00:24,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,"
00:00:24,00:00:27,this week coming to you from the Brighton Dome!
00:00:27,00:00:30,(cheering and applause)
00:00:30,00:00:34,My name is Dan Schreiber
00:00:34,00:00:36,"and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:36,00:00:38,"Andrew Hunter, Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:38,00:00:40,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:40,00:00:43,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:43,00:00:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:48,00:00:51,"- My fact this week is that until the 17th century,"
00:00:51,00:00:55,mothers hung their babies up on hooks while they worked.
00:00:55,00:00:57,(laughing)
00:00:57,00:00:58,- It's amazing.
00:00:58,00:00:59,- You just hung them up like a coat.
00:00:59,00:01:00,(laughing)
00:01:00,00:01:02,"- Were they, is it, yeah, is it like,"
00:01:02,00:01:04,everyone who works at the same place has a number
00:01:04,00:01:07,"above their hook and a-- - Oh, look at the cloakroom."
00:01:07,00:01:08,"- Yeah, yeah. - Like if you go to the restaurant,"
00:01:08,00:01:10,do you just leave your baby in the cloakroom?
00:01:10,00:01:11,"- Yeah, and if you lose your ticket,"
00:01:11,00:01:12,you're absolutely pockets.
00:01:12,00:01:14,(laughing)
00:01:14,00:01:15,- Can you describe it?
00:01:15,00:01:17,"Well, it is small, it's not got much hair"
00:01:17,00:01:18,and it's like Winston Churchill.
00:01:18,00:01:20,(laughing)
00:01:20,00:01:21,- This is genuinely true.
00:01:21,00:01:24,So this baby needs to be swaddled for long periods
00:01:24,00:01:26,"of history, it was thought that it was good for them"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"to be very tightly swaddled, wrapped up in material."
00:01:29,00:01:32,"So their limbs could grow straight, that was the belief."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"And once they were swaddled, then they would just be"
00:01:35,00:01:37,"latched onto a hook that was maybe in your house,"
00:01:37,00:01:39,"if you were doing the house work,"
00:01:39,00:01:40,or sometimes mothers would be working out
00:01:40,00:01:42,"in the field, doing agricultural work,"
00:01:42,00:01:44,"and you could hook them onto a tree,"
00:01:44,00:01:48,"like a bit of twig, and that was how they did it."
00:01:48,00:01:49,- Wow.
00:01:49,00:01:54,- Is that where the rocker by baby kind of thing comes from?
00:01:54,00:01:55,- Ooh.
00:01:55,00:01:56,"- You're not rocking them, really."
00:01:56,00:01:57,You're swinging them if you're doing anything.
00:01:57,00:01:59,'Cause he's on a tree top.
00:01:59,00:02:00,- Right.
00:02:00,00:02:03,"- He's definitely in a vessel lying down comfortably,"
00:02:03,00:02:04,not just like--
00:02:04,00:02:07,- Just a small baby from the tree side.
00:02:07,00:02:08,(laughing)
00:02:08,00:02:10,"- Yeah, keep holding your tear care to a baby."
00:02:10,00:02:12,"We'll disappear, it doesn't work."
00:02:12,00:02:15,(laughing)
00:02:15,00:02:18,- So this used to happen all over the place.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"In Sweden, women would carry their children"
00:02:20,00:02:22,in what was called a bog.
00:02:22,00:02:24,Just put your baby in the bog.
00:02:24,00:02:25,Baby bog.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- What was it?
00:02:26,00:02:27,- It was a bag.
00:02:27,00:02:29,(laughing)
00:02:29,00:02:30,- Sounds like a typo.
00:02:30,00:02:32,(laughing)
00:02:32,00:02:34,"- Yeah, it's where we get the word bag from,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,but it was a leather container shaped into a bag.
00:02:37,00:02:37,- Oh really?
00:02:37,00:02:38,- Same principle.
00:02:38,00:02:40,- There's actually still a thing today
00:02:40,00:02:42,"in amongst indigenous North Americans,"
00:02:42,00:02:44,"where there's a thing called cradle boards,"
00:02:44,00:02:46,"and these have been a thing for hundreds of years,"
00:02:46,00:02:49,"and they're sort of flat boards that you strap a baby to,"
00:02:49,00:02:50,"and in a very similar way,"
00:02:50,00:02:54,"you can then hang them on a tree or lean them against a tree,"
00:02:54,00:02:55,"and they were very commonly used,"
00:02:55,00:02:58,"and there were a few tribes like the shoe,"
00:02:58,00:02:59,"or the Iroquois, or the Cherokee,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,who were all kind of bringing them back
00:03:01,00:03:02,in a sort of artisan way.
00:03:02,00:03:04,"They're really beautiful if you look them up,"
00:03:04,00:03:06,and therefore hanging babies up.
00:03:06,00:03:08,- And actually they think that carrying babies
00:03:08,00:03:11,"or having like bogs or bags or whatever to put babies in,"
00:03:11,00:03:14,is probably one of the biggest inventions
00:03:14,00:03:15,in the history of mankind.
00:03:15,00:03:16,- Wow.
00:03:16,00:03:17,"- It's up there with like, you know,"
00:03:17,00:03:20,writing and the wheel and fire and all that kind of stuff.
00:03:20,00:03:21,- Is it?
00:03:21,00:03:22,- That's how I read it.
00:03:22,00:03:24,"- Well, it meant that mothers could carry food"
00:03:24,00:03:26,as well as carrying the child.
00:03:26,00:03:27,"So once you had a child,"
00:03:27,00:03:29,"if you just had to hold it the whole time,"
00:03:29,00:03:31,"basically you weren't able to do anything else,"
00:03:31,00:03:33,"but this meant that they could carry food,"
00:03:33,00:03:35,they can go hunter-gathering as well.
00:03:35,00:03:36,- Wow.
00:03:36,00:03:40,"- So prams used to not really be a thing,"
00:03:40,00:03:41,"and if you did have a pram, you'd--"
00:03:41,00:03:43,- That's actually true of everything that was invented.
00:03:43,00:03:46,(audience laughing)
00:03:46,00:03:49,"- iPhones didn't used to be a thing, really."
00:03:49,00:03:50,"- Yeah, that's fair."
00:03:50,00:03:52,(audience laughing)
00:03:52,00:03:52,- And that's it.
00:03:52,00:03:53,- That's all I got.
00:03:53,00:03:56,(audience laughing)
00:03:56,00:03:59,"- But basically in Germany, when it was invented,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"particularly mothers used to pull along prams,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,and obviously you can't see if the babies fallen out.
00:04:03,00:04:06,So the push pram was a genuine innovation.
00:04:06,00:04:08,"But in Germany, until 1888,"
00:04:08,00:04:11,you had to have a license to take a child out in a pram.
00:04:11,00:04:13,- Wow.
00:04:13,00:04:15,- And this was so the police knew you had to permission
00:04:15,00:04:17,"to be out with basically a small vehicle,"
00:04:17,00:04:19,and you had to name the baby.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"You had to say, ""I'm gonna be taking Jeff out in the pram."""
00:04:22,00:04:23,(audience laughing)
00:04:23,00:04:25,"- Wait, so if you're taking a different baby out in the pram,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,then you'd lose your license or whatever.
00:04:27,00:04:28,You're arrested.
00:04:28,00:04:28,- Six months.
00:04:28,00:04:29,"- Six months, prison."
00:04:29,00:04:30,- What?
00:04:30,00:04:32,"- Prison, no, I don't know, I don't know."
00:04:32,00:04:35,"- And the other thing is around the same time in Britain,"
00:04:35,00:04:39,any vehicle with four wheels was counted as a road vehicle.
00:04:39,00:04:41,"Okay, so they got the new prams,"
00:04:41,00:04:44,"which had like a bassinet, and they had four wheels."
00:04:44,00:04:45,The previous ones only had three.
00:04:45,00:04:48,"And those four wheelers, you could get arrested"
00:04:48,00:04:50,for walking down the street with one of those.
00:04:50,00:04:52,"And people did, people got prosecuted."
00:04:52,00:04:55,"If you walked on the pavement with them, instead of the road."
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- So responsible advice, push your baby along"
00:04:57,00:04:59,and down the middle of the road.
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Wow.
00:05:00,00:05:03,"- Another pregnancy thing, actually, giving birth thing."
00:05:03,00:05:05,There is a medical text from the 12th century
00:05:05,00:05:07,called the trotulla.
00:05:07,00:05:10,"And one of the instructions in there is if you're giving birth,"
00:05:10,00:05:13,you should induce sneezing to the woman.
00:05:13,00:05:15,"Because apparently when you sneeze,"
00:05:15,00:05:19,it helps contoe contract to your womb and push the child out.
00:05:19,00:05:20,And they genuinely did this.
00:05:20,00:05:23,"- Wow, I mean, it's an unpleasant process anyway, I've heard."
00:05:23,00:05:25,"But having someone pour pepper into your nostrils,"
00:05:25,00:05:27,"I was like, ""It would make the whole thing even worse."""
00:05:27,00:05:28,"- Well, they also said that the womb"
00:05:28,00:05:31,reacted differently to different kinds of smells.
00:05:31,00:05:33,So the womb would push towards sweet smells
00:05:33,00:05:35,and away from unpleasant smells.
00:05:35,00:05:36,- What?
00:05:36,00:05:38,"So if you're giving birth near a beclava stand,"
00:05:38,00:05:40,you'll just be drawn magnetically over to it.
00:05:40,00:05:43,(audience laughing)
00:05:43,00:05:46,And I don't know why a beclava stand was the first thing
00:05:46,00:05:50,"I thought, ""Oh, that's a good ass thing, isn't it?"""
00:05:50,00:05:53,"- Metropolis and elite twat, why not say it to the guys?"
00:05:53,00:05:55,(audience laughing)
00:05:55,00:05:59,- But so women didn't used to be allowed to be at birth.
00:05:59,00:06:02,So there was a long tradition of only women being
00:06:02,00:06:04,except for the women involved.
00:06:04,00:06:05,(audience laughing)
00:06:05,00:06:08,There was one woman allowed at every birth.
00:06:08,00:06:12,"So for many centuries, doctors weren't allowed at birth"
00:06:12,00:06:14,because men weren't allowed to see a woman giving birth
00:06:14,00:06:15,because it was thought to be improper.
00:06:15,00:06:17,So actually the only people that you would be allowed
00:06:17,00:06:20,to have when you were giving birth were midwives
00:06:20,00:06:22,"after a while and astrologers,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,'cause some were more astrologers.
00:06:23,00:06:25,So you couldn't have a doctor to tell you
00:06:25,00:06:25,"it was gonna be okay,"
00:06:25,00:06:27,but you could have an astrologer to give you
00:06:27,00:06:29,a prediction of whether the baby was gonna survive.
00:06:29,00:06:34,"And then when doctors started taking over in the 19th century,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,it was decided that actually women couldn't handle
00:06:36,00:06:39,"being in the room with other women giving birth,"
00:06:39,00:06:41,even though I guess they are the ones that do it in the end.
00:06:41,00:06:45,But the Lancet Medical Journal wrote in 1868
00:06:45,00:06:48,that women are too delicate to watch someone else giving birth
00:06:48,00:06:52,and only men could brave the revolting scenes of childbirth.
00:06:52,00:06:53,(audience laughing)
00:06:53,00:06:53,- Wow.
00:06:53,00:06:56,- We just can't hack it.
00:06:56,00:06:58,'Cause we actually never have to see it.
00:06:58,00:06:59,- Right. - I think.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- You're just lay there going,"
00:07:00,00:07:02,can anyone smell baccalaver?
00:07:02,00:07:05,(audience laughing)
00:07:05,00:07:08,- That is such a Sagittarius thing to say.
00:07:08,00:07:10,(audience laughing)
00:07:10,00:07:13,"- Do you know what, I was looking up Medieval child rearing."
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Oh yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"- So what happened in Medieval era was,"
00:07:17,00:07:21,"basically once you got to the age of 14,"
00:07:21,00:07:24,you would just be sent away on a French exchange forever.
00:07:24,00:07:28,You would be sent to be a servant in someone else's house
00:07:28,00:07:31,for seven to 10 years.
00:07:31,00:07:32,Was it always in France?
00:07:32,00:07:33,- It wasn't always in France actually.
00:07:33,00:07:34,It was always not in France.
00:07:34,00:07:35,It was never in France.
00:07:35,00:07:36,It was.
00:07:38,00:07:43,"So you were sent on a French exchange trip forever,"
00:07:43,00:07:46,which was not in France and only lasted seven years.
00:07:46,00:07:47,- Yeah.
00:07:47,00:07:49,- I can see I'm gonna be accused of sexing up this fact.
00:07:49,00:07:51,I was trying to think of an analogy.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Basically you'd do a swap.
00:07:52,00:07:55,Everyone just sent away their child to someone else's house
00:07:55,00:07:56,and then you would get someone else's child
00:07:56,00:07:58,being a servant in your house.
00:07:58,00:08:00,And everyone did this right up to the aristocracy.
00:08:00,00:08:02,- Because they thought that it was easier
00:08:02,00:08:04,"to bring up someone else's child, didn't they?"
00:08:04,00:08:05,- Oh wow. - Yeah.
00:08:05,00:08:06,- That's cool.
00:08:06,00:08:10,"Have you guys heard, so again, around the sort of medieval period"
00:08:10,00:08:12,of the groaning cheese?
00:08:12,00:08:15,This is really cool.
00:08:15,00:08:17,It was just a tradition that people would do.
00:08:17,00:08:19,"And the idea was that when you got pregnant,"
00:08:19,00:08:20,you knew you were pregnant.
00:08:20,00:08:22,You would mature a wheel of cheese
00:08:22,00:08:25,for the nine month period that you were pregnant.
00:08:25,00:08:27,"And then once the baby was born,"
00:08:27,00:08:30,you would share out the cheese amongst family and friends
00:08:30,00:08:31,and you would all eat the cheese.
00:08:31,00:08:35,But it would leave the outer rind of the cheese.
00:08:35,00:08:39,"And on christening day, they would pass the baby through."
00:08:39,00:08:41,- Yeah. - Through the hoop.
00:08:41,00:08:43,- And that's where we get the tradition
00:08:43,00:08:45,"of the woman bursting out of the cake, isn't it?"
00:08:45,00:08:46,- Yes. - Yes.
00:08:46,00:08:47,- No.
00:08:47,00:08:51,"- But yeah, that was the groaning cheese."
00:08:51,00:08:52,- That's amazing. - That's amazing.
00:08:52,00:08:54,- Yeah.
00:08:54,00:08:55,- How up is that?
00:08:55,00:08:59,"Did you, on boggies and ways of pushing children around,"
00:08:59,00:09:02,"did you see the survey that was done by Scoda,"
00:09:02,00:09:05,but it was seeing what father's thought
00:09:05,00:09:06,about pushing boggies around.
00:09:06,00:09:07,It was quite recent.
00:09:07,00:09:10,"It was, it discovered that 33% of fathers"
00:09:10,00:09:12,said they were embarrassed by their Pram or push chair.
00:09:12,00:09:14,So they felt emasculated pushing them around.
00:09:14,00:09:18,76% of dads said they'd be more likely to push a Pram
00:09:18,00:09:21,"if they had access to a stylish, high-spec buggy"
00:09:21,00:09:22,that could go.
00:09:22,00:09:25,"And so there's this one guy called Colin Furze,"
00:09:25,00:09:30,"who in 2013, yeah, Colin Furze is broken a load of records."
00:09:30,00:09:31,So he likes breaking records
00:09:31,00:09:34,and he's broken the record for the world's fastest Pram.
00:09:34,00:09:36,So he found out his wife was pregnant
00:09:36,00:09:40,and he thought the way to be supportive was to attach
00:09:40,00:09:45,a motorbike engine to a Pram and create something
00:09:45,00:09:49,"that can go up to 80 kilometers an hour, which it does."
00:09:49,00:09:50,You can't put a baby in it.
00:09:50,00:09:52,- That's a shot.
00:09:52,00:09:54,- Because that'd be really dangerous.
00:09:54,00:09:56,But he says he does put dolls in it
00:09:56,00:09:58,just to freak out on lookers.
00:09:58,00:10:01,(laughing)
00:10:01,00:10:04,"- Wait, but hang on, is he wearing roller skates?"
00:10:04,00:10:06,"- No, but he has a little skateboard attached to the back"
00:10:06,00:10:07,that he can stand on.
00:10:07,00:10:09,So it pulls him along.
00:10:09,00:10:10,(laughing)
00:10:10,00:10:11,- It's really cool.
00:10:11,00:10:12,- That's incredible.
00:10:12,00:10:14,"- It's really cool, but his wife is still having"
00:10:14,00:10:16,"to push the baby along in a normal Pram,"
00:10:16,00:10:18,some way behind him.
00:10:18,00:10:24,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:10:24,00:10:28,"- Ah, yes, my fact this week is that there's a man in Brazil"
00:10:28,00:10:31,who's been living in a sand castle for 22 years.
00:10:31,00:10:33,(laughing)
00:10:33,00:10:35,He has to constantly water his house
00:10:35,00:10:37,to prevent it from collapsing.
00:10:37,00:10:39,(laughing)
00:10:39,00:10:40,- It's extraordinary.
00:10:40,00:10:41,- This is so cool.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"- So this is just a guy, he lives in Rio,"
00:10:43,00:10:47,"he lives in Brazil, he's known as King Marcio,"
00:10:47,00:10:50,and he has this really awesome looking sand castle.
00:10:50,00:10:53,"It's like, just imagine like a really ornate sand castle."
00:10:53,00:10:54,"It's quite small on the inside,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"it's only about three square meters,"
00:10:56,00:10:59,"and it's full of books because he has two hobbies,"
00:10:59,00:11:02,reading and beach golf.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"- Yeah, beach golf."
00:11:04,00:11:06,"- Yeah, it's just one big bunker, I guess."
00:11:06,00:11:07,(laughing)
00:11:07,00:11:09,"But he lives there, and he basically,"
00:11:09,00:11:11,"if you go to Rio and you go to his house,"
00:11:11,00:11:13,"he has a little scepter, and he has photos taken"
00:11:13,00:11:16,with Taurus and stuff like that.
00:11:16,00:11:17,- That's very cool.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"- It has a roof right, 'cause none of my sandcastles"
00:11:19,00:11:20,have ever had roofs.
00:11:20,00:11:21,- Did they not?
00:11:21,00:11:23,"- Well no, they just be basically a wall."
00:11:23,00:11:25,Isn't that the standard sand castle?
00:11:25,00:11:28,"- Yes, unless you just do the upturned bucket,"
00:11:28,00:11:29,in which case there's all roof.
00:11:29,00:11:31,(laughing)
00:11:31,00:11:33,"- A lot of sandcastles, like these really ornate ones"
00:11:33,00:11:35,"you see on, you know, they do competitions,"
00:11:35,00:11:37,"don't they, and stuff like that."
00:11:37,00:11:39,And the way that they do that is they super compact it.
00:11:39,00:11:42,"So they really, really, really compact the sand,"
00:11:42,00:11:44,and this is an ancient way of building things.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"So actually, the Great Wall of China,"
00:11:46,00:11:48,"a lot of that is made like this,"
00:11:48,00:11:50,so it's basically just one big sand castle.
00:11:50,00:11:51,- Joking.
00:11:51,00:11:53,"- Honestly, that's amazing."
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Except they use different materials.
00:11:54,00:11:56,"- Well, some of it, for some of the Great Wall of China,"
00:11:56,00:11:58,"they just, it's just kind of mountains,"
00:11:58,00:12:01,"and that's just literally sand compacted, really hard."
00:12:01,00:12:03,"- Well, happens when the tide comes in."
00:12:03,00:12:04,(laughing)
00:12:04,00:12:05,- It tends not to in the middle of China.
00:12:05,00:12:07,(laughing)
00:12:07,00:12:08,- It doesn't quite reach.
00:12:08,00:12:10,That's where all kids are going wrong.
00:12:10,00:12:11,It's building them on bloody beaches.
00:12:11,00:12:13,(laughing)
00:12:13,00:12:15,- But they've also worked out the exactly perfect way
00:12:15,00:12:17,now to build a sand castle.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"And when I say they, I mean physicists,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,but it's actually quite surprising.
00:12:21,00:12:23,"So this is a couple of years ago,"
00:12:23,00:12:25,"there was some experimenting, there was some studies,"
00:12:25,00:12:28,and it was found out that the strongest sand castle
00:12:28,00:12:32,"will be 99 parts sand to one part water,"
00:12:32,00:12:35,which I think is not very as much water as I was probably doing.
00:12:35,00:12:38,"And the person who did this study is a guy called Dr. Bond,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"who's a physicist, and he said the best way to do it"
00:12:40,00:12:42,"is to tamp wet sand into a mold,"
00:12:42,00:12:44,"but a mold that's like open at the top and the bottom,"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"so like a bucket without a bottom,"
00:12:46,00:12:49,"and then thump it at least 70 times,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,before which no one has the time for on a beach.
00:12:51,00:12:53,(laughing)
00:12:53,00:12:56,"- You know, actually a best place to build a sand castle,"
00:12:56,00:12:59,"the best sand for a sand castle is on Titan,"
00:12:59,00:13:01,the largest moon of Saturn.
00:13:01,00:13:03,"- Wow, really?"
00:13:03,00:13:05,- It's the best place in some ways to do it.
00:13:05,00:13:07,"In other ways, I wouldn't recommend it."
00:13:07,00:13:09,"- You get that, I forgot the bloody bucket."
00:13:09,00:13:11,(laughing)
00:13:11,00:13:12,"Right, turn it around."
00:13:12,00:13:16,"- Well, this is amazing, they have sand dunes on Titan,"
00:13:16,00:13:19,"but their sand has got static electricity in it,"
00:13:19,00:13:22,and so it self-adheres.
00:13:22,00:13:23,- Wow!
00:13:23,00:13:23,- You know what I mean?
00:13:23,00:13:25,So you kind of put it together and it's never going to fall apart
00:13:25,00:13:28,because they're all sticks together with static electricity.
00:13:28,00:13:28,- That's amazing.
00:13:28,00:13:29,- That's really cool.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"- That is cool, isn't it?"
00:13:30,00:13:31,It's worth going for that.
00:13:31,00:13:33,(laughing)
00:13:33,00:13:36,- You can be fined for stealing sand from Sardinia.
00:13:36,00:13:38,"Even if you take a small drinks bottle full of sand,"
00:13:38,00:13:42,"you can be fined a thousand euros,"
00:13:42,00:13:43,"and this is a big problem,"
00:13:43,00:13:45,"'cause people keep on stealing Sardinia, basically,"
00:13:45,00:13:46,and people are worried about it.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"In the summer months of 2015,"
00:13:48,00:13:51,they seized five tons in smaller
00:13:51,00:13:52,"and bigger consumers,"
00:13:52,00:13:54,"but lots of it was just little bottles,"
00:13:54,00:13:55,which people take as a souvenir.
00:13:55,00:13:56,- Wow.
00:13:56,00:13:57,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:13:57,00:13:58,"- And that's 'cause we're running out of sand, right?"
00:13:58,00:13:59,- Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:01,"- Which is a weird sentence in its own right,"
00:14:01,00:14:04,but we are running out of sand on earth.
00:14:04,00:14:07,- Have you guys had a great sand castle dispute of 1900?
00:14:07,00:14:08,"- No, no."
00:14:08,00:14:13,"- So this was like the original First World War,"
00:14:13,00:14:15,"except it happened in Rill in North Wales,"
00:14:15,00:14:17,and it was quite a small deal.
00:14:17,00:14:18,But...
00:14:18,00:14:20,(laughing)
00:14:20,00:14:22,"It was basically Bovril,"
00:14:22,00:14:24,"which was a relatively new company at that point,"
00:14:24,00:14:26,"sponsored a sand castle building contest,"
00:14:26,00:14:29,and it was the idea was that you had to build a sand castle
00:14:29,00:14:30,"that was extremely impressive,"
00:14:30,00:14:33,and you had to have Bovril's logo somewhere on it.
00:14:33,00:14:35,"And so some people picked up on the idea,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,"and in the same place in North Wales,"
00:14:38,00:14:41,"this alcohol merchant copied it, copied the whole idea,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"and had a lot of kids come to the beach,"
00:14:43,00:14:46,"and compete over who could build the best sand castle,"
00:14:46,00:14:50,and include the name of his whiskey on the sand castle.
00:14:50,00:14:51,So he was encouraging lots of kids
00:14:51,00:14:53,"to advertise his whiskey, basically."
00:14:53,00:14:55,"And so then this spiraled out of control,"
00:14:55,00:14:57,'cause temperance movements got really upset
00:14:57,00:14:59,at the fact that they were using kids as a vehicle
00:14:59,00:15:01,to advertise extremely strong liquor.
00:15:01,00:15:04,And so these temperance movements
00:15:04,00:15:07,ran a rival contest for who could build a sand castle
00:15:07,00:15:08,that denounced drink and alcohol
00:15:08,00:15:10,in the strongest possible terms.
00:15:10,00:15:12,(laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:14,"Poor kids, so torn."
00:15:14,00:15:15,- That's amazing.
00:15:15,00:15:16,- Wow.
00:15:16,00:15:17,That's awesome.
00:15:17,00:15:20,I found a thing which really surprised me.
00:15:20,00:15:21,This was from 1990.
00:15:21,00:15:25,"It was a scientific report that was looking into,"
00:15:25,00:15:27,"there's always the thing of, you know,"
00:15:27,00:15:30,vending machines kill more people than sharks do per year.
00:15:30,00:15:33,So does sand castles more than sharks per year?
00:15:33,00:15:35,"Sand castles, sand tunnels."
00:15:35,00:15:38,"So anything where you're trying to construct by a sand,"
00:15:38,00:15:40,and the collapse is very dangerous.
00:15:40,00:15:44,"So in 1990 they found 16 people died of it as opposed to 12,"
00:15:44,00:15:47,which is how many would killed by sharks in that year.
00:15:47,00:15:48,- Wow.
00:15:48,00:15:48,- Yeah.
00:15:48,00:15:50,"- What a way to go, running ashore, thinking,"
00:15:50,00:15:52,"""Oh, finally, have avoided that shark."""
00:15:52,00:15:53,(laughing)
00:15:53,00:15:56,"Well, pretty good day for me."
00:15:56,00:15:57,(laughing)
00:15:57,00:15:58,- Bang.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Sand castle.
00:15:59,00:15:59,- Yep.
00:15:59,00:16:01,(laughing)
00:16:01,00:16:05,"- Well, lifeguards have to watch out for people"
00:16:05,00:16:06,digging two deep holes on beaches.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"So this is, they have fewer complaints"
00:16:09,00:16:11,about going out and having to save people from sharks
00:16:11,00:16:14,and they do about going and having to tell kids
00:16:14,00:16:17,or adults to stop building such a deep hole.
00:16:17,00:16:20,And I was reading something by a life I called Annie Howe
00:16:20,00:16:21,"who was saying, she didn't like it for nine years"
00:16:21,00:16:24,"and she often has to warn beachgoers that in her words,"
00:16:24,00:16:27,their excavations are getting out of control.
00:16:27,00:16:30,And she says that no hole should be more than
00:16:30,00:16:32,need deep for the smallest person in the group.
00:16:32,00:16:35,So I think we have all surely contribute there.
00:16:35,00:16:37,"- Yeah, 'cause that's part of the fun, isn't it,"
00:16:37,00:16:38,trying to dig to Australia?
00:16:38,00:16:39,- It should.
00:16:39,00:16:40,- Yeah.
00:16:40,00:16:43,"- Sorry, it's not so that people don't dig to Australia."
00:16:43,00:16:44,(laughing)
00:16:44,00:16:45,I presume.
00:16:45,00:16:46,- No.
00:16:46,00:16:47,- It's an anti-immigration thing
00:16:47,00:16:49,'cause I think the Australians will come back up.
00:16:49,00:16:51,- I got it.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"- Sorry, I should add, through what I said earlier"
00:16:53,00:16:57,about sandcastles and tunnels being the fatality thing.
00:16:57,00:16:59,It's actually majorotively people digging holes.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"So when people are walking at night on a beach,"
00:17:01,00:17:03,"not knowing there's a massive hole, that's how they."
00:17:03,00:17:04,- No way.
00:17:04,00:17:05,- Yeah.
00:17:05,00:17:08,"- No, the main danger is sand falling in on you."
00:17:08,00:17:09,You're not red danger.
00:17:09,00:17:11,People walking at night falling into the holes by the way.
00:17:11,00:17:12,"- Well, I think that's right."
00:17:12,00:17:14,I think it's the holes collapse.
00:17:14,00:17:15,It's a lot of people falling into the hole.
00:17:15,00:17:16,It's very tough.
00:17:16,00:17:18,- It's got the muscle power to dig a hole so big
00:17:18,00:17:20,that it falls in on you.
00:17:20,00:17:21,"- It's not, I know it's about the foot."
00:17:21,00:17:23,I almost killed my grandmother that way.
00:17:23,00:17:24,"She, well."
00:17:24,00:17:25,(laughing)
00:17:25,00:17:26,- I better love next time.
00:17:26,00:17:27,(laughing)
00:17:27,00:17:28,- I didn't intend to.
00:17:28,00:17:31,I was at her house and I dug a hole in the garden
00:17:31,00:17:33,and I didn't tell her and she went out at night
00:17:33,00:17:35,and she ended up in hospital.
00:17:35,00:17:36,And but she's okay.
00:17:36,00:17:38,- But didn't you grow up in Australia?
00:17:38,00:17:39,- Yeah.
00:17:39,00:17:40,- When you're trying to dig to the UK.
00:17:40,00:17:43,(laughing)
00:17:43,00:17:44,- Yeah.
00:17:44,00:17:47,"Okay, it is time for fact number three"
00:17:47,00:17:51,"and that is my fact, my fact this week."
00:17:51,00:17:51,Oh boy.
00:17:51,00:17:52,(laughing)
00:17:52,00:17:57,My fact this week is Queen Elizabeth the first was a man.
00:17:57,00:18:04,"According to the Dracula author, Bram Stoker."
00:18:04,00:18:04,Yeah.
00:18:04,00:18:05,Isn't that amazing?
00:18:05,00:18:08,This is the fact that the year before.
00:18:08,00:18:10,"- I mean, he was writing fiction quite a lot."
00:18:10,00:18:12,- And he was writing fiction but the year before he died
00:18:12,00:18:14,he wrote a nonfiction book.
00:18:14,00:18:16,And it was called Famous in Posters
00:18:16,00:18:18,and the idea was to expose con artists
00:18:18,00:18:21,and it was to expose hoaxes and so on.
00:18:21,00:18:24,"However, there's one chapter in it in which he claims"
00:18:24,00:18:27,and he did proper investigation into it
00:18:27,00:18:30,that Queen Elizabeth the first was a man
00:18:30,00:18:33,and he actually published that and obviously it's not true
00:18:33,00:18:34,but it's so crazy though.
00:18:34,00:18:37,"- Well, let's not reject it and look at it."
00:18:37,00:18:38,- There's a lot of compelling evidence.
00:18:38,00:18:40,- Let's hear the evidence.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"- Well, he said things like, for example, she never married."
00:18:43,00:18:46,(audience laughing)
00:18:46,00:18:48,She used to wear a lot of wigs.
00:18:48,00:18:50,He said someone's trying to hide a bald spot.
00:18:50,00:18:52,- She used to wear one wig at a time.
00:18:52,00:18:54,(laughing)
00:18:54,00:18:57,- But she didn't wear a snack of wigs.
00:18:57,00:18:59,"- Yeah, no, but she was constantly famously"
00:18:59,00:19:01,according to him was wearing wigs.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"The story is that basically when the original,"
00:19:04,00:19:08,"this is according to, I need to specify this is not my theory."
00:19:08,00:19:11,"This is a very famous author, Bram Sker."
00:19:11,00:19:14,"He said that when Queen Elizabeth was a 10 years old,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"she was visiting Bizly, which is in Gloucestershire"
00:19:16,00:19:18,"and while she was there, the plague was very rife"
00:19:18,00:19:21,and she got ill and she passed away.
00:19:21,00:19:24,The place Bizly thought that they were gonna suffer
00:19:24,00:19:28,the wrath of Henry and so they quickly had to replace her.
00:19:28,00:19:32,"However, they didn't find a girl who is anyone still listening?"
00:19:32,00:19:35,(audience laughing)
00:19:35,00:19:37,- So they couldn't find a girl that would match
00:19:37,00:19:42,her complexion to fool Henry and so they did find this one boy
00:19:42,00:19:44,"and they said, you're gonna have to now be Elizabeth"
00:19:44,00:19:49,"and he said, okay, and then it worked and it worked."
00:19:49,00:19:51,"- Yeah, it worked and we're gonna have to stick with this"
00:19:51,00:19:53,"and so, okay, it's time for fact number one."
00:19:53,00:19:55,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
00:19:55,00:19:57,- This is basically the class hamster has died
00:19:57,00:19:59,theory of egret history.
00:19:59,00:20:04,"- Because actually if you, 'cause I read that book today"
00:20:04,00:20:09,and he says that because the people of Bizly still believe it
00:20:09,00:20:12,"that it must be true, 'cause he's like,"
00:20:12,00:20:15,"if it wasn't true, there's no way they'd still believe that shit."
00:20:15,00:20:17,"- Yeah, and for a long time, there used to be a thing"
00:20:17,00:20:19,where they would dress boys as Queen Elizabeth
00:20:19,00:20:21,and so the idea was that there was a local vicar
00:20:21,00:20:25,"who started this rumor, what's interesting"
00:20:25,00:20:27,is that Bram Stoker effectively was a conspiracy theorist
00:20:27,00:20:30,which is very bizarre for the time as well
00:20:30,00:20:33,"and he was, no one believed him obviously at the time"
00:20:33,00:20:34,"but it is a theory. - Well they did,"
00:20:34,00:20:36,because as in it was a theory that had existed
00:20:36,00:20:39,for since Queen Elizabeth and he popularized it
00:20:39,00:20:41,so there were people who genuinely thought that
00:20:41,00:20:43,and there were people who put to get lots of evidence
00:20:43,00:20:47,about it like the fact that her writing style changed
00:20:47,00:20:51,apparently as soon as she left Bizly so--
00:20:51,00:20:52,- When she was seven years old.
00:20:52,00:20:54,"- Yeah, so everyone's development was so--"
00:20:54,00:20:57,"- Oh, she started writing in cursive, she must be a man."
00:20:57,00:20:59,"- James, 10 years old."
00:20:59,00:21:00,"- Oh, sorry, yeah."
00:21:00,00:21:03,"- No, it did change and yeah, that was pretty much it"
00:21:03,00:21:07,in the way from a young girl's diary to just football scores
00:21:07,00:21:08,every week.
00:21:08,00:21:10,(audience laughing)
00:21:10,00:21:12,- It's the way to super my pram.
00:21:12,00:21:16,(audience laughing)
00:21:16,00:21:19,- So the Times reviewed the book as Tommy Rocks.
00:21:19,00:21:20,- Yep.
00:21:20,00:21:22,- The original manuscript is signed BS
00:21:22,00:21:25,but it was by Bram Stoker.
00:21:25,00:21:27,(audience laughing)
00:21:27,00:21:30,- But that's just as good evidence as the stuff you're giving
00:21:30,00:21:31,"that is just not true, right?"
00:21:31,00:21:33,"- Hang on, again, it's not my evidence."
00:21:33,00:21:34,(audience laughing)
00:21:34,00:21:37,- But it is true that Bram Stoker was a conspiracy theorist
00:21:37,00:21:38,and that is the curious thing.
00:21:38,00:21:40,And I had a look at the book and it's got loads
00:21:40,00:21:42,of other hoaxes that have happened in history.
00:21:42,00:21:43,Some he's just reporting.
00:21:43,00:21:46,"So there's one called the Cat Hoax of 1815,"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"which is where Napoleon was about to be sent to St Helena,"
00:21:50,00:21:53,it's a very distant island and it was supposedly
00:21:53,00:21:56,over on with rats and people put up signs
00:21:56,00:21:58,around the city of Chester saying that the government
00:21:58,00:22:01,desperately needed lots of cats to wipe out all the rats
00:22:01,00:22:03,on St Helena to make it fit for Napoleon.
00:22:03,00:22:07,"And if you bring your cat to this address tomorrow,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,the government will give you quite a lot of money for it.
00:22:10,00:22:12,"And it was mayhem, it was absolute collusion."
00:22:12,00:22:14,People brought hundreds and hundreds of cats.
00:22:14,00:22:17,- So was it a hoax that it was just some random person
00:22:17,00:22:19,"who you didn't like and they went there, is that it?"
00:22:19,00:22:22,"- It was an empty house, so I don't know exactly why it was."
00:22:22,00:22:23,"It was, although that would be a hell of a prank."
00:22:23,00:22:27,"- I know, it's like ordering a pizza to someone but with cats."
00:22:27,00:22:28,- Yeah.
00:22:28,00:22:30,(audience laughing)
00:22:30,00:22:33,"- But Bram Stoker did write some questionable stuff, didn't he?"
00:22:33,00:22:35,"A lot of it's been discovered recently,"
00:22:35,00:22:40,so a book of his notes was discovered in the '90s
00:22:40,00:22:44,"and basically he loves puns and he loves really rude jokes,"
00:22:44,00:22:46,so there's a really good joke.
00:22:46,00:22:48,I'm just gonna see if it works.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"For this joke to work, you do actually have to know"
00:22:50,00:22:51,what a canticle is.
00:22:51,00:22:53,(audience laughing)
00:22:53,00:22:54,Does everyone know what a canticle is?
00:22:54,00:22:55,- I don't know what one is.
00:22:55,00:22:56,- Cool.
00:22:56,00:22:57,- Yes.
00:22:57,00:22:59,- We've got some church goes in the audience.
00:22:59,00:23:02,"It's like a religious song, it's like a hymn, isn't it?"
00:23:02,00:23:04,So this is a really funny joke.
00:23:04,00:23:06,Why is death like a psalm?
00:23:06,00:23:09,"- I don't know, why is death like a psalm?"
00:23:09,00:23:10,- Is it supposed to do a canticle?
00:23:10,00:23:13,(audience laughing)
00:23:13,00:23:14,"James, you've absolutely nailed it."
00:23:14,00:23:18,"Because I've been cut out the bit where you said,"
00:23:18,00:23:20,you need to know what canticle is.
00:23:20,00:23:21,(audience laughing)
00:23:21,00:23:23,- You look like an absolute genius.
00:23:23,00:23:26,"No, it's quite clever because kicking the bucket"
00:23:26,00:23:28,resembles a can tickle.
00:23:29,00:23:30,- Yeah.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- Well.
00:23:31,00:23:32,- That's great.
00:23:32,00:23:35,"- Yeah, it just shows that comedy changes, I suppose."
00:23:35,00:23:37,(audience laughing)
00:23:37,00:23:39,"So Dracula, just briefly on Dracula,"
00:23:39,00:23:41,did you know the first adaptation of Dracula
00:23:41,00:23:44,for the stage happened before the novel came out?
00:23:44,00:23:45,- Really?
00:23:45,00:23:46,- No way.
00:23:46,00:23:47,- Yeah.
00:23:47,00:23:49,- So he worked for many years as the manager
00:23:49,00:23:52,"to the actor Henry Irving, who was incredibly famous"
00:23:52,00:23:55,"in Victorian times, Cumberbatch levels of famous,"
00:23:55,00:23:58,"and he ran his theatre, the Lyceum, which is in London."
00:23:58,00:23:59,It's in the West End.
00:23:59,00:24:02,"And Stoker had been writing this novel for a very long time,"
00:24:02,00:24:05,"and it debuted at the Lyceum Theatre, where he worked."
00:24:05,00:24:08,And Stoker had been working on it for seven years.
00:24:08,00:24:10,"It was only performed once, and after the performance,"
00:24:10,00:24:13,"he asked his boss Henry Irving, the incredibly famous actor,"
00:24:13,00:24:16,"what he thought, the only word Irving said"
00:24:16,00:24:18,in reply was dreadful.
00:24:18,00:24:19,(audience laughing)
00:24:19,00:24:21,"I know, but I think it may have been, you know,"
00:24:21,00:24:24,"it was full of dread, because it's a very spooky story."
00:24:24,00:24:24,(audience laughing)
00:24:24,00:24:26,"So, and a lot of people say to me after gigs,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,"""Andy, that was dreadful."""
00:24:28,00:24:29,(audience laughing)
00:24:29,00:24:30,I think that's why.
00:24:30,00:24:32,(audience laughing)
00:24:32,00:24:33,- That'll be it.
00:24:33,00:24:34,"- And so when they say it's awful,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,it's 'cause they're full of awe.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Exactly.
00:24:36,00:24:38,"- Yeah, and when they say, ""Shit."""
00:24:38,00:24:43,(audience laughing)
00:24:43,00:24:44,- Can't win them all.
00:24:44,00:24:47,(audience laughing)
00:24:47,00:24:51,- We should say that he was not famous in his own time.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"So I went back through the British Newspaper archive,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,looking for his obituary.
00:24:55,00:24:58,"And when he died, all the obits said"
00:24:58,00:25:00,he was the manager of Henry Irving.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"So as Andy says, Henry Irving was the Cumberbatch."
00:25:02,00:25:05,"And literally, it was just an adendum"
00:25:05,00:25:06,at the end of the obituary.
00:25:06,00:25:08,"And he wrote a number of novels,"
00:25:08,00:25:10,"but Henry Irving, what a guy."
00:25:10,00:25:12,"And Henry Irving was quite an exciting guy,"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"and a really nice person, as far as I could tell."
00:25:15,00:25:18,And he had this lovely coincidence
00:25:18,00:25:19,where he was an actor.
00:25:19,00:25:22,And his last work he performed on stage
00:25:22,00:25:24,was the day that he died.
00:25:24,00:25:27,"This was in 1905, and his last words on stage were"
00:25:27,00:25:29,"""Into Thy Hands O Lord."""
00:25:29,00:25:32,"And then he had a stroke that night, and he died."
00:25:32,00:25:34,And then all the newspapers reported it
00:25:34,00:25:37,"as ""Pathetic End to a Great Career,"""
00:25:37,00:25:40,"which ""Pathetic"" meant a different thing a hundred years ago,"
00:25:40,00:25:42,but now it just looks incredibly harsh.
00:25:42,00:25:44,"- No, no, a lot of people say to me,"
00:25:44,00:25:45,"Andy, that was pathetic."
00:25:45,00:25:49,(audience laughing)
00:25:49,00:25:51,"- Did you know, just on Boy's Dressed As Girls"
00:25:51,00:25:54,"and Girls Dressed As Boys, in the Elizabethan Theatre,"
00:25:54,00:25:57,"all the roles of girls were played by boys,"
00:25:57,00:25:58,but I didn't know this.
00:25:58,00:26:01,You could be officially legally kidnapped
00:26:01,00:26:04,if you were a child and put in a play.
00:26:04,00:26:05,- Really?
00:26:05,00:26:06,- Yes.
00:26:06,00:26:07,- What?
00:26:07,00:26:08,- This was not illegal.
00:26:08,00:26:11,"So theaters, if they had a license,"
00:26:11,00:26:15,could abduct children and put them in place.
00:26:15,00:26:17,"- Wow, this is real."
00:26:17,00:26:18,"- So you'd get back to your meat hook,"
00:26:18,00:26:20,"and you'd be like, ""Where's my plate?"""
00:26:20,00:26:22,(audience laughing)
00:26:22,00:26:25,"Queen Elizabeth granted permission to theaters, like..."
00:26:25,00:26:26,- 30.
00:26:26,00:26:29,(audience laughing)
00:26:29,00:26:35,"- Yeah, it was originally so they could get choristers"
00:26:35,00:26:37,"for the Royal Chapel, but the theaters all did it too,"
00:26:37,00:26:38,and now I'm really minded.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"There are legal cases surviving of people saying,"
00:26:40,00:26:42,"""I quite like my son back."""
00:26:42,00:26:44,(audience laughing)
00:26:44,00:26:47,"- I can't, was there just not enough interest"
00:26:47,00:26:48,in their profession?
00:26:48,00:26:49,- No.
00:26:49,00:26:49,- Right.
00:26:49,00:26:50,- Okay.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"Well, I think we've got a shortage of teachers"
00:26:52,00:26:54,"at the moment, haven't we, in this country?"
00:26:54,00:26:56,There's something to think about.
00:26:56,00:26:58,- We're gonna have to move on to the final fact soon.
00:26:58,00:26:59,Anything before we do?
00:26:59,00:27:01,- Can I give you another brown stoker joke?
00:27:01,00:27:02,Oh God.
00:27:02,00:27:03,(audience laughing)
00:27:03,00:27:06,"- Do you wanna save it to close the show, Roy?"
00:27:06,00:27:08,We might need a big one at the end.
00:27:08,00:27:10,"- I felt like these guys appetites, they couldn't wait."
00:27:10,00:27:12,"- Okay, let's do it."
00:27:12,00:27:13,"Now, do you all know what a chasable is?"
00:27:13,00:27:14,Good.
00:27:14,00:27:18,"- You do actually need to know what a prince consort is,"
00:27:18,00:27:20,but I see he has a...
00:27:20,00:27:21,(audience laughing)
00:27:21,00:27:23,"Come on, Brighton."
00:27:23,00:27:26,"So, the question is, why is the letter P"
00:27:26,00:27:29,like a prince consort?
00:27:29,00:27:30,Anyone?
00:27:30,00:27:30,No.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"Okay, I'll give you the answer."
00:27:31,00:27:33,(audience laughing)
00:27:33,00:27:38,"Because it makes a queen pregnant, a queen pregnant."
00:27:38,00:27:41,- Oh yeah.
00:27:41,00:27:42,- You also have to know what a queen pregnant is.
00:27:42,00:27:45,(audience laughing)
00:27:45,00:27:47,- I actually got quite a good response.
00:27:47,00:27:48,"- It's all right, isn't it?"
00:27:48,00:27:50,- That's probably the first time anyone said that joke
00:27:50,00:27:52,on a stage since Bram Stoker.
00:27:52,00:27:53,- Yeah.
00:27:53,00:27:54,- Yeah.
00:27:54,00:27:55,- Yeah.
00:27:55,00:27:57,- Should we move on to our final facts on the night?
00:27:57,00:27:58,- Yeah.
00:27:58,00:28:00,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:28:00,00:28:02,and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:28:02,00:28:05,- My fact is that when a computer tried to come up
00:28:05,00:28:07,with romantic messages for love heart suites
00:28:07,00:28:11,"based on existing ones, it came up with bear wig,"
00:28:11,00:28:16,"meat mate, bong love, and you are bag."
00:28:16,00:28:19,(audience laughing)
00:28:19,00:28:21,"- In Sweden, it was you, our park, wasn't it?"
00:28:21,00:28:23,(audience laughing)
00:28:23,00:28:24,"- They're great, aren't they?"
00:28:24,00:28:25,"- Well, no."
00:28:25,00:28:26,- Yeah.
00:28:26,00:28:28,"- If they were great, it wouldn't be a good fact."
00:28:28,00:28:30,(audience laughing)
00:28:30,00:28:33,"- So there is a researcher, I think she's American,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"she's called Janelle Shane,"
00:28:34,00:28:38,and she specializes in building neural networks.
00:28:38,00:28:41,"So this is where you feed a machine load of information,"
00:28:41,00:28:42,and you try and encourage it to come up
00:28:42,00:28:44,"with more things that I like it,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,with varying degrees of creativity.
00:28:46,00:28:47,So you can dial it up or dial it down
00:28:47,00:28:51,to get them more accurate or more imaginative.
00:28:51,00:28:52,"And she did this with love hearts,"
00:28:52,00:28:54,"she fed in a load of love hearts,"
00:28:54,00:28:56,and some of them were really good.
00:28:56,00:29:00,"So there was cute kiss, and my bear, which is quite sweet."
00:29:00,00:29:01,"- Yeah, that's good."
00:29:01,00:29:03,"- Some of them were okay, am good."
00:29:03,00:29:06,(audience laughing)
00:29:06,00:29:07,You are a babe.
00:29:07,00:29:09,(audience laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:10,"They're all right, but then there were others"
00:29:10,00:29:15,"which included, pin a face, sweat poo,"
00:29:15,00:29:19,(audience laughing)
00:29:19,00:29:22,"and my favourite one, love 2,000 hogs, yeah."
00:29:22,00:29:24,(audience laughing)
00:29:24,00:29:26,"- It's hard to imagine them fitting that on the suite,"
00:29:26,00:29:27,isn't it? - Yeah.
00:29:27,00:29:32,"- I also saw Stank Love, my hag, hole."
00:29:32,00:29:35,(audience laughing)
00:29:35,00:29:37,And you hack.
00:29:37,00:29:38,- You hack.
00:29:38,00:29:39,- You hack.
00:29:39,00:29:42,- That's one fit to give to Bram Stoker after a set.
00:29:42,00:29:44,(audience laughing)
00:29:44,00:29:46,"- And this for overseas listeners,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,'cause I didn't know they were called love hearts.
00:29:48,00:29:49,"I've called them sweet hearts,"
00:29:49,00:29:51,which I think an America is what they're called.
00:29:51,00:29:52,So it's the same thing.
00:29:52,00:29:54,- Sometimes conversation hearts as well.
00:29:54,00:29:56,"- Yes, yeah, so it's a little sugary heart"
00:29:56,00:29:59,"with a message on it for, yeah."
00:29:59,00:30:01,"- And apparently I think in the '80s in Britain at least,"
00:30:01,00:30:04,"they wanted to get drop dead gorgeous on the suite,"
00:30:04,00:30:08,"but it was too long, and so they instead went with drop dead."
00:30:08,00:30:10,(audience laughing)
00:30:10,00:30:11,'Cause what?
00:30:11,00:30:12,- I don't remember.
00:30:12,00:30:14,- I remember growing up and seeing drop dead on that.
00:30:14,00:30:16,"And always, I thought it was just like,"
00:30:16,00:30:18,"you know, Russian roulette of, you know, you're gonna go--"
00:30:18,00:30:20,(audience laughing)
00:30:20,00:30:21,You're just gonna get one bad one.
00:30:21,00:30:23,"And you never know, like you give someone a suite,"
00:30:23,00:30:24,"and it might be a nice one,"
00:30:24,00:30:26,or it might be not a nice one.
00:30:26,00:30:27,"- It might be, you are bag."
00:30:27,00:30:31,(audience laughing)
00:30:31,00:30:35,So obviously they have to change it as the years go around.
00:30:35,00:30:38,"So at the 1950s, they phased out, hey, daddy, oh."
00:30:39,00:30:42,"- I know it's ready for a comeback, isn't it?"
00:30:42,00:30:43,- I think so.
00:30:43,00:30:47,"- Right, Wikipedia claims that faxed me is still on the list,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,which I cannot believe faxed me.
00:30:49,00:30:52,"- There is one that's grow up,"
00:30:52,00:30:55,and that was actually the cause of a complaint
00:30:55,00:30:58,that the Love Arts Company received from a man
00:30:58,00:31:00,"who was trying to placate his wife after a row,"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"and he gave her a tubular of hearts,"
00:31:01,00:31:03,and the first message that she saw was grow up.
00:31:03,00:31:05,(audience laughing)
00:31:05,00:31:07,And she left him.
00:31:07,00:31:08,- No.
00:31:08,00:31:11,"- The article said, grow up is still in production,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,so they obviously didn't think that was a good enough reason
00:31:13,00:31:14,to discontinue.
00:31:14,00:31:18,"- Wow, grow up, that is one of those not good ones though,"
00:31:18,00:31:19,isn't it?
00:31:19,00:31:22,"- Yeah, I can't think of a good way that grow up could be used."
00:31:22,00:31:24,- With me?
00:31:24,00:31:25,"- Grow up with me, grow old with me."
00:31:25,00:31:27,- It's more grow old with me.
00:31:27,00:31:29,(audience laughing)
00:31:29,00:31:33,"- Some more recent ones from 2014 on the Love Arts,"
00:31:33,00:31:38,"Skype for Me is now one, Yolo is one, Toat Hiller."
00:31:38,00:31:42,(audience laughing)
00:31:42,00:31:45,"And this is a good one for me, Ori Pet."
00:31:45,00:31:48,"- Oh, that's great, that's a good one, isn't it?"
00:31:48,00:31:50,"- Oh, you can fax me."
00:31:50,00:31:52,(audience laughing)
00:31:52,00:31:54,"So the very original Love Arts,"
00:31:54,00:31:56,"they were called Conversation Lozenges,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,that was the original name.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"- Yeah, I know, it's so good."
00:32:00,00:32:01,"And they date from the 1820s,"
00:32:01,00:32:03,"these are seriously old things,"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"and they originally had the message on the wrapper,"
00:32:05,00:32:08,and then eventually the message migrated onto the suite.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"But the messages said things like,"
00:32:10,00:32:13,"can you polka, do you flirt,"
00:32:13,00:32:15,or the highly flirtatious?
00:32:15,00:32:17,"No, I won't ask Mamma."
00:32:17,00:32:21,(audience laughing)
00:32:21,00:32:24,"But then the temperance movement got hold of the Love Heart,"
00:32:24,00:32:27,"and they started putting on messages like,"
00:32:27,00:32:30,"misery, sickness, and poverty are the effects of drunkenness."
00:32:30,00:32:32,(audience laughing)
00:32:32,00:32:34,They ruined everything.
00:32:34,00:32:35,(audience laughing)
00:32:35,00:32:37,There was a real fashion in the Victorian era
00:32:37,00:32:39,"for a suite that had a message on them,"
00:32:39,00:32:43,and the LRB pointed out that the rage for suites
00:32:43,00:32:44,with a message was initially delayed
00:32:44,00:32:47,"by the illiteracy prevailing in the market,"
00:32:47,00:32:50,"but successive education acts did for readable suites,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,what they also did for penny dreadfuls and newspapers.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"So they became more popular,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,"but sticks of rock with a message inside,"
00:32:57,00:32:59,"which we are familiar with today, right?"
00:32:59,00:33:01,"Were popular in the 1800s,"
00:33:01,00:33:04,and the first mention of sticks of rock with a message
00:33:04,00:33:05,"came in the 1860s,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"where it was mentioned in someone's diary,"
00:33:07,00:33:10,"and messages in size sticks of rock included,"
00:33:10,00:33:12,do you love me?
00:33:12,00:33:13,Do you love sprouts?
00:33:13,00:33:15,(audience laughing)
00:33:15,00:33:19,"Sir Robert Peel, who was a recently deceased prime minister."
00:33:19,00:33:21,(audience laughing)
00:33:21,00:33:22,I'm just sucking on a stick of rock
00:33:22,00:33:26,and seeing Theresa May's name being spelled out.
00:33:26,00:33:30,"And so the American ones are not made by swizzles,"
00:33:30,00:33:32,"they're made by NECO, an ECCO,"
00:33:32,00:33:34,which is a new England candy company.
00:33:34,00:33:37,They also make candy buttons and havel and mince
00:33:37,00:33:38,"and a few other things,"
00:33:38,00:33:41,"but there are a few things that they don't make anymore,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,"including whore-hound ovals,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,"jujube monoplanes,"
00:33:46,00:33:49,"wang-bees,"
00:33:49,00:33:51,and climax mint patties.
00:33:51,00:33:52,Whoa.
00:33:52,00:33:55,"They sound great, don't they?"
00:33:55,00:33:58,"I mean, I'd love to, at the end of a meal,"
00:33:58,00:34:01,would you like a climax mint patty?
00:34:01,00:34:01,(audience laughing)
00:34:01,00:34:05,They sound like sort of x-rated Harry Potter sweet shop
00:34:05,00:34:07,"when you go behind the door, that's what it is."
00:34:07,00:34:08,"Yeah, wang-bees."
00:34:08,00:34:14,"Well, just on the topic of AI sort of generating this new stuff"
00:34:14,00:34:18,"and a bizarrely Harry Potter, you mentioning that,"
00:34:18,00:34:20,I found an amazing AI generated Harry Potter book
00:34:20,00:34:22,the other day.
00:34:22,00:34:25,It's made by this online company called Botnik Studios.
00:34:25,00:34:27,"They're online artists to do, they're really cool,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,really fun stuff.
00:34:29,00:34:31,And what they did is they fed into this machine
00:34:31,00:34:34,all seven books of Harry Potter and they understood the language
00:34:34,00:34:37,and so on and kind of got their heads around it.
00:34:37,00:34:40,And it pumped out an original Harry Potter book.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"And yeah, it's an amazing book."
00:34:43,00:34:43,I'll read a couple of--
00:34:43,00:34:44,Do you know what it's called?
00:34:44,00:34:47,"Yeah, I thought I had the title here,"
00:34:47,00:34:48,I'm missing it at the moment.
00:34:48,00:34:50,"I'll see if I can find it before the end of the show,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,but I'll give you a couple of extracts from it.
00:34:52,00:34:55,"This is from chapter 13, The Handsome One, it's called."
00:34:56,00:34:59,"""Lethory Sheets of Rain"" lashed at Harry's ghost"
00:34:59,00:35:02,as he walked across the grounds towards the castle.
00:35:02,00:35:06,Ron was standing there and doing a kind of frenzied tap dance.
00:35:06,00:35:10,He saw Harry and immediately began to eat Hermione's family.
00:35:10,00:35:15,And then--
00:35:15,00:35:18,"Oh, that's a bit from the order of the Phoenix, I think."
00:35:18,00:35:19,This is the very next page.
00:35:19,00:35:22,Harry could tell that Voldemort was standing right behind him.
00:35:22,00:35:24,He felt a great overreaction.
00:35:24,00:35:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:26,00:35:28,Harry tore--
00:35:28,00:35:32,Harry tore his eyes from his head and threw them into the forest.
00:35:32,00:35:36,"In fact, that is an overreaction."
00:35:36,00:35:39,"Voldemort raised his eyebrows at Harry,"
00:35:39,00:35:40,who could not see anything at the moment.
00:35:40,00:35:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:43,00:35:46,Ron threw his wand at Voldemort and everyone applauded.
00:35:46,00:35:47,Ron smiled.
00:35:47,00:35:50,Ron reached through his wand slowly.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"Not so handsome now thought Harry,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,as he dipped Hermione in hot sauce.
00:35:54,00:35:57,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:57,00:36:00,That is amazing.
00:36:00,00:36:02,That whole range of family is edible in this.
00:36:02,00:36:06,"Yeah, they are not, like this is an amazing bit as well."
00:36:06,00:36:08,"Voldemort, you're a very bad and mean wizard."
00:36:08,00:36:12,"Harry savagely said, Hermione nodded encouragingly."
00:36:12,00:36:14,"The tall death eater was wearing a shirt that said,"
00:36:14,00:36:16,Hermione has forgotten how to dance.
00:36:16,00:36:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:19,00:36:20,So Hermione dipped his face in mud.
00:36:20,00:36:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:23,00:36:25,"I mean, it reads awesomely."
00:36:25,00:36:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:26,00:36:28,"I read one, it might not be as good as that."
00:36:28,00:36:32,I read one about fortune cookies.
00:36:32,00:36:35,So they used AI to find some fortune cookie things.
00:36:35,00:36:38,One of them is a short pencil is usually
00:36:38,00:36:40,better than a bird in the future.
00:36:40,00:36:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:43,00:36:46,Do not have a peaceful place where you will feel better.
00:36:46,00:36:49,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:49,00:36:52,"And this one, carve your name on your parents."
00:36:52,00:36:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:55,00:36:59,"I mean, we're laughing now, but they're going to kill us."
00:36:59,00:37:00,"OK, that is it."
00:37:00,00:37:02,That is all of our facts.

00:37:31,00:37:34,"to read, like a book called Harry Potter and the Portrait"
00:37:34,00:37:36,of what looked like a large pile of ash.
00:37:36,00:37:41,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:41,00:37:45,"And it also has a link to our exclusive cassette, which"

00:37:56,00:37:57,"James, you got it?"
00:37:57,00:37:59,It's from John Platt.
00:37:59,00:38:01,"And the fact is, if a human could move their arm"
00:38:01,00:38:04,"one-tenth as fast as a mantis shrimp,"
00:38:04,00:38:07,they could throw a baseball into orbit.
00:38:07,00:38:08,Whoa.
00:38:08,00:38:09,Wow.
00:38:09,00:38:09,Yeah.
