1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
 (tapping sound)

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,340
 (tapping sound)

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,020
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,600
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:21,560
 Hello and welcome to another episode

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,440
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,360
 this week coming to you from the Brighton Dome!

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,520
 (cheering and applause)

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,500
 My name is Dan Schreiber

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,620
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,580
 Andrew Hunter, Murray, and James Harkin.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,500
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

15
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,980
 and in no particular order, here we go.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,380
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,380
 - My fact this week is that until the 17th century,

18
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,020
 mothers hung their babies up on hooks while they worked.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,340
 (laughing)

20
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,180
 - It's amazing.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,940
 - You just hung them up like a coat.

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,940
 (laughing)

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,900
 - Were they, is it, yeah, is it like,

24
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,980
 everyone who works at the same place has a number

25
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,220
 above their hook and a-- - Oh, look at the cloakroom.

26
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,900
 - Yeah, yeah. - Like if you go to the restaurant,

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,540
 do you just leave your baby in the cloakroom?

28
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,700
 - Yeah, and if you lose your ticket,

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,820
 you're absolutely pockets.

30
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,220
 (laughing)

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,060
 - Can you describe it?

32
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,260
 Well, it is small, it's not got much hair

33
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,980
 and it's like Winston Churchill.

34
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,780
 (laughing)

35
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,940
 - This is genuinely true.

36
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,740
 So this baby needs to be swaddled for long periods

37
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,220
 of history, it was thought that it was good for them

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,980
 to be very tightly swaddled, wrapped up in material.

39
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,980
 So their limbs could grow straight, that was the belief.

40
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,580
 And once they were swaddled, then they would just be

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,780
 latched onto a hook that was maybe in your house,

42
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,100
 if you were doing the house work,

43
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,940
 or sometimes mothers would be working out

44
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,540
 in the field, doing agricultural work,

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,140
 and you could hook them onto a tree,

46
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,780
 like a bit of twig, and that was how they did it.

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,620
 - Wow.

48
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,260
 - Is that where the rocker by baby kind of thing comes from?

49
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,100
 - Ooh.

50
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,140
 - You're not rocking them, really.

51
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,620
 You're swinging them if you're doing anything.

52
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,180
 'Cause he's on a tree top.

53
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,020
 - Right.

54
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,820
 - He's definitely in a vessel lying down comfortably,

55
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,660
 not just like--

56
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,180
 - Just a small baby from the tree side.

57
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,420
 (laughing)

58
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,900
 - Yeah, keep holding your tear care to a baby.

59
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,700
 We'll disappear, it doesn't work.

60
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,540
 (laughing)

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,500
 - So this used to happen all over the place.

62
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,700
 In Sweden, women would carry their children

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,780
 in what was called a bog.

64
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,420
 Just put your baby in the bog.

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,260
 Baby bog.

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,100
 - What was it?

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
 - It was a bag.

68
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
 (laughing)

69
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,100
 - Sounds like a typo.

70
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,900
 (laughing)

71
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,460
 - Yeah, it's where we get the word bag from,

72
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,140
 but it was a leather container shaped into a bag.

73
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:37,980
 - Oh really?

74
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,820
 - Same principle.

75
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,940
 - There's actually still a thing today

76
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,900
 in amongst indigenous North Americans,

77
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,540
 where there's a thing called cradle boards,

78
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,420
 and these have been a thing for hundreds of years,

79
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,620
 and they're sort of flat boards that you strap a baby to,

80
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,700
 and in a very similar way,

81
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,300
 you can then hang them on a tree or lean them against a tree,

82
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
 and they were very commonly used,

83
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,020
 and there were a few tribes like the shoe,

84
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,540
 or the Iroquois, or the Cherokee,

85
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,220
 who were all kind of bringing them back

86
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,500
 in a sort of artisan way.

87
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,700
 They're really beautiful if you look them up,

88
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,260
 and therefore hanging babies up.

89
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,500
 - And actually they think that carrying babies

90
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,980
 or having like bogs or bags or whatever to put babies in,

91
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,180
 is probably one of the biggest inventions

92
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,460
 in the history of mankind.

93
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,300
 - Wow.

94
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,580
 - It's up there with like, you know,

95
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,380
 writing and the wheel and fire and all that kind of stuff.

96
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,220
 - Is it?

97
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,060
 - That's how I read it.

98
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,660
 - Well, it meant that mothers could carry food

99
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,340
 as well as carrying the child.

100
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
 So once you had a child,

101
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,220
 if you just had to hold it the whole time,

102
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,860
 basically you weren't able to do anything else,

103
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,340
 but this meant that they could carry food,

104
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,260
 they can go hunter-gathering as well.

105
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,780
 - Wow.

106
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,060
 - So prams used to not really be a thing,

107
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,740
 and if you did have a pram, you'd--

108
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,740
 - That's actually true of everything that was invented.

109
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,380
 (audience laughing)

110
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,380
 - iPhones didn't used to be a thing, really.

111
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,660
 - Yeah, that's fair.

112
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,060
 (audience laughing)

113
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,900
 - And that's it.

114
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,740
 - That's all I got.

115
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,260
 (audience laughing)

116
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,620
 - But basically in Germany, when it was invented,

117
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,700
 particularly mothers used to pull along prams,

118
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,460
 and obviously you can't see if the babies fallen out.

119
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,980
 So the push pram was a genuine innovation.

120
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
 But in Germany, until 1888,

121
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,980
 you had to have a license to take a child out in a pram.

122
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,140
 - Wow.

123
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,060
 - And this was so the police knew you had to permission

124
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,180
 to be out with basically a small vehicle,

125
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,700
 and you had to name the baby.

126
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,940
 You had to say, "I'm gonna be taking Jeff out in the pram."

127
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,940
 (audience laughing)

128
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,900
 - Wait, so if you're taking a different baby out in the pram,

129
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,300
 then you'd lose your license or whatever.

130
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,140
 You're arrested.

131
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,980
 - Six months.

132
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,820
 - Six months, prison.

133
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,660
 - What?

134
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,380
 - Prison, no, I don't know, I don't know.

135
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,260
 - And the other thing is around the same time in Britain,

136
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,180
 any vehicle with four wheels was counted as a road vehicle.

137
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,660
 Okay, so they got the new prams,

138
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,180
 which had like a bassinet, and they had four wheels.

139
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,700
 The previous ones only had three.

140
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,740
 And those four wheelers, you could get arrested

141
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,260
 for walking down the street with one of those.

142
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,300
 And people did, people got prosecuted.

143
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,100
 If you walked on the pavement with them, instead of the road.

144
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,580
 - So responsible advice, push your baby along

145
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,420
 and down the middle of the road.

146
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
 - Wow.

147
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,580
 - Another pregnancy thing, actually, giving birth thing.

148
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,460
 There is a medical text from the 12th century

149
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,100
 called the trotulla.

150
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,060
 And one of the instructions in there is if you're giving birth,

151
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,300
 you should induce sneezing to the woman.

152
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
 Because apparently when you sneeze,

153
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,020
 it helps contoe contract to your womb and push the child out.

154
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,660
 And they genuinely did this.

155
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,180
 - Wow, I mean, it's an unpleasant process anyway, I've heard.

156
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
 But having someone pour pepper into your nostrils,

157
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,380
 I was like, "It would make the whole thing even worse."

158
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,740
 - Well, they also said that the womb

159
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,340
 reacted differently to different kinds of smells.

160
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,540
 So the womb would push towards sweet smells

161
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,380
 and away from unpleasant smells.

162
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,220
 - What?

163
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,260
 So if you're giving birth near a beclava stand,

164
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,460
 you'll just be drawn magnetically over to it.

165
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,940
 (audience laughing)

166
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,340
 And I don't know why a beclava stand was the first thing

167
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,580
 I thought, "Oh, that's a good ass thing, isn't it?"

168
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,580
 - Metropolis and elite twat, why not say it to the guys?

169
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,820
 (audience laughing)

170
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,340
 - But so women didn't used to be allowed to be at birth.

171
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,660
 So there was a long tradition of only women being

172
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,420
 except for the women involved.

173
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,940
 (audience laughing)

174
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,100
 There was one woman allowed at every birth.

175
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,100
 So for many centuries, doctors weren't allowed at birth

176
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
 because men weren't allowed to see a woman giving birth

177
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
 because it was thought to be improper.

178
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,940
 So actually the only people that you would be allowed

179
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,500
 to have when you were giving birth were midwives

180
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,100
 after a while and astrologers,

181
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,500
 'cause some were more astrologers.

182
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,060
 So you couldn't have a doctor to tell you

183
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,860
 it was gonna be okay,

184
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,220
 but you could have an astrologer to give you

185
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,860
 a prediction of whether the baby was gonna survive.

186
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,460
 And then when doctors started taking over in the 19th century,

187
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,860
 it was decided that actually women couldn't handle

188
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,260
 being in the room with other women giving birth,

189
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,660
 even though I guess they are the ones that do it in the end.

190
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,260
 But the Lancet Medical Journal wrote in 1868

191
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,460
 that women are too delicate to watch someone else giving birth

192
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,100
 and only men could brave the revolting scenes of childbirth.

193
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
 (audience laughing)

194
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,940
 - Wow.

195
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,180
 - We just can't hack it.

196
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,580
 'Cause we actually never have to see it.

197
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,780
 - Right. - I think.

198
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
 - You're just lay there going,

199
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,340
 can anyone smell baccalaver?

200
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,340
 (audience laughing)

201
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,540
 - That is such a Sagittarius thing to say.

202
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,060
 (audience laughing)

203
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,940
 - Do you know what, I was looking up Medieval child rearing.

204
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,780
 - Oh yeah.

205
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,780
 - So what happened in Medieval era was,

206
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,020
 basically once you got to the age of 14,

207
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,460
 you would just be sent away on a French exchange forever.

208
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,620
 You would be sent to be a servant in someone else's house

209
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,380
 for seven to 10 years.

210
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,620
 Was it always in France?

211
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,660
 - It wasn't always in France actually.

212
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,620
 It was always not in France.

213
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,700
 It was never in France.

214
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
 It was.

215
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,180
 So you were sent on a French exchange trip forever,

216
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,060
 which was not in France and only lasted seven years.

217
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,380
 - Yeah.

218
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,900
 - I can see I'm gonna be accused of sexing up this fact.

219
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,540
 I was trying to think of an analogy.

220
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,700
 Basically you'd do a swap.

221
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,100
 Everyone just sent away their child to someone else's house

222
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,740
 and then you would get someone else's child

223
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,380
 being a servant in your house.

224
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,260
 And everyone did this right up to the aristocracy.

225
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,140
 - Because they thought that it was easier

226
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,620
 to bring up someone else's child, didn't they?

227
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,620
 - Oh wow. - Yeah.

228
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,740
 - That's cool.

229
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,420
 Have you guys heard, so again, around the sort of medieval period

230
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,420
 of the groaning cheese?

231
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,300
 This is really cool.

232
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,900
 It was just a tradition that people would do.

233
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,620
 And the idea was that when you got pregnant,

234
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,860
 you knew you were pregnant.

235
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,620
 You would mature a wheel of cheese

236
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,380
 for the nine month period that you were pregnant.

237
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,140
 And then once the baby was born,

238
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,300
 you would share out the cheese amongst family and friends

239
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,460
 and you would all eat the cheese.

240
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,780
 But it would leave the outer rind of the cheese.

241
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,300
 And on christening day, they would pass the baby through.

242
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,620
 - Yeah. - Through the hoop.

243
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,260
 - And that's where we get the tradition

244
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,500
 of the woman bursting out of the cake, isn't it?

245
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,980
 - Yes. - Yes.

246
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,820
 - No.

247
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,860
 - But yeah, that was the groaning cheese.

248
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,980
 - That's amazing. - That's amazing.

249
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,300
 - Yeah.

250
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,940
 - How up is that?

251
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,420
 Did you, on boggies and ways of pushing children around,

252
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:02,900
 did you see the survey that was done by Scoda,

253
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,020
 but it was seeing what father's thought

254
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,500
 about pushing boggies around.

255
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
 It was quite recent.

256
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,460
 It was, it discovered that 33% of fathers

257
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,700
 said they were embarrassed by their Pram or push chair.

258
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,740
 So they felt emasculated pushing them around.

259
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,260
 76% of dads said they'd be more likely to push a Pram

260
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,380
 if they had access to a stylish, high-spec buggy

261
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
 that could go.

262
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,580
 And so there's this one guy called Colin Furze,

263
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,100
 who in 2013, yeah, Colin Furze is broken a load of records.

264
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,740
 So he likes breaking records

265
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,580
 and he's broken the record for the world's fastest Pram.

266
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,660
 So he found out his wife was pregnant

267
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,820
 and he thought the way to be supportive was to attach

268
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,620
 a motorbike engine to a Pram and create something

269
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,180
 that can go up to 80 kilometers an hour, which it does.

270
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,860
 You can't put a baby in it.

271
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,940
 - That's a shot.

272
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,860
 - Because that'd be really dangerous.

273
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,900
 But he says he does put dolls in it

274
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,580
 just to freak out on lookers.

275
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,340
 (laughing)

276
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,220
 - Wait, but hang on, is he wearing roller skates?

277
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,580
 - No, but he has a little skateboard attached to the back

278
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,860
 that he can stand on.

279
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,060
 So it pulls him along.

280
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,660
 (laughing)

281
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,660
 - It's really cool.

282
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,900
 - That's incredible.

283
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,540
 - It's really cool, but his wife is still having

284
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:16,980
 to push the baby along in a normal Pram,

285
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,260
 some way behind him.

286
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:24,460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

287
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,220
 - Ah, yes, my fact this week is that there's a man in Brazil

288
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,460
 who's been living in a sand castle for 22 years.

289
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,100
 (laughing)

290
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,820
 He has to constantly water his house

291
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,540
 to prevent it from collapsing.

292
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,900
 (laughing)

293
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
 - It's extraordinary.

294
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,740
 - This is so cool.

295
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,460
 - So this is just a guy, he lives in Rio,

296
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,020
 he lives in Brazil, he's known as King Marcio,

297
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,300
 and he has this really awesome looking sand castle.

298
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,580
 It's like, just imagine like a really ornate sand castle.

299
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,740
 It's quite small on the inside,

300
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,980
 it's only about three square meters,

301
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,940
 and it's full of books because he has two hobbies,

302
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,660
 reading and beach golf.

303
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,260
 - Yeah, beach golf.

304
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,500
 - Yeah, it's just one big bunker, I guess.

305
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,980
 (laughing)

306
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,500
 But he lives there, and he basically,

307
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,420
 if you go to Rio and you go to his house,

308
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,940
 he has a little scepter, and he has photos taken

309
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,500
 with Taurus and stuff like that.

310
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,820
 - That's very cool.

311
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,860
 - It has a roof right, 'cause none of my sandcastles

312
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,900
 have ever had roofs.

313
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,740
 - Did they not?

314
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,660
 - Well no, they just be basically a wall.

315
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,180
 Isn't that the standard sand castle?

316
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:28,460
 - Yes, unless you just do the upturned bucket,

317
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,980
 in which case there's all roof.

318
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,420
 (laughing)

319
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,580
 - A lot of sandcastles, like these really ornate ones

320
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,940
 you see on, you know, they do competitions,

321
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,020
 don't they, and stuff like that.

322
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,580
 And the way that they do that is they super compact it.

323
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,540
 So they really, really, really compact the sand,

324
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,660
 and this is an ancient way of building things.

325
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,700
 So actually, the Great Wall of China,

326
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,020
 a lot of that is made like this,

327
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,380
 so it's basically just one big sand castle.

328
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,220
 - Joking.

329
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,100
 - Honestly, that's amazing.

330
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,860
 - Except they use different materials.

331
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,820
 - Well, some of it, for some of the Great Wall of China,

332
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,500
 they just, it's just kind of mountains,

333
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,460
 and that's just literally sand compacted, really hard.

334
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,100
 - Well, happens when the tide comes in.

335
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
 (laughing)

336
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,980
 - It tends not to in the middle of China.

337
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,380
 (laughing)

338
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,500
 - It doesn't quite reach.

339
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,180
 That's where all kids are going wrong.

340
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,700
 It's building them on bloody beaches.

341
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,620
 (laughing)

342
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,940
 - But they've also worked out the exactly perfect way

343
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,460
 now to build a sand castle.

344
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,300
 And when I say they, I mean physicists,

345
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,180
 but it's actually quite surprising.

346
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,100
 So this is a couple of years ago,

347
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,340
 there was some experimenting, there was some studies,

348
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,660
 and it was found out that the strongest sand castle

349
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,020
 will be 99 parts sand to one part water,

350
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,620
 which I think is not very as much water as I was probably doing.

351
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,500
 And the person who did this study is a guy called Dr. Bond,

352
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,420
 who's a physicist, and he said the best way to do it

353
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,980
 is to tamp wet sand into a mold,

354
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,780
 but a mold that's like open at the top and the bottom,

355
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,540
 so like a bucket without a bottom,

356
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,820
 and then thump it at least 70 times,

357
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,860
 before which no one has the time for on a beach.

358
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,340
 (laughing)

359
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,420
 - You know, actually a best place to build a sand castle,

360
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,780
 the best sand for a sand castle is on Titan,

361
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,900
 the largest moon of Saturn.

362
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,220
 - Wow, really?

363
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,340
 - It's the best place in some ways to do it.

364
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,140
 In other ways, I wouldn't recommend it.

365
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,300
 - You get that, I forgot the bloody bucket.

366
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,020
 (laughing)

367
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,260
 Right, turn it around.

368
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,580
 - Well, this is amazing, they have sand dunes on Titan,

369
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,940
 but their sand has got static electricity in it,

370
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,300
 and so it self-adheres.

371
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,140
 - Wow!

372
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,980
 - You know what I mean?

373
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,780
 So you kind of put it together and it's never going to fall apart

374
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,020
 because they're all sticks together with static electricity.

375
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,860
 - That's amazing.

376
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,700
 - That's really cool.

377
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,540
 - That is cool, isn't it?

378
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,700
 It's worth going for that.

379
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,220
 (laughing)

380
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,140
 - You can be fined for stealing sand from Sardinia.

381
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,980
 Even if you take a small drinks bottle full of sand,

382
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,140
 you can be fined a thousand euros,

383
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,140
 and this is a big problem,

384
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,260
 'cause people keep on stealing Sardinia, basically,

385
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,820
 and people are worried about it.

386
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
 In the summer months of 2015,

387
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,740
 they seized five tons in smaller

388
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,580
 and bigger consumers,

389
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,100
 but lots of it was just little bottles,

390
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,980
 which people take as a souvenir.

391
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,820
 - Wow.

392
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,660
 - Yeah, that's good.

393
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,980
 - And that's 'cause we're running out of sand, right?

394
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
 - Yeah.

395
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,900
 - Which is a weird sentence in its own right,

396
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,420
 but we are running out of sand on earth.

397
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,780
 - Have you guys had a great sand castle dispute of 1900?

398
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,980
 - No, no.

399
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,580
 - So this was like the original First World War,

400
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,860
 except it happened in Rill in North Wales,

401
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,420
 and it was quite a small deal.

402
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,260
 But...

403
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,300
 (laughing)

404
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,540
 It was basically Bovril,

405
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,900
 which was a relatively new company at that point,

406
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,780
 sponsored a sand castle building contest,

407
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,820
 and it was the idea was that you had to build a sand castle

408
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,660
 that was extremely impressive,

409
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,340
 and you had to have Bovril's logo somewhere on it.

410
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,780
 And so some people picked up on the idea,

411
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,220
 and in the same place in North Wales,

412
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,580
 this alcohol merchant copied it, copied the whole idea,

413
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,740
 and had a lot of kids come to the beach,

414
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,620
 and compete over who could build the best sand castle,

415
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,060
 and include the name of his whiskey on the sand castle.

416
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,420
 So he was encouraging lots of kids

417
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,540
 to advertise his whiskey, basically.

418
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
 And so then this spiraled out of control,

419
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,740
 'cause temperance movements got really upset

420
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,780
 at the fact that they were using kids as a vehicle

421
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,740
 to advertise extremely strong liquor.

422
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,060
 And so these temperance movements

423
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,220
 ran a rival contest for who could build a sand castle

424
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,860
 that denounced drink and alcohol

425
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,380
 in the strongest possible terms.

426
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,620
 (laughing)

427
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,340
 Poor kids, so torn.

428
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,180
 - That's amazing.

429
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,020
 - Wow.

430
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,900
 That's awesome.

431
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,780
 I found a thing which really surprised me.

432
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,940
 This was from 1990.

433
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,260
 It was a scientific report that was looking into,

434
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,180
 there's always the thing of, you know,

435
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,180
 vending machines kill more people than sharks do per year.

436
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,180
 So does sand castles more than sharks per year?

437
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,500
 Sand castles, sand tunnels.

438
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,140
 So anything where you're trying to construct by a sand,

439
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,260
 and the collapse is very dangerous.

440
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,180
 So in 1990 they found 16 people died of it as opposed to 12,

441
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,260
 which is how many would killed by sharks in that year.

442
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,100
 - Wow.

443
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,940
 - Yeah.

444
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
 - What a way to go, running ashore, thinking,

445
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,740
 "Oh, finally, have avoided that shark."

446
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,900
 (laughing)

447
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,540
 Well, pretty good day for me.

448
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,460
 (laughing)

449
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,300
 - Bang.

450
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,140
 - Sand castle.

451
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,980
 - Yep.

452
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,460
 (laughing)

453
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,020
 - Well, lifeguards have to watch out for people

454
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,980
 digging two deep holes on beaches.

455
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,660
 So this is, they have fewer complaints

456
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,380
 about going out and having to save people from sharks

457
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,100
 and they do about going and having to tell kids

458
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,060
 or adults to stop building such a deep hole.

459
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,260
 And I was reading something by a life I called Annie Howe

460
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,860
 who was saying, she didn't like it for nine years

461
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,740
 and she often has to warn beachgoers that in her words,

462
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,180
 their excavations are getting out of control.

463
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,180
 And she says that no hole should be more than

464
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,980
 need deep for the smallest person in the group.

465
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,820
 So I think we have all surely contribute there.

466
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,180
 - Yeah, 'cause that's part of the fun, isn't it,

467
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,660
 trying to dig to Australia?

468
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,500
 - It should.

469
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,340
 - Yeah.

470
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,420
 - Sorry, it's not so that people don't dig to Australia.

471
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,260
 (laughing)

472
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,100
 I presume.

473
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
 - No.

474
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,460
 - It's an anti-immigration thing

475
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,620
 'cause I think the Australians will come back up.

476
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,100
 - I got it.

477
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,060
 - Sorry, I should add, through what I said earlier

478
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,020
 about sandcastles and tunnels being the fatality thing.

479
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,780
 It's actually majorotively people digging holes.

480
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,620
 So when people are walking at night on a beach,

481
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,980
 not knowing there's a massive hole, that's how they.

482
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,820
 - No way.

483
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
 - Yeah.

484
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,260
 - No, the main danger is sand falling in on you.

485
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,180
 You're not red danger.

486
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,220
 People walking at night falling into the holes by the way.

487
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,300
 - Well, I think that's right.

488
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,260
 I think it's the holes collapse.

489
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,780
 It's a lot of people falling into the hole.

490
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,620
 It's very tough.

491
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,860
 - It's got the muscle power to dig a hole so big

492
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,660
 that it falls in on you.

493
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
 - It's not, I know it's about the foot.

494
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,180
 I almost killed my grandmother that way.

495
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,020
 She, well.

496
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,220
 (laughing)

497
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,260
 - I better love next time.

498
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,420
 (laughing)

499
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,420
 - I didn't intend to.

500
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,820
 I was at her house and I dug a hole in the garden

501
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,740
 and I didn't tell her and she went out at night

502
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
 and she ended up in hospital.

503
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,940
 And but she's okay.

504
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,980
 - But didn't you grow up in Australia?

505
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,820
 - Yeah.

506
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,900
 - When you're trying to dig to the UK.

507
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,340
 (laughing)

508
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,340
 - Yeah.

509
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,580
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

510
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,060
 and that is my fact, my fact this week.

511
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,900
 Oh boy.

512
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
 (laughing)

513
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,900
 My fact this week is Queen Elizabeth the first was a man.

514
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:04,020
 According to the Dracula author, Bram Stoker.

515
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,860
 Yeah.

516
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,700
 Isn't that amazing?

517
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,260
 This is the fact that the year before.

518
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,220
 - I mean, he was writing fiction quite a lot.

519
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,380
 - And he was writing fiction but the year before he died

520
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,860
 he wrote a nonfiction book.

521
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,660
 And it was called Famous in Posters

522
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,940
 and the idea was to expose con artists

523
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,500
 and it was to expose hoaxes and so on.

524
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,780
 However, there's one chapter in it in which he claims

525
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,020
 and he did proper investigation into it

526
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,420
 that Queen Elizabeth the first was a man

527
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,540
 and he actually published that and obviously it's not true

528
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,700
 but it's so crazy though.

529
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,060
 - Well, let's not reject it and look at it.

530
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,700
 - There's a lot of compelling evidence.

531
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,100
 - Let's hear the evidence.

532
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,820
 - Well, he said things like, for example, she never married.

533
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,580
 (audience laughing)

534
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,300
 She used to wear a lot of wigs.

535
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,540
 He said someone's trying to hide a bald spot.

536
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,580
 - She used to wear one wig at a time.

537
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,180
 (laughing)

538
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,100
 - But she didn't wear a snack of wigs.

539
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,660
 - Yeah, no, but she was constantly famously

540
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,940
 according to him was wearing wigs.

541
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,340
 The story is that basically when the original,

542
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:08,540
 this is according to, I need to specify this is not my theory.

543
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,060
 This is a very famous author, Bram Sker.

544
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,100
 He said that when Queen Elizabeth was a 10 years old,

545
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,420
 she was visiting Bizly, which is in Gloucestershire

546
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,420
 and while she was there, the plague was very rife

547
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,740
 and she got ill and she passed away.

548
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,500
 The place Bizly thought that they were gonna suffer

549
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,740
 the wrath of Henry and so they quickly had to replace her.

550
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,660
 However, they didn't find a girl who is anyone still listening?

551
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,660
 (audience laughing)

552
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,740
 - So they couldn't find a girl that would match

553
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,020
 her complexion to fool Henry and so they did find this one boy

554
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,700
 and they said, you're gonna have to now be Elizabeth

555
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,220
 and he said, okay, and then it worked and it worked.

556
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,420
 - Yeah, it worked and we're gonna have to stick with this

557
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,980
 and so, okay, it's time for fact number one.

558
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,260
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

559
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,740
 - This is basically the class hamster has died

560
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,740
 theory of egret history.

561
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,860
 - Because actually if you, 'cause I read that book today

562
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,580
 and he says that because the people of Bizly still believe it

563
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,060
 that it must be true, 'cause he's like,

564
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,060
 if it wasn't true, there's no way they'd still believe that shit.

565
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,340
 - Yeah, and for a long time, there used to be a thing

566
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,340
 where they would dress boys as Queen Elizabeth

567
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,860
 and so the idea was that there was a local vicar

568
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,260
 who started this rumor, what's interesting

569
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,940
 is that Bram Stoker effectively was a conspiracy theorist

570
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,540
 which is very bizarre for the time as well

571
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,260
 and he was, no one believed him obviously at the time

572
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,380
 but it is a theory. - Well they did,

573
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,940
 because as in it was a theory that had existed

574
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,860
 for since Queen Elizabeth and he popularized it

575
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,500
 so there were people who genuinely thought that

576
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,460
 and there were people who put to get lots of evidence

577
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,780
 about it like the fact that her writing style changed

578
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,060
 apparently as soon as she left Bizly so--

579
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,900
 - When she was seven years old.

580
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,020
 - Yeah, so everyone's development was so--

581
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,540
 - Oh, she started writing in cursive, she must be a man.

582
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,260
 - James, 10 years old.

583
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,420
 - Oh, sorry, yeah.

584
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,700
 - No, it did change and yeah, that was pretty much it

585
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,500
 in the way from a young girl's diary to just football scores

586
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,340
 every week.

587
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,940
 (audience laughing)

588
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,620
 - It's the way to super my pram.

589
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:16,260
 (audience laughing)

590
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,580
 - So the Times reviewed the book as Tommy Rocks.

591
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,420
 - Yep.

592
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,820
 - The original manuscript is signed BS

593
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,340
 but it was by Bram Stoker.

594
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,780
 (audience laughing)

595
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,220
 - But that's just as good evidence as the stuff you're giving

596
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,460
 that is just not true, right?

597
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,620
 - Hang on, again, it's not my evidence.

598
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,460
 (audience laughing)

599
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,020
 - But it is true that Bram Stoker was a conspiracy theorist

600
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,580
 and that is the curious thing.

601
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,660
 And I had a look at the book and it's got loads

602
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,220
 of other hoaxes that have happened in history.

603
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,500
 Some he's just reporting.

604
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,860
 So there's one called the Cat Hoax of 1815,

605
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,940
 which is where Napoleon was about to be sent to St Helena,

606
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,660
 it's a very distant island and it was supposedly

607
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,220
 over on with rats and people put up signs

608
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,860
 around the city of Chester saying that the government

609
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,420
 desperately needed lots of cats to wipe out all the rats

610
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,700
 on St Helena to make it fit for Napoleon.

611
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,020
 And if you bring your cat to this address tomorrow,

612
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,020
 the government will give you quite a lot of money for it.

613
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,380
 And it was mayhem, it was absolute collusion.

614
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,820
 People brought hundreds and hundreds of cats.

615
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,660
 - So was it a hoax that it was just some random person

616
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,580
 who you didn't like and they went there, is that it?

617
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,180
 - It was an empty house, so I don't know exactly why it was.

618
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,860
 It was, although that would be a hell of a prank.

619
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,620
 - I know, it's like ordering a pizza to someone but with cats.

620
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,460
 - Yeah.

621
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,580
 (audience laughing)

622
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,540
 - But Bram Stoker did write some questionable stuff, didn't he?

623
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,620
 A lot of it's been discovered recently,

624
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,620
 so a book of his notes was discovered in the '90s

625
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,460
 and basically he loves puns and he loves really rude jokes,

626
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
 so there's a really good joke.

627
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,260
 I'm just gonna see if it works.

628
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,140
 For this joke to work, you do actually have to know

629
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,260
 what a canticle is.

630
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,540
 (audience laughing)

631
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,860
 Does everyone know what a canticle is?

632
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,980
 - I don't know what one is.

633
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,820
 - Cool.

634
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,660
 - Yes.

635
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,780
 - We've got some church goes in the audience.

636
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,900
 It's like a religious song, it's like a hymn, isn't it?

637
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,420
 So this is a really funny joke.

638
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,940
 Why is death like a psalm?

639
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,340
 - I don't know, why is death like a psalm?

640
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,900
 - Is it supposed to do a canticle?

641
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,420
 (audience laughing)

642
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,900
 James, you've absolutely nailed it.

643
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,980
 Because I've been cut out the bit where you said,

644
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
 you need to know what canticle is.

645
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,780
 (audience laughing)

646
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,980
 - You look like an absolute genius.

647
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,420
 No, it's quite clever because kicking the bucket

648
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,740
 resembles a can tickle.

649
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,900
 - Yeah.

650
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,740
 - Well.

651
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,980
 - That's great.

652
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,980
 - Yeah, it just shows that comedy changes, I suppose.

653
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,420
 (audience laughing)

654
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,860
 So Dracula, just briefly on Dracula,

655
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,940
 did you know the first adaptation of Dracula

656
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,780
 for the stage happened before the novel came out?

657
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,620
 - Really?

658
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,460
 - No way.

659
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,300
 - Yeah.

660
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,660
 - So he worked for many years as the manager

661
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,980
 to the actor Henry Irving, who was incredibly famous

662
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,660
 in Victorian times, Cumberbatch levels of famous,

663
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,220
 and he ran his theatre, the Lyceum, which is in London.

664
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,460
 It's in the West End.

665
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,940
 And Stoker had been writing this novel for a very long time,

666
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,820
 and it debuted at the Lyceum Theatre, where he worked.

667
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,420
 And Stoker had been working on it for seven years.

668
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,780
 It was only performed once, and after the performance,

669
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,700
 he asked his boss Henry Irving, the incredibly famous actor,

670
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,340
 what he thought, the only word Irving said

671
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,380
 in reply was dreadful.

672
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,380
 (audience laughing)

673
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,580
 I know, but I think it may have been, you know,

674
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,140
 it was full of dread, because it's a very spooky story.

675
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,980
 (audience laughing)

676
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,980
 So, and a lot of people say to me after gigs,

677
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,420
 "Andy, that was dreadful."

678
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,260
 (audience laughing)

679
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,100
 I think that's why.

680
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,180
 (audience laughing)

681
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,020
 - That'll be it.

682
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,580
 - And so when they say it's awful,

683
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,620
 it's 'cause they're full of awe.

684
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
 - Exactly.

685
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,780
 - Yeah, and when they say, "Shit."

686
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,140
 (audience laughing)

687
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,140
 - Can't win them all.

688
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,740
 (audience laughing)

689
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,220
 - We should say that he was not famous in his own time.

690
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,660
 So I went back through the British Newspaper archive,

691
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,340
 looking for his obituary.

692
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,580
 And when he died, all the obits said

693
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,180
 he was the manager of Henry Irving.

694
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,860
 So as Andy says, Henry Irving was the Cumberbatch.

695
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,460
 And literally, it was just an adendum

696
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,460
 at the end of the obituary.

697
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,060
 And he wrote a number of novels,

698
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,260
 but Henry Irving, what a guy.

699
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,700
 And Henry Irving was quite an exciting guy,

700
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,740
 and a really nice person, as far as I could tell.

701
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,700
 And he had this lovely coincidence

702
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,980
 where he was an actor.

703
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,780
 And his last work he performed on stage

704
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,020
 was the day that he died.

705
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,220
 This was in 1905, and his last words on stage were

706
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,700
 "Into Thy Hands O Lord."

707
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,620
 And then he had a stroke that night, and he died.

708
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,260
 And then all the newspapers reported it

709
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,980
 as "Pathetic End to a Great Career,"

710
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,700
 which "Pathetic" meant a different thing a hundred years ago,

711
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,740
 but now it just looks incredibly harsh.

712
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,460
 - No, no, a lot of people say to me,

713
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,860
 Andy, that was pathetic.

714
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,100
 (audience laughing)

715
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,700
 - Did you know, just on Boy's Dressed As Girls

716
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,740
 and Girls Dressed As Boys, in the Elizabethan Theatre,

717
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,420
 all the roles of girls were played by boys,

718
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
 but I didn't know this.

719
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,700
 You could be officially legally kidnapped

720
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,660
 if you were a child and put in a play.

721
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,500
 - Really?

722
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,340
 - Yes.

723
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,180
 - What?

724
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,500
 - This was not illegal.

725
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,340
 So theaters, if they had a license,

726
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,820
 could abduct children and put them in place.

727
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,340
 - Wow, this is real.

728
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,620
 - So you'd get back to your meat hook,

729
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,180
 and you'd be like, "Where's my plate?"

730
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,540
 (audience laughing)

731
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,260
 Queen Elizabeth granted permission to theaters, like...

732
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
 - 30.

733
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,100
 (audience laughing)

734
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,500
 - Yeah, it was originally so they could get choristers

735
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,740
 for the Royal Chapel, but the theaters all did it too,

736
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,780
 and now I'm really minded.

737
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,460
 There are legal cases surviving of people saying,

738
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,100
 "I quite like my son back."

739
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,780
 (audience laughing)

740
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,340
 - I can't, was there just not enough interest

741
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,300
 in their profession?

742
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,140
 - No.

743
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,980
 - Right.

744
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,820
 - Okay.

745
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,220
 Well, I think we've got a shortage of teachers

746
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,940
 at the moment, haven't we, in this country?

747
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,340
 There's something to think about.

748
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,140
 - We're gonna have to move on to the final fact soon.

749
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,580
 Anything before we do?

750
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,980
 - Can I give you another brown stoker joke?

751
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,820
 Oh God.

752
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
 (audience laughing)

753
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:06,620
 - Do you wanna save it to close the show, Roy?

754
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,540
 We might need a big one at the end.

755
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,820
 - I felt like these guys appetites, they couldn't wait.

756
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,220
 - Okay, let's do it.

757
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,940
 Now, do you all know what a chasable is?

758
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,780
 Good.

759
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,860
 - You do actually need to know what a prince consort is,

760
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,140
 but I see he has a...

761
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,820
 (audience laughing)

762
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,140
 Come on, Brighton.

763
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,940
 So, the question is, why is the letter P

764
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:29,220
 like a prince consort?

765
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,060
 Anyone?

766
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,900
 No.

767
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,900
 Okay, I'll give you the answer.

768
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,300
 (audience laughing)

769
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:38,300
 Because it makes a queen pregnant, a queen pregnant.

770
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,100
 - Oh yeah.

771
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,860
 - You also have to know what a queen pregnant is.

772
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,140
 (audience laughing)

773
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,100
 - I actually got quite a good response.

774
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,420
 - It's all right, isn't it?

775
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,660
 - That's probably the first time anyone said that joke

776
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,900
 on a stage since Bram Stoker.

777
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,740
 - Yeah.

778
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,580
 - Yeah.

779
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,420
 - Yeah.

780
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,260
 - Should we move on to our final facts on the night?

781
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,100
 - Yeah.

782
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,820
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

783
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

784
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,020
 - My fact is that when a computer tried to come up

785
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,420
 with romantic messages for love heart suites

786
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,700
 based on existing ones, it came up with bear wig,

787
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,700
 meat mate, bong love, and you are bag.

788
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,780
 (audience laughing)

789
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,580
 - In Sweden, it was you, our park, wasn't it?

790
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,780
 (audience laughing)

791
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,620
 - They're great, aren't they?

792
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,460
 - Well, no.

793
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,300
 - Yeah.

794
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,660
 - If they were great, it wouldn't be a good fact.

795
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,500
 (audience laughing)

796
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,500
 - So there is a researcher, I think she's American,

797
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,980
 she's called Janelle Shane,

798
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,460
 and she specializes in building neural networks.

799
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,180
 So this is where you feed a machine load of information,

800
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,380
 and you try and encourage it to come up

801
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,460
 with more things that I like it,

802
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,100
 with varying degrees of creativity.

803
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,700
 So you can dial it up or dial it down

804
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,020
 to get them more accurate or more imaginative.

805
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,300
 And she did this with love hearts,

806
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,420
 she fed in a load of love hearts,

807
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,100
 and some of them were really good.

808
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,780
 So there was cute kiss, and my bear, which is quite sweet.

809
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,620
 - Yeah, that's good.

810
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,980
 - Some of them were okay, am good.

811
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,220
 (audience laughing)

812
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,380
 You are a babe.

813
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,020
 (audience laughing)

814
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,460
 They're all right, but then there were others

815
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,460
 which included, pin a face, sweat poo,

816
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,060
 (audience laughing)

817
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,500
 and my favourite one, love 2,000 hogs, yeah.

818
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,020
 (audience laughing)

819
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,140
 - It's hard to imagine them fitting that on the suite,

820
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,340
 isn't it? - Yeah.

821
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,340
 - I also saw Stank Love, my hag, hole.

822
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,500
 (audience laughing)

823
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,460
 And you hack.

824
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,460
 - You hack.

825
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,940
 - You hack.

826
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,740
 - That's one fit to give to Bram Stoker after a set.

827
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,460
 (audience laughing)

828
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,420
 - And this for overseas listeners,

829
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,580
 'cause I didn't know they were called love hearts.

830
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,700
 I've called them sweet hearts,

831
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,380
 which I think an America is what they're called.

832
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,220
 So it's the same thing.

833
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,060
 - Sometimes conversation hearts as well.

834
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,980
 - Yes, yeah, so it's a little sugary heart

835
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,060
 with a message on it for, yeah.

836
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,860
 - And apparently I think in the '80s in Britain at least,

837
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,820
 they wanted to get drop dead gorgeous on the suite,

838
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,740
 but it was too long, and so they instead went with drop dead.

839
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,540
 (audience laughing)

840
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,380
 'Cause what?

841
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,220
 - I don't remember.

842
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,620
 - I remember growing up and seeing drop dead on that.

843
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,220
 And always, I thought it was just like,

844
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,060
 you know, Russian roulette of, you know, you're gonna go--

845
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,060
 (audience laughing)

846
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,740
 You're just gonna get one bad one.

847
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,700
 And you never know, like you give someone a suite,

848
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
 and it might be a nice one,

849
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,100
 or it might be not a nice one.

850
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,460
 - It might be, you are bag.

851
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,100
 (audience laughing)

852
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,540
 So obviously they have to change it as the years go around.

853
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,100
 So at the 1950s, they phased out, hey, daddy, oh.

854
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,220
 - I know it's ready for a comeback, isn't it?

855
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,380
 - I think so.

856
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:47,860
 - Right, Wikipedia claims that faxed me is still on the list,

857
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,980
 which I cannot believe faxed me.

858
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,060
 - There is one that's grow up,

859
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,860
 and that was actually the cause of a complaint

860
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,060
 that the Love Arts Company received from a man

861
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,140
 who was trying to placate his wife after a row,

862
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,420
 and he gave her a tubular of hearts,

863
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,900
 and the first message that she saw was grow up.

864
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,140
 (audience laughing)

865
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,020
 And she left him.

866
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,500
 - No.

867
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,460
 - The article said, grow up is still in production,

868
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,420
 so they obviously didn't think that was a good enough reason

869
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,500
 to discontinue.

870
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,220
 - Wow, grow up, that is one of those not good ones though,

871
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,060
 isn't it?

872
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,900
 - Yeah, I can't think of a good way that grow up could be used.

873
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,220
 - With me?

874
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,780
 - Grow up with me, grow old with me.

875
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,220
 - It's more grow old with me.

876
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,780
 (audience laughing)

877
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,740
 - Some more recent ones from 2014 on the Love Arts,

878
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,740
 Skype for Me is now one, Yolo is one, Toat Hiller.

879
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:42,660
 (audience laughing)

880
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,860
 And this is a good one for me, Ori Pet.

881
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,700
 - Oh, that's great, that's a good one, isn't it?

882
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,180
 - Oh, you can fax me.

883
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,660
 (audience laughing)

884
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,500
 So the very original Love Arts,

885
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,580
 they were called Conversation Lozenges,

886
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
 that was the original name.

887
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,220
 - Yeah, I know, it's so good.

888
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,620
 And they date from the 1820s,

889
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,260
 these are seriously old things,

890
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,980
 and they originally had the message on the wrapper,

891
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,220
 and then eventually the message migrated onto the suite.

892
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,380
 But the messages said things like,

893
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,300
 can you polka, do you flirt,

894
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,180
 or the highly flirtatious?

895
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,620
 No, I won't ask Mamma.

896
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,180
 (audience laughing)

897
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,860
 But then the temperance movement got hold of the Love Heart,

898
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,180
 and they started putting on messages like,

899
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,220
 misery, sickness, and poverty are the effects of drunkenness.

900
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,820
 (audience laughing)

901
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,340
 They ruined everything.

902
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,740
 (audience laughing)

903
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,940
 There was a real fashion in the Victorian era

904
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,980
 for a suite that had a message on them,

905
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,100
 and the LRB pointed out that the rage for suites

906
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,740
 with a message was initially delayed

907
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,140
 by the illiteracy prevailing in the market,

908
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,340
 but successive education acts did for readable suites,

909
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,260
 what they also did for penny dreadfuls and newspapers.

910
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,660
 So they became more popular,

911
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,260
 but sticks of rock with a message inside,

912
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,220
 which we are familiar with today, right?

913
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,420
 Were popular in the 1800s,

914
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,220
 and the first mention of sticks of rock with a message

915
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,980
 came in the 1860s,

916
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,620
 where it was mentioned in someone's diary,

917
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,380
 and messages in size sticks of rock included,

918
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,020
 do you love me?

919
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,740
 Do you love sprouts?

920
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,140
 (audience laughing)

921
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,220
 Sir Robert Peel, who was a recently deceased prime minister.

922
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,500
 (audience laughing)

923
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,900
 I'm just sucking on a stick of rock

924
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,860
 and seeing Theresa May's name being spelled out.

925
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,020
 And so the American ones are not made by swizzles,

926
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:32,580
 they're made by NECO, an ECCO,

927
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,980
 which is a new England candy company.

928
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,420
 They also make candy buttons and havel and mince

929
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,620
 and a few other things,

930
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,060
 but there are a few things that they don't make anymore,

931
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,140
 including whore-hound ovals,

932
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,580
 jujube monoplanes,

933
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,060
 wang-bees,

934
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,460
 and climax mint patties.

935
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,300
 Whoa.

936
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,740
 They sound great, don't they?

937
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,940
 I mean, I'd love to, at the end of a meal,

938
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,060
 would you like a climax mint patty?

939
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,900
 (audience laughing)

940
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,580
 They sound like sort of x-rated Harry Potter sweet shop

941
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,740
 when you go behind the door, that's what it is.

942
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,900
 Yeah, wang-bees.

943
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:14,900
 Well, just on the topic of AI sort of generating this new stuff

944
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,020
 and a bizarrely Harry Potter, you mentioning that,

945
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,860
 I found an amazing AI generated Harry Potter book

946
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,220
 the other day.

947
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,540
 It's made by this online company called Botnik Studios.

948
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,980
 They're online artists to do, they're really cool,

949
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,060
 really fun stuff.

950
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,660
 And what they did is they fed into this machine

951
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,660
 all seven books of Harry Potter and they understood the language

952
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,020
 and so on and kind of got their heads around it.

953
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,700
 And it pumped out an original Harry Potter book.

954
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,100
 And yeah, it's an amazing book.

955
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,940
 I'll read a couple of--

956
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,780
 Do you know what it's called?

957
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,620
 Yeah, I thought I had the title here,

958
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,740
 I'm missing it at the moment.

959
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,380
 I'll see if I can find it before the end of the show,

960
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,620
 but I'll give you a couple of extracts from it.

961
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,700
 This is from chapter 13, The Handsome One, it's called.

962
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,500
 "Lethory Sheets of Rain" lashed at Harry's ghost

963
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,220
 as he walked across the grounds towards the castle.

964
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,700
 Ron was standing there and doing a kind of frenzied tap dance.

965
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,500
 He saw Harry and immediately began to eat Hermione's family.

966
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,500
 And then--

967
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,540
 Oh, that's a bit from the order of the Phoenix, I think.

968
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,820
 This is the very next page.

969
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:22,740
 Harry could tell that Voldemort was standing right behind him.

970
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,540
 He felt a great overreaction.

971
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,820
 [LAUGHTER]

972
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,380
 Harry tore--

973
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,820
 Harry tore his eyes from his head and threw them into the forest.

974
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,420
 In fact, that is an overreaction.

975
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,020
 Voldemort raised his eyebrows at Harry,

976
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,980
 who could not see anything at the moment.

977
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,140
 [LAUGHTER]

978
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,460
 Ron threw his wand at Voldemort and everyone applauded.

979
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,940
 Ron smiled.

980
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,100
 Ron reached through his wand slowly.

981
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,700
 Not so handsome now thought Harry,

982
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,940
 as he dipped Hermione in hot sauce.

983
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,140
 [LAUGHTER]

984
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,180
 That is amazing.

985
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,500
 That whole range of family is edible in this.

986
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,380
 Yeah, they are not, like this is an amazing bit as well.

987
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,460
 Voldemort, you're a very bad and mean wizard.

988
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,220
 Harry savagely said, Hermione nodded encouragingly.

989
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,780
 The tall death eater was wearing a shirt that said,

990
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,820
 Hermione has forgotten how to dance.

991
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:19,100
 [LAUGHTER]

992
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,940
 So Hermione dipped his face in mud.

993
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,180
 [LAUGHTER]

994
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,380
 I mean, it reads awesomely.

995
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
 [LAUGHTER]

996
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,980
 I read one, it might not be as good as that.

997
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,660
 I read one about fortune cookies.

998
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,980
 So they used AI to find some fortune cookie things.

999
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,460
 One of them is a short pencil is usually

1000
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,300
 better than a bird in the future.

1001
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,220
 [LAUGHTER]

1002
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:46,180
 Do not have a peaceful place where you will feel better.

1003
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,820
 [LAUGHTER]

1004
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,340
 And this one, carve your name on your parents.

1005
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,260
 [LAUGHTER]

1006
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,540
 I mean, we're laughing now, but they're going to kill us.

1007
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,620
 OK, that is it.

1008
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,380
 That is all of our facts.

1009
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,580
 Thank you so much for listening.

1010
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,260
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

 James.

1017
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,260
 It's James Harkin.

1018
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,340
 And Jizinski.

1019
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,340
 You can email podcast@kyway.com.

1020
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,140
 Yep.

 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing.

 Or you can go to our website.

1023
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,060
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com where we have all of our previous episodes.

1024
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,740
 We have links to more of our tour dates, our book.

1025
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,940
 We also have recommendations for great things

1026
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,620
 to read, like a book called Harry Potter and the Portrait

1027
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,900
 of what looked like a large pile of ash.

1028
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,180
 [LAUGHTER]

1029
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,580
 And it also has a link to our exclusive cassette, which

1030
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,500
 is only actually available on tour at the moment.

1031
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,820
 But you can find out where to get it.

1032
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:53,180
 And we're about to give one away to one of the members of this audience.

1033
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,500
 And we've picked out a fact that was sent to us

1034
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,620
 at the top of the show.

1035
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,500
 James, you got it?

1036
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,100
 It's from John Platt.

1037
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,540
 And the fact is, if a human could move their arm

1038
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,340
 one-tenth as fast as a mantis shrimp,

1039
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,180
 they could throw a baseball into orbit.

1040
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,100
 Whoa.

1041
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
 Wow.

1042
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,620
 Yeah.

1043
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,620
 Thank you.

1044
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,620
 [APPLAUSE]

1045
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,060
 So John, if you come and find us, we'll give you your cassette.

1046
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,420
 Yeah, and we'll all be out there, guys, with our cassettes.

1047
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,620
 If you want to come say hi, good night, guys.

1048
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,980
 Thank you so much.

1049
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,820
