00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
 (tapping sound)

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.120
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.340
 (tapping sound)

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.020
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.600
 (upbeat music)

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:21.560
 Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.440
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.360
 this week coming to you from the Brighton Dome!

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.520
 (cheering and applause)

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.500
 My name is Dan Schreiber

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.620
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.580
 Andrew Hunter, Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.900
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.500
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.980
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380
 - My fact this week is that until the 17th century,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.020
 mothers hung their babies up on hooks while they worked.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.340
 (laughing)

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.180
 - It's amazing.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.940
 - You just hung them up like a coat.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 (laughing)

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.900
 - Were they, is it, yeah, is it like,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.980
 everyone who works at the same place has a number

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.220
 above their hook and a-- - Oh, look at the cloakroom.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.900
 - Yeah, yeah. - Like if you go to the restaurant,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.540
 do you just leave your baby in the cloakroom?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 - Yeah, and if you lose your ticket,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.820
 you're absolutely pockets.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.220
 (laughing)

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.060
 - Can you describe it?

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.260
 Well, it is small, it's not got much hair

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.980
 and it's like Winston Churchill.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.780
 (laughing)

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.940
 - This is genuinely true.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.740
 So this baby needs to be swaddled for long periods

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.220
 of history, it was thought that it was good for them

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.980
 to be very tightly swaddled, wrapped up in material.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.980
 So their limbs could grow straight, that was the belief.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.580
 And once they were swaddled, then they would just be

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 latched onto a hook that was maybe in your house,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.100
 if you were doing the house work,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 or sometimes mothers would be working out

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.540
 in the field, doing agricultural work,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.140
 and you could hook them onto a tree,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.780
 like a bit of twig, and that was how they did it.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.620
 - Wow.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.260
 - Is that where the rocker by baby kind of thing comes from?

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.100
 - Ooh.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.140
 - You're not rocking them, really.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.620
 You're swinging them if you're doing anything.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.180
 'Cause he's on a tree top.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 - Right.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.820
 - He's definitely in a vessel lying down comfortably,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.660
 not just like--

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.180
 - Just a small baby from the tree side.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.420
 (laughing)

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.900
 - Yeah, keep holding your tear care to a baby.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.700
 We'll disappear, it doesn't work.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 (laughing)

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.500
 - So this used to happen all over the place.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 In Sweden, women would carry their children

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.780
 in what was called a bog.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.420
 Just put your baby in the bog.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.260
 Baby bog.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.100
 - What was it?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.100
 - It was a bag.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.100
 (laughing)

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.100
 - Sounds like a typo.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.900
 (laughing)

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.460
 - Yeah, it's where we get the word bag from,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.140
 but it was a leather container shaped into a bag.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.980
 - Oh really?

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.820
 - Same principle.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.940
 - There's actually still a thing today

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.900
 in amongst indigenous North Americans,

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.540
 where there's a thing called cradle boards,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.420
 and these have been a thing for hundreds of years,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.620
 and they're sort of flat boards that you strap a baby to,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.700
 and in a very similar way,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.300
 you can then hang them on a tree or lean them against a tree,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.700
 and they were very commonly used,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.020
 and there were a few tribes like the shoe,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.540
 or the Iroquois, or the Cherokee,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.220
 who were all kind of bringing them back

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.500
 in a sort of artisan way.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.700
 They're really beautiful if you look them up,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.260
 and therefore hanging babies up.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.500
 - And actually they think that carrying babies

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.980
 or having like bogs or bags or whatever to put babies in,

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.180
 is probably one of the biggest inventions

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.460
 in the history of mankind.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.300
 - Wow.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.580
 - It's up there with like, you know,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.380
 writing and the wheel and fire and all that kind of stuff.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.220
 - Is it?

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.060
 - That's how I read it.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.660
 - Well, it meant that mothers could carry food

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.340
 as well as carrying the child.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.340
 So once you had a child,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.220
 if you just had to hold it the whole time,

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.860
 basically you weren't able to do anything else,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.340
 but this meant that they could carry food,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.260
 they can go hunter-gathering as well.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.780
 - Wow.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.060
 - So prams used to not really be a thing,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.740
 and if you did have a pram, you'd--

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.740
 - That's actually true of everything that was invented.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.380
 (audience laughing)

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.380
 - iPhones didn't used to be a thing, really.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.660
 - Yeah, that's fair.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.060
 (audience laughing)

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.900
 - And that's it.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.740
 - That's all I got.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.260
 (audience laughing)

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 - But basically in Germany, when it was invented,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.700
 particularly mothers used to pull along prams,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.460
 and obviously you can't see if the babies fallen out.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.980
 So the push pram was a genuine innovation.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 But in Germany, until 1888,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.980
 you had to have a license to take a child out in a pram.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.140
 - Wow.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.060
 - And this was so the police knew you had to permission

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.180
 to be out with basically a small vehicle,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.700
 and you had to name the baby.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.940
 You had to say, "I'm gonna be taking Jeff out in the pram."

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.940
 (audience laughing)

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.900
 - Wait, so if you're taking a different baby out in the pram,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.300
 then you'd lose your license or whatever.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.140
 You're arrested.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.980
 - Six months.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:29.820
 - Six months, prison.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.660
 - What?

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.380
 - Prison, no, I don't know, I don't know.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.260
 - And the other thing is around the same time in Britain,

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.180
 any vehicle with four wheels was counted as a road vehicle.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.660
 Okay, so they got the new prams,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.180
 which had like a bassinet, and they had four wheels.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.700
 The previous ones only had three.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.740
 And those four wheelers, you could get arrested

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.260
 for walking down the street with one of those.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.300
 And people did, people got prosecuted.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.100
 If you walked on the pavement with them, instead of the road.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.580
 - So responsible advice, push your baby along

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.420
 and down the middle of the road.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.420
 - Wow.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.580
 - Another pregnancy thing, actually, giving birth thing.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.460
 There is a medical text from the 12th century

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.100
 called the trotulla.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.060
 And one of the instructions in there is if you're giving birth,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.300
 you should induce sneezing to the woman.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.300
 Because apparently when you sneeze,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.020
 it helps contoe contract to your womb and push the child out.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.660
 And they genuinely did this.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.180
 - Wow, I mean, it's an unpleasant process anyway, I've heard.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.180
 But having someone pour pepper into your nostrils,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.380
 I was like, "It would make the whole thing even worse."

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.740
 - Well, they also said that the womb

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.340
 reacted differently to different kinds of smells.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.540
 So the womb would push towards sweet smells

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.380
 and away from unpleasant smells.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.220
 - What?

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.260
 So if you're giving birth near a beclava stand,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.460
 you'll just be drawn magnetically over to it.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.940
 (audience laughing)

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.340
 And I don't know why a beclava stand was the first thing

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.580
 I thought, "Oh, that's a good ass thing, isn't it?"

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.580
 - Metropolis and elite twat, why not say it to the guys?

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.820
 (audience laughing)

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.340
 - But so women didn't used to be allowed to be at birth.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.660
 So there was a long tradition of only women being

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.420
 except for the women involved.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.940
 (audience laughing)

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.100
 There was one woman allowed at every birth.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.100
 So for many centuries, doctors weren't allowed at birth

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.100
 because men weren't allowed to see a woman giving birth

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.900
 because it was thought to be improper.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.940
 So actually the only people that you would be allowed

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.500
 to have when you were giving birth were midwives

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.100
 after a while and astrologers,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.500
 'cause some were more astrologers.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.060
 So you couldn't have a doctor to tell you

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.860
 it was gonna be okay,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.220
 but you could have an astrologer to give you

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.860
 a prediction of whether the baby was gonna survive.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.460
 And then when doctors started taking over in the 19th century,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.860
 it was decided that actually women couldn't handle

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.260
 being in the room with other women giving birth,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.660
 even though I guess they are the ones that do it in the end.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.260
 But the Lancet Medical Journal wrote in 1868

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.460
 that women are too delicate to watch someone else giving birth

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.100
 and only men could brave the revolting scenes of childbirth.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.100
 (audience laughing)

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.940
 - Wow.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.180
 - We just can't hack it.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.580
 'Cause we actually never have to see it.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.780
 - Right. - I think.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.780
 - You're just lay there going,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.340
 can anyone smell baccalaver?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.340
 (audience laughing)

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.540
 - That is such a Sagittarius thing to say.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.060
 (audience laughing)

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.940
 - Do you know what, I was looking up Medieval child rearing.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.780
 - Oh yeah.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.780
 - So what happened in Medieval era was,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.020
 basically once you got to the age of 14,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.460
 you would just be sent away on a French exchange forever.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.620
 You would be sent to be a servant in someone else's house

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.380
 for seven to 10 years.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.620
 Was it always in France?

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.660
 - It wasn't always in France actually.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.620
 It was always not in France.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.700
 It was never in France.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.540
 It was.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.180
 So you were sent on a French exchange trip forever,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.060
 which was not in France and only lasted seven years.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.380
 - Yeah.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.900
 - I can see I'm gonna be accused of sexing up this fact.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.540
 I was trying to think of an analogy.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.700
 Basically you'd do a swap.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.100
 Everyone just sent away their child to someone else's house

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.740
 and then you would get someone else's child

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.380
 being a servant in your house.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.260
 And everyone did this right up to the aristocracy.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.140
 - Because they thought that it was easier

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.620
 to bring up someone else's child, didn't they?

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.620
 - Oh wow. - Yeah.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.740
 - That's cool.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.420
 Have you guys heard, so again, around the sort of medieval period

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.420
 of the groaning cheese?

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.300
 This is really cool.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.900
 It was just a tradition that people would do.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.620
 And the idea was that when you got pregnant,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.860
 you knew you were pregnant.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.620
 You would mature a wheel of cheese

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.380
 for the nine month period that you were pregnant.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.140
 And then once the baby was born,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.300
 you would share out the cheese amongst family and friends

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.460
 and you would all eat the cheese.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.780
 But it would leave the outer rind of the cheese.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.300
 And on christening day, they would pass the baby through.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.620
 - Yeah. - Through the hoop.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.260
 - And that's where we get the tradition

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.500
 of the woman bursting out of the cake, isn't it?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.980
 - Yes. - Yes.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:47.820
 - No.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.860
 - But yeah, that was the groaning cheese.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.980
 - That's amazing. - That's amazing.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.300
 - Yeah.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.940
 - How up is that?

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.420
 Did you, on boggies and ways of pushing children around,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.900
 did you see the survey that was done by Scoda,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.020
 but it was seeing what father's thought

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:06.500
 about pushing boggies around.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.500
 It was quite recent.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.460
 It was, it discovered that 33% of fathers

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.700
 said they were embarrassed by their Pram or push chair.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.740
 So they felt emasculated pushing them around.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.260
 76% of dads said they'd be more likely to push a Pram

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.380
 if they had access to a stylish, high-spec buggy

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.780
 that could go.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.580
 And so there's this one guy called Colin Furze,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.100
 who in 2013, yeah, Colin Furze is broken a load of records.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.740
 So he likes breaking records

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.580
 and he's broken the record for the world's fastest Pram.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.660
 So he found out his wife was pregnant

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.820
 and he thought the way to be supportive was to attach

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.620
 a motorbike engine to a Pram and create something

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.180
 that can go up to 80 kilometers an hour, which it does.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:50.860
 You can't put a baby in it.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.940
 - That's a shot.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.860
 - Because that'd be really dangerous.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.900
 But he says he does put dolls in it

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.580
 just to freak out on lookers.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.340
 (laughing)

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.220
 - Wait, but hang on, is he wearing roller skates?

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.580
 - No, but he has a little skateboard attached to the back

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.860
 that he can stand on.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.060
 So it pulls him along.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.660
 (laughing)

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.660
 - It's really cool.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:12.900
 - That's incredible.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.540
 - It's really cool, but his wife is still having

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.980
 to push the baby along in a normal Pram,

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.260
 some way behind him.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:24.460
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.220
 - Ah, yes, my fact this week is that there's a man in Brazil

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.460
 who's been living in a sand castle for 22 years.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.100
 (laughing)

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.820
 He has to constantly water his house

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.540
 to prevent it from collapsing.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.900
 (laughing)

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.900
 - It's extraordinary.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.740
 - This is so cool.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.460
 - So this is just a guy, he lives in Rio,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.020
 he lives in Brazil, he's known as King Marcio,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:50.300
 and he has this really awesome looking sand castle.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.580
 It's like, just imagine like a really ornate sand castle.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.740
 It's quite small on the inside,

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:56.980
 it's only about three square meters,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.940
 and it's full of books because he has two hobbies,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.660
 reading and beach golf.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.260
 - Yeah, beach golf.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.500
 - Yeah, it's just one big bunker, I guess.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.980
 (laughing)

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.500
 But he lives there, and he basically,

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.420
 if you go to Rio and you go to his house,

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.940
 he has a little scepter, and he has photos taken

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.500
 with Taurus and stuff like that.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.820
 - That's very cool.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.860
 - It has a roof right, 'cause none of my sandcastles

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.900
 have ever had roofs.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.740
 - Did they not?

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.660
 - Well no, they just be basically a wall.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.180
 Isn't that the standard sand castle?

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.460
 - Yes, unless you just do the upturned bucket,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.980
 in which case there's all roof.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.420
 (laughing)

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.580
 - A lot of sandcastles, like these really ornate ones

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.940
 you see on, you know, they do competitions,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.020
 don't they, and stuff like that.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.580
 And the way that they do that is they super compact it.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.540
 So they really, really, really compact the sand,

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.660
 and this is an ancient way of building things.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.700
 So actually, the Great Wall of China,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.020
 a lot of that is made like this,

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.380
 so it's basically just one big sand castle.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.220
 - Joking.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.100
 - Honestly, that's amazing.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.860
 - Except they use different materials.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.820
 - Well, some of it, for some of the Great Wall of China,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.500
 they just, it's just kind of mountains,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.460
 and that's just literally sand compacted, really hard.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.100
 - Well, happens when the tide comes in.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.100
 (laughing)

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.980
 - It tends not to in the middle of China.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.380
 (laughing)

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.500
 - It doesn't quite reach.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.180
 That's where all kids are going wrong.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.700
 It's building them on bloody beaches.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.620
 (laughing)

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.940
 - But they've also worked out the exactly perfect way

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.460
 now to build a sand castle.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.300
 And when I say they, I mean physicists,

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.180
 but it's actually quite surprising.

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.100
 So this is a couple of years ago,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.340
 there was some experimenting, there was some studies,

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.660
 and it was found out that the strongest sand castle

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.020
 will be 99 parts sand to one part water,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.620
 which I think is not very as much water as I was probably doing.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.500
 And the person who did this study is a guy called Dr. Bond,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.420
 who's a physicist, and he said the best way to do it

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.980
 is to tamp wet sand into a mold,

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.780
 but a mold that's like open at the top and the bottom,

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.540
 so like a bucket without a bottom,

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.820
 and then thump it at least 70 times,

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:51.860
 before which no one has the time for on a beach.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.340
 (laughing)

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.420
 - You know, actually a best place to build a sand castle,

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:59.780
 the best sand for a sand castle is on Titan,

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.900
 the largest moon of Saturn.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.220
 - Wow, really?

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.340
 - It's the best place in some ways to do it.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.140
 In other ways, I wouldn't recommend it.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.300
 - You get that, I forgot the bloody bucket.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.020
 (laughing)

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.260
 Right, turn it around.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.580
 - Well, this is amazing, they have sand dunes on Titan,

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.940
 but their sand has got static electricity in it,

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.300
 and so it self-adheres.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:23.140
 - Wow!

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:23.980
 - You know what I mean?

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.780
 So you kind of put it together and it's never going to fall apart

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.020
 because they're all sticks together with static electricity.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:28.860
 - That's amazing.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.700
 - That's really cool.

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.540
 - That is cool, isn't it?

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.700
 It's worth going for that.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.220
 (laughing)

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.140
 - You can be fined for stealing sand from Sardinia.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.980
 Even if you take a small drinks bottle full of sand,

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:42.140
 you can be fined a thousand euros,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.140
 and this is a big problem,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.260
 'cause people keep on stealing Sardinia, basically,

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.820
 and people are worried about it.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.420
 In the summer months of 2015,

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.740
 they seized five tons in smaller

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:52.580
 and bigger consumers,

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.100
 but lots of it was just little bottles,

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.980
 which people take as a souvenir.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:56.820
 - Wow.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.660
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.980
 - And that's 'cause we're running out of sand, right?

00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.980
 - Yeah.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.900
 - Which is a weird sentence in its own right,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.420
 but we are running out of sand on earth.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.780
 - Have you guys had a great sand castle dispute of 1900?

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.980
 - No, no.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.580
 - So this was like the original First World War,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.860
 except it happened in Rill in North Wales,

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.420
 and it was quite a small deal.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.260
 But...

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.300
 (laughing)

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.540
 It was basically Bovril,

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.900
 which was a relatively new company at that point,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.780
 sponsored a sand castle building contest,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.820
 and it was the idea was that you had to build a sand castle

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.660
 that was extremely impressive,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.340
 and you had to have Bovril's logo somewhere on it.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.780
 And so some people picked up on the idea,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.220
 and in the same place in North Wales,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.580
 this alcohol merchant copied it, copied the whole idea,

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.740
 and had a lot of kids come to the beach,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.620
 and compete over who could build the best sand castle,

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.060
 and include the name of his whiskey on the sand castle.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.420
 So he was encouraging lots of kids

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.540
 to advertise his whiskey, basically.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:55.540
 And so then this spiraled out of control,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.740
 'cause temperance movements got really upset

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.780
 at the fact that they were using kids as a vehicle

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.740
 to advertise extremely strong liquor.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:04.060
 And so these temperance movements

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.220
 ran a rival contest for who could build a sand castle

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.860
 that denounced drink and alcohol

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.380
 in the strongest possible terms.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.620
 (laughing)

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.340
 Poor kids, so torn.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.180
 - That's amazing.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.020
 - Wow.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.900
 That's awesome.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.780
 I found a thing which really surprised me.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.940
 This was from 1990.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:25.260
 It was a scientific report that was looking into,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.180
 there's always the thing of, you know,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.180
 vending machines kill more people than sharks do per year.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.180
 So does sand castles more than sharks per year?

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.500
 Sand castles, sand tunnels.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.140
 So anything where you're trying to construct by a sand,

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:40.260
 and the collapse is very dangerous.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:44.180
 So in 1990 they found 16 people died of it as opposed to 12,

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.260
 which is how many would killed by sharks in that year.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.100
 - Wow.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.940
 - Yeah.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.940
 - What a way to go, running ashore, thinking,

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.740
 "Oh, finally, have avoided that shark."

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.900
 (laughing)

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.540
 Well, pretty good day for me.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.460
 (laughing)

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.300
 - Bang.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.140
 - Sand castle.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.980
 - Yep.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.460
 (laughing)

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.020
 - Well, lifeguards have to watch out for people

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.980
 digging two deep holes on beaches.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.660
 So this is, they have fewer complaints

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.380
 about going out and having to save people from sharks

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.100
 and they do about going and having to tell kids

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.060
 or adults to stop building such a deep hole.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:20.260
 And I was reading something by a life I called Annie Howe

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:21.860
 who was saying, she didn't like it for nine years

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.740
 and she often has to warn beachgoers that in her words,

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.180
 their excavations are getting out of control.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.180
 And she says that no hole should be more than

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.980
 need deep for the smallest person in the group.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.820
 So I think we have all surely contribute there.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.180
 - Yeah, 'cause that's part of the fun, isn't it,

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.660
 trying to dig to Australia?

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.500
 - It should.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.340
 - Yeah.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.420
 - Sorry, it's not so that people don't dig to Australia.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.260
 (laughing)

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:45.100
 I presume.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100
 - No.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.460
 - It's an anti-immigration thing

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:49.620
 'cause I think the Australians will come back up.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:51.100
 - I got it.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.060
 - Sorry, I should add, through what I said earlier

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.020
 about sandcastles and tunnels being the fatality thing.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.780
 It's actually majorotively people digging holes.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.620
 So when people are walking at night on a beach,

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:03.980
 not knowing there's a massive hole, that's how they.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.820
 - No way.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.660
 - Yeah.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.260
 - No, the main danger is sand falling in on you.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.180
 You're not red danger.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.220
 People walking at night falling into the holes by the way.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.300
 - Well, I think that's right.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.260
 I think it's the holes collapse.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.780
 It's a lot of people falling into the hole.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:16.620
 It's very tough.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:18.860
 - It's got the muscle power to dig a hole so big

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.660
 that it falls in on you.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.660
 - It's not, I know it's about the foot.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.180
 I almost killed my grandmother that way.

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.020
 She, well.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.220
 (laughing)

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.260
 - I better love next time.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.420
 (laughing)

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.420
 - I didn't intend to.

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.820
 I was at her house and I dug a hole in the garden

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.740
 and I didn't tell her and she went out at night

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.740
 and she ended up in hospital.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.940
 And but she's okay.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.980
 - But didn't you grow up in Australia?

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:39.820
 - Yeah.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:40.900
 - When you're trying to dig to the UK.

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.340
 (laughing)

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.340
 - Yeah.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.580
 Okay, it is time for fact number three

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.060
 and that is my fact, my fact this week.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.900
 Oh boy.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900
 (laughing)

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:57.900
 My fact this week is Queen Elizabeth the first was a man.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:04.020
 According to the Dracula author, Bram Stoker.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:04.860
 Yeah.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.700
 Isn't that amazing?

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.260
 This is the fact that the year before.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.220
 - I mean, he was writing fiction quite a lot.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.380
 - And he was writing fiction but the year before he died

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.860
 he wrote a nonfiction book.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.660
 And it was called Famous in Posters

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.940
 and the idea was to expose con artists

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:21.500
 and it was to expose hoaxes and so on.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.780
 However, there's one chapter in it in which he claims

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.020
 and he did proper investigation into it

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.420
 that Queen Elizabeth the first was a man

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:33.540
 and he actually published that and obviously it's not true

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.700
 but it's so crazy though.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.060
 - Well, let's not reject it and look at it.

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.700
 - There's a lot of compelling evidence.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.100
 - Let's hear the evidence.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.820
 - Well, he said things like, for example, she never married.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.580
 (audience laughing)

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.300
 She used to wear a lot of wigs.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.540
 He said someone's trying to hide a bald spot.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:52.580
 - She used to wear one wig at a time.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.180
 (laughing)

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.100
 - But she didn't wear a snack of wigs.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.660
 - Yeah, no, but she was constantly famously

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.940
 according to him was wearing wigs.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.340
 The story is that basically when the original,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.540
 this is according to, I need to specify this is not my theory.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.060
 This is a very famous author, Bram Sker.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.100
 He said that when Queen Elizabeth was a 10 years old,

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.420
 she was visiting Bizly, which is in Gloucestershire

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.420
 and while she was there, the plague was very rife

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.740
 and she got ill and she passed away.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.500
 The place Bizly thought that they were gonna suffer

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.740
 the wrath of Henry and so they quickly had to replace her.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.660
 However, they didn't find a girl who is anyone still listening?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.660
 (audience laughing)

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.740
 - So they couldn't find a girl that would match

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:42.020
 her complexion to fool Henry and so they did find this one boy

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:44.700
 and they said, you're gonna have to now be Elizabeth

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.220
 and he said, okay, and then it worked and it worked.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:51.420
 - Yeah, it worked and we're gonna have to stick with this

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.980
 and so, okay, it's time for fact number one.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.260
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.740
 - This is basically the class hamster has died

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.740
 theory of egret history.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.860
 - Because actually if you, 'cause I read that book today

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.580
 and he says that because the people of Bizly still believe it

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.060
 that it must be true, 'cause he's like,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.060
 if it wasn't true, there's no way they'd still believe that shit.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.340
 - Yeah, and for a long time, there used to be a thing

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.340
 where they would dress boys as Queen Elizabeth

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.860
 and so the idea was that there was a local vicar

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.260
 who started this rumor, what's interesting

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.940
 is that Bram Stoker effectively was a conspiracy theorist

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.540
 which is very bizarre for the time as well

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.260
 and he was, no one believed him obviously at the time

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.380
 but it is a theory. - Well they did,

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.940
 because as in it was a theory that had existed

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.860
 for since Queen Elizabeth and he popularized it

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.500
 so there were people who genuinely thought that

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.460
 and there were people who put to get lots of evidence

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.780
 about it like the fact that her writing style changed

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:51.060
 apparently as soon as she left Bizly so--

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.900
 - When she was seven years old.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.020
 - Yeah, so everyone's development was so--

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.540
 - Oh, she started writing in cursive, she must be a man.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.260
 - James, 10 years old.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:00.420
 - Oh, sorry, yeah.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.700
 - No, it did change and yeah, that was pretty much it

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.500
 in the way from a young girl's diary to just football scores

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.340
 every week.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.940
 (audience laughing)

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.620
 - It's the way to super my pram.

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.260
 (audience laughing)

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.580
 - So the Times reviewed the book as Tommy Rocks.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.420
 - Yep.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.820
 - The original manuscript is signed BS

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:25.340
 but it was by Bram Stoker.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.780
 (audience laughing)

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.220
 - But that's just as good evidence as the stuff you're giving

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.460
 that is just not true, right?

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.620
 - Hang on, again, it's not my evidence.

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.460
 (audience laughing)

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:37.020
 - But it is true that Bram Stoker was a conspiracy theorist

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.580
 and that is the curious thing.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.660
 And I had a look at the book and it's got loads

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.220
 of other hoaxes that have happened in history.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.500
 Some he's just reporting.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.860
 So there's one called the Cat Hoax of 1815,

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.940
 which is where Napoleon was about to be sent to St Helena,

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.660
 it's a very distant island and it was supposedly

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.220
 over on with rats and people put up signs

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.860
 around the city of Chester saying that the government

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.420
 desperately needed lots of cats to wipe out all the rats

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.700
 on St Helena to make it fit for Napoleon.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.020
 And if you bring your cat to this address tomorrow,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.020
 the government will give you quite a lot of money for it.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.380
 And it was mayhem, it was absolute collusion.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.820
 People brought hundreds and hundreds of cats.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.660
 - So was it a hoax that it was just some random person

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.580
 who you didn't like and they went there, is that it?

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.180
 - It was an empty house, so I don't know exactly why it was.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.860
 It was, although that would be a hell of a prank.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:27.620
 - I know, it's like ordering a pizza to someone but with cats.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.460
 - Yeah.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.580
 (audience laughing)

00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.540
 - But Bram Stoker did write some questionable stuff, didn't he?

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.620
 A lot of it's been discovered recently,

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.620
 so a book of his notes was discovered in the '90s

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.460
 and basically he loves puns and he loves really rude jokes,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.380
 so there's a really good joke.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.260
 I'm just gonna see if it works.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.140
 For this joke to work, you do actually have to know

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.260
 what a canticle is.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.540
 (audience laughing)

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.860
 Does everyone know what a canticle is?

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.980
 - I don't know what one is.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.820
 - Cool.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.660
 - Yes.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.780
 - We've got some church goes in the audience.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.900
 It's like a religious song, it's like a hymn, isn't it?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.420
 So this is a really funny joke.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.940
 Why is death like a psalm?

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.340
 - I don't know, why is death like a psalm?

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:10.900
 - Is it supposed to do a canticle?

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.420
 (audience laughing)

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.900
 James, you've absolutely nailed it.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:18.980
 Because I've been cut out the bit where you said,

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.620
 you need to know what canticle is.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:21.780
 (audience laughing)

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.980
 - You look like an absolute genius.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.420
 No, it's quite clever because kicking the bucket

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.740
 resembles a can tickle.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:30.900
 - Yeah.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.740
 - Well.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.980
 - That's great.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:35.980
 - Yeah, it just shows that comedy changes, I suppose.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.420
 (audience laughing)

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.860
 So Dracula, just briefly on Dracula,

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.940
 did you know the first adaptation of Dracula

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.780
 for the stage happened before the novel came out?

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:45.620
 - Really?

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:46.460
 - No way.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.300
 - Yeah.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.660
 - So he worked for many years as the manager

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.980
 to the actor Henry Irving, who was incredibly famous

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.660
 in Victorian times, Cumberbatch levels of famous,

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.220
 and he ran his theatre, the Lyceum, which is in London.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.460
 It's in the West End.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.940
 And Stoker had been writing this novel for a very long time,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.820
 and it debuted at the Lyceum Theatre, where he worked.

00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:08.420
 And Stoker had been working on it for seven years.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.780
 It was only performed once, and after the performance,

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.700
 he asked his boss Henry Irving, the incredibly famous actor,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.340
 what he thought, the only word Irving said

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.380
 in reply was dreadful.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.380
 (audience laughing)

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.580
 I know, but I think it may have been, you know,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.140
 it was full of dread, because it's a very spooky story.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.980
 (audience laughing)

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:26.980
 So, and a lot of people say to me after gigs,

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.420
 "Andy, that was dreadful."

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.260
 (audience laughing)

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.100
 I think that's why.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.180
 (audience laughing)

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.020
 - That'll be it.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.580
 - And so when they say it's awful,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.620
 it's 'cause they're full of awe.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.620
 - Exactly.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.780
 - Yeah, and when they say, "Shit."

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.140
 (audience laughing)

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.140
 - Can't win them all.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.740
 (audience laughing)

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.220
 - We should say that he was not famous in his own time.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.660
 So I went back through the British Newspaper archive,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.340
 looking for his obituary.

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.580
 And when he died, all the obits said

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.180
 he was the manager of Henry Irving.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.860
 So as Andy says, Henry Irving was the Cumberbatch.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.460
 And literally, it was just an adendum

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:06.460
 at the end of the obituary.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.060
 And he wrote a number of novels,

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.260
 but Henry Irving, what a guy.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.700
 And Henry Irving was quite an exciting guy,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.740
 and a really nice person, as far as I could tell.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.700
 And he had this lovely coincidence

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.980
 where he was an actor.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.780
 And his last work he performed on stage

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.020
 was the day that he died.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.220
 This was in 1905, and his last words on stage were

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.700
 "Into Thy Hands O Lord."

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.620
 And then he had a stroke that night, and he died.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.260
 And then all the newspapers reported it

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:37.980
 as "Pathetic End to a Great Career,"

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.700
 which "Pathetic" meant a different thing a hundred years ago,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:42.740
 but now it just looks incredibly harsh.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.460
 - No, no, a lot of people say to me,

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.860
 Andy, that was pathetic.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.100
 (audience laughing)

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.700
 - Did you know, just on Boy's Dressed As Girls

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.740
 and Girls Dressed As Boys, in the Elizabethan Theatre,

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.420
 all the roles of girls were played by boys,

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420
 but I didn't know this.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.700
 You could be officially legally kidnapped

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.660
 if you were a child and put in a play.

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.500
 - Really?

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.340
 - Yes.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.180
 - What?

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.500
 - This was not illegal.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.340
 So theaters, if they had a license,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.820
 could abduct children and put them in place.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.340
 - Wow, this is real.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.620
 - So you'd get back to your meat hook,

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.180
 and you'd be like, "Where's my plate?"

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.540
 (audience laughing)

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.260
 Queen Elizabeth granted permission to theaters, like...

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.100
 - 30.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.100
 (audience laughing)

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:35.500
 - Yeah, it was originally so they could get choristers

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.740
 for the Royal Chapel, but the theaters all did it too,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.780
 and now I'm really minded.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.460
 There are legal cases surviving of people saying,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.100
 "I quite like my son back."

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.780
 (audience laughing)

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.340
 - I can't, was there just not enough interest

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.300
 in their profession?

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.140
 - No.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:49.980
 - Right.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:50.820
 - Okay.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.220
 Well, I think we've got a shortage of teachers

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.940
 at the moment, haven't we, in this country?

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.340
 There's something to think about.

00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.140
 - We're gonna have to move on to the final fact soon.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.580
 Anything before we do?

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.980
 - Can I give you another brown stoker joke?

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.820
 Oh God.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:03.820
 (audience laughing)

00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:06.620
 - Do you wanna save it to close the show, Roy?

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.540
 We might need a big one at the end.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.820
 - I felt like these guys appetites, they couldn't wait.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.220
 - Okay, let's do it.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.940
 Now, do you all know what a chasable is?

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:14.780
 Good.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.860
 - You do actually need to know what a prince consort is,

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.140
 but I see he has a...

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.820
 (audience laughing)

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.140
 Come on, Brighton.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.940
 So, the question is, why is the letter P

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.220
 like a prince consort?

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.060
 Anyone?

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.900
 No.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.900
 Okay, I'll give you the answer.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.300
 (audience laughing)

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.300
 Because it makes a queen pregnant, a queen pregnant.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.100
 - Oh yeah.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.860
 - You also have to know what a queen pregnant is.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:45.140
 (audience laughing)

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.100
 - I actually got quite a good response.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.420
 - It's all right, isn't it?

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.660
 - That's probably the first time anyone said that joke

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.900
 on a stage since Bram Stoker.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.740
 - Yeah.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.580
 - Yeah.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.420
 - Yeah.

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.260
 - Should we move on to our final facts on the night?

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.100
 - Yeah.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.820
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.820
 and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.020
 - My fact is that when a computer tried to come up

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.420
 with romantic messages for love heart suites

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.700
 based on existing ones, it came up with bear wig,

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:16.700
 meat mate, bong love, and you are bag.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.780
 (audience laughing)

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.580
 - In Sweden, it was you, our park, wasn't it?

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.780
 (audience laughing)

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.620
 - They're great, aren't they?

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.460
 - Well, no.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.300
 - Yeah.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.660
 - If they were great, it wouldn't be a good fact.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.500
 (audience laughing)

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.500
 - So there is a researcher, I think she's American,

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.980
 she's called Janelle Shane,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:38.460
 and she specializes in building neural networks.

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.180
 So this is where you feed a machine load of information,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.380
 and you try and encourage it to come up

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.460
 with more things that I like it,

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.100
 with varying degrees of creativity.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.700
 So you can dial it up or dial it down

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.020
 to get them more accurate or more imaginative.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.300
 And she did this with love hearts,

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.420
 she fed in a load of love hearts,

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.100
 and some of them were really good.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.780
 So there was cute kiss, and my bear, which is quite sweet.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.620
 - Yeah, that's good.

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.980
 - Some of them were okay, am good.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.220
 (audience laughing)

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.380
 You are a babe.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.020
 (audience laughing)

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:10.460
 They're all right, but then there were others

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:15.460
 which included, pin a face, sweat poo,

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.060
 (audience laughing)

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.500
 and my favourite one, love 2,000 hogs, yeah.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.020
 (audience laughing)

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:26.140
 - It's hard to imagine them fitting that on the suite,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.340
 isn't it? - Yeah.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.340
 - I also saw Stank Love, my hag, hole.

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.500
 (audience laughing)

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.460
 And you hack.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460
 - You hack.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.940
 - You hack.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.740
 - That's one fit to give to Bram Stoker after a set.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.460
 (audience laughing)

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.420
 - And this for overseas listeners,

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.580
 'cause I didn't know they were called love hearts.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.700
 I've called them sweet hearts,

00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.380
 which I think an America is what they're called.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.220
 So it's the same thing.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.060
 - Sometimes conversation hearts as well.

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.980
 - Yes, yeah, so it's a little sugary heart

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.060
 with a message on it for, yeah.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.860
 - And apparently I think in the '80s in Britain at least,

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.820
 they wanted to get drop dead gorgeous on the suite,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.740
 but it was too long, and so they instead went with drop dead.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.540
 (audience laughing)

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.380
 'Cause what?

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.220
 - I don't remember.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.620
 - I remember growing up and seeing drop dead on that.

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:16.220
 And always, I thought it was just like,

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.060
 you know, Russian roulette of, you know, you're gonna go--

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.060
 (audience laughing)

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.740
 You're just gonna get one bad one.

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:23.700
 And you never know, like you give someone a suite,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.700
 and it might be a nice one,

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.100
 or it might be not a nice one.

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.460
 - It might be, you are bag.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.100
 (audience laughing)

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.540
 So obviously they have to change it as the years go around.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.100
 So at the 1950s, they phased out, hey, daddy, oh.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.220
 - I know it's ready for a comeback, isn't it?

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.380
 - I think so.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.860
 - Right, Wikipedia claims that faxed me is still on the list,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.980
 which I cannot believe faxed me.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.060
 - There is one that's grow up,

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.860
 and that was actually the cause of a complaint

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.060
 that the Love Arts Company received from a man

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.140
 who was trying to placate his wife after a row,

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.420
 and he gave her a tubular of hearts,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.900
 and the first message that she saw was grow up.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.140
 (audience laughing)

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.020
 And she left him.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.500
 - No.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:11.460
 - The article said, grow up is still in production,

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.420
 so they obviously didn't think that was a good enough reason

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.500
 to discontinue.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:18.220
 - Wow, grow up, that is one of those not good ones though,

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.060
 isn't it?

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.900
 - Yeah, I can't think of a good way that grow up could be used.

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.220
 - With me?

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.780
 - Grow up with me, grow old with me.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.220
 - It's more grow old with me.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.780
 (audience laughing)

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:33.740
 - Some more recent ones from 2014 on the Love Arts,

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:38.740
 Skype for Me is now one, Yolo is one, Toat Hiller.

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.660
 (audience laughing)

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.860
 And this is a good one for me, Ori Pet.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.700
 - Oh, that's great, that's a good one, isn't it?

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.180
 - Oh, you can fax me.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.660
 (audience laughing)

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.500
 So the very original Love Arts,

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.580
 they were called Conversation Lozenges,

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.180
 that was the original name.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.220
 - Yeah, I know, it's so good.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.620
 And they date from the 1820s,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.260
 these are seriously old things,

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.980
 and they originally had the message on the wrapper,

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.220
 and then eventually the message migrated onto the suite.

00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.380
 But the messages said things like,

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:13.300
 can you polka, do you flirt,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.180
 or the highly flirtatious?

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.620
 No, I won't ask Mamma.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.180
 (audience laughing)

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.860
 But then the temperance movement got hold of the Love Heart,

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:27.180
 and they started putting on messages like,

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.220
 misery, sickness, and poverty are the effects of drunkenness.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.820
 (audience laughing)

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.340
 They ruined everything.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:35.740
 (audience laughing)

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.940
 There was a real fashion in the Victorian era

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.980
 for a suite that had a message on them,

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.100
 and the LRB pointed out that the rage for suites

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.740
 with a message was initially delayed

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:47.140
 by the illiteracy prevailing in the market,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.340
 but successive education acts did for readable suites,

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.260
 what they also did for penny dreadfuls and newspapers.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.660
 So they became more popular,

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.260
 but sticks of rock with a message inside,

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.220
 which we are familiar with today, right?

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.420
 Were popular in the 1800s,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.220
 and the first mention of sticks of rock with a message

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.980
 came in the 1860s,

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.620
 where it was mentioned in someone's diary,

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.380
 and messages in size sticks of rock included,

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.020
 do you love me?

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:13.740
 Do you love sprouts?

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.140
 (audience laughing)

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.220
 Sir Robert Peel, who was a recently deceased prime minister.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.500
 (audience laughing)

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.900
 I'm just sucking on a stick of rock

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.860
 and seeing Theresa May's name being spelled out.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.020
 And so the American ones are not made by swizzles,

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.580
 they're made by NECO, an ECCO,

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.980
 which is a new England candy company.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.420
 They also make candy buttons and havel and mince

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.620
 and a few other things,

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.060
 but there are a few things that they don't make anymore,

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.140
 including whore-hound ovals,

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.580
 jujube monoplanes,

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.060
 wang-bees,

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.460
 and climax mint patties.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.300
 Whoa.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:55.740
 They sound great, don't they?

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.940
 I mean, I'd love to, at the end of a meal,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.060
 would you like a climax mint patty?

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.900
 (audience laughing)

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.580
 They sound like sort of x-rated Harry Potter sweet shop

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.740
 when you go behind the door, that's what it is.

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.900
 Yeah, wang-bees.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.900
 Well, just on the topic of AI sort of generating this new stuff

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.020
 and a bizarrely Harry Potter, you mentioning that,

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.860
 I found an amazing AI generated Harry Potter book

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.220
 the other day.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.540
 It's made by this online company called Botnik Studios.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.980
 They're online artists to do, they're really cool,

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.060
 really fun stuff.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.660
 And what they did is they fed into this machine

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.660
 all seven books of Harry Potter and they understood the language

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:37.020
 and so on and kind of got their heads around it.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.700
 And it pumped out an original Harry Potter book.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.100
 And yeah, it's an amazing book.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.940
 I'll read a couple of--

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:44.780
 Do you know what it's called?

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.620
 Yeah, I thought I had the title here,

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.740
 I'm missing it at the moment.

00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:50.380
 I'll see if I can find it before the end of the show,

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.620
 but I'll give you a couple of extracts from it.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.700
 This is from chapter 13, The Handsome One, it's called.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.500
 "Lethory Sheets of Rain" lashed at Harry's ghost

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.220
 as he walked across the grounds towards the castle.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.700
 Ron was standing there and doing a kind of frenzied tap dance.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.500
 He saw Harry and immediately began to eat Hermione's family.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.500
 And then--

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.540
 Oh, that's a bit from the order of the Phoenix, I think.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:19.820
 This is the very next page.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.740
 Harry could tell that Voldemort was standing right behind him.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.540
 He felt a great overreaction.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.380
 Harry tore--

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.820
 Harry tore his eyes from his head and threw them into the forest.

00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:36.420
 In fact, that is an overreaction.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.020
 Voldemort raised his eyebrows at Harry,

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:40.980
 who could not see anything at the moment.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.460
 Ron threw his wand at Voldemort and everyone applauded.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.940
 Ron smiled.

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.100
 Ron reached through his wand slowly.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.700
 Not so handsome now thought Harry,

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:54.940
 as he dipped Hermione in hot sauce.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.180
 That is amazing.

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.500
 That whole range of family is edible in this.

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:06.380
 Yeah, they are not, like this is an amazing bit as well.

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.460
 Voldemort, you're a very bad and mean wizard.

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.220
 Harry savagely said, Hermione nodded encouragingly.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.780
 The tall death eater was wearing a shirt that said,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.820
 Hermione has forgotten how to dance.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.100
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.940
 So Hermione dipped his face in mud.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.380
 I mean, it reads awesomely.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:28.980
 I read one, it might not be as good as that.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.660
 I read one about fortune cookies.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:35.980
 So they used AI to find some fortune cookie things.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.460
 One of them is a short pencil is usually

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.300
 better than a bird in the future.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.180
 Do not have a peaceful place where you will feel better.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.340
 And this one, carve your name on your parents.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.540
 I mean, we're laughing now, but they're going to kill us.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.620
 OK, that is it.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.380
 That is all of our facts.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.580
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.260

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.260
 It's James Harkin.

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.340
 And Jizinski.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.340
 You can email podcast@kyway.com.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.140
 Yep.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.660
 Or you can go to our group account, which is @NoSuchThing.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:22.260
 Or you can go to our website.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.060
 NoSuchThing is a fish.com where we have all of our previous episodes.

00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.740
 We have links to more of our tour dates, our book.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.940
 We also have recommendations for great things

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.620
 to read, like a book called Harry Potter and the Portrait

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:36.900
 of what looked like a large pile of ash.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.180
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:45.580
 And it also has a link to our exclusive cassette, which

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.500
 is only actually available on tour at the moment.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.820
 But you can find out where to get it.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.180
 And we're about to give one away to one of the members of this audience.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.500
 And we've picked out a fact that was sent to us

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.620
 at the top of the show.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.500
 James, you got it?

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.100
 It's from John Platt.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.540
 And the fact is, if a human could move their arm

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.340
 one-tenth as fast as a mantis shrimp,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.180
 they could throw a baseball into orbit.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.100
 Whoa.

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.100
 Wow.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:09.620
 Yeah.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:10.620
 Thank you.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:14.620
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.060
 So John, if you come and find us, we'll give you your cassette.

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.420
 Yeah, and we'll all be out there, guys, with our cassettes.

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.620
 If you want to come say hi, good night, guys.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.980
 Thank you so much.

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.820
 [APPLAUSE]

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:29.180
 [MUSIC PLAYING]
