 Hello everyone and welcome to Meet the Elves which is another one of our

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,240
 favorite features on Clubfish where we meet one of the QI elves who you might

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,160
 not have met before and today we're gonna speak with Leigh-ing.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,060
 Hi. Hi Leigh-ing, how you doing?

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,040
 Hi, yeah I'm good, enjoying the sun.

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,400
 Oh yeah, we're in London in our new offices in Holborn and it's beautifully

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,340
 sunshiny outside. Dan, anything to add on the weather?

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,220
 No, I was just curious how you said Holborn because I've dropped the L from my

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,600
 pronunciation, but I kind of saw you snuck it in to yours.

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,840
 Well I told you not to put the L in Holborn, but you say it with an L.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,040
 Yeah, because I'm not from London you see.

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:05,360
 I'm not from London. I pronounce it Covent Garden so anyway, Leigh-ing.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,920
 Nice to see you and you've brought a question for us I think and we're gonna

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,800
 chat about it and try and answer it and maybe learn a bit more about you along

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,840
 the way. Sure. So what's your question?

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,240
 My question is, how do you pronounce it?

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,480
 Why shouldn't you use the pink toilet in Christchurch Cathedral?

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 Oh, okay. What a great question. It sounds like a euphemism doesn't it?

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,480
 Christchurch, is that an Oxford or a Cambrian?

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 New Zealand? Oh yeah. My first thought was New Zealand, is it?

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,480
 Was it? It's not in New Zealand. You were right the first time, it is the one in Oxford.

23
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,480
 Christchurch is a posh college. Is it?

24
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 Yeah, it is. It's one of the ones where people at the other colleges go, oh Christchurch.

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,480
 Because to me, they're all posh. What is the, you know, on the scale of poshness?

26
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,480
 It used to just be called church didn't it? And they went, oh Christchurch.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,480
 There is a kind of, I'm not gonna say a social dividing line, but basically

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,480
 colleges made of stone tend to look down on those made of brick, you know?

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,480
 Is that right? What about those made of straw?

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,480
 All the little pigs have been eaten in those. It's very tragic.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
 No, as in just if your college is made of stone, it's like it's 700 years old

32
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
 and it can withstand a medieval siege and it's probably there for the Civil War and all this stuff.

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
 Whereas if you just made a brick, it's either like late 19th century or early 20th century.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,480
 So did you not talk to it? Because you went to Oxford. How could you go?

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,480
 I thought we were dancing around the subject there. I thought we'd just lay it down.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 Did you go to a brick or a stone? I went to a brick because I'm a blue-collar guy.

37
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,480
 - Flame, did you go to university? - I did go to university. I went to Durham.

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,480
 Oh, that feels like a stone to me.

39
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,480
 - That's a good question. - It feels like bonds to me. Durham.

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,480
 - It's nice and countryside, isn't it? - What? Durham, isn't it? - It's a city.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 - It's a tiny city to be fair. - But it's quite medieval, isn't it?

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
 It is gorgeous. I didn't go to one of the old posh ones though.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 - You know what I'm talking about. - I do, I do.

44
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,480
 - We tried ourselves on being relatable. - Durham.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
 - It's our college, our college. - Durham is a lot of posh as well.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
 It's like St Andrews as well. St Andrews is incredible. They've got three streets and everyone's got 15 names. It's very posh.

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 What was Exeter like? That's where you went, isn't it, James?

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,480
 - No, I went to Sheffield. - Oh, sorry, Sheffield. My wife went as well, weirdly.

49
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,480
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was it like there? Was that...

50
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,480
 - That was great. - Sorry. - Why does a wolf have a little goatee?

51
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:53,480
 It was alright. I went to Durham only once in my life, as in stayed there, and it was when I walked from Durham to Lindisfarne.

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,480
 - Oh, gorgeous. - I did a pilgrimage.

53
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,480
 Were you briefly in training for a monk to be a monk?

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
 I feel like there was some point in your life where you could have become a monk.

55
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,480
 I want you to carry on with this, because it is a complete falsehood, but I want to know where you're going to go with it.

56
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 No, I just thought that you'd be into it. I was an altar boy.

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 - That's it, and you were educated. - Does he just give off monkish vibes?

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
 It's the tonsure that does it.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
 Yeah, that's why he's got a hat on.

60
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,480
 But it's the... You went to a seminary. You were raised Catholic.

61
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,480
 - I thought you went to a seminary. - I didn't go to a seminary. I actually don't know what that is.

62
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,480
 I think of it as being a bit like a kind of training wheels monastery.

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 I went to a Catholic school, which was run by nuns and priests.

64
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,480
 Right, so there must have been a point, the last possible point at which you could have become a monk.

65
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
 I think it's still open to me.

66
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,480
 You're absolutely right. There's no age limit in monks, is there?

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
 Actually, famously, a lot of them are very old.

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,480
 Yeah, you're right. You're right. Sorry, if you're listening to this and you think you're becoming a monk, don't give up.

69
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
 Never too late.

70
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,480
 Ling, have you ever considered the religious life?

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,480
 Well, interestingly, both my parents are vikers.

72
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
 - Are they? - Yeah, both.

73
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 So my mum and my dad are both reverent.

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
 Andy was shocked a woman was allowed to be a viker in that.

75
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,480
 No, I assume Ling had two dads who were both vikers.

76
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,480
 Can I just say that must be difficult because I'm sure I'm wrong about this,

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,480
 but I would have thought they would have to stay in their own diocese or parish.

78
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,480
 And so it would be difficult because one of them would have to work in one town and the other one would have to work in another town.

79
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 So my dad is a viker, but not in the Church of England and my mum is a viker.

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,480
 It is an Anglican viker, but that's irrelevant now anyway because they've moved to Hong Kong.

81
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
 So my mum is a viker in Hong Kong.

82
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
 Wow, which church?

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,480
 So she used to be at St Andrews on Nathan Road.

84
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
 - That's where I used to go. - Did she?

85
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,480
 - Yeah, my whole childhood. - In Jinxatui, right?

86
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

87
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,480
 - Oh, my God. Wait, where? - In Jinxatui, TST.

88
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

89
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,480
 But I would have gone to that because I used to live near that area.

90
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 - So, wow. - Yeah, by Jordan and TST.

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,480
 That's not well, she's not there anymore, but she used to be there.

92
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
 And then now they've moved to a different church.

93
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 - I mean, that would have been amazing. - That would have been incredible.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
 I'm kind of sad that you backed off that.

95
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,480
 I just sort of thought for accuracy, but yeah, I would have been there.

96
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
 I would have prayed there.

97
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,480
 You famously went to all the churches in Hong Kong, didn't you?

98
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
 You've got to try them all out to see which one fits.

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
 Sadly, it's made of brick, not stone, so...

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
 - Right. - I know.

101
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
 I just remembered the format.

102
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 - You had a question. - Pink toilets.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,480
 So Christ Church is like, it's got a big bell, which is called Old Tom.

104
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,480
 That's one thing I know about Christ Church.

105
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,480
 - Oh, I didn't know that. - And they've got the longest dining hall in Oxford.

106
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
 - Is that where they filmed Harry Potter, their dining hall? - I think it is.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,480
 And I think my college had the second longest dining hall in Oxford.

108
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 - Oh, that must have hurt. - You couldn't add just a bit of wood.

109
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
 - It was built later. - Why didn't they just make it?

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
 I think mine was built later, and they did deliberately make it

111
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,480
 by about six inches, the longest dining hall in Oxford.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,480
 You know, when they're trying to build the tortoise building,

113
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
 they just add an extra spire on the top.

114
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,480
 - They just chuck an extra table in the end. - One brick.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
 - This is a difference between my education and your education, Andy,

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,480
 is that my university had the longest bar in England,

117
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
 and I think it still does have the longest bar in England.

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
 - Wow, it's very nice. - Bar one in Sheffield.

119
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
 - Bar one? - Yeah.

120
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 - They couldn't remember bar two. - Is it an actual toilet, Leigh?

121
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,480
 - No. - Oh, okay.

122
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
 - Wait, let's have the question again then. - So why shouldn't you use

123
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
 the pink toilet in Christ Church Cathedral?

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
 - It's not an actual toilet. - It's not an actual toilet.

125
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
 - Oh, and it's a cathedral. That's the other mad thing.

126
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
 The reason that everyone thinks Christ Church College is so posh

127
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 is it has a cathedral on the premises, as in that's uncommon.

128
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
 Like, colleges might have a chapel, or a little, you know,

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,480
 because they're all religiously, they've got religious origins,

130
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
 all of them, you know, so a chapel normal.

131
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
 A cathedral? - Ah, so--

132
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
 - If your little college, which has about 300 students,

133
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
 you've got a cathedral, it's crazy.

134
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,480
 - Is it a confession booth that's been called the pink toilet?

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
 And-- - Oh, my God.

136
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,480
 - Right, so Dan, I'd like to ask you a question.

137
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
 Why is your confession booth called the pink toilet?

138
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
 - I'm actually not taking questions right now, Andy.

139
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
 - But it does, like, a confessional booth

140
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
 looks a bit like a stall in a toilet.

141
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
 - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.

142
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
 - You've got the guy in there taking a mess of shit.

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
 He's been in there for hours.

144
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
 - 'Cause they have a little seat you sit on,

145
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
 and they have a hole in the wall next to you.

146
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
 - The trouble is-- - And there's a blow coming up

147
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
 inside. - It would be incredibly circular

148
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
 if the confession booth was a toilet, and you use it as a toilet,

149
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
 and you were stuck in the confession booth add-in,

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,480
 so confessing that you just shat in the confession booth.

151
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
 - Yeah, it's got another confession booth if you do that.

152
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
 - Imagine being the priest waiting for the next confession

153
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
 to start, but then you just hear this--

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
 (laughing)

155
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
 Sorry, is there someone-- - No.

156
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
 - Is there-- - No.

157
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
 - There's no toilet paper there, is there?

158
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
 (laughing)

159
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
 - No.

160
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
 - Oh, well, I've definitely sinned.

161
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
 Forgive me, Father.

162
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
 - That's when they open the little hatch

163
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
 and just pass the-- (laughing)

164
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
 - Pass the lever all through.

165
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,480
 - Give it five minutes before you confess your sins

166
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,480
 in there. (laughing)

167
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 - Oh, my God.

168
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
 - Oh, no.

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
 - There's nothing to do with confessional booths.

170
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
 - Nothing to do with confession, apart from anything,

171
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,480
 because Christchurch is an Anglican cathedral.

172
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
 - Okay.

173
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,480
 - And confessions, and correct me if I'm wrong,

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
 I think they're Catholic, is that right?

175
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
 - I don't know if there was ever a tradition of--

176
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
 I think, I mean, they are Catholic, for sure.

177
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
 - Yeah, so I think that's-- - Okay.

178
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
 - All right.

179
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
 Okay, so it's not a toilet.

180
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
 That's what we know.

181
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
 It's a big toilet, but it's not a toilet.

182
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
 - Is there any kind of little clue that you can help us

183
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
 along our way?

184
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,480
 - Sure, it is a depiction of a toilet.

185
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 - Ah, okay.

186
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,480
 - Of course.

187
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
 Well, in that case, if it's a painting,

188
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
 you should never shit on a painting.

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 (laughing)

190
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
 I think, is that the answer?

191
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
 - It's not a painting.

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
 - Oh, not a painting.

193
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
 - It's not a depiction, depiction.

194
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
 Could be a mural, could be a gargoyle.

195
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
 - Stained glass.

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
 - Stained glass.

197
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
 - Stained glass toilet.

198
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
 - There is a stained glass toilet.

199
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
 - No.

200
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
 - In Christchurch Cathedral.

201
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
 - Brilliant.

202
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
 - Is there?

203
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
 - Yes, and it is bright pink.

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
 - Wow.

205
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
 - Okay.

206
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 Who's, is it an, is it a?

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
 - Is it quite modern?

208
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
 - Yeah, it's modern.

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
 - Because you would think like pink glass

210
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
 would be difficult to get.

211
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
 - Yeah, it's actually from the 1850s.

212
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
 - Okay, wow.

213
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,480
 - Yeah, so it was added by Edward Burn-Jones,

214
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
 who became a pre-Raphaelite,

215
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
 but it was in his pre-Raphaelite days

216
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
 (laughing)

217
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
 that he designed this stained glass,

218
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,480
 and he was 24, 25.

219
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
 - Wow.

220
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
 - And they think that he was pretty excited

221
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
 about the advent of flushing toilets,

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 and he added one into a panel in Christchurch Cathedral.

223
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
 - That's so crazy.

224
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 - Wow, so it's a modern,

225
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
 I didn't know when we got flushing toilets,

226
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
 so that's quite exciting.

227
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 - Victorians.

228
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
 - Yeah, great.

229
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 - When Victoria arrived on the throne,

230
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
 they wouldn't have had them,

231
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
 and by the time she died, they definitely would.

232
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
 - Okay.

233
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
 - So that's.

234
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,480
 - That's about the right time.

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
 - Yeah, so they think that he probably

236
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
 would have used, you know,

237
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
 the communal toilet on his street kind of thing.

238
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
 - Right.

239
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
 - But basically, this bright pink flushing toilet

240
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,480
 is in a panel that he designed

241
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,480
 that depicts the life of St. Frideswide,

242
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,480
 who is the patron saint of Oxford.

243
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
 Frides, well, so.

244
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
 - I think it might be Frida's Wider.

245
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,480
 - Well, Frida's Wider.

246
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
 - Is it?

247
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,480
 - I'm not sure.

248
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,480
 - Frida's Wider?

249
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
 - I thought that was a patron saint of Stockholm.

250
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
 (laughing)

251
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,480
 - Yeah.

252
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,480
 - I'm not certain,

253
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
 but I don't think it's Frideswide.

254
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
 - Well, that is what I was going to say,

255
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
 which I find really interesting,

256
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
 'cause I was mentioning this to Tara, who's.

257
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,480
 - Don't use the pink toilet, Frida's Wider.

258
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
 Don't be naughty.

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,480
 - So Frida's Wider or Frideswide,

260
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 what's funny is that this is a town and gown divide,

261
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
 I think, because my brother.

262
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
 - Okay, town and gown.

263
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,480
 (laughing)

264
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
 - My brother went to,

265
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 his high school was called Frideswide School.

266
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
 - Right.

267
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
 - And everybody called it Frideswide School.

268
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
 - Oh.

269
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 - And there's a square in Oxford called Frideswide Square.

270
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
 - Well, they make all sorts of shit up in Oxford,

271
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
 don't they?

272
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
 - Oh yeah.

273
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,480
 - They call Magdalene Maudlin.

274
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
 - Yeah.

275
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 - Yeah, that's true.

276
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
 - There is a magazine about the patron saint of Oxford.

277
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
 I think it's called Frida's Wider's Digest.

278
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,480
 (laughing)

279
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
 - Very nice, very nice.

280
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 - Are you a Frida's Wider Wider?

281
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 - Yeah.

282
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
 (laughing)

283
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,480
 - Well, Frida's, Frida's Wider, Frideswide.

284
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
 - Frideswide.

285
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
 - Whoever we're going for.

286
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
 It was a panel depicting her life,

287
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
 and this is the very, very last panel,

288
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 was Herb on her deathbed.

289
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
 And behind her,

290
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 she just has a little on suite.

291
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
 - Toilet.

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
 - Cool.

293
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 - Toilet.

294
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
 - Lovely.

295
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
 - She's got a little curtain.

296
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
 - Made it.

297
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
 - And you've got the toilet with a flushing handle

298
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
 and everything.

299
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,480
 - Wow.

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,480
 - It's extraordinary.

301
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
 - That is incredible.

302
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
 - Yeah.

303
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
 - I had no idea that there's two crossed over,

304
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
 the stained glass in there.

305
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
 - I suppose if you're making a church now,

306
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
 they rebuilt the one in Christchurch, New Zealand,

307
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
 didn't they?

308
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
 - Yeah.

309
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
 - After the earthquake.

310
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
 What would you put into the stained glass?

311
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
 - That's true.

312
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
 - That's the modern equivalent of the toilet.

313
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
 - Oh, it'd be like a mobile phone.

314
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
 - Someone getting a good signal.

315
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
 - Yeah.

316
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
 Or a rocket.

317
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
 - Yeah.

318
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 - Or a working printer.

319
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
 - Yeah.

320
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
 - I've been to a Buddhist temple in Wimbledon,

321
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
 and it's quite, like it's a surprising Buddhist temple.

322
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
 - He'd be looking for James in his monkhood.

323
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
 (all laughing)

324
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
 But in it, they've got depictions

325
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
 of all sorts of modern things.

326
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
 - Okay.

327
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
 - Whether it's spaceships or planes or whatever.

328
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
 I mean, they're painted rather than stained glass,

329
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
 but it's one of these incredible,

330
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
 like all-round painted rooms.

331
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
 I can't remember the name of the temple.

332
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
 It's quite a famous Buddhist temple.

333
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
 - We spoke on the pod a bit ago.

334
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
 I can't remember how long ago,

335
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
 but there is a stained glass window

336
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
 that's now at Westminster Abbey,

337
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
 which was designed by Hockney.

338
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
 - Oh, yeah.

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,480
 - The one that looks like it was made on Microsoft Paint.

340
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
 - Well, it was made on an iPad.

341
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
 - An iPad, yeah.

342
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
 - He sort of designed it on an iPad.

343
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
 - Oh, yeah.

344
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
 - So stained glass is still alive.

345
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
 - I went to the Hockney exhibition

346
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
 in Granary Square in Kings Cross this weekend.

347
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
 And someone who isn't a massive fan

348
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
 of the new Hockney stuff, it was really good.

349
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
 - Cool.

350
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
 - You're like in a room,

351
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,480
 and it's on all of the walls,

352
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
 all of his paintings,

353
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
 and he's talking about it and stuff like that.

354
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
 And these things that look not particularly brilliant

355
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,480
 'cause they're done in an iPad on a wall,

356
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
 suddenly when it's the whole room lit up

357
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
 with all the lights and stuff, it looks incredible.

358
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
 - Nice, yeah.

359
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,480
 - Yeah, it's really awesome.

360
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
 - It'd be a cool escape room as well.

361
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
 - Yeah?

362
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
 - Like David Hockney's locked you up,

363
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
 and you gotta get out.

364
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
 - David locked me.

365
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 (all laughing)

366
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
 - And there's the poster.

367
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
 Have your name.

368
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
 Hockney, we'll split it 50/50.

369
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 We'll see you there.

370
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
 (all laughing)

371
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
 - James, on your question

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
 on what you'd put in a church nowadays,

373
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
 I think it depends as well

374
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
 on what we think Edward,

375
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
 or why we think Edward Ben-Jones

376
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
 put the toilet in the glass to begin with.

377
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
 - See, I thought 'cause he was celebrating it, maybe?

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
 - Yeah, so there's different ideas about that.

379
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
 I'm curious what you guys think.

380
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
 So one of them is this,

381
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 that he's excited about this new invention.

382
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
 There's another idea that he might be actually making

383
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
 a bit of a political statement

384
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
 about the importance of sanitation.

385
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,480
 - Oh, yeah.

386
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
 - Yeah, so because in 1858,

387
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
 that was the year of the big stink.

388
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
 So, you know, where all the, you know,

389
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
 parliament had to be evacuated.

390
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,480
 - Because, yeah, the sewers were emptying into the Thames.

391
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
 It was a really hot summer.

392
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
 - Exactly, exactly.

393
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
 And the year before,

394
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
 he had had a really awful, awful fever.

395
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
 He nearly died.

396
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 And apparently, Frieders-Weeder,

397
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,480
 slash, fried-eyed, had also died of a fever.

398
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
 - Frieders-Weeder died of a fever.

399
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 (laughing)

400
00:15:48,480 --> 00:16:03,480
 - There is a thought that he's trying to make

401
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
 a bit of a statement of, you know,

402
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
 if only she'd had proper sanitation.

403
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
 - Okay, that is, yeah, great.

404
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
 - Yeah, so I don't know if you could, you know,

405
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
 add some kind of political statement into your church.

406
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
 I don't know what it would be.

407
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,480
 - Hmm, well, it'd be a climate change thing,

408
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
 I guess, for a lot of people these days.

409
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
 You'd sort of have Attenborough sinking.

410
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
 - Yeah, like a solar panel.

411
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
 - I would want to see Attenborough

412
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
 in a, like, depicted in stained glass.

413
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
 - What, drowning?

414
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
 (laughing)

415
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,480
 - A stained glass solar panel would look really cool.

416
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
 - Yeah, it would look cool.

417
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
 - But wait a minute, the light has to pass through

418
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
 in order to light up the cathedral,

419
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
 and the solar panel has to-

420
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
 - Yeah, you're right, you're right.

421
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
 I put someone not playing the music out loud

422
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
 on a portable speaker.

423
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
 - Oh yeah, how would you, how would you depict that?

424
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
 Someone not doing something?

425
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
 (laughing)

426
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
 I think actually this person who did the other one

427
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
 has already put that in his-

428
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
 (laughing)

429
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
 - Yeah, it's all stained glass windows,

430
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
 showing people not using portable speakers.

431
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
 (laughing)

432
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
 - Okay, well, thanks very much for your question, Leigh-Ink.

433
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
 I think, did we get it right or not?

434
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
 I think Andy maybe got the correct answer.

435
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,480
 - Yeah, I don't want to say glass.

436
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
 - Eventually.

437
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
 All right, well, that's the end of the show.

438
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
 Thank you very much, Leigh-Ink.

439
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
 Thanks for bringing your question.

440
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
 Hopefully we get you on this again quite soon.

441
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
 And that's the end of Meet the Elves.

442
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
 We'll be back again with another elf.

443
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
 (singing)

444
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,480
 - You remembered it!

445
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
 - It's my, yeah.

446
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
 - I'm impressed.

447
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
 - I wrote it for this show.

448
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
 (laughing)

449
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,480
 (upbeat music)

450
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,480
 (upbeat music)

451
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
 (upbeat music)
