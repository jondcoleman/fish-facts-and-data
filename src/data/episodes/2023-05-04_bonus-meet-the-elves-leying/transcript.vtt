 Hello everyone and welcome to Meet the Elves which is another one of our

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.240
 favorite features on Clubfish where we meet one of the QI elves who you might

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.160
 not have met before and today we're gonna speak with Leigh-ing.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.060
 Hi. Hi Leigh-ing, how you doing?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.040
 Hi, yeah I'm good, enjoying the sun.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.400
 Oh yeah, we're in London in our new offices in Holborn and it's beautifully

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.340
 sunshiny outside. Dan, anything to add on the weather?

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.220
 No, I was just curious how you said Holborn because I've dropped the L from my

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.600
 pronunciation, but I kind of saw you snuck it in to yours.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.840
 Well I told you not to put the L in Holborn, but you say it with an L.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.040
 Yeah, because I'm not from London you see.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.360
 I'm not from London. I pronounce it Covent Garden so anyway, Leigh-ing.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.920
 Nice to see you and you've brought a question for us I think and we're gonna

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.800
 chat about it and try and answer it and maybe learn a bit more about you along

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.840
 the way. Sure. So what's your question?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.240
 My question is, how do you pronounce it?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.480
 Why shouldn't you use the pink toilet in Christchurch Cathedral?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 Oh, okay. What a great question. It sounds like a euphemism doesn't it?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.480
 Christchurch, is that an Oxford or a Cambrian?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.480
 New Zealand? Oh yeah. My first thought was New Zealand, is it?

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.480
 Was it? It's not in New Zealand. You were right the first time, it is the one in Oxford.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.480
 Christchurch is a posh college. Is it?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 Yeah, it is. It's one of the ones where people at the other colleges go, oh Christchurch.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 Because to me, they're all posh. What is the, you know, on the scale of poshness?

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.480
 It used to just be called church didn't it? And they went, oh Christchurch.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 There is a kind of, I'm not gonna say a social dividing line, but basically

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.480
 colleges made of stone tend to look down on those made of brick, you know?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.480
 Is that right? What about those made of straw?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 All the little pigs have been eaten in those. It's very tragic.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 No, as in just if your college is made of stone, it's like it's 700 years old

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.480
 and it can withstand a medieval siege and it's probably there for the Civil War and all this stuff.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.480
 Whereas if you just made a brick, it's either like late 19th century or early 20th century.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 So did you not talk to it? Because you went to Oxford. How could you go?

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
 I thought we were dancing around the subject there. I thought we'd just lay it down.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.480
 Did you go to a brick or a stone? I went to a brick because I'm a blue-collar guy.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 - Flame, did you go to university? - I did go to university. I went to Durham.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.480
 Oh, that feels like a stone to me.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.480
 - That's a good question. - It feels like bonds to me. Durham.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.480
 - It's nice and countryside, isn't it? - What? Durham, isn't it? - It's a city.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 - It's a tiny city to be fair. - But it's quite medieval, isn't it?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.480
 It is gorgeous. I didn't go to one of the old posh ones though.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.480
 - You know what I'm talking about. - I do, I do.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.480
 - We tried ourselves on being relatable. - Durham.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.480
 - It's our college, our college. - Durham is a lot of posh as well.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.480
 It's like St Andrews as well. St Andrews is incredible. They've got three streets and everyone's got 15 names. It's very posh.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 What was Exeter like? That's where you went, isn't it, James?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 - No, I went to Sheffield. - Oh, sorry, Sheffield. My wife went as well, weirdly.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.480
 - Oh, yeah? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was it like there? Was that...

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.480
 - That was great. - Sorry. - Why does a wolf have a little goatee?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 It was alright. I went to Durham only once in my life, as in stayed there, and it was when I walked from Durham to Lindisfarne.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 - Oh, gorgeous. - I did a pilgrimage.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 Were you briefly in training for a monk to be a monk?

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.480
 I feel like there was some point in your life where you could have become a monk.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.480
 I want you to carry on with this, because it is a complete falsehood, but I want to know where you're going to go with it.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.480
 No, I just thought that you'd be into it. I was an altar boy.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.480
 - That's it, and you were educated. - Does he just give off monkish vibes?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 It's the tonsure that does it.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
 Yeah, that's why he's got a hat on.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.480
 But it's the... You went to a seminary. You were raised Catholic.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.480
 - I thought you went to a seminary. - I didn't go to a seminary. I actually don't know what that is.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.480
 I think of it as being a bit like a kind of training wheels monastery.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 I went to a Catholic school, which was run by nuns and priests.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.480
 Right, so there must have been a point, the last possible point at which you could have become a monk.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.480
 I think it's still open to me.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.480
 You're absolutely right. There's no age limit in monks, is there?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.480
 Actually, famously, a lot of them are very old.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.480
 Yeah, you're right. You're right. Sorry, if you're listening to this and you think you're becoming a monk, don't give up.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.480
 Never too late.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.480
 Ling, have you ever considered the religious life?

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.480
 Well, interestingly, both my parents are vikers.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.480
 - Are they? - Yeah, both.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.480
 So my mum and my dad are both reverent.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.480
 Andy was shocked a woman was allowed to be a viker in that.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.480
 No, I assume Ling had two dads who were both vikers.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.480
 Can I just say that must be difficult because I'm sure I'm wrong about this,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.480
 but I would have thought they would have to stay in their own diocese or parish.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.480
 And so it would be difficult because one of them would have to work in one town and the other one would have to work in another town.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.480
 So my dad is a viker, but not in the Church of England and my mum is a viker.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.480
 It is an Anglican viker, but that's irrelevant now anyway because they've moved to Hong Kong.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.480
 So my mum is a viker in Hong Kong.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.480
 Wow, which church?

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.480
 So she used to be at St Andrews on Nathan Road.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.480
 - That's where I used to go. - Did she?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.480
 - Yeah, my whole childhood. - In Jinxatui, right?

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.480
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.480
 - Oh, my God. Wait, where? - In Jinxatui, TST.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.480
 But I would have gone to that because I used to live near that area.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.480
 - So, wow. - Yeah, by Jordan and TST.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.480
 That's not well, she's not there anymore, but she used to be there.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.480
 And then now they've moved to a different church.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.480
 - I mean, that would have been amazing. - That would have been incredible.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.480
 I'm kind of sad that you backed off that.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.480
 I just sort of thought for accuracy, but yeah, I would have been there.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.480
 I would have prayed there.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.480
 You famously went to all the churches in Hong Kong, didn't you?

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.480
 You've got to try them all out to see which one fits.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.480
 Sadly, it's made of brick, not stone, so...

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.480
 - Right. - I know.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.480
 I just remembered the format.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.480
 - You had a question. - Pink toilets.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.480
 So Christ Church is like, it's got a big bell, which is called Old Tom.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.480
 That's one thing I know about Christ Church.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.480
 - Oh, I didn't know that. - And they've got the longest dining hall in Oxford.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480
 - Is that where they filmed Harry Potter, their dining hall? - I think it is.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.480
 And I think my college had the second longest dining hall in Oxford.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.480
 - Oh, that must have hurt. - You couldn't add just a bit of wood.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480
 - It was built later. - Why didn't they just make it?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.480
 I think mine was built later, and they did deliberately make it

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.480
 by about six inches, the longest dining hall in Oxford.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.480
 You know, when they're trying to build the tortoise building,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.480
 they just add an extra spire on the top.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.480
 - They just chuck an extra table in the end. - One brick.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.480
 - This is a difference between my education and your education, Andy,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.480
 is that my university had the longest bar in England,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.480
 and I think it still does have the longest bar in England.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.480
 - Wow, it's very nice. - Bar one in Sheffield.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.480
 - Bar one? - Yeah.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480
 - They couldn't remember bar two. - Is it an actual toilet, Leigh?

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.480
 - No. - Oh, okay.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.480
 - Wait, let's have the question again then. - So why shouldn't you use

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.480
 the pink toilet in Christ Church Cathedral?

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480
 - It's not an actual toilet. - It's not an actual toilet.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.480
 - Oh, and it's a cathedral. That's the other mad thing.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.480
 The reason that everyone thinks Christ Church College is so posh

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.480
 is it has a cathedral on the premises, as in that's uncommon.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.480
 Like, colleges might have a chapel, or a little, you know,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.480
 because they're all religiously, they've got religious origins,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.480
 all of them, you know, so a chapel normal.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.480
 A cathedral? - Ah, so--

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.480
 - If your little college, which has about 300 students,

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.480
 you've got a cathedral, it's crazy.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.480
 - Is it a confession booth that's been called the pink toilet?

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.480
 And-- - Oh, my God.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.480
 - Right, so Dan, I'd like to ask you a question.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.480
 Why is your confession booth called the pink toilet?

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.480
 - I'm actually not taking questions right now, Andy.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.480
 - But it does, like, a confessional booth

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.480
 looks a bit like a stall in a toilet.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
 - Yeah, absolutely. - Yeah.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.480
 - You've got the guy in there taking a mess of shit.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.480
 He's been in there for hours.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.480
 - 'Cause they have a little seat you sit on,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480
 and they have a hole in the wall next to you.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.480
 - The trouble is-- - And there's a blow coming up

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.480
 inside. - It would be incredibly circular

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:40.480
 if the confession booth was a toilet, and you use it as a toilet,

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.480
 and you were stuck in the confession booth add-in,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.480
 so confessing that you just shat in the confession booth.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.480
 - Yeah, it's got another confession booth if you do that.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.480
 - Imagine being the priest waiting for the next confession

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.480
 to start, but then you just hear this--

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.480
 (laughing)

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.480
 Sorry, is there someone-- - No.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480
 - Is there-- - No.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.480
 - There's no toilet paper there, is there?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.480
 (laughing)

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480
 - No.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.480
 - Oh, well, I've definitely sinned.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.480
 Forgive me, Father.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480
 - That's when they open the little hatch

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.480
 and just pass the-- (laughing)

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480
 - Pass the lever all through.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.480
 - Give it five minutes before you confess your sins

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.480
 in there. (laughing)

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480
 - Oh, my God.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480
 - Oh, no.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.480
 - There's nothing to do with confessional booths.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
 - Nothing to do with confession, apart from anything,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.480
 because Christchurch is an Anglican cathedral.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
 - Okay.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.480
 - And confessions, and correct me if I'm wrong,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480
 I think they're Catholic, is that right?

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:26.480
 - I don't know if there was ever a tradition of--

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.480
 I think, I mean, they are Catholic, for sure.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.480
 - Yeah, so I think that's-- - Okay.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.480
 - All right.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.480
 Okay, so it's not a toilet.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480
 That's what we know.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480
 It's a big toilet, but it's not a toilet.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.480
 - Is there any kind of little clue that you can help us

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.480
 along our way?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.480
 - Sure, it is a depiction of a toilet.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.480
 - Ah, okay.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.480
 - Of course.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.480
 Well, in that case, if it's a painting,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
 you should never shit on a painting.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.480
 (laughing)

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.480
 I think, is that the answer?

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.480
 - It's not a painting.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.480
 - Oh, not a painting.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.480
 - It's not a depiction, depiction.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.480
 Could be a mural, could be a gargoyle.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480
 - Stained glass.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480
 - Stained glass.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.480
 - Stained glass toilet.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.480
 - There is a stained glass toilet.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480
 - No.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.480
 - In Christchurch Cathedral.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.480
 - Brilliant.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.480
 - Is there?

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.480
 - Yes, and it is bright pink.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.480
 - Wow.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.480
 - Okay.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.480
 Who's, is it an, is it a?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
 - Is it quite modern?

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
 - Yeah, it's modern.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
 - Because you would think like pink glass

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480
 would be difficult to get.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.480
 - Yeah, it's actually from the 1850s.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.480
 - Okay, wow.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.480
 - Yeah, so it was added by Edward Burn-Jones,

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480
 who became a pre-Raphaelite,

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.480
 but it was in his pre-Raphaelite days

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.480
 (laughing)

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.480
 that he designed this stained glass,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.480
 and he was 24, 25.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
 - Wow.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.480
 - And they think that he was pretty excited

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.480
 about the advent of flushing toilets,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.480
 and he added one into a panel in Christchurch Cathedral.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.480
 - That's so crazy.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480
 - Wow, so it's a modern,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.480
 I didn't know when we got flushing toilets,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480
 so that's quite exciting.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.480
 - Victorians.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.480
 - Yeah, great.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.480
 - When Victoria arrived on the throne,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480
 they wouldn't have had them,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480
 and by the time she died, they definitely would.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480
 - Okay.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480
 - So that's.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.480
 - That's about the right time.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.480
 - Yeah, so they think that he probably

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.480
 would have used, you know,

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.480
 the communal toilet on his street kind of thing.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480
 - Right.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.480
 - But basically, this bright pink flushing toilet

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.480
 is in a panel that he designed

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.480
 that depicts the life of St. Frideswide,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.480
 who is the patron saint of Oxford.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.480
 Frides, well, so.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.480
 - I think it might be Frida's Wider.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.480
 - Well, Frida's Wider.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480
 - Is it?

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.480
 - I'm not sure.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.480
 - Frida's Wider?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.480
 - I thought that was a patron saint of Stockholm.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:26.480
 (laughing)

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480
 - Yeah.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 - I'm not certain,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.480
 but I don't think it's Frideswide.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.480
 - Well, that is what I was going to say,

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.480
 which I find really interesting,

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.480
 'cause I was mentioning this to Tara, who's.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.480
 - Don't use the pink toilet, Frida's Wider.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480
 Don't be naughty.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.480
 - So Frida's Wider or Frideswide,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.480
 what's funny is that this is a town and gown divide,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.480
 I think, because my brother.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.480
 - Okay, town and gown.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.480
 (laughing)

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.480
 - My brother went to,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 his high school was called Frideswide School.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480
 - Right.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.480
 - And everybody called it Frideswide School.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480
 - Oh.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.480
 - And there's a square in Oxford called Frideswide Square.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480
 - Well, they make all sorts of shit up in Oxford,

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480
 don't they?

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480
 - Oh yeah.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480
 - They call Magdalene Maudlin.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480
 - Yeah.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
 - Yeah, that's true.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.480
 - There is a magazine about the patron saint of Oxford.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.480
 I think it's called Frida's Wider's Digest.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.480
 (laughing)

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:16.480
 - Very nice, very nice.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.480
 - Are you a Frida's Wider Wider?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480
 - Yeah.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.480
 (laughing)

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.480
 - Well, Frida's, Frida's Wider, Frideswide.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.480
 - Frideswide.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.480
 - Whoever we're going for.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.480
 It was a panel depicting her life,

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.480
 and this is the very, very last panel,

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.480
 was Herb on her deathbed.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.480
 And behind her,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.480
 she just has a little on suite.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.480
 - Toilet.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480
 - Cool.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.480
 - Toilet.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480
 - Lovely.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.480
 - She's got a little curtain.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.480
 - Made it.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.480
 - And you've got the toilet with a flushing handle

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.480
 and everything.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480
 - Wow.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480
 - It's extraordinary.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.480
 - That is incredible.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.480
 - Yeah.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480
 - I had no idea that there's two crossed over,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.480
 the stained glass in there.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.480
 - I suppose if you're making a church now,

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.480
 they rebuilt the one in Christchurch, New Zealand,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.480
 didn't they?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
 - Yeah.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480
 - After the earthquake.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.480
 What would you put into the stained glass?

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.480
 - That's true.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.480
 - That's the modern equivalent of the toilet.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.480
 - Oh, it'd be like a mobile phone.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480
 - Someone getting a good signal.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480
 - Yeah.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480
 Or a rocket.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480
 - Yeah.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.480
 - Or a working printer.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.480
 - Yeah.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.480
 - I've been to a Buddhist temple in Wimbledon,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.480
 and it's quite, like it's a surprising Buddhist temple.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.480
 - He'd be looking for James in his monkhood.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 (all laughing)

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.480
 But in it, they've got depictions

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.480
 of all sorts of modern things.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.480
 - Okay.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.480
 - Whether it's spaceships or planes or whatever.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.480
 I mean, they're painted rather than stained glass,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.480
 but it's one of these incredible,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.480
 like all-round painted rooms.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:40.480
 I can't remember the name of the temple.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.480
 It's quite a famous Buddhist temple.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.480
 - We spoke on the pod a bit ago.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480
 I can't remember how long ago,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.480
 but there is a stained glass window

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.480
 that's now at Westminster Abbey,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.480
 which was designed by Hockney.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.480
 - The one that looks like it was made on Microsoft Paint.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.480
 - Well, it was made on an iPad.

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480
 - An iPad, yeah.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.480
 - He sort of designed it on an iPad.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480
 - So stained glass is still alive.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.480
 - I went to the Hockney exhibition

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.480
 in Granary Square in Kings Cross this weekend.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.480
 And someone who isn't a massive fan

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.480
 of the new Hockney stuff, it was really good.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480
 - Cool.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.480
 - You're like in a room,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.480
 and it's on all of the walls,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.480
 all of his paintings,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.480
 and he's talking about it and stuff like that.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.480
 And these things that look not particularly brilliant

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.480
 'cause they're done in an iPad on a wall,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.480
 suddenly when it's the whole room lit up

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.480
 with all the lights and stuff, it looks incredible.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480
 - Nice, yeah.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.480
 - Yeah, it's really awesome.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.480
 - It'd be a cool escape room as well.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480
 - Yeah?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480
 - Like David Hockney's locked you up,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.480
 and you gotta get out.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.480
 - David locked me.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.480
 (all laughing)

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480
 - And there's the poster.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480
 Have your name.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.480
 Hockney, we'll split it 50/50.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480
 We'll see you there.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480
 (all laughing)

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480
 - James, on your question

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.480
 on what you'd put in a church nowadays,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480
 I think it depends as well

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.480
 on what we think Edward,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480
 or why we think Edward Ben-Jones

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.480
 put the toilet in the glass to begin with.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.480
 - See, I thought 'cause he was celebrating it, maybe?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.480
 - Yeah, so there's different ideas about that.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.480
 I'm curious what you guys think.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.480
 So one of them is this,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.480
 that he's excited about this new invention.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.480
 There's another idea that he might be actually making

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.480
 a bit of a political statement

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.480
 about the importance of sanitation.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.480
 - Oh, yeah.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.480
 - Yeah, so because in 1858,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480
 that was the year of the big stink.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.480
 So, you know, where all the, you know,

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.480
 parliament had to be evacuated.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.480
 - Because, yeah, the sewers were emptying into the Thames.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480
 It was a really hot summer.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.480
 And the year before,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.480
 he had had a really awful, awful fever.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.480
 He nearly died.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.480
 And apparently, Frieders-Weeder,

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.480
 slash, fried-eyed, had also died of a fever.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.480
 - Frieders-Weeder died of a fever.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.480
 (laughing)

00:15:48.480 --> 00:16:03.480
 - There is a thought that he's trying to make

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.480
 a bit of a statement of, you know,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.480
 if only she'd had proper sanitation.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.480
 - Okay, that is, yeah, great.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.480
 - Yeah, so I don't know if you could, you know,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.480
 add some kind of political statement into your church.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.480
 I don't know what it would be.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.480
 - Hmm, well, it'd be a climate change thing,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.480
 I guess, for a lot of people these days.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:22.480
 You'd sort of have Attenborough sinking.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.480
 - Yeah, like a solar panel.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.480
 - I would want to see Attenborough

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.480
 in a, like, depicted in stained glass.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480
 - What, drowning?

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480
 (laughing)

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.480
 - A stained glass solar panel would look really cool.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.480
 - Yeah, it would look cool.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.480
 - But wait a minute, the light has to pass through

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480
 in order to light up the cathedral,

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.480
 and the solar panel has to-

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.480
 - Yeah, you're right, you're right.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.480
 I put someone not playing the music out loud

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.480
 on a portable speaker.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.480
 - Oh yeah, how would you, how would you depict that?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.480
 Someone not doing something?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480
 (laughing)

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.480
 I think actually this person who did the other one

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.480
 has already put that in his-

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.480
 (laughing)

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.480
 - Yeah, it's all stained glass windows,

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.480
 showing people not using portable speakers.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.480
 (laughing)

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.480
 - Okay, well, thanks very much for your question, Leigh-Ink.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.480
 I think, did we get it right or not?

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.480
 I think Andy maybe got the correct answer.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.480
 - Yeah, I don't want to say glass.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480
 - Eventually.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.480
 All right, well, that's the end of the show.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.480
 Thank you very much, Leigh-Ink.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:19.480
 Thanks for bringing your question.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.480
 Hopefully we get you on this again quite soon.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.480
 And that's the end of Meet the Elves.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.480
 We'll be back again with another elf.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 (singing)

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.480
 - You remembered it!

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480
 - It's my, yeah.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 - I'm impressed.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480
 - I wrote it for this show.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.480
 (laughing)

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.480
 (upbeat music)

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.480
 (upbeat music)

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.480
 (upbeat music)
