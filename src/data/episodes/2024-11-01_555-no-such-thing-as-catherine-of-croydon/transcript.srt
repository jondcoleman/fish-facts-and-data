 [MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,460
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,080
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Drury Lane.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,100
 >> [APPLAUSE]

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,560
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,160
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,040
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,060
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,160
 >> My fact is, as well as the world famous White Cliffs of Dover,

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,560
 Britain is home to the world unknown White Cliffs of Croydon.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,640
 >> [LAUGH] >> For listeners at home,

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,000
 we're looking at a majestic, huge set of glorious White Cliffs.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,280
 >> I mean, in fairness, they are White Cliffs, aren't they?

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,360
 There's no doubt about that.

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,480
 >> Are they White Cliffs or are they a disused quarry?

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,200
 It doesn't matter.

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,240
 >> [LAUGH]

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,680
 >> Right, is that what they are?

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,760
 >> They are the White Cliffs of Croydon.

21
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a bit of, is there anyone in tonight from Croydon?

22
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,320
 >> Yeah, wow.

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,840
 >> Excellent.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,160
 >> Were you familiar with the White Cliffs of Croydon?

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,720
 >> No, it's mixed results.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,280
 >> Croydon doesn't even know.

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,880
 >> Yeah, we weren't sure if it was a thing, and it turns out Andy,

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,400
 you sort of helped to coin it, I think.

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,960
 >> Well, I definitely didn't coin it.

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,920
 This is in a bit, Croydon is a bit of London, we should say.

31
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
 And in Croydon, there is a bit called Riddles Down,

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,480
 which is home to a disused truck quarry.

33
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,920
 And if you look at it from the right angle,

34
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,640
 it looks exactly like the White Cliffs of Dover.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,200
 >> From, sorry, from a right angle, or from-

36
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,160
 >> From, and if you look at it at right angles.

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,200
 >> Right. >> Which is the right angle.

38
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,560
 >> So this, and in fact, quite a lot of my research,

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,520
 it comes from a new book, which is called Croydonopolis,

40
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,880
 by Will Noble, and it is fantastic.

41
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,120
 I cannot recommend it enough.

42
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,760
 If you only read one book about Croydon this year, make it.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
 Croydonopolis, Croydon gets a really bad rap

44
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,800
 for anyone listening overseas.

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,840
 >> It's a shit hole.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
 >> Well.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
 >> But it is, yeah, for international listeners,

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 it is the punchline to jokes.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,480
 It's what is that place, you know?

50
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,120
 It's like Francis Belgium.

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,960
 >> Yeah.

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,640
 >> So, and famously, just people hate it.

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,280
 I think most famously, David Bowie hated it, didn't he?

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
 >> Definitely.

55
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,560
 >> And yeah, sorry, Dan, and you love David Bowie,

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,920
 and you love Croydon, apparently.

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,240
 >> Yeah, there's, what do I do?

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
 >> This is painful.

59
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,360
 He said, he literally said Croydon wasn't insult to him.

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,200
 He would say it's so fucking Croydon, to mean, well.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,440
 He said it's the most derogatory thing

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
 you can say about something.

63
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,840
 >> It is, and I try to, I try to look for good stuff

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,600
 in the news about Croydon, and I mean, the headlines

65
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,240
 that come up do not do it any favors.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,280
 One here was, "Teenager loses finger at Croydon rave,

67
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:56,160
 "but continues dancing because the bass was hard."

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,080
 >> That's good.

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,800
 >> That's, yeah, I guess so.

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,080
 Yeah, showing, showing, you know, that's something.

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
 >> That's a good news story.

72
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,040
 >> How about this one, "Croydon hospital leaves human teeth

73
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,720
 "embedded in man's leg after bizarre iPad trampoline incident."

74
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,520
 (laughing)

75
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,960
 >> Did you read any more into the article then?

76
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,640
 >> No, I thought it was better just leaving that as is.

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,000
 >> Well, they do, they have a fun palace,

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
 which has 60 trampolines.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,680
 >> Do they?

80
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,340
 >> I believe, yeah, yeah, they do.

81
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,080
 So, Henry VIII said it was a place

82
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,200
 that he could never be without sickness,

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 and there's a store--

84
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
 >> Did he mean sick hasn't good?

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,120
 >> No, I don't think he did.

86
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,600
 I think that would be very charitable.

87
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,680
 >> Was one of his wives from there?

88
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,120
 >> Catherine of Croydon.

89
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,960
 (laughing)

90
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,040
 >> She was the fourth Catherine

91
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
 who never gets any credit.

92
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
 No, the first one, who was she?

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
 Catherine of Aragon.

94
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,680
 >> Aragon?

95
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,760
 >> I think he supposedly proposed

96
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,160
 to Catherine of Aragon, it was one of the Catharines,

97
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,940
 anyway, one of the odds, 50/50.

98
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,280
 (laughing)

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,200
 >> The first beheaded died,

100
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,080
 the first beheaded got some teeth stuck in their leg

101
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,520
 after an iPad accident.

102
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,040
 (laughing)

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,560
 >> But there is a huge and story history of Croydon,

104
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,620
 it turns out, and actually we've all been very unfair to it.

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,920
 So, for example, it used to be the summer residence

106
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,400
 of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

107
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,240
 >> Is that right?

108
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,720
 >> Yeah, I mean, some time ago.

109
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,800
 >> I thought the summer residence was a bucolic beach,

110
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,120
 your mountainous place you went to relax,

111
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,160
 not a brutalist gray tower block place.

112
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
 >> Well, this is all before all the tower blocks

113
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,560
 and the car parks and things.

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,880
 So, the name might mean valley

115
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,240
 where the wild saffron grows.

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,080
 >> Right.

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,000
 >> Crocadine, crocadine.

118
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,640
 It's a nice, it sounds, it sounds lovely.

119
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,880
 >> I think it used to be the place

120
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,960
 where all celebrities wanted to be seen, right?

121
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,800
 >> What periods?

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
 >> So, we're talking early 20th century,

123
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,080
 Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford,

124
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,000
 Babe Ruth, JFK, Rita Hayworth,

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,680
 all these people wanted to be seen in Croydon.

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,200
 And that's because Croydon was where their airport was,

127
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
 main airport in London.

128
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
 And they weren't really doing airports

129
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,320
 in America at the time.

130
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,680
 And planes are really cool and trendy and new.

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
 So, everyone wanted to go there

132
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
 and be seen with the airplanes.

133
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,240
 >> Also, the base is hard.

134
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,280
 (audience laughing)

135
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,920
 No, you're right, it was, the aerodrome was a mega,

136
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,240
 and it was until the Second World War,

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,200
 it was basically the, the most,

138
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,800
 like they had 100,000 visitors a year

139
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,400
 who were just turning up to see the planes.

140
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,160
 >> John Mayday was invented there,

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,400
 presumably by a pilot desperately trying to reject him.

142
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,320
 He saw it, looming up ahead.

143
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
 >> Mayday, Mayday, and they're going,

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,920
 "What's that, sounds awesome, we should lock that in,

145
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,200
 "is that like you in trouble?"

146
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,880
 >> Amy Johnson flew from Croydon

147
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,520
 when she flew to Australia in 1930.

148
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,720
 And then when she came back,

149
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,120
 she came back to Croydon Airport,

150
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
 and 200,000 people greeted her there.

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
 >> So, sorry, was she, she was the first woman

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
 to fly a long way?

153
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,320
 >> To, to Australia.

154
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,840
 >> Okay, okay.

155
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,760
 >> So she came back, and there were 200,000 people there,

156
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,520
 and according to articles at the time,

157
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,640
 at least 12 people were run over

158
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,480
 by the slow-moving procession,

159
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,800
 but one journalist said they were all quite cheerful

160
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,760
 as they were carried off to hospital.

161
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,920
 (audience laughing)

162
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
 Probably 'cause they were leaving Croydon.

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,160
 (audience laughing)

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
 And apparently the Daily Mail paid for all the compensation

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,880
 of anyone who got injured.

166
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,720
 >> Oh, wow.

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,560
 >> Hey.

168
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,760
 >> Good old Daily Mail.

169
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
 >> I said no one ever.

170
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,080
 (audience laughing)

171
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,200
 I did a quick hunt for sort of

172
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,720
 underappreciated white things in Croydon.

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
 (audience laughing)

174
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
 Arthur Conan Doyle lived in Croydon,

175
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,280
 and he wrote quite a lot of the Sherlock Holmes stories there,

176
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,680
 obviously very, very famous,

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,040
 but when he moved there,

178
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,640
 the first thing that he published,

179
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,440
 which was a three-volume book,

180
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,840
 was The White Company,

181
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,320
 which was a historical adventure novel,

182
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,840
 which was massive at the time.

183
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,280
 No one now really knows what that is,

184
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,960
 unless you know Conan Doyle's bibliography really well,

185
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,560
 but it was big in the day, and it kind of disappeared.

186
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,320
 That was published while he lived in Croydon.

187
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,520
 Will Hay, the comedian, in 1932,

188
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
 he has noted as having discovered a great white spot

189
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,680
 on the planet Saturn from his garden in Croydon.

190
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
 It was like a big new astronomical discovery.

191
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,600
 Everyone's really excited, not so much anymore.

192
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
 It's getting nothing in here.

193
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,000
 (audience laughing)

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,760
 And then lastly, C.B. Frye, the great cricketer,

195
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,000
 and sort of multi-everything person.

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,160
 He wasn't his party trick.

197
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,320
 He used to be able to just jump backwards

198
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,400
 onto a mantelpiece.

199
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,560
 Yeah, that was his party trick.

200
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
 He'd just be chatting to you and go, "Whoop,"

201
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,280
 and then he would be on top of the mantelpiece,

202
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,680
 and he was like, "Party trick."

203
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
 C.B. Frye, lesser-known appreciated white,

204
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,360
 is his mother, Constance White.

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,640
 Wow.

206
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,840
 I feel like you-- There's a good crowbars.

207
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,160
 (laughing)

208
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,520
 The crowbars are strong.

209
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,080
 It also has the world's grumpiest woman, Croydon, in it.

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,120
 That's it.

211
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,800
 Self-professed world's grumpiest woman.

212
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,000
 This is according to a news article in 2015

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,760
 about a woman who was completely naked

214
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,240
 aside from a large sash that read,

215
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,400
 "World's grumpiest woman who glued her bum

216
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,440
 "to the Croydon Debenham store window."

217
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,360
 (audience laughing)

218
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,600
 From the inside or from the outside, do we know?

219
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,240
 You'd think it would be too cold outside,

220
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,080
 but she was committed,

221
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,560
 and she was actually wearing fake pubic hair,

222
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,440
 which would have kept her warm.

223
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,000
 So I'm gonna say outside.

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,920
 Ah.

225
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,160
 And...

226
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,400
 Was it a protest?

227
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,480
 Yes, but it was just a protest about how grumpy she was.

228
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
 She just did a long rant about how grumpy she was.

229
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,840
 Oh, really?

230
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
 Yeah.

231
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
 But Debenham said, "It's great to hear our customers,

232
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,880
 "like our window displays so much

233
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,320
 "that they want to be part of it."

234
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,800
 So it's good that they saw the silver lining.

235
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,640
 It is quite...

236
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,320
 More recent stories about Croydon have...

237
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
 They've definitely...

238
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,320
 They're not Archbishop of Canterbury quality stories.

239
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,160
 So one of the most recent stories about Croydon from the BBC

240
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,840
 is about a homeowner in South London

241
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,640
 who has complained after Transport for London

242
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,040
 erected a toilet for bus drivers outside his house.

243
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,880
 He's called Brett Kemp,

244
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
 and he said it was putting off potential buyers

245
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,840
 because he keeps seeing bus drivers go in and go to the loo.

246
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,680
 And he says...

247
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
 Why don't you put a door on it?

248
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,560
 I think...

249
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,720
 I think even with a door,

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
 he says it's not the most appealing thing for potential buyers.

251
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
 He says it's nicknamed the turdis.

252
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,680
 To bring it a little bit more high, bro,

253
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,520
 Samuel Coleridge Taylor was born in Croydon.

254
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
 Samuel Taylor Coleridge?

255
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,280
 No, Samuel Coleridge Taylor.

256
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
 He was named after Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

257
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,160
 Confusingly, there's a piece called Kubla Khan,

258
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,440
 which was written by Taylor Coleridge and Coleridge Taylor.

259
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,920
 So I said the words are written by Taylor Coleridge,

260
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
 and the music is written by Coleridge Taylor.

261
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,920
 Because he was a composer, the classical one, yeah, yeah.

262
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
 So he wrote a violin concerto towards the end of his life,

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,880
 and he sent the music over to America,

264
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,000
 so it could be learned before he went there.

265
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,680
 Bad news, he sent it on the Titanic.

266
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
 Oh, no.

267
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,360
 Good news, it turned out they'd been mislaid,

268
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
 and they hadn't gone on the Titanic after all.

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,560
 Bad news.

270
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
 This is a roller coaster chase.

271
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,440
 Well, it goes downhill quite quickly.

272
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,240
 Bad news, he died before that discovery was made.

273
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,000
 So it's his sort of undiscovered and then posthumous piece of work.

274
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,320
 Yeah, exactly, and they did play it 100 years after his death.

275
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,880
 That's very cool.

276
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,800
 I'm going to have to move us on in a second.

277
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,960
 We haven't even got onto White Cliffs of Dover.

278
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,960
 Why do you need to, when you've got the White Cliffs of Croydon?

279
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,760
 They used to have an atmospheric railway.

280
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,240
 So do you know what that is?

281
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,640
 No.

282
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,840
 OK, imagine a railway, but it doesn't operate with boring engines,

283
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,280
 diesel, electricity, whatever.

284
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,360
 It's a vacuum.

285
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,280
 I don't need to explain an atmospheric railway to any of you.

286
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,880
 You mean like a pneumatic railway?

287
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
 I mean exactly that.

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,520
 You mean a pneumatic railway?

289
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,000
 A pneumatic railway, a vacuum pipe railway, as I call it.

290
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,520
 And this was going to be the future of transportation.

291
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,320
 And it was very exciting, it was mid-19th century.

292
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,800
 It was when we hadn't definitely settled on the train.

293
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,520
 The train was looking pretty good, but the atmospheric railway was potential.

294
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,760
 And it was actually built and it was tried out.

295
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,720
 The only problems where there were, sometimes it would miss the station

296
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,240
 and it couldn't go backwards so the passengers would have to walk along the tracks.

297
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,520
 Or sometimes male passengers had to get out and give it a little push

298
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,760
 because it stopped and couldn't get going again.

299
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,800
 And then when it got going again, it just left without you

300
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,400
 because you couldn't go back on.

301
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,800
 And the third problem was that rats would chew their way in

302
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,400
 and then they would just fly their way along the tubes and out into the pumping station.

303
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,920
 No, hundreds of rats a day.

304
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,800
 They had to put a sack over the outlet tube just to catch the rats.

305
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,200
 But apart from that, it's great, it's the system.

306
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
 Wow.

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,360
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

308
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:29,320
 My fact this week is that the world's most expensive super yacht probably doesn't exist.

309
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
 What?

310
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
 Oh, sounds like a Dan fact, that one, Anna.

311
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
 Doesn't it?

312
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,440
 What on earth does that mean?

313
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,000
 Well, I think it's an extraordinary thing.

314
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,640
 If you Google and all of you go to the world's most expensive super yacht,

315
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,760
 you've got loads and loads of top ten lists of the most expensive yachts in the world.

316
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 And number one is always this one called History Supreme.

317
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,600
 And these are on proper boating websites, they're reliable sources.

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,920
 History Supreme is worth $4.8 billion.

319
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,080
 The second on the list is Eclipse, which I think is or was owned by Roman Abramovich,

320
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
 which is $1.5 billion.

321
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,280
 So this is three times more than that.

322
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,000
 And it was bought by an anonymous Malaysian businessman.

323
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,440
 It's extremely lavish and it probably doesn't exist.

324
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,200
 According to quite a few people who've looked into it and pointed out things like the photos,

325
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,200
 so it's never been seen in real life by anyone who's told anyone about it.

326
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,640
 And it's quite hard to hide, I think, a super yacht.

327
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
 They're not subtle.

328
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,440
 But it could be floating somewhere secret, like private islands for the wealthy.

329
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
 That's a thing.

330
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
 Yeah, yeah.

331
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 You know?

332
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 That is a thing.

333
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,600
 Well, it also, so a statement was issued by another yacht making company, Bayer Yachts,

334
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,800
 saying that all the photos that were posted on the designer's website when it was designed

335
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,080
 a few years ago were actually of a completely different yacht that they designed and they

336
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,400
 just been coloured gold.

337
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,040
 Because one of the things about this yacht amongst the many ridiculous features is that

338
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
 it's covered in solid gold.

339
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,760
 Another thing that's been pointed out is if a boat is covered in solid gold, it's going

340
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,520
 to struggle to float.

341
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,880
 But it's so weird and it's insisted on and the designer sadly passed away now, but he's

342
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,640
 got a guy called Stuart Hughes known for designing very expensive things, as you can

343
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,200
 imagine, like iPhones encrusted with diamonds and stuff.

344
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,320
 And yeah, he said, I think the best thing about this super yacht that he said he'd made is

345
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,840
 a wall feature that's made from a meteor with Tyrannosaurus Rex bones shaved into it.

346
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,800
 He is just making shit up now, isn't he?

347
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 It's mad.

348
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,120
 So what do we think the deal is?

349
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,640
 Is this a tax thing or is it just a joke or what do we know?

350
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,320
 I think people think it might be one of the world's best pranks, because I don't know

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,680
 how it could be a tax thing.

352
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,400
 I mean, yachts are quite a shady business anyway, right?

353
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
 Yeah.

354
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,160
 We don't really know the world that exists beyond them.

355
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,760
 We don't know who the owners are.

356
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,120
 It's said that the owner of this one is Malaysia's richest businessman, a guy called Robert

357
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
 Kwok.

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,080
 And I cannot just say they are owned by rich people who are often quite powerful as well.

359
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,120
 So I'd just like to say that I believe them all.

360
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,120
 Yeah.

361
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,760
 So here's the thing.

362
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,080
 Robert Kwok is 101 years old.

363
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
 What?

364
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
 Yeah, he's 101 years old.

365
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,800
 He turned, I think it was October, November last year, he turned 101.

366
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 I know him.

367
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 No.

368
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 Yeah.

369
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 So, okay.

370
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,000
 Now, do you remember last week on the, so the latest show that went out, as of recording,

371
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,880
 was my parents had a salon and they used to do the hair of Bruce Lee's supposed mistress,

372
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,040
 Betty Ting, right?

373
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
 Yes.

374
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,120
 Another person whose hair they used to do was Robert Kwok.

375
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
 No.

376
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
 Yes.

377
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,440
 So, as a result, after he got his haircut by my mum, he said, "Hey, you should have a

378
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
 salon in my Shangri-La hotels," which he owned all the Shangri-La hotels in the world.

379
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
 He's the founder.

380
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,720
 So they set up a salon there.

381
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,880
 So I kind of grew up with Robert Kwok in my life.

382
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,080
 Did you ask him, or can you ask him about his yacht?

383
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
 Yeah.

384
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,240
 So I messaged my sister because she's still best friends with his granddaughter.

385
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,160
 And I messaged it just before the show.

386
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,840
 We went to school with each other in Hong Kong.

387
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,680
 I was going to do a humorous straw ball of the audience of, like, who owns a yacht or

388
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,240
 knows anyone who owns a yacht, because no one does.

389
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,840
 But of course you do.

390
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 I don't own a yacht.

391
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
 Yeah.

392
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,360
 You're best mates with the granddaughter.

393
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
 No.

394
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
 We know them.

395
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,880
 Anyway, I messaged my sister, but it's, of course, she's in Australia, so we won't

396
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
 hear back for another 12 hours or so.

397
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 Oh, come on.

398
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
 But I've been on his boat.

399
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
 His yacht?

400
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,640
 Yeah.

401
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,640
 What?

402
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,640
 A different one.

403
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
 A different one.

404
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
 It's not that great.

405
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
 Wow.

406
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
 Wow.

407
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 Yeah.

408
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,920
 So I'll say a couple of things about, so Larry Ellison, he's a, he's a squillionaire as

409
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
 well.

410
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
 Oh, yeah.

411
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,960
 He's the founder of Oracle Software, Software Guy.

412
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,320
 He bought a yacht in 1999 that was called Isanami.

413
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,360
 And he changed the name after it was pointed out that that name was "I'm a Nazi" backwards.

414
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
 In no way.

415
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
 I know.

416
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
 Was it?

417
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
 Is that what they used to do?

418
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
 You know, like ambulances have a name backwards.

419
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
 So.

420
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
 Have you looked in your review mirror?

421
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 Yeah, yeah.

422
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,040
 That guy, Larry Ellison, his yacht has someone in a speedboat who follows it around and their

423
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,240
 whole job is to retrieve the basketballs that he throws overboard because he's got a basketball

424
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 suit.

425
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
 Because he plays, but it's not just that.

426
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
 It's his hobby.

427
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
 He throws basketballs overboard.

428
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
 To torment a speedboat guy.

429
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
 Oh, yeah.

430
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
 He's got hoops.

431
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,680
 He's got a hoop, but he must be really bad at basketball, you would think, because he

432
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,960
 misses quite often and this guy has to go around and collect all the balls.

433
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,320
 Because basketballs are so expensive that you can't let one go.

434
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,360
 No, I think it's because he cares about the environment.

435
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,360
 Oh, okay.

436
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
 Not enough not to have a yacht.

437
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,400
 Because yachts are very, very bad for the environment.

438
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,120
 Have you heard of the Prince of Brunei's one?

439
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,360
 So he had one ages ago, it's now been sold.

440
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,880
 Which of your parents was the manicurist to him?

441
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,920
 He had one, it's now gone, but when he had it, it was called TITS.

442
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
 That was his yacht.

443
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,000
 Is it something in Brunei and?

444
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
 It literally just means TITS.

445
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,160
 And we think there's a lot of questions about how the name came about, but they think it

446
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
 must be that.

447
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,000
 Because when a lot of his personal collection was sold, they found a lot of erotic statues.

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,560
 He had watches with two figures that would copulate on the hour, so he clearly had a

449
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
 thing for it.

450
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,720
 They must be exhausted.

451
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
 Yeah.

452
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,440
 Is that Geoffrey of Brunei?

453
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,720
 Yeah, that's right.

454
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 And Bill Clinton.

455
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 Geoffrey.

456
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,720
 I think he's called Geoffrey.

457
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 Geoffrey of Brunei.

458
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 Geoffrey of Brunei?

459
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
 Yeah.

460
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 Geoffrey of Brunei.

461
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
 Cool.

462
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 The city of Brunei is his name.

463
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 But yeah, Clinton was meant to go on it, but apparently they just said he can't because

464
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 of the name.

465
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 They're like, we don't need that in our life.

466
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
 Right.

467
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
 We don't need a Clinton scandal like that.

468
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,960
 And he has a helipad on it, and his son, who's called Prince Hakim, is a helicopter pilot,

469
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,120
 and he flies in a jumpsuit with the name Iceman in a reference to Val Kilmer from Top Gun.

470
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:51,320
 Well, the backwards Iceman reads, I am a twat.

471
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,320
 Jokes on him.

472
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
 Yeah.

473
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,760
 Did you guys hear about these sort of very ancient yachts that were like Roman, Roman

474
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,760
 yachts?

475
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
 No.

476
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,440
 So Caligula had a, the Emperor Caligula had some pleasure barges, basically, which were

477
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,280
 kind of the ancient world equivalent of yachts.

478
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,320
 So the historian Suetonius writes about them, there were 10 banks of oars, which is a lot.

479
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,320
 They were about 240 feet long, they were used mostly for parties, they were kind of stationary.

480
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,240
 I think they were on a lake actually, a lake in Italy.

481
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,960
 Anyway, Emperor Caligula commissioned them, and he only got to enjoy them for a year because

482
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,160
 he was then stabbed to death by his senators and his own guards and everyone else.

483
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:35,880
 But, I know, sad, but they were drenched by Mussolini in the 1930s.

484
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,760
 Also spoiler alert, not a great ending ahead for Mussolini.

485
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,280
 But this is the, okay, this is the amazing thing about these yachts, because they were

486
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,960
 luxurious, they were real, they sank, their location was known, and they were drenched,

487
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
 right?

488
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,720
 There were some mosaics, beautiful mosaics, which had been drenched up.

489
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,920
 And around the end of the Second World War, a lot of stuff was going missing across Europe,

490
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,320
 and one of the mosaics just went AWOL, and it was never seen or heard of again, until

491
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,080
 in New York, this was a couple of years ago, there was a book signing by a guy who'd written

492
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,200
 a book about Italian marbles, and as he was sitting at the table doing his signing, he

493
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,520
 overheard a couple standing nearby, one of them said to the other, "Oh, Helen, look,

494
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520
 that's your mosaic."

495
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,880
 And a New York couple had bought it, not knowing where it was from, and for the last 45 years

496
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,280
 they'd been using it as a coffee table.

497
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,400
 Yeah, Helen's my auntie.

498
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,000
 That is amazing.

499
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,400
 So now it's got coffee stains, beautifully woven into the chair.

500
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,600
 I think it was repatriated, though, I think it was agreed that they probably shouldn't

501
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
 be able to keep it, and so it was sent back to Italy.

502
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,360
 Did they get a replacement table, at least?

503
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,080
 I'm sure they did.

504
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,480
 I said before they're bad for the environment yachts, and I think they are, I mean, they

505
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,840
 use a lot of oil and stuff, and they have big anchors that can get rid of the seagrass

506
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,920
 and the bottom of the sea, stuff like that.

507
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,080
 Jeff Bezos has got a new yacht.

508
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,440
 A big anchor himself, I would say.

509
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,480
 Massive anchor.

510
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,120
 He's kind of a very powerful man.

511
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,160
 Complete anchor, yeah, yeah.

512
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,160
 And his relies on wind power, which is quite good.

513
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,720
 Unfortunately, it has to be followed everywhere by a diesel-engined support vessel that carries

514
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,160
 all of his supplies and also has his helicopter pad.

515
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,160
 Wow.

516
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,800
 Yachts in waiting is a thing that is mad, and the biggest super yachts have these other

517
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,000
 yachts that follow them around, which I guess this is one of, and they have everything right.

518
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,040
 They have additional accommodation for the slightly less-favoured guests.

519
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,920
 The crew will stay on them, and they also contain all the toys.

520
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,400
 Now, if you're ever invited onto a yacht, I just think this is going to help you out

521
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
 in terms of terminology.

522
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,400
 Do you know what the toys are?

523
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
 Of course.

524
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
 Yeah.

525
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
 Of course.

526
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
 Grow up on them.

527
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
 No, they're jet skis and stuff like that, right?

528
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
 Yeah.

529
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 According to the article.

530
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
 But the large rubber ducks.

531
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,400
 Yeah.

532
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,400
 Exactly.

533
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,400
 Oh, really?

534
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
 Oh, right.

535
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
 Sorry, yeah, yeah.

536
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,400
 The jet skis, banana boats, that's, I thought, I thought there was, you know, they refer to

537
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 as the toys are kept in here.

538
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,400
 All the entertainment.

539
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
 They're massive as well, aren't they?

540
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 Yeah.

541
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,280
 They are bigger than your average boat, and this is the thing trawling behind.

542
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,520
 Tits apparently had two trawling behind it.

543
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,920
 They were supposedly called Nipple One and Nipple Two, but, yeah, it's wild.

544
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
 You can't just buy a yacht.

545
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,320
 You have to buy the follow-up yachts to carry all the stuff for your yacht.

546
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
 It's so annoying.

547
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,520
 It's like getting an app, like a game app, and then you have to pay for all the, I mean,

548
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
 I don't do this.

549
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
 I don't quite know how it works, but you have to pay for it.

550
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
 I think that's pretty clear.

551
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
 Yeah.

552
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,720
 But it's like, I think it's all like, once a yacht salesman to see that you can afford

553
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,920
 a yacht, they probably think, "Well, we could probably sell this guy another yacht."

554
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,040
 This is, again, slightly old-fashioned, like sailing yachts, you know, not super yachts

555
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,720
 or mega yachts, just old-school, nice yachts.

556
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,080
 There is a yacht club, which has been going since 1984, called the Southwest Chingles

557
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,240
 Yacht Club.

558
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,240
 It is very exclusive.

559
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,760
 It's invitation-only, founded by a yachtsman called David Latchford, and it is for people

560
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,600
 who have massively screwed up sailing their ships or yachts.

561
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 Right.

562
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 So he pranked a boy.

563
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
 He won't.

564
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 What?

565
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
 A B-U-O-Y.

566
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
 A boy.

567
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,600
 Boy.

568
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
 Boy.

569
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 Boy.

570
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
 Boy.

571
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
 Boy.

572
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
 Boy.

573
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,600
 You have to say it in a New Jersey accent.

574
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
 A boy.

575
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,480
 He pranked, he pranked a boy and he, it's very embarrassing, it's broad daylight.

576
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,200
 You're not meant to bump into the boys.

577
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,160
 And so he did that and he saw, "Oh, I found this club."

578
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,720
 And he has incredibly eminent people who are now members of the club.

579
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,760
 Like, there was the commander of a Royal Navy submarine who hit a rock in Scotland in

580
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
 clear daylight, which is a big no-no.

581
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,920
 A Royal Navy commander who hit London Bridge.

582
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
 Yikes.

583
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
 Oh, really bad.

584
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,160
 And it also has some genuine sort of yachting heroes, like there's a guy called Tony Bullymour

585
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,040
 who was his yacht capsized when he was on, I think, a yachting race across the oceans.

586
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,840
 And he spent four days under his own yacht in an air pocket.

587
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
 Four days?

588
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,840
 Four days.

589
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,120
 And then he was rescued and he survived.

590
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
 Wow.

591
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
 And he was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

592
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
 What kind of luxury stuff did he have under there?

593
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,040
 It was like he had the full dining table and a gym that he could exercise on.

594
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,040
 Again, sailing yacht.

595
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,040
 Very different.

596
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,040
 Very different thing.

597
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
 Yeah, yeah.

598
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,800
 Crew ships are like yachts that poor people can afford to go on, like me.

599
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
 Yep.

600
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,480
 The biggest crew ship was unveiled by the Royal Caribbean this year.

601
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,040
 It was called the Icon of the Seas.

602
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:20,160
 It can carry 7,600 passengers and 2,350 crew members.

603
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,720
 That's the same as the population of Sirencesta in Roman times.

604
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,600
 Thank you so much for that vital context.

605
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,440
 Its gross tonnage is 250,000 tonnes, which is the same as all the cars in Surrey that

606
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:40,160
 is Ules compliant.

607
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,040
 And it's 360 metres long, which is the same as the length of the furthest golf shot at

608
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,440
 the 2023 World Long Drive Championships.

609
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,920
 So just so you know exactly.

610
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
 Thanks, James.

611
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
 Yeah.

612
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
 Yeah, yeah.

613
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
 We're going to have to move on in a second, guys.

614
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 Actually, just on Beasles's yacht, James mentioned earlier, when he first had it made, because

615
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:06,080
 a lot of these yachts have been made quite recently.

616
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 It's called the Coru, I think, and it was made in the Netherlands near Rotterdam.

617
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,960
 And to leave the place where it was being made, he had to get through the Icon of the Seas

618
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,160
 and Bridge, and that was too low for his yacht, which was going to be the tallest boat in

619
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
 the world to get past.

620
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,920
 So he said, "Could I dismantle the bridge?"

621
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,280
 Now this bridge was built in 1927, it's a heritage site, it's a very historic building.

622
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,240
 Obviously the people of Rotterdam said, "Absolutely not, sod off, mate."

623
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
 And so he was trapped.

624
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,560
 So there was a period where Jeff Beasles had this gigantic soupy yacht stuck in a little

625
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,960
 kind of harbor somewhere in London, the Netherlands, and then he just realised he could take the

626
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
 mast down.

627
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
 Right.

628
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:56,920
 That's that brilliant business acumen that's got him where he is today.

629
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,600
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact, and my fact this week is that

630
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:08,440
 the reason that the band Ace of Bass became successful is because a cassette of their

631
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,560
 music got stuck in a producer's car, and after two weeks of having nothing else to

632
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:19,120
 listen to, he went from hating it to liking it.

633
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,720
 And he was like, "It's a sign!"

634
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
 I saw the sign, yes.

635
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,000
 Now it's one of their songs.

636
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,560
 That's one of their songs.

637
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,160
 I had to play Ace of Bass to Andy backstage here.

638
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
 You hadn't heard it before.

639
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,480
 No, and you were playing me The Biggie, weren't you?

640
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
 I was.

641
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
 I was playing him The Biggie.

642
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
 I'm having another baby?

643
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,880
 No, I want you to have another baby.

644
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,440
 She wants another baby.

645
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
 What is it?

646
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,080
 All she wants is a baby.

647
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,120
 She wants a baby for him.

648
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,400
 All that she wants is another baby.

649
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 Another baby?

650
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,920
 I haven't had a say.

651
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,440
 She's got six already.

652
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
 Do they specify the song, how many babies she already has?

653
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 We don't know.

654
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,920
 I don't think anyone's listened to the lyrics ever of any of their songs.

655
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
 But listen, this is a...

656
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,520
 Do you mean either of their songs?

657
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,120
 Well, there's also Don't Turn Around.

658
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,200
 Which I imagine if he played that in his cassette and he had his GPS on and they were going,

659
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
 "Please turn around."

660
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,680
 And the song's going, "Don't turn around, please turn around, don't turn around."

661
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,440
 No one's made any Ace of Bass jokes for about 30 years.

662
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
 Yeah, yeah.

663
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
 We've got to dust them off.

664
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,960
 And look, we joke about it, but I remember being a 12-year-old kid, absolutely loved.

665
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,400
 I remember sitting on my buddy's yacht, just going, "Fang that tune."

666
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,040
 It was, that was a big cassette back in the day.

667
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,840
 And it's not just me who liked it.

668
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,520
 It was the best-selling album of 1994.

669
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,720
 One of the most successful debut albums of all time.

670
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:52,520
 And it was all because this producer, Dennis Pop, he was a 28-year-old pop producer living

671
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,960
 in Sweden.

672
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,240
 And he got given this tape and they were like, "Please listen to it."

673
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
 He put it in his car.

674
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,320
 And as I said, he went to eject it when he got home.

675
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
 Really hating it.

676
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
 Thought this was terrible.

677
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
 And it just wouldn't come out.

678
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
 It wouldn't come out.

679
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,280
 And by weird coincidence, his radio was broken at the same time.

680
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,160
 So he had nothing else to listen to.

681
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,040
 And every day, he would pick up a mate of his who was also in the music business.

682
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,720
 And as a joke, they would just listen to it on the way to work, just mocking it.

683
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,200
 Just go, "God damn it, this is so bad."

684
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,200
 And then as the weeks went on, he was like, "Hang on, there's a bit of a hook there."

685
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,560
 And by the end of the two weeks, he went, "This is a hit."

686
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,400
 And the song was called "Mr. Ace," which is then retitled to all that she wants.

687
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,000
 So that was the song.

688
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,600
 I think they were already famous-ish, weren't they?

689
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,560
 They'd had a number two hit in Denmark.

690
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,520
 So they were pretty big too.

691
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,520
 They were kind of big.

692
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,160
 But then he was the one who made them so big, they were massive in America.

693
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,000
 They had a number one album in America, which no Swedish band had ever had, including ABBA.

694
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Yeah.

695
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,240
 And this is all thanks to this guy, Dennis Pop.

696
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
 Dennis.

697
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
 Dennis Pop.

698
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
 With a Z at the end.

699
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
 That's why we're saying it weird.

700
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
 Yeah.

701
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,240
 And I know him as the other half of the production team.

702
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,440
 He worked with Max Martin, who is, I believe, a very famous music producer, who made everything

703
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,120
 from baby one more time through to "Shake It Off" and beyond, and they have this amazing

704
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,200
 method of recording songs.

705
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,960
 All that she wants is another baby and baby one more time.

706
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,040
 Is that also about wanting another baby?

707
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,480
 And weirdly, so is "Shake It Off."

708
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
 Yeah.

709
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
 Oh my God.

710
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,040
 It wasn't meant to be rude, but it's become rude.

711
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,680
 And so Max Martin, who incidentally started off on the French horn, which is interesting.

712
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,680
 That's interesting.

713
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
 A bit of information.

714
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,240
 Dennis Pop, by the way, couldn't play any instruments.

715
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
 Really?

716
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,080
 No, he started taking the recorder when he was a child, but gave up after three attempts,

717
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 because he thought musical instruments were boring.

718
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,200
 But you don't have to play musical instruments to make pop songs.

719
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 You do not.

720
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,360
 He is, as you say, he made those hits.

721
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,520
 But really, if you look at the list, every single catchy, slightly trashy song that you're

722
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,720
 a bit embarrassed that you love from the last 30 years is basically written by Max Martin.

723
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,980
 It's so weird, like Maroon 5, Backstreet Boys 5, Pink, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Ariana Grande,

724
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,960
 name anyone with catchy songs.

725
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,000
 They were all Taylor Swift.

726
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Taylor Swift.

727
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 No.

728
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 He's written for Taylor Swift.

729
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,560
 I'm so sorry to say it.

730
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
 Hechler in the audience.

731
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,000
 Can someone get Kea Star Morale up here, please?

732
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,760
 It is crazy.

733
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
 It is crazy.

734
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,480
 Also, they're a band of siblings, so three of them were related to each other.

735
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
 Ace of Bays.

736
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
 Sorry, jumping back to Ace of Bays.

737
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,480
 Yeah, so you had Jonas, you had Lynn, and you had Jenny, and then they had a cousin,

738
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
 Ulf.

739
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
 But they were siblings.

740
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,680
 They were like the Jonas brothers.

741
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:55,800
 Actually, like literally, there was a Jonas brother in the band itself.

742
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:01,760
 And then the one person who wasn't a brother or sister was Nazi, I think, wasn't he?

743
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,760
 He wasn't a Nazi.

744
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,160
 Well, what was his yacht called?

745
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,240
 He was called Ulf Eppurg, and he, as a child, had been a skinhead.

746
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
 Or not a child.

747
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
 It's a teenager.

748
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,040
 I mean, old children are right at the beginning of skinheads.

749
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,200
 "Oh, we've given birth to a Nazi!"

750
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,680
 Oh, my God, yeah, as a teenager, he was a skinhead, and he later said that he regretted

751
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,800
 it and that actually Ace of Bays is supposed to be inclusive and lovely and everything.

752
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,440
 Well, all she wants is another baby.

753
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,040
 It does sound like it's the Kinderkirche Kuche model of pro-Aryan family structure.

754
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,800
 So, anyway...

755
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,040
 I won't be a part of this conspiracy theory.

756
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,240
 I know we're talking about Dennis Poppin music production, but just Dan, as you mentioned,

757
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
 family bands.

758
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
 Yeah.

759
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:59,960
 So I was reading the list of music considered the worst on Wikipedia, which is a real article,

760
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
 very good.

761
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,520
 And it contains this band called The Shags.

762
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,200
 Oh, yeah, The Shags.

763
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,640
 So, 1969 album, I think it was the debut called Philosophy of the World, they were a band

764
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,360
 of three sisters, right?

765
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,120
 And what marked them out as unusual in the music world is that they had no interest

766
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:25,320
 in being in a band, but their father's mother was a fortune teller and had told her son,

767
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:28,720
 their dad, "You will have some daughters," and they were going to form the greatest music

768
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,200
 group on the planet's history.

769
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 Wow.

770
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,480
 And their dad basically insisted they become musicians off the back of it, and they were

771
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
 not good.

772
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
 Really?

773
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,000
 They apparently composed, I'm quoting here, "bizarre songs with untuned guitars, erratic

774
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,720
 time signatures, disconnected rhythms, wandering melodies, and rudimentary lyrics about pets."

775
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,400
 They were cool though, they had attitude, they were awesome.

776
00:31:52,400 --> 00:32:00,040
 People who were thought to be shit at first, actually, band origins.

777
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,960
 So where band started, Fleetwood Mac, similar kind of area to Ace of Base, did we say?

778
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,320
 I'm sure their fans would agree.

779
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
 Okay, cool.

780
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,000
 I'm guessing that they were a band.

781
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Yeah.

782
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,640
 Do you know who they're named after, Fleetwood Mac?

783
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
 Yes, about, yeah.

784
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,520
 Well, they're named after two of the members, so if you know them, you'll know, Mick Fleetwood

785
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,720
 and John McVeigh.

786
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,960
 But McVeigh, the Mac, wasn't in the band when they started.

787
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,120
 They basically named it Fleetwood Mac to lure him into the band.

788
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
 No.

789
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,360
 So it was started by Peter Green as the other one, Peter Green and Fleetwood formed this

790
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,000
 band, and they had been in a band with McVeigh, and McVeigh was like, "I like the old band,

791
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,840
 it's regular income, I'm staying here," and they called it Fleetwood Mac in order to persuade

792
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,840
 him.

793
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,840
 That's amazing.

794
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,840
 They named a band after you now, mate.

795
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
 No, that is emotional, blackmail, I would say.

796
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,840
 That's good.

797
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,840
 Very clever.

798
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
 Yeah.

799
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,600
 Simon and Garfield Cole weren't originally called Simon and Garfield Cole, were they,

800
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
 the band?

801
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 Really?

802
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
 No.

803
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,200
 They didn't like their names, and so they changed their name to John Landis and Tom

804
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,840
 Graff and called themselves Tom and Jerry, and Paul Simon changed his name to John Landis

805
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,600
 because it was a girl that he had a crush on, was called Landis, and now Garfield Cole

806
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,520
 called himself Tom Graff because he really liked Graffs.

807
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
 Wow.

808
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
 Wow.

809
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
 Nothing is...

810
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
 Really?

811
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
 Yeah.

812
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:23,800
 He used to do, like, he used to do, like, Graffs of how many records people were selling and

813
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
 stuff like that.

814
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,400
 Do you know the band Joanna Gruesome?

815
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
 No.

816
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,640
 They're pretty obscure, but I do love the way they found each other as bandmates.

817
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,640
 They were all sent to the same anger management course.

818
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
 Oh, wow.

819
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
 How good is that?

820
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
 Yeah.

821
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
 They were incredibly angry teenagers.

822
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,160
 They were at school, and they all got sent there.

823
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,160
 Hi, everybody.

824
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
 Andy here.

825
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,280
 What a great fact about Joanna Gruesome that just was, right?

826
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,120
 Well, there's only one problem, which is that it turns out it actually wasn't true.

827
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,400
 There was someone in the audience at this gig who sent us an email.

828
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,640
 He's called George Ford, and he wrote, "Hi, I was at your show on the 23rd of October,

829
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,400
 but the Joanna Gruesome fact of the band forming an anger management class is not correct.

830
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,200
 They made this up for an interview.

831
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,520
 This was because they had no original formation, apart from just being friends.

832
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,200
 My source is that the drummer was my design technology technician when I was at Heathside

833
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,360
 School in Weybridge."

834
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,360
 So that's from George.

835
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,720
 So sorry, that is not true.

836
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,900
 It's not true at all, and we thought we could either snip it out or record a bit of extra

837
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,040
 bonus information, just a little bit of how the sausage gets made.

838
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
 Okay, back to the show.

839
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
 Cheers.

840
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
 Bye.

841
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
 Pet Shop Boys.

842
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
 How did they meet?

843
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 Is it in a pet shop?

844
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
 It was at an electronics shop.

845
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,040
 Really?

846
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
 Harry Styles' bandmate Mitch.

847
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,840
 Do you know how Harry Styles found Mitch?

848
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
 In an advert?

849
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
 They're usually in an advert?

850
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
 In a pizza shop.

851
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,840
 A pizza shop, really?

852
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,640
 They just met at a pizza shop.

853
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,840
 Was he, hang on, was he like a musician, or was he making?

854
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,840
 He probably is a musician.

855
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,840
 Okay.

856
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,240
 He wasn't making him a pizza, and Harry Styles looked at the way he made pizza and went,

857
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,920
 "Do you know what those sounds would be great at?

858
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,920
 Playing guitar."

859
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,160
 When you finished arranging the pepperoni on that, coming to range, some great new songs.

860
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
 My tunes.

861
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
 Yeah.

862
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,160
 I don't know about music.

863
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,760
 It's becoming increasingly clear that none of us does.

864
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
 I know.

865
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,480
 Actually, there's one more Swedish band, which I think I'd heard of.

866
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,400
 So, obviously, we've got Abo, we've got AcerBase, and The Hives, I think, a moderately famous

867
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
 Swedish band.

868
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,560
 They sung, I hate to say, I told you so, and do you know who all their songs are written

869
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
 by?

870
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,120
 I thought they wrote them themselves.

871
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
 Well, they did not.

872
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,200
 They're all written by someone called Randy Fitzsimmons, and that's the reason they exist

873
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,800
 is because they once got a letter in the post from this Randy Fitzsimmons telling them to

874
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,440
 meet up in a certain place and form a band saying, "You'll be massive if you do this."

875
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,520
 This is in 1993, and he said, "I've got all these tunes in nine for you," and he started

876
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,640
 writing them songs, and he's written them songs ever since, and even up until very recently,

877
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,880
 all the songs were credited to Randy Fitzsimmons, who wrote them.

878
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,520
 No one knows who this person is.

879
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,840
 I think their latest album is called The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons, which is, and all the

880
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,440
 music on that was composed by Chip, Montgomery, and Wilbur Fitzsimmons.

881
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,960
 Wait, what's going on?

882
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
 This is bullshit.

883
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
 Is it?

884
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,320
 Did they make him up?

885
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,360
 I think they made him up, yeah, but they've never admitted they made him up.

886
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,760
 It's possible that Randy Fitzsimmons is just a great music writer.

887
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,160
 Have you got any real facts?

888
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 Fake yachts?

889
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
 Fake songwriters?

890
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,640
 We've got a lot of stuff about how bands started.

891
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,920
 I thought I'd look at what happened after they left.

892
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,760
 So these are people who were kind of big when I was younger, the cheeky girls.

893
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,360
 They're now both working as second-hand car dealers.

894
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
 Get out.

895
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,360
 Yeah.

896
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:47,200
 One of them works in a Hyundai dealership in York, and the other one works in Lincolnshire.

897
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
 What kind of dealership?

898
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,840
 I didn't write it down.

899
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,600
 I think she might have got her sister the job, so I think it might also be Hyundai.

900
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
 Well, that would make sense, yeah?

901
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,560
 Yeah, a bit cheeky.

902
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,880
 Lisa from Steps is now a head teacher at a school in Dubai, and Abs from Five went on

903
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,840
 to become a farmer, but then in 2021 he said, "The animals just all died."

904
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:12,840
 They all meant to.

905
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,640
 When you were a farmer, the plants weren't growing anymore.

906
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,600
 I'm a rubbish farmer, so I'm back in London.

907
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,920
 Because you're so right, Anna, like, the animals all died, could be the best farmer

908
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
 in the world.

909
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,720
 The animals all died on time and under budget, and they've become sausages.

910
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,920
 I think one of the favourite facts of our colleague Ann is about the origin, talking

911
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,600
 of song origins, of the Hansen song Mbop, or what it means, and I just, I really enjoyed

912
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,200
 an interview with Zach Hansen, who everyone will remember, who said, "It's the most misunderstood

913
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,120
 successful song of all time."

914
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
 And he said...

915
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,100
 Is it about someone having another baby?

916
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,040
 And that's the sound it makes.

917
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,240
 Was that an impression of a woman in labour?

918
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,800
 I've not been at many births, but I go there, simple and relaxed affairs, I don't

919
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,360
 see it as a small...

920
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,920
 Makes sense, you're asked away outside.

921
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,240
 That's not what it's about.

922
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,800
 Do people know what it means, Mbop?

923
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,240
 Because it just always makes me laugh.

924
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,360
 It represents a frame of time, and it's about how quickly time gets away from you, your

925
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,440
 life will disappear before you know it.

926
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,960
 In an Mbop, it's gone.

927
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,920
 Oh, that's deep.

928
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,440
 It's so deep.

929
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,760
 It's the deepest song you've ever heard without knowing it.

930
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
 That's incredible.

931
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
 It's really funny.

932
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,120
 I still can't get over abs.

933
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,120
 That's insane.

934
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:57,200
 He just decimated this whole farm, and then went back to London.

935
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,920
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

936
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:10,320
 OK, my fact this week is that being visited by a clown can help you get pregnant.

937
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,760
 This gives you your answer to how she gets another baby.

938
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,480
 That's not the first.

939
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,040
 Look, what does the clown have to do?

940
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:24,760
 Well, it could be one sexy clown, he just goes around having sex with people, but no,

941
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,040
 they just need to clown around.

942
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,760
 It sounds sexy when you say clown around, it's never sounded sexy before.

943
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,600
 It didn't sound sexy to me, just to me.

944
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,480
 So this is from Benefits of Medical Clowning, a summary of the research by Amy J. Stephson.

945
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,800
 She references a 2011 study by S. Friedler, and they looked at 219 patients, 110 of whom

946
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,400
 interacted with medical clowns, 109 who didn't, and the pregnancy rate in the clown group

947
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:05,120
 was 36.4% compared to 20.2% in the control group, and that gave the clown group twice

948
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
 the odds of pregnancy.

949
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,120
 So it was significant.

950
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,620
 That's mega.

951
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,320
 And when they interacted with them, were they just doing clown stuff, like nose honking

952
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,680
 and car stuffing and what have you, that's it?

953
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,760
 Now it does sound sexy, I must say.

954
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:27,600
 How many clowns can you fit in this phone box?

955
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,920
 They were just doing clowny stuff, and like you say it like, ah, ah, ah, ah, that kind

956
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,920
 of thing.

957
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,440
 On the left one, or the right one, or...

958
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,400
 It's because I just didn't know that they were such an established thing, medical clowns,

959
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
 you say it.

960
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
 They really are.

961
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,960
 But medical clowns are brought in, largely for children, right?

962
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,240
 Hippocrates had clowns in ancient Greece, yeah, he had his own hospital on the island

963
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,000
 of Kos, and he had constant troops of players and clowns who would come and play to the

964
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,040
 people to keep them happy.

965
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,960
 So in this study by S. Friedler, they said we are very surprised by the results, and

966
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,600
 frankly, we can't explain it, but one theory that they had was maybe that stress reduction

967
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,520
 might improve fertility, so you're a bit less stressed.

968
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,080
 They are extremely beneficial in other ways, and it is largely with children that they're

969
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,760
 used, understandably, but there was a study that followed 51 children with pneumonia who

970
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,080
 got, as well as getting ordinary treatment, got 15-minute visits from a medical clown

971
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,960
 twice a day, and then it had the same number of children who didn't get the visits but

972
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,920
 still had the treatment, and it was pretty much like half the length of time that the

973
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
 ones who were visited by the clown stayed in hospital.

974
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:44,600
 I know that sounds like they just said please get me out of here, but they were discharged

975
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,800
 sensibly.

976
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,280
 They needed only two days of antibiotics compared to three days for those who hadn't had the

977
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,480
 clown, so they have an amazing impact.

978
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,040
 They also use them during pre-operative anesthesia, so as you're going down, you'll turn and

979
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,160
 they'll just be a clown staring at you, and apparently that reduces stress and anxiety

980
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,880
 as opposed to making you going, "Wait, hang on one moment!"

981
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,840
 So I read that down, but I read a doctor saying that in some minor surgeries a clown replaces

982
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,480
 general anesthesia, which I think cannot be correct.

983
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,440
 Can you imagine if a kid's cut their finger and you need to give them two stitches, maybe

984
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,640
 it's a look at the clown?

985
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,280
 Why are you giving them general anesthesia for two stitches?

986
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,160
 It raises more questions than an answer, you know, and what's the one disease a clown

987
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
 cannot help?

988
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,760
 Something to do with the nose, alcoholism, because it's all in the nose, alcoholism,

989
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,760
 it just gets better.

990
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,760
 It's like chronic laughter.

991
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:42,760
 Bingo.

992
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,760
 Is it?

993
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,760
 Oh!

994
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,360
 This was a patient who lived in Hawaii and he had suffered uncontrollable lifelong laughter.

995
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,960
 He was 40, and from the age of eight he'd just been laughing, pretty much non-stop.

996
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,320
 Oh my God, did something happen when he was eight?

997
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,440
 That was just like the funniest thing that ever happened.

998
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,440
 No.

999
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,960
 What it is, is he contracted a small non-cancerous tumour on his brain.

1000
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,680
 That's almost the opposite of funny.

1001
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,680
 It's the opposite of funny.

1002
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
 Yeah.

1003
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,640
 Can we say he went to see a Jimmy Carr?

1004
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,560
 Maybe just...

1005
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:20,080
 No, it's a thing called a 'gelastic seizure', and 'gelastic' is the word for 'related

1006
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,080
 to laughter'.

1007
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,200
 Because I think 'ageelastic' means you can't laugh, right?

1008
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,640
 Exactly, and this guy was very 'gelastic' indeed, and it turns out it was due to a hypothalamic

1009
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,160
 haematoma, which is not funny, but was operable and so could be cured, but not by a clown.

1010
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
 That's nice.

1011
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,960
 But when he'd been cured, did he never laugh again?

1012
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,960
 Well he just went to see Jimmy Carr, and that sorted him right out.

1013
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,040
 There's a thing in New Zealand whereby, if you're about to be made redundant, you're

1014
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,400
 allowed to bring someone in to be a support friend, and there's a great story about a

1015
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,360
 guy who hired for $200 New Zealand a clown to come in with him, and so as the boss was

1016
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,320
 very sternly trying to tell him that he was no longer going to be employed by the company,

1017
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:09,320
 there was a man in full get-up next to him making balloon animals, and as he was told

1018
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:16,360
 and handed the sheet saying that he was going to be redundant, had the clown go 'ooh no!'

1019
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,680
 doing the fake tears with his hand.

1020
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
 It's so good.

1021
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,280
 I wrote about this guy too, Dad.

1022
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,720
 Josh Thompson is the name of the man.

1023
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,680
 The clown was called Joe.

1024
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,320
 He had to be told to stop a few times the clown, because the squeaking of plastic as he made

1025
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,320
 the balloon animals was too noisy for Josh to be fired.

1026
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,760
 It's just so good.

1027
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,760
 It's so amazing.

1028
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,320
 I don't know, you guys know this about me, but one of my favourite things is whenever

1029
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,640
 a clown is put in a medical situation, so I'm probably the only person who loves the

1030
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:46,640
 movie.

1031
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,640
 What?

1032
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,960
 It's not something that's why we know nothing about it.

1033
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,960
 No, no, no.

1034
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:51,960
 Did you say we probably know this about you?

1035
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,360
 Yeah, you know that MASH is my favourite TV series.

1036
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,120
 Describe Dan in one sense as well.

1037
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,000
 Pat Chathams is one of my favourite movies, despite everyone hating that movie.

1038
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,280
 I absolutely loved it.

1039
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,000
 Pat Chathams is quite an interesting character.

1040
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,160
 He's still alive, and he's quite alternative.

1041
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,840
 I watched a YouTube video of him talking about the things he believes will cure stuff, so

1042
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,720
 he doesn't really believe in depression.

1043
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,000
 He says you can avoid...

1044
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,520
 And he has been severely depressed in his teens, to be fair to him, but he says things

1045
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,200
 like, you can avoid being depressed if you think about things like, what a beautiful

1046
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:34,120
 sunset, or if you take pleasure in stroking a purring cat.

1047
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,360
 To hell with depression, just go out and sing to the world, hug a tree, and follow an ant

1048
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,840
 as it walks across the ground.

1049
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
 There you go.

1050
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,240
 He's an interesting guy.

1051
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,320
 He named his first son Atomic Zagnut.

1052
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,320
 It's very interesting.

1053
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,400
 A lot of doctors do become clowns and they do go out into struggling countries that

1054
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,960
 are going through war and so on.

1055
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,920
 There's one guy, Ping Pong, who's one of the clowns.

1056
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:01,320
 He had a thing where he was going through airport security and he got taken into a room

1057
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,160
 and they opened up his suitcase.

1058
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:08,040
 And basically, they did it because he had 100 confetti cannons and all these ping pong

1059
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,120
 balls and they didn't know what it was when they went through the scan.

1060
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,920
 And according to Ping Pong, the guy went, what are you, some sort of clown?

1061
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,920
 No.

1062
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,160
 Laughter can be dangerous, though, kind of.

1063
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,880
 And there was a meta-analysis of 785 academic studies done by the University of Birmingham

1064
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,680
 and they found that laughter can cause fainting, asthma, headaches, incontinence, dislocated

1065
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,840
 jaw, infectious diseases.

1066
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
 Hang on.

1067
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,800
 That's the first one where I thought, I haven't actually done that.

1068
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,640
 How do you get an infectious disease when you're laughing?

1069
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,360
 Well, if you're laughing so much, your mouth is open, isn't it?

1070
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
 I was joking.

1071
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:48,360
 If you're near some other people.

1072
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,160
 Basically, you're expelling more fine particulates from your mouth.

1073
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,160
 It is very dangerous.

1074
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
 Yeah.

1075
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,040
 And there's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which can rupture your esophagus if you laugh

1076
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
 too much.

1077
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,120
 And that is, that's actually fatal.

1078
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,120
 Wow.

1079
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,120
 Wow.

1080
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,000
 So the rest of this show will be, no more jokes.

1081
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,320
 Do you know who's one of the chief villains for clowns?

1082
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,320
 The chief villains.

1083
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,080
 Oh, one of the chief villains.

1084
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,760
 Is it someone else in the circus?

1085
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,600
 Well, she was in a kind of circus, actually, a few years ago.

1086
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
 Oh, Liz Truss?

1087
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
 Thatcher?

1088
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
 Thatcher.

1089
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
 Margaret Thatcher.

1090
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
 Yeah.

1091
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:31,120
 Do they just hate Thatcher because they love jumping on a bandwagon, squeezing into a car?

1092
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,440
 No, it's that in 1980, the clown's training school was closed due to government cuts,

1093
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,080
 which was thanks to Margaret's pop.

1094
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:43,600
 It wasn't like she said, shut these clowns down.

1095
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,320
 But it was funded by the arts council, and there were some arts council cuts happening

1096
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,320
 at the time.

1097
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,200
 And she got a complaint about it from some children who said, why have you cut the clowns?

1098
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,880
 And she wrote back saying she was sorry that they were upset, but the clowns would continue

1099
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,120
 receiving some kind of public funds.

1100
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:01,800
 P.S., no more milk for you.

1101
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
 Bye.

1102
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,400
 There's a great story I write about Jimmy Hendricks.

1103
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,640
 He was, for his first, I think it was his first tour in the UK, and he went to Liverpool.

1104
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,920
 They did a gig, and they went to a bar afterwards, and the bartender was incredibly suspicious

1105
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,360
 of Jimmy Hendricks as he was walking in, and he went, we don't serve your kind here.

1106
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,360
 And he went, what?

1107
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,760
 And it was a really intense moment, and everyone froze.

1108
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,800
 And the bartender went, read the sign, buddy, and it read, no clowns allowed.

1109
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,000
 And basically, Hendricks' 60s get-up, which was very flamboyant and colorful, and there

1110
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,360
 was a circus up the road.

1111
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:43,960
 The guy thought, wait, if I let you in, all the fucking clowns are going to come in here.

1112
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,480
 I don't want it being overrun.

1113
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,480
 Why?

1114
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,760
 They'd have a sign made, say no clowns.

1115
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,760
 No clowns allowed.

1116
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,840
 How much clown-related trouble have they had?

1117
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:55,640
 I think something had happened there, hadn't it, a few days earlier.

1118
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
 Yeah.

1119
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:58,520
 Do you know where the word clown comes from?

1120
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,520
 Oh, no.

1121
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:00,520
 Clown.

1122
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,520
 No.

1123
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,200
 It's probably from the Danish klunt.

1124
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,760
 Come on, guys, which means log or block, and then it meant like a blockhead, and then it

1125
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,880
 meant like a silly person.

1126
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,280
 And some other words for clown in the Oxford English Dictionary.

1127
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:26,120
 Bagpudding, clod hopper, cluster fist, lobcock, and Mary Andrew.

1128
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
 Oh!

1129
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
 Mary Andrew.

1130
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:29,120
 Mary Andrew.

1131
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,400
 Sometimes I feel like the OED doesn't have its finger on the pulse.

1132
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,080
 Do you ever get that?

1133
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,400
 This fact was about getting pregnant, so I have a loosely related getting pregnant fact

1134
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:44,720
 that I happened upon this week, which is that everyone knows the 12 labours of Hercules,

1135
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,720
 right?

1136
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,720
 I mean, you don't have to recite them now.

1137
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,720
 I'm not going to test anyone.

1138
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:51,840
 But like the clean out the stables and bring back the dog with three heads, Cerberus, and

1139
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
 there's a river to--

1140
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
 Exactly.

1141
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
 Something about a lion, maybe.

1142
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
 Kill the lion.

1143
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
 Exactly.

1144
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
 Kill the lion.

1145
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
 Do all the big stuff.

1146
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,280
 So 12 labours of Hercules, these big things you have to do.

1147
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,000
 Who knows about the 13th labour of Hercules?

1148
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
 No.

1149
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,720
 Well, this was written about the same time, and his 13th labour was to impregnate 50 women

1150
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,720
 in one night.

1151
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,720
 Whoa!

1152
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,120
 I'm going to need a lot of clowns.

1153
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
 Yeah.

1154
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:22,120
 That's 50 additional labours of Hercules, right?

1155
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,960
 I think they counted as one 50th of a labour each.

1156
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
 No, no, it's a labour.

1157
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
 Is that a labour?

1158
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,960
 Because you'd go into labour when you're--

1159
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
 Sorry.

1160
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960
 No, there's a pun.

1161
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
 No.

1162
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,960
 No.

1163
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:41,960
 That is it.

1164
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
 That is it.

1165
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,960
 That is all of our facts.

1166
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:44,960
 Thank you so much.

1167
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,720
 We'll be back again next week with another episode, but very quickly, Drury Lane.

1168
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,800
 You were awesome.

1169
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,800
 Thank you for having us.

1170
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,800
 That was magical.

1171
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,440
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

1172
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,440
 We'll see you then.

1173
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,440
 Goodbye!

1174
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,440
 Bye!

1175
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,440
 Bye!

1176
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,440
 Bye!

1177
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,440
 Bye!

1178
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:03,440
 Bye!

1179
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,440
 Bye!

1180
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:04,440
 Bye!

1181
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
 Bye!

1182
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:05,440
 Bye!

1183
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
 Bye!

1184
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,020
 (upbeat music)

1185
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,600
 (upbeat music)
