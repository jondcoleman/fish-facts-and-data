00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 [MUSIC]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:19.460
 >> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.080
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Drury Lane.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.100
 >> [APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.560
 >> My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.040
 And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.060
 from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.760
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.160
 >> My fact is, as well as the world famous White Cliffs of Dover,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.560
 Britain is home to the world unknown White Cliffs of Croydon.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.640
 >> [LAUGH] >> For listeners at home,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 we're looking at a majestic, huge set of glorious White Cliffs.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.280
 >> I mean, in fairness, they are White Cliffs, aren't they?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 There's no doubt about that.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.480
 >> Are they White Cliffs or are they a disused quarry?

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.200
 It doesn't matter.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 >> [LAUGH]

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.680
 >> Right, is that what they are?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.760
 >> They are the White Cliffs of Croydon.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a bit of, is there anyone in tonight from Croydon?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.320
 >> Yeah, wow.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.840
 >> Excellent.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.160
 >> Were you familiar with the White Cliffs of Croydon?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.720
 >> No, it's mixed results.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.280
 >> Croydon doesn't even know.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 >> Yeah, we weren't sure if it was a thing, and it turns out Andy,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.400
 you sort of helped to coin it, I think.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.960
 >> Well, I definitely didn't coin it.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 This is in a bit, Croydon is a bit of London, we should say.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.640
 And in Croydon, there is a bit called Riddles Down,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.480
 which is home to a disused truck quarry.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.920
 And if you look at it from the right angle,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640
 it looks exactly like the White Cliffs of Dover.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 >> From, sorry, from a right angle, or from-

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.160
 >> From, and if you look at it at right angles.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.200
 >> Right. >> Which is the right angle.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 >> So this, and in fact, quite a lot of my research,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.520
 it comes from a new book, which is called Croydonopolis,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 by Will Noble, and it is fantastic.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.120
 I cannot recommend it enough.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.760
 If you only read one book about Croydon this year, make it.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 Croydonopolis, Croydon gets a really bad rap

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.800
 for anyone listening overseas.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.840
 >> It's a shit hole.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.680
 >> Well.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.280
 >> But it is, yeah, for international listeners,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.280
 it is the punchline to jokes.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.480
 It's what is that place, you know?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120
 It's like Francis Belgium.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.960
 >> Yeah.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.640
 >> So, and famously, just people hate it.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 I think most famously, David Bowie hated it, didn't he?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.120
 >> Definitely.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.560
 >> And yeah, sorry, Dan, and you love David Bowie,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.920
 and you love Croydon, apparently.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.240
 >> Yeah, there's, what do I do?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 >> This is painful.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.360
 He said, he literally said Croydon wasn't insult to him.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.200
 He would say it's so fucking Croydon, to mean, well.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.440
 He said it's the most derogatory thing

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.680
 you can say about something.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 >> It is, and I try to, I try to look for good stuff

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.600
 in the news about Croydon, and I mean, the headlines

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.240
 that come up do not do it any favors.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.280
 One here was, "Teenager loses finger at Croydon rave,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.160
 "but continues dancing because the bass was hard."

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.080
 >> That's good.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.800
 >> That's, yeah, I guess so.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.080
 Yeah, showing, showing, you know, that's something.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.920
 >> That's a good news story.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.040
 >> How about this one, "Croydon hospital leaves human teeth

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.720
 "embedded in man's leg after bizarre iPad trampoline incident."

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.520
 (laughing)

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.960
 >> Did you read any more into the article then?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.640
 >> No, I thought it was better just leaving that as is.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.000
 >> Well, they do, they have a fun palace,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.840
 which has 60 trampolines.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.680
 >> Do they?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.340
 >> I believe, yeah, yeah, they do.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.080
 So, Henry VIII said it was a place

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.200
 that he could never be without sickness,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200
 and there's a store--

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.480
 >> Did he mean sick hasn't good?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.120
 >> No, I don't think he did.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.600
 I think that would be very charitable.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.680
 >> Was one of his wives from there?

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.120
 >> Catherine of Croydon.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.960
 (laughing)

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.040
 >> She was the fourth Catherine

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.160
 who never gets any credit.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.000
 No, the first one, who was she?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.840
 Catherine of Aragon.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.680
 >> Aragon?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.760
 >> I think he supposedly proposed

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.160
 to Catherine of Aragon, it was one of the Catharines,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.940
 anyway, one of the odds, 50/50.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.280
 (laughing)

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.200
 >> The first beheaded died,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.080
 the first beheaded got some teeth stuck in their leg

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.520
 after an iPad accident.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.040
 (laughing)

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.560
 >> But there is a huge and story history of Croydon,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.620
 it turns out, and actually we've all been very unfair to it.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.920
 So, for example, it used to be the summer residence

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.400
 of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.240
 >> Is that right?

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.720
 >> Yeah, I mean, some time ago.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.800
 >> I thought the summer residence was a bucolic beach,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.120
 your mountainous place you went to relax,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.160
 not a brutalist gray tower block place.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.600
 >> Well, this is all before all the tower blocks

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.560
 and the car parks and things.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.880
 So, the name might mean valley

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.240
 where the wild saffron grows.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.080
 >> Right.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.000
 >> Crocadine, crocadine.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.640
 It's a nice, it sounds, it sounds lovely.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.880
 >> I think it used to be the place

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.960
 where all celebrities wanted to be seen, right?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.800
 >> What periods?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.200
 >> So, we're talking early 20th century,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.080
 Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford,

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.000
 Babe Ruth, JFK, Rita Hayworth,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.680
 all these people wanted to be seen in Croydon.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.200
 And that's because Croydon was where their airport was,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.480
 main airport in London.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.040
 And they weren't really doing airports

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.320
 in America at the time.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.680
 And planes are really cool and trendy and new.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.120
 So, everyone wanted to go there

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 and be seen with the airplanes.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.240
 >> Also, the base is hard.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.280
 (audience laughing)

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.920
 No, you're right, it was, the aerodrome was a mega,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.240
 and it was until the Second World War,

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.200
 it was basically the, the most,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.800
 like they had 100,000 visitors a year

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.400
 who were just turning up to see the planes.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.160
 >> John Mayday was invented there,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.400
 presumably by a pilot desperately trying to reject him.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.320
 He saw it, looming up ahead.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.160
 >> Mayday, Mayday, and they're going,

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.920
 "What's that, sounds awesome, we should lock that in,

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.200
 "is that like you in trouble?"

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.880
 >> Amy Johnson flew from Croydon

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.520
 when she flew to Australia in 1930.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.720
 And then when she came back,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.120
 she came back to Croydon Airport,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.560
 and 200,000 people greeted her there.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.400
 >> So, sorry, was she, she was the first woman

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680
 to fly a long way?

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.320
 >> To, to Australia.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.840
 >> Okay, okay.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.760
 >> So she came back, and there were 200,000 people there,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.520
 and according to articles at the time,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.640
 at least 12 people were run over

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.480
 by the slow-moving procession,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.800
 but one journalist said they were all quite cheerful

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.760
 as they were carried off to hospital.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.920
 (audience laughing)

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.560
 Probably 'cause they were leaving Croydon.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.160
 (audience laughing)

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.560
 And apparently the Daily Mail paid for all the compensation

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.880
 of anyone who got injured.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.720
 >> Oh, wow.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.560
 >> Hey.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.760
 >> Good old Daily Mail.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.640
 >> I said no one ever.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.080
 (audience laughing)

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.200
 I did a quick hunt for sort of

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.720
 underappreciated white things in Croydon.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.880
 (audience laughing)

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.280
 Arthur Conan Doyle lived in Croydon,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.280
 and he wrote quite a lot of the Sherlock Holmes stories there,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.680
 obviously very, very famous,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.040
 but when he moved there,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.640
 the first thing that he published,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.440
 which was a three-volume book,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.840
 was The White Company,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.320
 which was a historical adventure novel,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.840
 which was massive at the time.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.280
 No one now really knows what that is,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.960
 unless you know Conan Doyle's bibliography really well,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.560
 but it was big in the day, and it kind of disappeared.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.320
 That was published while he lived in Croydon.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.520
 Will Hay, the comedian, in 1932,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.280
 he has noted as having discovered a great white spot

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.680
 on the planet Saturn from his garden in Croydon.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.880
 It was like a big new astronomical discovery.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.600
 Everyone's really excited, not so much anymore.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.160
 It's getting nothing in here.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.000
 (audience laughing)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.760
 And then lastly, C.B. Frye, the great cricketer,

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.000
 and sort of multi-everything person.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.160
 He wasn't his party trick.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.320
 He used to be able to just jump backwards

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.400
 onto a mantelpiece.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.560
 Yeah, that was his party trick.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.160
 He'd just be chatting to you and go, "Whoop,"

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.280
 and then he would be on top of the mantelpiece,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.680
 and he was like, "Party trick."

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.440
 C.B. Frye, lesser-known appreciated white,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.360
 is his mother, Constance White.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.640
 Wow.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.840
 I feel like you-- There's a good crowbars.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.160
 (laughing)

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.520
 The crowbars are strong.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:38.080
 It also has the world's grumpiest woman, Croydon, in it.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.120
 That's it.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.800
 Self-professed world's grumpiest woman.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.000
 This is according to a news article in 2015

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.760
 about a woman who was completely naked

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.240
 aside from a large sash that read,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.400
 "World's grumpiest woman who glued her bum

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.440
 "to the Croydon Debenham store window."

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.360
 (audience laughing)

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.600
 From the inside or from the outside, do we know?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.240
 You'd think it would be too cold outside,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.080
 but she was committed,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.560
 and she was actually wearing fake pubic hair,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.440
 which would have kept her warm.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.000
 So I'm gonna say outside.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.920
 Ah.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.160
 And...

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.400
 Was it a protest?

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.480
 Yes, but it was just a protest about how grumpy she was.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.000
 She just did a long rant about how grumpy she was.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.840
 Oh, really?

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.680
 Yeah.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.440
 But Debenham said, "It's great to hear our customers,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.880
 "like our window displays so much

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.320
 "that they want to be part of it."

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.800
 So it's good that they saw the silver lining.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.640
 It is quite...

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.320
 More recent stories about Croydon have...

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.160
 They've definitely...

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.320
 They're not Archbishop of Canterbury quality stories.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.160
 So one of the most recent stories about Croydon from the BBC

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.840
 is about a homeowner in South London

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.640
 who has complained after Transport for London

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.040
 erected a toilet for bus drivers outside his house.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.880
 He's called Brett Kemp,

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.880
 and he said it was putting off potential buyers

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.840
 because he keeps seeing bus drivers go in and go to the loo.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.680
 And he says...

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.520
 Why don't you put a door on it?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.560
 I think...

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.720
 I think even with a door,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.920
 he says it's not the most appealing thing for potential buyers.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.240
 He says it's nicknamed the turdis.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.680
 To bring it a little bit more high, bro,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.520
 Samuel Coleridge Taylor was born in Croydon.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.640
 Samuel Taylor Coleridge?

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.280
 No, Samuel Coleridge Taylor.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.960
 He was named after Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.160
 Confusingly, there's a piece called Kubla Khan,

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.440
 which was written by Taylor Coleridge and Coleridge Taylor.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.920
 So I said the words are written by Taylor Coleridge,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.920
 and the music is written by Coleridge Taylor.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.920
 Because he was a composer, the classical one, yeah, yeah.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.000
 So he wrote a violin concerto towards the end of his life,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.880
 and he sent the music over to America,

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.000
 so it could be learned before he went there.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.680
 Bad news, he sent it on the Titanic.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.360
 Oh, no.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.360
 Good news, it turned out they'd been mislaid,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.640
 and they hadn't gone on the Titanic after all.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.560
 Bad news.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.080
 This is a roller coaster chase.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.440
 Well, it goes downhill quite quickly.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.240
 Bad news, he died before that discovery was made.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.000
 So it's his sort of undiscovered and then posthumous piece of work.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.320
 Yeah, exactly, and they did play it 100 years after his death.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.880
 That's very cool.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.800
 I'm going to have to move us on in a second.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960
 We haven't even got onto White Cliffs of Dover.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.960
 Why do you need to, when you've got the White Cliffs of Croydon?

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.760
 They used to have an atmospheric railway.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.240
 So do you know what that is?

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.640
 No.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.840
 OK, imagine a railway, but it doesn't operate with boring engines,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.280
 diesel, electricity, whatever.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.360
 It's a vacuum.

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.280
 I don't need to explain an atmospheric railway to any of you.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.880
 You mean like a pneumatic railway?

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.720
 I mean exactly that.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.520
 You mean a pneumatic railway?

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.000
 A pneumatic railway, a vacuum pipe railway, as I call it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.520
 And this was going to be the future of transportation.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.320
 And it was very exciting, it was mid-19th century.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.800
 It was when we hadn't definitely settled on the train.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.520
 The train was looking pretty good, but the atmospheric railway was potential.

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.760
 And it was actually built and it was tried out.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.720
 The only problems where there were, sometimes it would miss the station

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.240
 and it couldn't go backwards so the passengers would have to walk along the tracks.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.520
 Or sometimes male passengers had to get out and give it a little push

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.760
 because it stopped and couldn't get going again.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.800
 And then when it got going again, it just left without you

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.400
 because you couldn't go back on.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.800
 And the third problem was that rats would chew their way in

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.400
 and then they would just fly their way along the tubes and out into the pumping station.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.920
 No, hundreds of rats a day.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.800
 They had to put a sack over the outlet tube just to catch the rats.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.200
 But apart from that, it's great, it's the system.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200
 Wow.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.360
 It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:29.320
 My fact this week is that the world's most expensive super yacht probably doesn't exist.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320
 What?

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.680
 Oh, sounds like a Dan fact, that one, Anna.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.680
 Doesn't it?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.440
 What on earth does that mean?

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.000
 Well, I think it's an extraordinary thing.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.640
 If you Google and all of you go to the world's most expensive super yacht,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.760
 you've got loads and loads of top ten lists of the most expensive yachts in the world.

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.160
 And number one is always this one called History Supreme.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:53.600
 And these are on proper boating websites, they're reliable sources.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.920
 History Supreme is worth $4.8 billion.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.080
 The second on the list is Eclipse, which I think is or was owned by Roman Abramovich,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.080
 which is $1.5 billion.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.280
 So this is three times more than that.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.000
 And it was bought by an anonymous Malaysian businessman.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.440
 It's extremely lavish and it probably doesn't exist.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.200
 According to quite a few people who've looked into it and pointed out things like the photos,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.200
 so it's never been seen in real life by anyone who's told anyone about it.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.640
 And it's quite hard to hide, I think, a super yacht.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.640
 They're not subtle.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.440
 But it could be floating somewhere secret, like private islands for the wealthy.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440
 That's a thing.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440
 You know?

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 That is a thing.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.600
 Well, it also, so a statement was issued by another yacht making company, Bayer Yachts,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.800
 saying that all the photos that were posted on the designer's website when it was designed

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.080
 a few years ago were actually of a completely different yacht that they designed and they

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.400
 just been coloured gold.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.040
 Because one of the things about this yacht amongst the many ridiculous features is that

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.040
 it's covered in solid gold.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.760
 Another thing that's been pointed out is if a boat is covered in solid gold, it's going

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.520
 to struggle to float.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:05.880
 But it's so weird and it's insisted on and the designer sadly passed away now, but he's

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.640
 got a guy called Stuart Hughes known for designing very expensive things, as you can

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.200
 imagine, like iPhones encrusted with diamonds and stuff.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.320
 And yeah, he said, I think the best thing about this super yacht that he said he'd made is

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.840
 a wall feature that's made from a meteor with Tyrannosaurus Rex bones shaved into it.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.800
 He is just making shit up now, isn't he?

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800
 It's mad.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.120
 So what do we think the deal is?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.640
 Is this a tax thing or is it just a joke or what do we know?

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.320
 I think people think it might be one of the world's best pranks, because I don't know

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.680
 how it could be a tax thing.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.400
 I mean, yachts are quite a shady business anyway, right?

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
 Yeah.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.160
 We don't really know the world that exists beyond them.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.760
 We don't know who the owners are.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.120
 It's said that the owner of this one is Malaysia's richest businessman, a guy called Robert

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.120
 Kwok.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.080
 And I cannot just say they are owned by rich people who are often quite powerful as well.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.120
 So I'd just like to say that I believe them all.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120
 Yeah.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.760
 So here's the thing.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.080
 Robert Kwok is 101 years old.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080
 What?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.080
 Yeah, he's 101 years old.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.800
 He turned, I think it was October, November last year, he turned 101.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 I know him.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 No.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 Yeah.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 So, okay.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.000
 Now, do you remember last week on the, so the latest show that went out, as of recording,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.880
 was my parents had a salon and they used to do the hair of Bruce Lee's supposed mistress,

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.040
 Betty Ting, right?

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040
 Yes.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.120
 Another person whose hair they used to do was Robert Kwok.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.120
 No.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.120
 Yes.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.440
 So, as a result, after he got his haircut by my mum, he said, "Hey, you should have a

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.440
 salon in my Shangri-La hotels," which he owned all the Shangri-La hotels in the world.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440
 He's the founder.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.720
 So they set up a salon there.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.880
 So I kind of grew up with Robert Kwok in my life.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:46.080
 Did you ask him, or can you ask him about his yacht?

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.080
 Yeah.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.240
 So I messaged my sister because she's still best friends with his granddaughter.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.160
 And I messaged it just before the show.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.840
 We went to school with each other in Hong Kong.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.680
 I was going to do a humorous straw ball of the audience of, like, who owns a yacht or

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.240
 knows anyone who owns a yacht, because no one does.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.840
 But of course you do.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840
 I don't own a yacht.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840
 Yeah.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.360
 You're best mates with the granddaughter.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.360
 No.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.360
 We know them.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.880
 Anyway, I messaged my sister, but it's, of course, she's in Australia, so we won't

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.640
 hear back for another 12 hours or so.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640
 Oh, come on.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640
 But I've been on his boat.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:16.640
 His yacht?

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640
 Yeah.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.640
 What?

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.640
 A different one.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.640
 A different one.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.640
 It's not that great.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640
 Wow.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.640
 Wow.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.640
 Yeah.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.920
 So I'll say a couple of things about, so Larry Ellison, he's a, he's a squillionaire as

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:31.920
 well.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920
 Oh, yeah.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.960
 He's the founder of Oracle Software, Software Guy.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:38.320
 He bought a yacht in 1999 that was called Isanami.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.360
 And he changed the name after it was pointed out that that name was "I'm a Nazi" backwards.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.360
 In no way.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360
 I know.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
 Was it?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
 Is that what they used to do?

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.360
 You know, like ambulances have a name backwards.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360
 So.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.600
 Have you looked in your review mirror?

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600
 Yeah, yeah.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:16:01.040
 That guy, Larry Ellison, his yacht has someone in a speedboat who follows it around and their

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:08.240
 whole job is to retrieve the basketballs that he throws overboard because he's got a basketball

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 suit.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240
 Because he plays, but it's not just that.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.240
 It's his hobby.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.240
 He throws basketballs overboard.

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240
 To torment a speedboat guy.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240
 He's got hoops.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.680
 He's got a hoop, but he must be really bad at basketball, you would think, because he

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.960
 misses quite often and this guy has to go around and collect all the balls.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.320
 Because basketballs are so expensive that you can't let one go.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.360
 No, I think it's because he cares about the environment.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.360
 Oh, okay.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.360
 Not enough not to have a yacht.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.400
 Because yachts are very, very bad for the environment.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.120
 Have you heard of the Prince of Brunei's one?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.360
 So he had one ages ago, it's now been sold.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:43.880
 Which of your parents was the manicurist to him?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:49.920
 He had one, it's now gone, but when he had it, it was called TITS.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.920
 That was his yacht.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.000
 Is it something in Brunei and?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.440
 It literally just means TITS.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.160
 And we think there's a lot of questions about how the name came about, but they think it

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.160
 must be that.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.000
 Because when a lot of his personal collection was sold, they found a lot of erotic statues.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.560
 He had watches with two figures that would copulate on the hour, so he clearly had a

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.560
 thing for it.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.720
 They must be exhausted.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.720
 Yeah.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.440
 Is that Geoffrey of Brunei?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.720
 Yeah, that's right.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720
 And Bill Clinton.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
 Geoffrey.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.720
 I think he's called Geoffrey.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720
 Geoffrey of Brunei.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
 Geoffrey of Brunei?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:22.720
 Yeah.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720
 Geoffrey of Brunei.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720
 Cool.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720
 The city of Brunei is his name.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.720
 But yeah, Clinton was meant to go on it, but apparently they just said he can't because

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.720
 of the name.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.720
 They're like, we don't need that in our life.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.720
 Right.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.720
 We don't need a Clinton scandal like that.

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.960
 And he has a helipad on it, and his son, who's called Prince Hakim, is a helicopter pilot,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:46.120
 and he flies in a jumpsuit with the name Iceman in a reference to Val Kilmer from Top Gun.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.320
 Well, the backwards Iceman reads, I am a twat.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.320
 Jokes on him.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.320
 Yeah.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.760
 Did you guys hear about these sort of very ancient yachts that were like Roman, Roman

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760
 yachts?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760
 No.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:04.440
 So Caligula had a, the Emperor Caligula had some pleasure barges, basically, which were

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.280
 kind of the ancient world equivalent of yachts.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:12.320
 So the historian Suetonius writes about them, there were 10 banks of oars, which is a lot.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.320
 They were about 240 feet long, they were used mostly for parties, they were kind of stationary.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.240
 I think they were on a lake actually, a lake in Italy.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.960
 Anyway, Emperor Caligula commissioned them, and he only got to enjoy them for a year because

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.160
 he was then stabbed to death by his senators and his own guards and everyone else.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:35.880
 But, I know, sad, but they were drenched by Mussolini in the 1930s.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.760
 Also spoiler alert, not a great ending ahead for Mussolini.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.280
 But this is the, okay, this is the amazing thing about these yachts, because they were

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:45.960
 luxurious, they were real, they sank, their location was known, and they were drenched,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960
 right?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.720
 There were some mosaics, beautiful mosaics, which had been drenched up.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.920
 And around the end of the Second World War, a lot of stuff was going missing across Europe,

00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:00.320
 and one of the mosaics just went AWOL, and it was never seen or heard of again, until

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.080
 in New York, this was a couple of years ago, there was a book signing by a guy who'd written

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.200
 a book about Italian marbles, and as he was sitting at the table doing his signing, he

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:14.520
 overheard a couple standing nearby, one of them said to the other, "Oh, Helen, look,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.520
 that's your mosaic."

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.880
 And a New York couple had bought it, not knowing where it was from, and for the last 45 years

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.280
 they'd been using it as a coffee table.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.400
 Yeah, Helen's my auntie.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.000
 That is amazing.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.400
 So now it's got coffee stains, beautifully woven into the chair.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.600
 I think it was repatriated, though, I think it was agreed that they probably shouldn't

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.600
 be able to keep it, and so it was sent back to Italy.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.360
 Did they get a replacement table, at least?

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.080
 I'm sure they did.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.480
 I said before they're bad for the environment yachts, and I think they are, I mean, they

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.840
 use a lot of oil and stuff, and they have big anchors that can get rid of the seagrass

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.920
 and the bottom of the sea, stuff like that.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.080
 Jeff Bezos has got a new yacht.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.440
 A big anchor himself, I would say.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.480
 Massive anchor.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.120
 He's kind of a very powerful man.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.160
 Complete anchor, yeah, yeah.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.160
 And his relies on wind power, which is quite good.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.720
 Unfortunately, it has to be followed everywhere by a diesel-engined support vessel that carries

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.160
 all of his supplies and also has his helicopter pad.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.160
 Wow.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.800
 Yachts in waiting is a thing that is mad, and the biggest super yachts have these other

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.000
 yachts that follow them around, which I guess this is one of, and they have everything right.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.040
 They have additional accommodation for the slightly less-favoured guests.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:37.920
 The crew will stay on them, and they also contain all the toys.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.400
 Now, if you're ever invited onto a yacht, I just think this is going to help you out

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.400
 in terms of terminology.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.400
 Do you know what the toys are?

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.400
 Of course.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.400
 Yeah.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.400
 Of course.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400
 Grow up on them.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
 No, they're jet skis and stuff like that, right?

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.400
 Yeah.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400
 According to the article.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400
 But the large rubber ducks.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400
 Yeah.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400
 Exactly.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400
 Oh, really?

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400
 Oh, right.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400
 Sorry, yeah, yeah.

00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.400
 The jet skis, banana boats, that's, I thought, I thought there was, you know, they refer to

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
 as the toys are kept in here.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.400
 All the entertainment.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.400
 They're massive as well, aren't they?

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.400
 Yeah.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.280
 They are bigger than your average boat, and this is the thing trawling behind.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.520
 Tits apparently had two trawling behind it.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:12.920
 They were supposedly called Nipple One and Nipple Two, but, yeah, it's wild.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.160
 You can't just buy a yacht.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.320
 You have to buy the follow-up yachts to carry all the stuff for your yacht.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320
 It's so annoying.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.520
 It's like getting an app, like a game app, and then you have to pay for all the, I mean,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.520
 I don't do this.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.520
 I don't quite know how it works, but you have to pay for it.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.520
 I think that's pretty clear.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.520
 Yeah.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.720
 But it's like, I think it's all like, once a yacht salesman to see that you can afford

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:34.920
 a yacht, they probably think, "Well, we could probably sell this guy another yacht."

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:39.040
 This is, again, slightly old-fashioned, like sailing yachts, you know, not super yachts

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.720
 or mega yachts, just old-school, nice yachts.

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.080
 There is a yacht club, which has been going since 1984, called the Southwest Chingles

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.240
 Yacht Club.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240
 It is very exclusive.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.760
 It's invitation-only, founded by a yachtsman called David Latchford, and it is for people

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.600
 who have massively screwed up sailing their ships or yachts.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600
 Right.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600
 So he pranked a boy.

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.600
 He won't.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600
 What?

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.600
 A B-U-O-Y.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600
 A boy.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600
 Boy.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600
 Boy.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600
 Boy.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600
 Boy.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600
 Boy.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600
 Boy.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600
 You have to say it in a New Jersey accent.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600
 A boy.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:16.480
 He pranked, he pranked a boy and he, it's very embarrassing, it's broad daylight.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.200
 You're not meant to bump into the boys.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.160
 And so he did that and he saw, "Oh, I found this club."

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.720
 And he has incredibly eminent people who are now members of the club.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.760
 Like, there was the commander of a Royal Navy submarine who hit a rock in Scotland in

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.160
 clear daylight, which is a big no-no.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.920
 A Royal Navy commander who hit London Bridge.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920
 Yikes.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.560
 Oh, really bad.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.160
 And it also has some genuine sort of yachting heroes, like there's a guy called Tony Bullymour

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:44.040
 who was his yacht capsized when he was on, I think, a yachting race across the oceans.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.840
 And he spent four days under his own yacht in an air pocket.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.840
 Four days?

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840
 Four days.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.120
 And then he was rescued and he survived.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.120
 Wow.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.120
 And he was, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:54.120
 What kind of luxury stuff did he have under there?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.040
 It was like he had the full dining table and a gym that he could exercise on.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040
 Again, sailing yacht.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.040
 Very different.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.040
 Very different thing.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.040
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:06.800
 Crew ships are like yachts that poor people can afford to go on, like me.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800
 Yep.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.480
 The biggest crew ship was unveiled by the Royal Caribbean this year.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.040
 It was called the Icon of the Seas.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.160
 It can carry 7,600 passengers and 2,350 crew members.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:25.720
 That's the same as the population of Sirencesta in Roman times.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.600
 Thank you so much for that vital context.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.440
 Its gross tonnage is 250,000 tonnes, which is the same as all the cars in Surrey that

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.160
 is Ules compliant.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:47.040
 And it's 360 metres long, which is the same as the length of the furthest golf shot at

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.440
 the 2023 World Long Drive Championships.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:52.920
 So just so you know exactly.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920
 Thanks, James.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920
 Yeah.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920
 We're going to have to move on in a second, guys.

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.920
 Actually, just on Beasles's yacht, James mentioned earlier, when he first had it made, because

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.080
 a lot of these yachts have been made quite recently.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.080
 It's called the Coru, I think, and it was made in the Netherlands near Rotterdam.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.960
 And to leave the place where it was being made, he had to get through the Icon of the Seas

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:21.160
 and Bridge, and that was too low for his yacht, which was going to be the tallest boat in

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.720
 the world to get past.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.920
 So he said, "Could I dismantle the bridge?"

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.280
 Now this bridge was built in 1927, it's a heritage site, it's a very historic building.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.240
 Obviously the people of Rotterdam said, "Absolutely not, sod off, mate."

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240
 And so he was trapped.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:39.560
 So there was a period where Jeff Beasles had this gigantic soupy yacht stuck in a little

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.960
 kind of harbor somewhere in London, the Netherlands, and then he just realised he could take the

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.960
 mast down.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.960
 Right.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:56.920
 That's that brilliant business acumen that's got him where he is today.

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.600
 It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact, and my fact this week is that

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.440
 the reason that the band Ace of Bass became successful is because a cassette of their

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.560
 music got stuck in a producer's car, and after two weeks of having nothing else to

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:19.120
 listen to, he went from hating it to liking it.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.720
 And he was like, "It's a sign!"

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.720
 I saw the sign, yes.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.000
 Now it's one of their songs.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.560
 That's one of their songs.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.160
 I had to play Ace of Bass to Andy backstage here.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.160
 You hadn't heard it before.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.480
 No, and you were playing me The Biggie, weren't you?

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.480
 I was.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480
 I was playing him The Biggie.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480
 I'm having another baby?

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.880
 No, I want you to have another baby.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.440
 She wants another baby.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.440
 What is it?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.080
 All she wants is a baby.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.120
 She wants a baby for him.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.400
 All that she wants is another baby.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400
 Another baby?

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.920
 I haven't had a say.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.440
 She's got six already.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.720
 Do they specify the song, how many babies she already has?

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.720
 We don't know.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:05.920
 I don't think anyone's listened to the lyrics ever of any of their songs.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.920
 But listen, this is a...

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.520
 Do you mean either of their songs?

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.120
 Well, there's also Don't Turn Around.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.200
 Which I imagine if he played that in his cassette and he had his GPS on and they were going,

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.200
 "Please turn around."

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.680
 And the song's going, "Don't turn around, please turn around, don't turn around."

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:23.440
 No one's made any Ace of Bass jokes for about 30 years.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.440
 Yeah, yeah.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440
 We've got to dust them off.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.960
 And look, we joke about it, but I remember being a 12-year-old kid, absolutely loved.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.400
 I remember sitting on my buddy's yacht, just going, "Fang that tune."

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:38.040
 It was, that was a big cassette back in the day.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.840
 And it's not just me who liked it.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.520
 It was the best-selling album of 1994.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.720
 One of the most successful debut albums of all time.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:52.520
 And it was all because this producer, Dennis Pop, he was a 28-year-old pop producer living

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.960
 in Sweden.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.240
 And he got given this tape and they were like, "Please listen to it."

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.600
 He put it in his car.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.320
 And as I said, he went to eject it when he got home.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.320
 Really hating it.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320
 Thought this was terrible.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320
 And it just wouldn't come out.

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320
 It wouldn't come out.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:09.280
 And by weird coincidence, his radio was broken at the same time.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.160
 So he had nothing else to listen to.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.040
 And every day, he would pick up a mate of his who was also in the music business.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.720
 And as a joke, they would just listen to it on the way to work, just mocking it.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.200
 Just go, "God damn it, this is so bad."

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200
 And then as the weeks went on, he was like, "Hang on, there's a bit of a hook there."

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.560
 And by the end of the two weeks, he went, "This is a hit."

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:34.400
 And the song was called "Mr. Ace," which is then retitled to all that she wants.

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.000
 So that was the song.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.600
 I think they were already famous-ish, weren't they?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.560
 They'd had a number two hit in Denmark.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.520
 So they were pretty big too.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.520
 They were kind of big.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.160
 But then he was the one who made them so big, they were massive in America.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.000
 They had a number one album in America, which no Swedish band had ever had, including ABBA.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
 Yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.240
 And this is all thanks to this guy, Dennis Pop.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.240
 Dennis.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.240
 Dennis Pop.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.240
 With a Z at the end.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240
 That's why we're saying it weird.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.240
 Yeah.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.240
 And I know him as the other half of the production team.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:12.440
 He worked with Max Martin, who is, I believe, a very famous music producer, who made everything

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.120
 from baby one more time through to "Shake It Off" and beyond, and they have this amazing

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.200
 method of recording songs.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.960
 All that she wants is another baby and baby one more time.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.040
 Is that also about wanting another baby?

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.480
 And weirdly, so is "Shake It Off."

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480
 Yeah.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.480
 Oh my God.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:34.040
 It wasn't meant to be rude, but it's become rude.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.680
 And so Max Martin, who incidentally started off on the French horn, which is interesting.

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680
 That's interesting.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.680
 A bit of information.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.240
 Dennis Pop, by the way, couldn't play any instruments.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.240
 Really?

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.080
 No, he started taking the recorder when he was a child, but gave up after three attempts,

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.080
 because he thought musical instruments were boring.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.200
 But you don't have to play musical instruments to make pop songs.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200
 You do not.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.360
 He is, as you say, he made those hits.

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.520
 But really, if you look at the list, every single catchy, slightly trashy song that you're

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.720
 a bit embarrassed that you love from the last 30 years is basically written by Max Martin.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.980
 It's so weird, like Maroon 5, Backstreet Boys 5, Pink, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Ariana Grande,

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:17.960
 name anyone with catchy songs.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.000
 They were all Taylor Swift.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
 Taylor Swift.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
 No.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000
 He's written for Taylor Swift.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.560
 I'm so sorry to say it.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.560
 Hechler in the audience.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:31.000
 Can someone get Kea Star Morale up here, please?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.760
 It is crazy.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.760
 It is crazy.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:40.480
 Also, they're a band of siblings, so three of them were related to each other.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.480
 Ace of Bays.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.480
 Sorry, jumping back to Ace of Bays.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.480
 Yeah, so you had Jonas, you had Lynn, and you had Jenny, and then they had a cousin,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480
 Ulf.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.480
 But they were siblings.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:49.680
 They were like the Jonas brothers.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.800
 Actually, like literally, there was a Jonas brother in the band itself.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.760
 And then the one person who wasn't a brother or sister was Nazi, I think, wasn't he?

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760
 He wasn't a Nazi.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.160
 Well, what was his yacht called?

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:13.240
 He was called Ulf Eppurg, and he, as a child, had been a skinhead.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.240
 Or not a child.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240
 It's a teenager.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.040
 I mean, old children are right at the beginning of skinheads.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.200
 "Oh, we've given birth to a Nazi!"

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:30.680
 Oh, my God, yeah, as a teenager, he was a skinhead, and he later said that he regretted

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.800
 it and that actually Ace of Bays is supposed to be inclusive and lovely and everything.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.440
 Well, all she wants is another baby.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:43.040
 It does sound like it's the Kinderkirche Kuche model of pro-Aryan family structure.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.800
 So, anyway...

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.040
 I won't be a part of this conspiracy theory.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.240
 I know we're talking about Dennis Poppin music production, but just Dan, as you mentioned,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.240
 family bands.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240
 Yeah.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.960
 So I was reading the list of music considered the worst on Wikipedia, which is a real article,

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960
 very good.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.520
 And it contains this band called The Shags.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.200
 Oh, yeah, The Shags.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.640
 So, 1969 album, I think it was the debut called Philosophy of the World, they were a band

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.360
 of three sisters, right?

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:16.120
 And what marked them out as unusual in the music world is that they had no interest

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:25.320
 in being in a band, but their father's mother was a fortune teller and had told her son,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.720
 their dad, "You will have some daughters," and they were going to form the greatest music

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.200
 group on the planet's history.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.200
 Wow.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:35.480
 And their dad basically insisted they become musicians off the back of it, and they were

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480
 not good.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480
 Really?

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.000
 They apparently composed, I'm quoting here, "bizarre songs with untuned guitars, erratic

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.720
 time signatures, disconnected rhythms, wandering melodies, and rudimentary lyrics about pets."

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.400
 They were cool though, they had attitude, they were awesome.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:00.040
 People who were thought to be shit at first, actually, band origins.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:05.960
 So where band started, Fleetwood Mac, similar kind of area to Ace of Base, did we say?

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.320
 I'm sure their fans would agree.

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320
 Okay, cool.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.000
 I'm guessing that they were a band.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
 Yeah.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.640
 Do you know who they're named after, Fleetwood Mac?

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640
 Yes, about, yeah.

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.520
 Well, they're named after two of the members, so if you know them, you'll know, Mick Fleetwood

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.720
 and John McVeigh.

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.960
 But McVeigh, the Mac, wasn't in the band when they started.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:29.120
 They basically named it Fleetwood Mac to lure him into the band.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120
 No.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.360
 So it was started by Peter Green as the other one, Peter Green and Fleetwood formed this

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:39.000
 band, and they had been in a band with McVeigh, and McVeigh was like, "I like the old band,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.840
 it's regular income, I'm staying here," and they called it Fleetwood Mac in order to persuade

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.840
 him.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:46.840
 That's amazing.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:47.840
 They named a band after you now, mate.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.840
 No, that is emotional, blackmail, I would say.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:49.840
 That's good.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:50.840
 Very clever.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
 Yeah.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.600
 Simon and Garfield Cole weren't originally called Simon and Garfield Cole, were they,

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600
 the band?

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600
 Really?

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600
 No.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.200
 They didn't like their names, and so they changed their name to John Landis and Tom

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.840
 Graff and called themselves Tom and Jerry, and Paul Simon changed his name to John Landis

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.600
 because it was a girl that he had a crush on, was called Landis, and now Garfield Cole

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.520
 called himself Tom Graff because he really liked Graffs.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:15.520
 Wow.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520
 Wow.

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520
 Nothing is...

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.520
 Really?

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.520
 Yeah.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.800
 He used to do, like, he used to do, like, Graffs of how many records people were selling and

00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800
 stuff like that.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.400
 Do you know the band Joanna Gruesome?

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400
 No.

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.640
 They're pretty obscure, but I do love the way they found each other as bandmates.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.640
 They were all sent to the same anger management course.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:38.640
 Oh, wow.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.640
 How good is that?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.640
 Yeah.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:41.640
 They were incredibly angry teenagers.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.160
 They were at school, and they all got sent there.

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160
 Hi, everybody.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.160
 Andy here.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.280
 What a great fact about Joanna Gruesome that just was, right?

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.120
 Well, there's only one problem, which is that it turns out it actually wasn't true.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:56.400
 There was someone in the audience at this gig who sent us an email.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:01.640
 He's called George Ford, and he wrote, "Hi, I was at your show on the 23rd of October,

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.400
 but the Joanna Gruesome fact of the band forming an anger management class is not correct.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.200
 They made this up for an interview.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.520
 This was because they had no original formation, apart from just being friends.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.200
 My source is that the drummer was my design technology technician when I was at Heathside

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.360
 School in Weybridge."

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360
 So that's from George.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.720
 So sorry, that is not true.

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.900
 It's not true at all, and we thought we could either snip it out or record a bit of extra

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.040
 bonus information, just a little bit of how the sausage gets made.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040
 Okay, back to the show.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040
 Cheers.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.040
 Bye.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.040
 Pet Shop Boys.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.040
 How did they meet?

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040
 Is it in a pet shop?

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040
 It was at an electronics shop.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
 Really?

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.040
 Harry Styles' bandmate Mitch.

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.840
 Do you know how Harry Styles found Mitch?

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840
 In an advert?

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.840
 They're usually in an advert?

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840
 In a pizza shop.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840
 A pizza shop, really?

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.640
 They just met at a pizza shop.

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.840
 Was he, hang on, was he like a musician, or was he making?

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.840
 He probably is a musician.

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:53.840
 Okay.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.240
 He wasn't making him a pizza, and Harry Styles looked at the way he made pizza and went,

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.920
 "Do you know what those sounds would be great at?

00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920
 Playing guitar."

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:04.160
 When you finished arranging the pepperoni on that, coming to range, some great new songs.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.160
 My tunes.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160
 Yeah.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.160
 I don't know about music.

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.760
 It's becoming increasingly clear that none of us does.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760
 I know.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.480
 Actually, there's one more Swedish band, which I think I'd heard of.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.400
 So, obviously, we've got Abo, we've got AcerBase, and The Hives, I think, a moderately famous

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400
 Swedish band.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:25.560
 They sung, I hate to say, I told you so, and do you know who all their songs are written

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:26.560
 by?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.120
 I thought they wrote them themselves.

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.120
 Well, they did not.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.200
 They're all written by someone called Randy Fitzsimmons, and that's the reason they exist

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:37.800
 is because they once got a letter in the post from this Randy Fitzsimmons telling them to

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:42.440
 meet up in a certain place and form a band saying, "You'll be massive if you do this."

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:46.520
 This is in 1993, and he said, "I've got all these tunes in nine for you," and he started

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.640
 writing them songs, and he's written them songs ever since, and even up until very recently,

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.880
 all the songs were credited to Randy Fitzsimmons, who wrote them.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.520
 No one knows who this person is.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.840
 I think their latest album is called The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons, which is, and all the

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.440
 music on that was composed by Chip, Montgomery, and Wilbur Fitzsimmons.

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.960
 Wait, what's going on?

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.960
 This is bullshit.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960
 Is it?

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.320
 Did they make him up?

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.360
 I think they made him up, yeah, but they've never admitted they made him up.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.760
 It's possible that Randy Fitzsimmons is just a great music writer.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.160
 Have you got any real facts?

00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.160
 Fake yachts?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.160
 Fake songwriters?

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:26.640
 We've got a lot of stuff about how bands started.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.920
 I thought I'd look at what happened after they left.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.760
 So these are people who were kind of big when I was younger, the cheeky girls.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.360
 They're now both working as second-hand car dealers.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360
 Get out.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360
 Yeah.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:47.200
 One of them works in a Hyundai dealership in York, and the other one works in Lincolnshire.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200
 What kind of dealership?

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.840
 I didn't write it down.

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.600
 I think she might have got her sister the job, so I think it might also be Hyundai.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.560
 Well, that would make sense, yeah?

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.560
 Yeah, a bit cheeky.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:04.880
 Lisa from Steps is now a head teacher at a school in Dubai, and Abs from Five went on

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.840
 to become a farmer, but then in 2021 he said, "The animals just all died."

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840
 They all meant to.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.640
 When you were a farmer, the plants weren't growing anymore.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:21.600
 I'm a rubbish farmer, so I'm back in London.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.920
 Because you're so right, Anna, like, the animals all died, could be the best farmer

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:26.920
 in the world.

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:31.720
 The animals all died on time and under budget, and they've become sausages.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.920
 I think one of the favourite facts of our colleague Ann is about the origin, talking

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.600
 of song origins, of the Hansen song Mbop, or what it means, and I just, I really enjoyed

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:46.200
 an interview with Zach Hansen, who everyone will remember, who said, "It's the most misunderstood

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.120
 successful song of all time."

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120
 And he said...

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.100
 Is it about someone having another baby?

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.040
 And that's the sound it makes.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.240
 Was that an impression of a woman in labour?

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:07.800
 I've not been at many births, but I go there, simple and relaxed affairs, I don't

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.360
 see it as a small...

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.920
 Makes sense, you're asked away outside.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.240
 That's not what it's about.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.800
 Do people know what it means, Mbop?

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.240
 Because it just always makes me laugh.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:24.360
 It represents a frame of time, and it's about how quickly time gets away from you, your

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.440
 life will disappear before you know it.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.960
 In an Mbop, it's gone.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.920
 Oh, that's deep.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.440
 It's so deep.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.760
 It's the deepest song you've ever heard without knowing it.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760
 That's incredible.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760
 It's really funny.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.120
 I still can't get over abs.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120
 That's insane.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:57.200
 He just decimated this whole farm, and then went back to London.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.920
 We need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:10.320
 OK, my fact this week is that being visited by a clown can help you get pregnant.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.760
 This gives you your answer to how she gets another baby.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.480
 That's not the first.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.040
 Look, what does the clown have to do?

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:24.760
 Well, it could be one sexy clown, he just goes around having sex with people, but no,

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.040
 they just need to clown around.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.760
 It sounds sexy when you say clown around, it's never sounded sexy before.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.600
 It didn't sound sexy to me, just to me.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:43.480
 So this is from Benefits of Medical Clowning, a summary of the research by Amy J. Stephson.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:51.800
 She references a 2011 study by S. Friedler, and they looked at 219 patients, 110 of whom

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.400
 interacted with medical clowns, 109 who didn't, and the pregnancy rate in the clown group

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:05.120
 was 36.4% compared to 20.2% in the control group, and that gave the clown group twice

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120
 the odds of pregnancy.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:07.120
 So it was significant.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.620
 That's mega.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:12.320
 And when they interacted with them, were they just doing clown stuff, like nose honking

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.680
 and car stuffing and what have you, that's it?

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.760
 Now it does sound sexy, I must say.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:27.600
 How many clowns can you fit in this phone box?

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.920
 They were just doing clowny stuff, and like you say it like, ah, ah, ah, ah, that kind

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.920
 of thing.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.440
 On the left one, or the right one, or...

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:43.400
 It's because I just didn't know that they were such an established thing, medical clowns,

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400
 you say it.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400
 They really are.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.960
 But medical clowns are brought in, largely for children, right?

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:54.240
 Hippocrates had clowns in ancient Greece, yeah, he had his own hospital on the island

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.000
 of Kos, and he had constant troops of players and clowns who would come and play to the

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.040
 people to keep them happy.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.960
 So in this study by S. Friedler, they said we are very surprised by the results, and

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:11.600
 frankly, we can't explain it, but one theory that they had was maybe that stress reduction

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.520
 might improve fertility, so you're a bit less stressed.

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:19.080
 They are extremely beneficial in other ways, and it is largely with children that they're

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:23.760
 used, understandably, but there was a study that followed 51 children with pneumonia who

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.080
 got, as well as getting ordinary treatment, got 15-minute visits from a medical clown

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.960
 twice a day, and then it had the same number of children who didn't get the visits but

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:36.920
 still had the treatment, and it was pretty much like half the length of time that the

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.920
 ones who were visited by the clown stayed in hospital.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:44.600
 I know that sounds like they just said please get me out of here, but they were discharged

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.800
 sensibly.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.280
 They needed only two days of antibiotics compared to three days for those who hadn't had the

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.480
 clown, so they have an amazing impact.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:59.040
 They also use them during pre-operative anesthesia, so as you're going down, you'll turn and

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:06.160
 they'll just be a clown staring at you, and apparently that reduces stress and anxiety

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.880
 as opposed to making you going, "Wait, hang on one moment!"

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.840
 So I read that down, but I read a doctor saying that in some minor surgeries a clown replaces

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.480
 general anesthesia, which I think cannot be correct.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.440
 Can you imagine if a kid's cut their finger and you need to give them two stitches, maybe

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.640
 it's a look at the clown?

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.280
 Why are you giving them general anesthesia for two stitches?

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.160
 It raises more questions than an answer, you know, and what's the one disease a clown

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.160
 cannot help?

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.760
 Something to do with the nose, alcoholism, because it's all in the nose, alcoholism,

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.760
 it just gets better.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:41.760
 It's like chronic laughter.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760
 Bingo.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.760
 Is it?

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.760
 Oh!

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:49.360
 This was a patient who lived in Hawaii and he had suffered uncontrollable lifelong laughter.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.960
 He was 40, and from the age of eight he'd just been laughing, pretty much non-stop.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.320
 Oh my God, did something happen when he was eight?

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:58.440
 That was just like the funniest thing that ever happened.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.440
 No.

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.960
 What it is, is he contracted a small non-cancerous tumour on his brain.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.680
 That's almost the opposite of funny.

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.680
 It's the opposite of funny.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.680
 Yeah.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.640
 Can we say he went to see a Jimmy Carr?

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.560
 Maybe just...

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:20.080
 No, it's a thing called a 'gelastic seizure', and 'gelastic' is the word for 'related

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080
 to laughter'.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.200
 Because I think 'ageelastic' means you can't laugh, right?

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:28.640
 Exactly, and this guy was very 'gelastic' indeed, and it turns out it was due to a hypothalamic

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:34.160
 haematoma, which is not funny, but was operable and so could be cured, but not by a clown.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.160
 That's nice.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:37.960
 But when he'd been cured, did he never laugh again?

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:42.960
 Well he just went to see Jimmy Carr, and that sorted him right out.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.040
 There's a thing in New Zealand whereby, if you're about to be made redundant, you're

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.400
 allowed to bring someone in to be a support friend, and there's a great story about a

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:57.360
 guy who hired for $200 New Zealand a clown to come in with him, and so as the boss was

00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:02.320
 very sternly trying to tell him that he was no longer going to be employed by the company,

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:09.320
 there was a man in full get-up next to him making balloon animals, and as he was told

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:16.360
 and handed the sheet saying that he was going to be redundant, had the clown go 'ooh no!'

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.680
 doing the fake tears with his hand.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.680
 It's so good.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.280
 I wrote about this guy too, Dad.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.720
 Josh Thompson is the name of the man.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.680
 The clown was called Joe.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:29.320
 He had to be told to stop a few times the clown, because the squeaking of plastic as he made

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:33.320
 the balloon animals was too noisy for Josh to be fired.

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.760
 It's just so good.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760
 It's so amazing.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:41.320
 I don't know, you guys know this about me, but one of my favourite things is whenever

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.640
 a clown is put in a medical situation, so I'm probably the only person who loves the

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:46.640
 movie.

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640
 What?

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.960
 It's not something that's why we know nothing about it.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.960
 No, no, no.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960
 Did you say we probably know this about you?

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.360
 Yeah, you know that MASH is my favourite TV series.

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.120
 Describe Dan in one sense as well.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.000
 Pat Chathams is one of my favourite movies, despite everyone hating that movie.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.280
 I absolutely loved it.

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.000
 Pat Chathams is quite an interesting character.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.160
 He's still alive, and he's quite alternative.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.840
 I watched a YouTube video of him talking about the things he believes will cure stuff, so

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.720
 he doesn't really believe in depression.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.000
 He says you can avoid...

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.520
 And he has been severely depressed in his teens, to be fair to him, but he says things

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:28.200
 like, you can avoid being depressed if you think about things like, what a beautiful

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:34.120
 sunset, or if you take pleasure in stroking a purring cat.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.360
 To hell with depression, just go out and sing to the world, hug a tree, and follow an ant

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.840
 as it walks across the ground.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840
 There you go.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.240
 He's an interesting guy.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.320
 He named his first son Atomic Zagnut.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320
 It's very interesting.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.400
 A lot of doctors do become clowns and they do go out into struggling countries that

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.960
 are going through war and so on.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.920
 There's one guy, Ping Pong, who's one of the clowns.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:01.320
 He had a thing where he was going through airport security and he got taken into a room

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.160
 and they opened up his suitcase.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.040
 And basically, they did it because he had 100 confetti cannons and all these ping pong

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.120
 balls and they didn't know what it was when they went through the scan.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.920
 And according to Ping Pong, the guy went, what are you, some sort of clown?

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:15.920
 No.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.160
 Laughter can be dangerous, though, kind of.

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:24.880
 And there was a meta-analysis of 785 academic studies done by the University of Birmingham

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:32.680
 and they found that laughter can cause fainting, asthma, headaches, incontinence, dislocated

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.840
 jaw, infectious diseases.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:35.840
 Hang on.

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.800
 That's the first one where I thought, I haven't actually done that.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.640
 How do you get an infectious disease when you're laughing?

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:46.360
 Well, if you're laughing so much, your mouth is open, isn't it?

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.360
 I was joking.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.360
 If you're near some other people.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.160
 Basically, you're expelling more fine particulates from your mouth.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160
 It is very dangerous.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160
 Yeah.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.040
 And there's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which can rupture your esophagus if you laugh

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.040
 too much.

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.120
 And that is, that's actually fatal.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:02.120
 Wow.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:03.120
 Wow.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.000
 So the rest of this show will be, no more jokes.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.320
 Do you know who's one of the chief villains for clowns?

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320
 The chief villains.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.080
 Oh, one of the chief villains.

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.760
 Is it someone else in the circus?

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:19.600
 Well, she was in a kind of circus, actually, a few years ago.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:20.600
 Oh, Liz Truss?

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.600
 Thatcher?

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:22.600
 Thatcher.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:23.600
 Margaret Thatcher.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.600
 Yeah.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:31.120
 Do they just hate Thatcher because they love jumping on a bandwagon, squeezing into a car?

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.440
 No, it's that in 1980, the clown's training school was closed due to government cuts,

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.080
 which was thanks to Margaret's pop.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.600
 It wasn't like she said, shut these clowns down.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.320
 But it was funded by the arts council, and there were some arts council cuts happening

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320
 at the time.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:53.200
 And she got a complaint about it from some children who said, why have you cut the clowns?

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.880
 And she wrote back saying she was sorry that they were upset, but the clowns would continue

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:59.120
 receiving some kind of public funds.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.800
 P.S., no more milk for you.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800
 Bye.

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.400
 There's a great story I write about Jimmy Hendricks.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:11.640
 He was, for his first, I think it was his first tour in the UK, and he went to Liverpool.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.920
 They did a gig, and they went to a bar afterwards, and the bartender was incredibly suspicious

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.360
 of Jimmy Hendricks as he was walking in, and he went, we don't serve your kind here.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360
 And he went, what?

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:27.760
 And it was a really intense moment, and everyone froze.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.800
 And the bartender went, read the sign, buddy, and it read, no clowns allowed.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:38.000
 And basically, Hendricks' 60s get-up, which was very flamboyant and colorful, and there

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.360
 was a circus up the road.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.960
 The guy thought, wait, if I let you in, all the fucking clowns are going to come in here.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.480
 I don't want it being overrun.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:46.480
 Why?

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.760
 They'd have a sign made, say no clowns.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760
 No clowns allowed.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.840
 How much clown-related trouble have they had?

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.640
 I think something had happened there, hadn't it, a few days earlier.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640
 Yeah.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.520
 Do you know where the word clown comes from?

00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.520
 Oh, no.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.520
 Clown.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.520
 No.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.200
 It's probably from the Danish klunt.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.760
 Come on, guys, which means log or block, and then it meant like a blockhead, and then it

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.880
 meant like a silly person.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.280
 And some other words for clown in the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:26.120
 Bagpudding, clod hopper, cluster fist, lobcock, and Mary Andrew.

00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.120
 Oh!

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:28.120
 Mary Andrew.

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.120
 Mary Andrew.

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.400
 Sometimes I feel like the OED doesn't have its finger on the pulse.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.080
 Do you ever get that?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.400
 This fact was about getting pregnant, so I have a loosely related getting pregnant fact

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:44.720
 that I happened upon this week, which is that everyone knows the 12 labours of Hercules,

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:45.720
 right?

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:46.720
 I mean, you don't have to recite them now.

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.720
 I'm not going to test anyone.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:51.840
 But like the clean out the stables and bring back the dog with three heads, Cerberus, and

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:52.840
 there's a river to--

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:53.840
 Exactly.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.840
 Something about a lion, maybe.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:55.840
 Kill the lion.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.840
 Exactly.

00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840
 Kill the lion.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840
 Do all the big stuff.

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:01.280
 So 12 labours of Hercules, these big things you have to do.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.000
 Who knows about the 13th labour of Hercules?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
 No.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.720
 Well, this was written about the same time, and his 13th labour was to impregnate 50 women

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:10.720
 in one night.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.720
 Whoa!

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.120
 I'm going to need a lot of clowns.

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:16.120
 Yeah.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:22.120
 That's 50 additional labours of Hercules, right?

00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:24.960
 I think they counted as one 50th of a labour each.

00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960
 No, no, it's a labour.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:26.960
 Is that a labour?

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.960
 Because you'd go into labour when you're--

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.960
 Sorry.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960
 No, there's a pun.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:31.960
 No.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.960
 No.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:41.960
 That is it.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:42.960
 That is it.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.960
 That is all of our facts.

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:44.960
 Thank you so much.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.720
 We'll be back again next week with another episode, but very quickly, Drury Lane.

00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.800
 You were awesome.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800
 Thank you for having us.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.800
 That was magical.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.440
 We will be back again next week with another podcast.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.440
 We'll see you then.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.440
 Goodbye!
