00:00:10,00:00:19,">> Hello, and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:19,00:00:24,a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Drury Lane.
00:00:24,00:00:27,>> [APPLAUSE]
00:00:27,00:00:28,>> My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:28,00:00:33,"I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:33,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered round the microphones with our four favorite facts"
00:00:37,00:00:42,"from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:45,00:00:50,">> My fact is, as well as the world famous White Cliffs of Dover,"
00:00:50,00:00:54,Britain is home to the world unknown White Cliffs of Croydon.
00:00:54,00:00:59,">> [LAUGH] >> For listeners at home,"
00:00:59,00:01:03,"we're looking at a majestic, huge set of glorious White Cliffs."
00:01:03,00:01:06,">> I mean, in fairness, they are White Cliffs, aren't they?"
00:01:06,00:01:07,There's no doubt about that.
00:01:07,00:01:09,>> Are they White Cliffs or are they a disused quarry?
00:01:09,00:01:10,It doesn't matter.
00:01:10,00:01:11,>> [LAUGH]
00:01:11,00:01:12,">> Right, is that what they are?"
00:01:12,00:01:13,>> They are the White Cliffs of Croydon.
00:01:13,00:01:17,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a bit of, is there anyone in tonight from Croydon?"
00:01:17,00:01:19,">> Yeah, wow."
00:01:19,00:01:19,>> Excellent.
00:01:19,00:01:23,>> Were you familiar with the White Cliffs of Croydon?
00:01:23,00:01:24,">> No, it's mixed results."
00:01:24,00:01:26,>> Croydon doesn't even know.
00:01:26,00:01:28,">> Yeah, we weren't sure if it was a thing, and it turns out Andy,"
00:01:28,00:01:31,"you sort of helped to coin it, I think."
00:01:31,00:01:32,">> Well, I definitely didn't coin it."
00:01:32,00:01:35,"This is in a bit, Croydon is a bit of London, we should say."
00:01:35,00:01:38,"And in Croydon, there is a bit called Riddles Down,"
00:01:38,00:01:40,which is home to a disused truck quarry.
00:01:40,00:01:41,"And if you look at it from the right angle,"
00:01:41,00:01:43,it looks exactly like the White Cliffs of Dover.
00:01:43,00:01:46,">> From, sorry, from a right angle, or from-"
00:01:46,00:01:48,">> From, and if you look at it at right angles."
00:01:48,00:01:50,>> Right. >> Which is the right angle.
00:01:50,00:01:52,">> So this, and in fact, quite a lot of my research,"
00:01:52,00:01:56,"it comes from a new book, which is called Croydonopolis,"
00:01:56,00:01:59,"by Will Noble, and it is fantastic."
00:01:59,00:02:01,I cannot recommend it enough.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"If you only read one book about Croydon this year, make it."
00:02:04,00:02:06,"Croydonopolis, Croydon gets a really bad rap"
00:02:06,00:02:08,for anyone listening overseas.
00:02:08,00:02:09,>> It's a shit hole.
00:02:09,00:02:11,>> Well.
00:02:11,00:02:13,">> But it is, yeah, for international listeners,"
00:02:13,00:02:15,it is the punchline to jokes.
00:02:15,00:02:16,"It's what is that place, you know?"
00:02:16,00:02:18,It's like Francis Belgium.
00:02:18,00:02:18,>> Yeah.
00:02:18,00:02:21,">> So, and famously, just people hate it."
00:02:21,00:02:24,"I think most famously, David Bowie hated it, didn't he?"
00:02:24,00:02:25,>> Definitely.
00:02:25,00:02:27,">> And yeah, sorry, Dan, and you love David Bowie,"
00:02:27,00:02:28,"and you love Croydon, apparently."
00:02:28,00:02:30,">> Yeah, there's, what do I do?"
00:02:30,00:02:31,>> This is painful.
00:02:31,00:02:33,"He said, he literally said Croydon wasn't insult to him."
00:02:33,00:02:38,"He would say it's so fucking Croydon, to mean, well."
00:02:38,00:02:39,He said it's the most derogatory thing
00:02:39,00:02:40,you can say about something.
00:02:40,00:02:43,">> It is, and I try to, I try to look for good stuff"
00:02:43,00:02:46,"in the news about Croydon, and I mean, the headlines"
00:02:46,00:02:49,that come up do not do it any favors.
00:02:49,00:02:52,"One here was, ""Teenager loses finger at Croydon rave,"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"""but continues dancing because the bass was hard."""
00:02:56,00:02:57,>> That's good.
00:02:57,00:02:58,">> That's, yeah, I guess so."
00:02:58,00:03:01,"Yeah, showing, showing, you know, that's something."
00:03:01,00:03:01,>> That's a good news story.
00:03:01,00:03:04,">> How about this one, ""Croydon hospital leaves human teeth"
00:03:04,00:03:07,"""embedded in man's leg after bizarre iPad trampoline incident."""
00:03:07,00:03:09,(laughing)
00:03:09,00:03:11,>> Did you read any more into the article then?
00:03:11,00:03:14,">> No, I thought it was better just leaving that as is."
00:03:14,00:03:16,">> Well, they do, they have a fun palace,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,which has 60 trampolines.
00:03:17,00:03:18,>> Do they?
00:03:18,00:03:20,">> I believe, yeah, yeah, they do."
00:03:20,00:03:23,"So, Henry VIII said it was a place"
00:03:23,00:03:25,"that he could never be without sickness,"
00:03:25,00:03:27,and there's a store--
00:03:27,00:03:28,>> Did he mean sick hasn't good?
00:03:28,00:03:30,">> No, I don't think he did."
00:03:30,00:03:31,I think that would be very charitable.
00:03:31,00:03:33,>> Was one of his wives from there?
00:03:33,00:03:35,>> Catherine of Croydon.
00:03:35,00:03:36,(laughing)
00:03:36,00:03:38,>> She was the fourth Catherine
00:03:38,00:03:40,who never gets any credit.
00:03:40,00:03:41,"No, the first one, who was she?"
00:03:41,00:03:41,Catherine of Aragon.
00:03:41,00:03:42,>> Aragon?
00:03:42,00:03:43,>> I think he supposedly proposed
00:03:43,00:03:45,"to Catherine of Aragon, it was one of the Catharines,"
00:03:45,00:03:46,"anyway, one of the odds, 50/50."
00:03:46,00:03:48,(laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:50,">> The first beheaded died,"
00:03:50,00:03:53,the first beheaded got some teeth stuck in their leg
00:03:53,00:03:54,after an iPad accident.
00:03:54,00:03:57,(laughing)
00:03:57,00:03:59,">> But there is a huge and story history of Croydon,"
00:03:59,00:04:01,"it turns out, and actually we've all been very unfair to it."
00:04:01,00:04:03,"So, for example, it used to be the summer residence"
00:04:03,00:04:05,of the Archbishop of Canterbury.
00:04:05,00:04:06,>> Is that right?
00:04:06,00:04:08,">> Yeah, I mean, some time ago."
00:04:08,00:04:11,">> I thought the summer residence was a bucolic beach,"
00:04:11,00:04:14,"your mountainous place you went to relax,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,not a brutalist gray tower block place.
00:04:17,00:04:18,">> Well, this is all before all the tower blocks"
00:04:18,00:04:19,and the car parks and things.
00:04:19,00:04:21,"So, the name might mean valley"
00:04:21,00:04:24,where the wild saffron grows.
00:04:24,00:04:25,>> Right.
00:04:25,00:04:27,">> Crocadine, crocadine."
00:04:27,00:04:29,"It's a nice, it sounds, it sounds lovely."
00:04:29,00:04:30,>> I think it used to be the place
00:04:30,00:04:33,"where all celebrities wanted to be seen, right?"
00:04:33,00:04:34,>> What periods?
00:04:34,00:04:37,">> So, we're talking early 20th century,"
00:04:37,00:04:40,"Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"Babe Ruth, JFK, Rita Hayworth,"
00:04:43,00:04:45,all these people wanted to be seen in Croydon.
00:04:45,00:04:49,"And that's because Croydon was where their airport was,"
00:04:49,00:04:50,main airport in London.
00:04:50,00:04:52,And they weren't really doing airports
00:04:52,00:04:53,in America at the time.
00:04:53,00:04:55,And planes are really cool and trendy and new.
00:04:55,00:04:57,"So, everyone wanted to go there"
00:04:57,00:04:58,and be seen with the airplanes.
00:04:58,00:05:00,">> Also, the base is hard."
00:05:00,00:05:02,(audience laughing)
00:05:02,00:05:04,"No, you're right, it was, the aerodrome was a mega,"
00:05:04,00:05:06,"and it was until the Second World War,"
00:05:06,00:05:08,"it was basically the, the most,"
00:05:08,00:05:09,"like they had 100,000 visitors a year"
00:05:09,00:05:12,who were just turning up to see the planes.
00:05:12,00:05:14,">> John Mayday was invented there,"
00:05:14,00:05:17,presumably by a pilot desperately trying to reject him.
00:05:17,00:05:19,"He saw it, looming up ahead."
00:05:19,00:05:20,">> Mayday, Mayday, and they're going,"
00:05:20,00:05:22,"""What's that, sounds awesome, we should lock that in,"
00:05:22,00:05:24,"""is that like you in trouble?"""
00:05:24,00:05:25,>> Amy Johnson flew from Croydon
00:05:25,00:05:30,when she flew to Australia in 1930.
00:05:30,00:05:31,"And then when she came back,"
00:05:31,00:05:33,"she came back to Croydon Airport,"
00:05:33,00:05:36,"and 200,000 people greeted her there."
00:05:36,00:05:38,">> So, sorry, was she, she was the first woman"
00:05:38,00:05:39,to fly a long way?
00:05:39,00:05:41,">> To, to Australia."
00:05:41,00:05:42,">> Okay, okay."
00:05:42,00:05:45,">> So she came back, and there were 200,000 people there,"
00:05:45,00:05:47,"and according to articles at the time,"
00:05:47,00:05:49,at least 12 people were run over
00:05:49,00:05:51,"by the slow-moving procession,"
00:05:51,00:05:53,but one journalist said they were all quite cheerful
00:05:53,00:05:55,as they were carried off to hospital.
00:05:55,00:05:56,(audience laughing)
00:05:56,00:05:58,Probably 'cause they were leaving Croydon.
00:05:58,00:06:00,(audience laughing)
00:06:00,00:06:02,And apparently the Daily Mail paid for all the compensation
00:06:02,00:06:03,of anyone who got injured.
00:06:03,00:06:04,">> Oh, wow."
00:06:04,00:06:05,>> Hey.
00:06:05,00:06:06,>> Good old Daily Mail.
00:06:06,00:06:08,>> I said no one ever.
00:06:08,00:06:10,(audience laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:12,I did a quick hunt for sort of
00:06:12,00:06:14,underappreciated white things in Croydon.
00:06:14,00:06:16,(audience laughing)
00:06:16,00:06:19,"Arthur Conan Doyle lived in Croydon,"
00:06:19,00:06:22,"and he wrote quite a lot of the Sherlock Holmes stories there,"
00:06:22,00:06:23,"obviously very, very famous,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,"but when he moved there,"
00:06:25,00:06:26,"the first thing that he published,"
00:06:26,00:06:28,"which was a three-volume book,"
00:06:28,00:06:29,"was The White Company,"
00:06:29,00:06:31,"which was a historical adventure novel,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,which was massive at the time.
00:06:32,00:06:34,"No one now really knows what that is,"
00:06:34,00:06:36,"unless you know Conan Doyle's bibliography really well,"
00:06:36,00:06:39,"but it was big in the day, and it kind of disappeared."
00:06:39,00:06:42,That was published while he lived in Croydon.
00:06:42,00:06:45,"Will Hay, the comedian, in 1932,"
00:06:45,00:06:49,he has noted as having discovered a great white spot
00:06:49,00:06:53,on the planet Saturn from his garden in Croydon.
00:06:53,00:06:56,It was like a big new astronomical discovery.
00:06:56,00:06:59,"Everyone's really excited, not so much anymore."
00:06:59,00:07:01,It's getting nothing in here.
00:07:01,00:07:04,(audience laughing)
00:07:04,00:07:07,"And then lastly, C.B. Frye, the great cricketer,"
00:07:07,00:07:10,and sort of multi-everything person.
00:07:10,00:07:11,He wasn't his party trick.
00:07:11,00:07:13,He used to be able to just jump backwards
00:07:13,00:07:14,onto a mantelpiece.
00:07:14,00:07:15,"Yeah, that was his party trick."
00:07:15,00:07:17,"He'd just be chatting to you and go, ""Whoop,"""
00:07:17,00:07:19,"and then he would be on top of the mantelpiece,"
00:07:19,00:07:21,"and he was like, ""Party trick."""
00:07:21,00:07:25,"C.B. Frye, lesser-known appreciated white,"
00:07:25,00:07:27,"is his mother, Constance White."
00:07:27,00:07:29,Wow.
00:07:29,00:07:31,I feel like you-- There's a good crowbars.
00:07:31,00:07:33,(laughing)
00:07:33,00:07:34,The crowbars are strong.
00:07:34,00:07:38,"It also has the world's grumpiest woman, Croydon, in it."
00:07:38,00:07:39,That's it.
00:07:39,00:07:40,Self-professed world's grumpiest woman.
00:07:40,00:07:43,This is according to a news article in 2015
00:07:43,00:07:45,about a woman who was completely naked
00:07:45,00:07:47,"aside from a large sash that read,"
00:07:47,00:07:49,"""World's grumpiest woman who glued her bum"
00:07:49,00:07:51,"""to the Croydon Debenham store window."""
00:07:51,00:07:53,(audience laughing)
00:07:53,00:07:55,"From the inside or from the outside, do we know?"
00:07:55,00:07:57,"You'd think it would be too cold outside,"
00:07:57,00:07:58,"but she was committed,"
00:07:58,00:07:59,"and she was actually wearing fake pubic hair,"
00:07:59,00:08:00,which would have kept her warm.
00:08:00,00:08:02,So I'm gonna say outside.
00:08:02,00:08:02,Ah.
00:08:02,00:08:04,And...
00:08:04,00:08:05,Was it a protest?
00:08:05,00:08:07,"Yes, but it was just a protest about how grumpy she was."
00:08:07,00:08:10,She just did a long rant about how grumpy she was.
00:08:10,00:08:10,"Oh, really?"
00:08:10,00:08:11,Yeah.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"But Debenham said, ""It's great to hear our customers,"
00:08:13,00:08:14,"""like our window displays so much"
00:08:14,00:08:16,"""that they want to be part of it."""
00:08:16,00:08:18,So it's good that they saw the silver lining.
00:08:18,00:08:19,It is quite...
00:08:19,00:08:22,More recent stories about Croydon have...
00:08:22,00:08:23,They've definitely...
00:08:23,00:08:25,They're not Archbishop of Canterbury quality stories.
00:08:25,00:08:28,So one of the most recent stories about Croydon from the BBC
00:08:28,00:08:29,is about a homeowner in South London
00:08:29,00:08:31,who has complained after Transport for London
00:08:31,00:08:35,erected a toilet for bus drivers outside his house.
00:08:35,00:08:35,"He's called Brett Kemp,"
00:08:35,00:08:37,and he said it was putting off potential buyers
00:08:37,00:08:40,because he keeps seeing bus drivers go in and go to the loo.
00:08:40,00:08:41,And he says...
00:08:41,00:08:42,Why don't you put a door on it?
00:08:42,00:08:43,I think...
00:08:43,00:08:44,"I think even with a door,"
00:08:44,00:08:47,he says it's not the most appealing thing for potential buyers.
00:08:47,00:08:50,He says it's nicknamed the turdis.
00:08:50,00:08:54,"To bring it a little bit more high, bro,"
00:08:54,00:08:57,Samuel Coleridge Taylor was born in Croydon.
00:08:57,00:08:58,Samuel Taylor Coleridge?
00:08:58,00:09:01,"No, Samuel Coleridge Taylor."
00:09:01,00:09:03,He was named after Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
00:09:03,00:09:07,"Confusingly, there's a piece called Kubla Khan,"
00:09:07,00:09:10,which was written by Taylor Coleridge and Coleridge Taylor.
00:09:10,00:09:12,"So I said the words are written by Taylor Coleridge,"
00:09:12,00:09:14,and the music is written by Coleridge Taylor.
00:09:14,00:09:17,"Because he was a composer, the classical one, yeah, yeah."
00:09:17,00:09:22,"So he wrote a violin concerto towards the end of his life,"
00:09:22,00:09:23,"and he sent the music over to America,"
00:09:23,00:09:26,so it could be learned before he went there.
00:09:26,00:09:28,"Bad news, he sent it on the Titanic."
00:09:28,00:09:30,"Oh, no."
00:09:30,00:09:33,"Good news, it turned out they'd been mislaid,"
00:09:33,00:09:36,and they hadn't gone on the Titanic after all.
00:09:36,00:09:38,Bad news.
00:09:38,00:09:40,This is a roller coaster chase.
00:09:40,00:09:42,"Well, it goes downhill quite quickly."
00:09:42,00:09:45,"Bad news, he died before that discovery was made."
00:09:45,00:09:50,So it's his sort of undiscovered and then posthumous piece of work.
00:09:50,00:09:53,"Yeah, exactly, and they did play it 100 years after his death."
00:09:53,00:09:54,That's very cool.
00:09:54,00:09:56,I'm going to have to move us on in a second.
00:09:56,00:09:58,We haven't even got onto White Cliffs of Dover.
00:09:58,00:10:01,"Why do you need to, when you've got the White Cliffs of Croydon?"
00:10:01,00:10:04,They used to have an atmospheric railway.
00:10:04,00:10:06,So do you know what that is?
00:10:06,00:10:06,No.
00:10:06,00:10:09,"OK, imagine a railway, but it doesn't operate with boring engines,"
00:10:09,00:10:11,"diesel, electricity, whatever."
00:10:11,00:10:12,It's a vacuum.
00:10:12,00:10:15,I don't need to explain an atmospheric railway to any of you.
00:10:15,00:10:16,You mean like a pneumatic railway?
00:10:16,00:10:18,I mean exactly that.
00:10:18,00:10:19,You mean a pneumatic railway?
00:10:19,00:10:23,"A pneumatic railway, a vacuum pipe railway, as I call it."
00:10:23,00:10:25,And this was going to be the future of transportation.
00:10:25,00:10:27,"And it was very exciting, it was mid-19th century."
00:10:27,00:10:29,It was when we hadn't definitely settled on the train.
00:10:29,00:10:33,"The train was looking pretty good, but the atmospheric railway was potential."
00:10:33,00:10:35,And it was actually built and it was tried out.
00:10:35,00:10:38,"The only problems where there were, sometimes it would miss the station"
00:10:38,00:10:43,and it couldn't go backwards so the passengers would have to walk along the tracks.
00:10:43,00:10:46,Or sometimes male passengers had to get out and give it a little push
00:10:46,00:10:48,because it stopped and couldn't get going again.
00:10:48,00:10:50,"And then when it got going again, it just left without you"
00:10:50,00:10:54,because you couldn't go back on.
00:10:54,00:10:56,And the third problem was that rats would chew their way in
00:10:56,00:11:00,and then they would just fly their way along the tubes and out into the pumping station.
00:11:00,00:11:02,"No, hundreds of rats a day."
00:11:02,00:11:08,They had to put a sack over the outlet tube just to catch the rats.
00:11:08,00:11:12,"But apart from that, it's great, it's the system."
00:11:12,00:11:13,Wow.
00:11:18,00:11:22,It is time for fact number two and that is Anna.
00:11:22,00:11:29,My fact this week is that the world's most expensive super yacht probably doesn't exist.
00:11:29,00:11:30,What?
00:11:30,00:11:33,"Oh, sounds like a Dan fact, that one, Anna."
00:11:33,00:11:34,Doesn't it?
00:11:34,00:11:36,What on earth does that mean?
00:11:36,00:11:39,"Well, I think it's an extraordinary thing."
00:11:39,00:11:42,"If you Google and all of you go to the world's most expensive super yacht,"
00:11:42,00:11:46,you've got loads and loads of top ten lists of the most expensive yachts in the world.
00:11:46,00:11:50,And number one is always this one called History Supreme.
00:11:50,00:11:53,"And these are on proper boating websites, they're reliable sources."
00:11:53,00:11:56,History Supreme is worth $4.8 billion.
00:11:56,00:12:01,"The second on the list is Eclipse, which I think is or was owned by Roman Abramovich,"
00:12:01,00:12:03,which is $1.5 billion.
00:12:03,00:12:06,So this is three times more than that.
00:12:06,00:12:09,And it was bought by an anonymous Malaysian businessman.
00:12:09,00:12:13,It's extremely lavish and it probably doesn't exist.
00:12:13,00:12:18,"According to quite a few people who've looked into it and pointed out things like the photos,"
00:12:18,00:12:23,so it's never been seen in real life by anyone who's told anyone about it.
00:12:23,00:12:25,"And it's quite hard to hide, I think, a super yacht."
00:12:25,00:12:26,They're not subtle.
00:12:26,00:12:30,"But it could be floating somewhere secret, like private islands for the wealthy."
00:12:30,00:12:31,That's a thing.
00:12:31,00:12:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:12:32,00:12:33,You know?
00:12:33,00:12:34,That is a thing.
00:12:34,00:12:38,"Well, it also, so a statement was issued by another yacht making company, Bayer Yachts,"
00:12:38,00:12:41,saying that all the photos that were posted on the designer's website when it was designed
00:12:41,00:12:46,a few years ago were actually of a completely different yacht that they designed and they
00:12:46,00:12:48,just been coloured gold.
00:12:48,00:12:52,Because one of the things about this yacht amongst the many ridiculous features is that
00:12:52,00:12:54,it's covered in solid gold.
00:12:54,00:12:57,"Another thing that's been pointed out is if a boat is covered in solid gold, it's going"
00:12:57,00:13:00,to struggle to float.
00:13:00,00:13:05,"But it's so weird and it's insisted on and the designer sadly passed away now, but he's"
00:13:05,00:13:11,"got a guy called Stuart Hughes known for designing very expensive things, as you can"
00:13:11,00:13:15,"imagine, like iPhones encrusted with diamonds and stuff."
00:13:15,00:13:19,"And yeah, he said, I think the best thing about this super yacht that he said he'd made is"
00:13:19,00:13:25,a wall feature that's made from a meteor with Tyrannosaurus Rex bones shaved into it.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"He is just making shit up now, isn't he?"
00:13:27,00:13:28,It's mad.
00:13:28,00:13:30,So what do we think the deal is?
00:13:30,00:13:33,Is this a tax thing or is it just a joke or what do we know?
00:13:33,00:13:38,"I think people think it might be one of the world's best pranks, because I don't know"
00:13:38,00:13:39,how it could be a tax thing.
00:13:39,00:13:42,"I mean, yachts are quite a shady business anyway, right?"
00:13:42,00:13:43,Yeah.
00:13:43,00:13:45,We don't really know the world that exists beyond them.
00:13:45,00:13:46,We don't know who the owners are.
00:13:46,00:13:50,"It's said that the owner of this one is Malaysia's richest businessman, a guy called Robert"
00:13:50,00:13:51,Kwok.
00:13:51,00:13:56,And I cannot just say they are owned by rich people who are often quite powerful as well.
00:13:56,00:13:58,So I'd just like to say that I believe them all.
00:13:58,00:13:59,Yeah.
00:13:59,00:14:00,So here's the thing.
00:14:00,00:14:03,Robert Kwok is 101 years old.
00:14:03,00:14:04,What?
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Yeah, he's 101 years old."
00:14:05,00:14:08,"He turned, I think it was October, November last year, he turned 101."
00:14:08,00:14:09,I know him.
00:14:09,00:14:10,No.
00:14:10,00:14:11,Yeah.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"So, okay."
00:14:12,00:14:17,"Now, do you remember last week on the, so the latest show that went out, as of recording,"
00:14:17,00:14:22,"was my parents had a salon and they used to do the hair of Bruce Lee's supposed mistress,"
00:14:22,00:14:24,"Betty Ting, right?"
00:14:24,00:14:25,Yes.
00:14:25,00:14:28,Another person whose hair they used to do was Robert Kwok.
00:14:28,00:14:29,No.
00:14:29,00:14:30,Yes.
00:14:30,00:14:33,"So, as a result, after he got his haircut by my mum, he said, ""Hey, you should have a"
00:14:33,00:14:37,"salon in my Shangri-La hotels,"" which he owned all the Shangri-La hotels in the world."
00:14:37,00:14:38,He's the founder.
00:14:38,00:14:39,So they set up a salon there.
00:14:39,00:14:42,So I kind of grew up with Robert Kwok in my life.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"Did you ask him, or can you ask him about his yacht?"
00:14:46,00:14:47,Yeah.
00:14:47,00:14:51,So I messaged my sister because she's still best friends with his granddaughter.
00:14:51,00:14:53,And I messaged it just before the show.
00:14:53,00:14:54,We went to school with each other in Hong Kong.
00:14:54,00:14:58,"I was going to do a humorous straw ball of the audience of, like, who owns a yacht or"
00:14:58,00:15:01,"knows anyone who owns a yacht, because no one does."
00:15:01,00:15:02,But of course you do.
00:15:02,00:15:03,I don't own a yacht.
00:15:03,00:15:04,Yeah.
00:15:04,00:15:06,You're best mates with the granddaughter.
00:15:06,00:15:07,No.
00:15:07,00:15:08,We know them.
00:15:08,00:15:10,"Anyway, I messaged my sister, but it's, of course, she's in Australia, so we won't"
00:15:10,00:15:12,hear back for another 12 hours or so.
00:15:12,00:15:13,"Oh, come on."
00:15:13,00:15:15,But I've been on his boat.
00:15:15,00:15:16,His yacht?
00:15:16,00:15:17,Yeah.
00:15:17,00:15:18,What?
00:15:18,00:15:19,A different one.
00:15:19,00:15:20,A different one.
00:15:20,00:15:21,It's not that great.
00:15:21,00:15:22,Wow.
00:15:22,00:15:23,Wow.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Yeah.
00:15:24,00:15:30,"So I'll say a couple of things about, so Larry Ellison, he's a, he's a squillionaire as"
00:15:30,00:15:31,well.
00:15:31,00:15:32,"Oh, yeah."
00:15:32,00:15:34,"He's the founder of Oracle Software, Software Guy."
00:15:34,00:15:38,He bought a yacht in 1999 that was called Isanami.
00:15:38,00:15:42,"And he changed the name after it was pointed out that that name was ""I'm a Nazi"" backwards."
00:15:42,00:15:44,In no way.
00:15:44,00:15:45,I know.
00:15:45,00:15:46,Was it?
00:15:46,00:15:47,Is that what they used to do?
00:15:47,00:15:50,"You know, like ambulances have a name backwards."
00:15:50,00:15:51,So.
00:15:51,00:15:53,Have you looked in your review mirror?
00:15:53,00:15:54,"Yeah, yeah."
00:15:54,00:16:01,"That guy, Larry Ellison, his yacht has someone in a speedboat who follows it around and their"
00:16:01,00:16:08,whole job is to retrieve the basketballs that he throws overboard because he's got a basketball
00:16:08,00:16:09,suit.
00:16:09,00:16:10,"Because he plays, but it's not just that."
00:16:10,00:16:11,It's his hobby.
00:16:11,00:16:12,He throws basketballs overboard.
00:16:12,00:16:13,To torment a speedboat guy.
00:16:13,00:16:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:16:14,00:16:15,He's got hoops.
00:16:15,00:16:18,"He's got a hoop, but he must be really bad at basketball, you would think, because he"
00:16:18,00:16:21,misses quite often and this guy has to go around and collect all the balls.
00:16:21,00:16:25,Because basketballs are so expensive that you can't let one go.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"No, I think it's because he cares about the environment."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"Oh, okay."
00:16:28,00:16:30,Not enough not to have a yacht.
00:16:30,00:16:33,"Because yachts are very, very bad for the environment."
00:16:33,00:16:36,Have you heard of the Prince of Brunei's one?
00:16:36,00:16:38,"So he had one ages ago, it's now been sold."
00:16:38,00:16:43,Which of your parents was the manicurist to him?
00:16:43,00:16:49,"He had one, it's now gone, but when he had it, it was called TITS."
00:16:49,00:16:50,That was his yacht.
00:16:50,00:16:54,Is it something in Brunei and?
00:16:54,00:16:57,It literally just means TITS.
00:16:57,00:17:01,"And we think there's a lot of questions about how the name came about, but they think it"
00:17:01,00:17:02,must be that.
00:17:02,00:17:06,"Because when a lot of his personal collection was sold, they found a lot of erotic statues."
00:17:06,00:17:10,"He had watches with two figures that would copulate on the hour, so he clearly had a"
00:17:10,00:17:11,thing for it.
00:17:11,00:17:12,They must be exhausted.
00:17:12,00:17:13,Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:15,Is that Geoffrey of Brunei?
00:17:15,00:17:16,"Yeah, that's right."
00:17:16,00:17:17,And Bill Clinton.
00:17:17,00:17:18,Geoffrey.
00:17:18,00:17:19,I think he's called Geoffrey.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Geoffrey of Brunei.
00:17:20,00:17:21,Geoffrey of Brunei?
00:17:21,00:17:22,Yeah.
00:17:22,00:17:23,Geoffrey of Brunei.
00:17:23,00:17:24,Cool.
00:17:24,00:17:25,The city of Brunei is his name.
00:17:25,00:17:29,"But yeah, Clinton was meant to go on it, but apparently they just said he can't because"
00:17:29,00:17:30,of the name.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"They're like, we don't need that in our life."
00:17:31,00:17:32,Right.
00:17:32,00:17:33,We don't need a Clinton scandal like that.
00:17:33,00:17:40,"And he has a helipad on it, and his son, who's called Prince Hakim, is a helicopter pilot,"
00:17:40,00:17:46,and he flies in a jumpsuit with the name Iceman in a reference to Val Kilmer from Top Gun.
00:17:46,00:17:51,"Well, the backwards Iceman reads, I am a twat."
00:17:51,00:17:52,Jokes on him.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Yeah.
00:17:53,00:17:56,"Did you guys hear about these sort of very ancient yachts that were like Roman, Roman"
00:17:56,00:17:57,yachts?
00:17:57,00:17:58,No.
00:17:58,00:18:04,"So Caligula had a, the Emperor Caligula had some pleasure barges, basically, which were"
00:18:04,00:18:07,kind of the ancient world equivalent of yachts.
00:18:07,00:18:12,"So the historian Suetonius writes about them, there were 10 banks of oars, which is a lot."
00:18:12,00:18:18,"They were about 240 feet long, they were used mostly for parties, they were kind of stationary."
00:18:18,00:18:21,"I think they were on a lake actually, a lake in Italy."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"Anyway, Emperor Caligula commissioned them, and he only got to enjoy them for a year because"
00:18:24,00:18:29,he was then stabbed to death by his senators and his own guards and everyone else.
00:18:29,00:18:35,"But, I know, sad, but they were drenched by Mussolini in the 1930s."
00:18:35,00:18:39,"Also spoiler alert, not a great ending ahead for Mussolini."
00:18:39,00:18:42,"But this is the, okay, this is the amazing thing about these yachts, because they were"
00:18:42,00:18:45,"luxurious, they were real, they sank, their location was known, and they were drenched,"
00:18:45,00:18:46,right?
00:18:46,00:18:49,"There were some mosaics, beautiful mosaics, which had been drenched up."
00:18:49,00:18:53,"And around the end of the Second World War, a lot of stuff was going missing across Europe,"
00:18:53,00:19:00,"and one of the mosaics just went AWOL, and it was never seen or heard of again, until"
00:19:00,00:19:06,"in New York, this was a couple of years ago, there was a book signing by a guy who'd written"
00:19:06,00:19:10,"a book about Italian marbles, and as he was sitting at the table doing his signing, he"
00:19:10,00:19:14,"overheard a couple standing nearby, one of them said to the other, ""Oh, Helen, look,"
00:19:14,00:19:17,"that's your mosaic."""
00:19:17,00:19:21,"And a New York couple had bought it, not knowing where it was from, and for the last 45 years"
00:19:21,00:19:24,they'd been using it as a coffee table.
00:19:24,00:19:28,"Yeah, Helen's my auntie."
00:19:28,00:19:31,That is amazing.
00:19:31,00:19:35,"So now it's got coffee stains, beautifully woven into the chair."
00:19:35,00:19:38,"I think it was repatriated, though, I think it was agreed that they probably shouldn't"
00:19:38,00:19:40,"be able to keep it, and so it was sent back to Italy."
00:19:40,00:19:42,"Did they get a replacement table, at least?"
00:19:42,00:19:44,I'm sure they did.
00:19:44,00:19:47,"I said before they're bad for the environment yachts, and I think they are, I mean, they"
00:19:47,00:19:52,"use a lot of oil and stuff, and they have big anchors that can get rid of the seagrass"
00:19:52,00:19:54,"and the bottom of the sea, stuff like that."
00:19:54,00:19:57,Jeff Bezos has got a new yacht.
00:19:57,00:20:00,"A big anchor himself, I would say."
00:20:00,00:20:03,Massive anchor.
00:20:03,00:20:06,He's kind of a very powerful man.
00:20:06,00:20:08,"Complete anchor, yeah, yeah."
00:20:08,00:20:11,"And his relies on wind power, which is quite good."
00:20:11,00:20:16,"Unfortunately, it has to be followed everywhere by a diesel-engined support vessel that carries"
00:20:16,00:20:20,all of his supplies and also has his helicopter pad.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Wow.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"Yachts in waiting is a thing that is mad, and the biggest super yachts have these other"
00:20:25,00:20:31,"yachts that follow them around, which I guess this is one of, and they have everything right."
00:20:31,00:20:34,They have additional accommodation for the slightly less-favoured guests.
00:20:34,00:20:37,"The crew will stay on them, and they also contain all the toys."
00:20:37,00:20:41,"Now, if you're ever invited onto a yacht, I just think this is going to help you out"
00:20:41,00:20:42,in terms of terminology.
00:20:42,00:20:43,Do you know what the toys are?
00:20:43,00:20:44,Of course.
00:20:44,00:20:45,Yeah.
00:20:45,00:20:46,Of course.
00:20:46,00:20:47,Grow up on them.
00:20:47,00:20:48,"No, they're jet skis and stuff like that, right?"
00:20:48,00:20:49,Yeah.
00:20:49,00:20:50,According to the article.
00:20:50,00:20:51,But the large rubber ducks.
00:20:51,00:20:52,Yeah.
00:20:52,00:20:53,Exactly.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"Oh, really?"
00:20:54,00:20:55,"Oh, right."
00:20:55,00:20:56,"Sorry, yeah, yeah."
00:20:56,00:20:57,"The jet skis, banana boats, that's, I thought, I thought there was, you know, they refer to"
00:20:57,00:20:58,as the toys are kept in here.
00:20:58,00:20:59,All the entertainment.
00:20:59,00:21:00,"They're massive as well, aren't they?"
00:21:00,00:21:01,Yeah.
00:21:01,00:21:04,"They are bigger than your average boat, and this is the thing trawling behind."
00:21:04,00:21:07,Tits apparently had two trawling behind it.
00:21:07,00:21:12,"They were supposedly called Nipple One and Nipple Two, but, yeah, it's wild."
00:21:12,00:21:14,You can't just buy a yacht.
00:21:14,00:21:18,You have to buy the follow-up yachts to carry all the stuff for your yacht.
00:21:18,00:21:19,It's so annoying.
00:21:19,00:21:22,"It's like getting an app, like a game app, and then you have to pay for all the, I mean,"
00:21:22,00:21:23,I don't do this.
00:21:23,00:21:25,"I don't quite know how it works, but you have to pay for it."
00:21:25,00:21:26,I think that's pretty clear.
00:21:26,00:21:27,Yeah.
00:21:27,00:21:29,"But it's like, I think it's all like, once a yacht salesman to see that you can afford"
00:21:29,00:21:34,"a yacht, they probably think, ""Well, we could probably sell this guy another yacht."""
00:21:34,00:21:39,"This is, again, slightly old-fashioned, like sailing yachts, you know, not super yachts"
00:21:39,00:21:41,"or mega yachts, just old-school, nice yachts."
00:21:41,00:21:45,"There is a yacht club, which has been going since 1984, called the Southwest Chingles"
00:21:45,00:21:46,Yacht Club.
00:21:46,00:21:47,It is very exclusive.
00:21:47,00:21:51,"It's invitation-only, founded by a yachtsman called David Latchford, and it is for people"
00:21:51,00:21:56,who have massively screwed up sailing their ships or yachts.
00:21:56,00:21:57,Right.
00:21:57,00:21:58,So he pranked a boy.
00:21:58,00:21:59,He won't.
00:21:59,00:22:00,What?
00:22:00,00:22:01,A B-U-O-Y.
00:22:01,00:22:02,A boy.
00:22:02,00:22:03,Boy.
00:22:03,00:22:04,Boy.
00:22:04,00:22:05,Boy.
00:22:05,00:22:06,Boy.
00:22:06,00:22:07,Boy.
00:22:07,00:22:08,Boy.
00:22:08,00:22:09,You have to say it in a New Jersey accent.
00:22:09,00:22:10,A boy.
00:22:10,00:22:16,"He pranked, he pranked a boy and he, it's very embarrassing, it's broad daylight."
00:22:16,00:22:18,You're not meant to bump into the boys.
00:22:18,00:22:21,"And so he did that and he saw, ""Oh, I found this club."""
00:22:21,00:22:23,And he has incredibly eminent people who are now members of the club.
00:22:23,00:22:27,"Like, there was the commander of a Royal Navy submarine who hit a rock in Scotland in"
00:22:27,00:22:30,"clear daylight, which is a big no-no."
00:22:30,00:22:32,A Royal Navy commander who hit London Bridge.
00:22:32,00:22:33,Yikes.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"Oh, really bad."
00:22:35,00:22:39,"And it also has some genuine sort of yachting heroes, like there's a guy called Tony Bullymour"
00:22:39,00:22:44,"who was his yacht capsized when he was on, I think, a yachting race across the oceans."
00:22:44,00:22:47,And he spent four days under his own yacht in an air pocket.
00:22:47,00:22:48,Four days?
00:22:48,00:22:49,Four days.
00:22:49,00:22:51,And then he was rescued and he survived.
00:22:51,00:22:52,Wow.
00:22:52,00:22:53,"And he was, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:22:53,00:22:54,What kind of luxury stuff did he have under there?
00:22:54,00:22:58,It was like he had the full dining table and a gym that he could exercise on.
00:22:58,00:22:59,"Again, sailing yacht."
00:22:59,00:23:00,Very different.
00:23:00,00:23:01,Very different thing.
00:23:01,00:23:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:02,00:23:06,"Crew ships are like yachts that poor people can afford to go on, like me."
00:23:06,00:23:07,Yep.
00:23:07,00:23:11,The biggest crew ship was unveiled by the Royal Caribbean this year.
00:23:11,00:23:14,It was called the Icon of the Seas.
00:23:14,00:23:20,"It can carry 7,600 passengers and 2,350 crew members."
00:23:20,00:23:25,That's the same as the population of Sirencesta in Roman times.
00:23:25,00:23:29,Thank you so much for that vital context.
00:23:29,00:23:36,"Its gross tonnage is 250,000 tonnes, which is the same as all the cars in Surrey that"
00:23:36,00:23:40,is Ules compliant.
00:23:40,00:23:47,"And it's 360 metres long, which is the same as the length of the furthest golf shot at"
00:23:47,00:23:51,the 2023 World Long Drive Championships.
00:23:51,00:23:52,So just so you know exactly.
00:23:52,00:23:53,"Thanks, James."
00:23:53,00:23:54,Yeah.
00:23:54,00:23:55,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:55,00:23:56,"We're going to have to move on in a second, guys."
00:23:56,00:24:02,"Actually, just on Beasles's yacht, James mentioned earlier, when he first had it made, because"
00:24:02,00:24:06,a lot of these yachts have been made quite recently.
00:24:06,00:24:11,"It's called the Coru, I think, and it was made in the Netherlands near Rotterdam."
00:24:11,00:24:15,"And to leave the place where it was being made, he had to get through the Icon of the Seas"
00:24:15,00:24:21,"and Bridge, and that was too low for his yacht, which was going to be the tallest boat in"
00:24:21,00:24:22,the world to get past.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"So he said, ""Could I dismantle the bridge?"""
00:24:24,00:24:29,"Now this bridge was built in 1927, it's a heritage site, it's a very historic building."
00:24:29,00:24:33,"Obviously the people of Rotterdam said, ""Absolutely not, sod off, mate."""
00:24:33,00:24:34,And so he was trapped.
00:24:34,00:24:39,So there was a period where Jeff Beasles had this gigantic soupy yacht stuck in a little
00:24:39,00:24:43,"kind of harbor somewhere in London, the Netherlands, and then he just realised he could take the"
00:24:43,00:24:44,mast down.
00:24:44,00:24:45,Right.
00:24:45,00:24:56,That's that brilliant business acumen that's got him where he is today.
00:24:56,00:25:02,"It is time for fact number three, and that is my fact, and my fact this week is that"
00:25:02,00:25:08,the reason that the band Ace of Bass became successful is because a cassette of their
00:25:08,00:25:13,"music got stuck in a producer's car, and after two weeks of having nothing else to"
00:25:13,00:25:19,"listen to, he went from hating it to liking it."
00:25:19,00:25:23,"And he was like, ""It's a sign!"""
00:25:23,00:25:24,"I saw the sign, yes."
00:25:24,00:25:27,Now it's one of their songs.
00:25:27,00:25:28,That's one of their songs.
00:25:28,00:25:32,I had to play Ace of Bass to Andy backstage here.
00:25:32,00:25:33,You hadn't heard it before.
00:25:33,00:25:34,"No, and you were playing me The Biggie, weren't you?"
00:25:34,00:25:35,I was.
00:25:35,00:25:36,I was playing him The Biggie.
00:25:36,00:25:37,I'm having another baby?
00:25:37,00:25:38,"No, I want you to have another baby."
00:25:38,00:25:40,She wants another baby.
00:25:40,00:25:41,What is it?
00:25:41,00:25:44,All she wants is a baby.
00:25:44,00:25:47,She wants a baby for him.
00:25:47,00:25:50,All that she wants is another baby.
00:25:50,00:25:51,Another baby?
00:25:51,00:25:53,I haven't had a say.
00:25:53,00:25:55,She's got six already.
00:25:55,00:25:58,"Do they specify the song, how many babies she already has?"
00:25:58,00:25:59,We don't know.
00:25:59,00:26:05,I don't think anyone's listened to the lyrics ever of any of their songs.
00:26:05,00:26:06,"But listen, this is a..."
00:26:06,00:26:08,Do you mean either of their songs?
00:26:08,00:26:11,"Well, there's also Don't Turn Around."
00:26:11,00:26:15,"Which I imagine if he played that in his cassette and he had his GPS on and they were going,"
00:26:15,00:26:16,"""Please turn around."""
00:26:16,00:26:20,"And the song's going, ""Don't turn around, please turn around, don't turn around."""
00:26:20,00:26:23,No one's made any Ace of Bass jokes for about 30 years.
00:26:23,00:26:24,"Yeah, yeah."
00:26:24,00:26:25,We've got to dust them off.
00:26:25,00:26:29,"And look, we joke about it, but I remember being a 12-year-old kid, absolutely loved."
00:26:29,00:26:34,"I remember sitting on my buddy's yacht, just going, ""Fang that tune."""
00:26:34,00:26:38,"It was, that was a big cassette back in the day."
00:26:38,00:26:39,And it's not just me who liked it.
00:26:39,00:26:42,It was the best-selling album of 1994.
00:26:42,00:26:45,One of the most successful debut albums of all time.
00:26:45,00:26:52,"And it was all because this producer, Dennis Pop, he was a 28-year-old pop producer living"
00:26:52,00:26:53,in Sweden.
00:26:53,00:26:57,"And he got given this tape and they were like, ""Please listen to it."""
00:26:57,00:26:58,He put it in his car.
00:26:58,00:27:01,"And as I said, he went to eject it when he got home."
00:27:01,00:27:02,Really hating it.
00:27:02,00:27:03,Thought this was terrible.
00:27:03,00:27:04,And it just wouldn't come out.
00:27:04,00:27:05,It wouldn't come out.
00:27:05,00:27:09,"And by weird coincidence, his radio was broken at the same time."
00:27:09,00:27:11,So he had nothing else to listen to.
00:27:11,00:27:15,"And every day, he would pick up a mate of his who was also in the music business."
00:27:15,00:27:18,"And as a joke, they would just listen to it on the way to work, just mocking it."
00:27:18,00:27:21,"Just go, ""God damn it, this is so bad."""
00:27:21,00:27:24,"And then as the weeks went on, he was like, ""Hang on, there's a bit of a hook there."""
00:27:24,00:27:27,"And by the end of the two weeks, he went, ""This is a hit."""
00:27:27,00:27:34,"And the song was called ""Mr. Ace,"" which is then retitled to all that she wants."
00:27:34,00:27:36,So that was the song.
00:27:36,00:27:39,"I think they were already famous-ish, weren't they?"
00:27:39,00:27:43,They'd had a number two hit in Denmark.
00:27:43,00:27:45,So they were pretty big too.
00:27:45,00:27:46,They were kind of big.
00:27:46,00:27:49,"But then he was the one who made them so big, they were massive in America."
00:27:49,00:27:54,"They had a number one album in America, which no Swedish band had ever had, including ABBA."
00:27:54,00:27:55,Yeah.
00:27:55,00:27:58,"And this is all thanks to this guy, Dennis Pop."
00:27:58,00:27:59,Dennis.
00:27:59,00:28:00,Dennis Pop.
00:28:00,00:28:01,With a Z at the end.
00:28:01,00:28:02,That's why we're saying it weird.
00:28:02,00:28:03,Yeah.
00:28:03,00:28:06,And I know him as the other half of the production team.
00:28:06,00:28:12,"He worked with Max Martin, who is, I believe, a very famous music producer, who made everything"
00:28:12,00:28:16,"from baby one more time through to ""Shake It Off"" and beyond, and they have this amazing"
00:28:16,00:28:18,method of recording songs.
00:28:18,00:28:20,All that she wants is another baby and baby one more time.
00:28:20,00:28:23,Is that also about wanting another baby?
00:28:23,00:28:24,"And weirdly, so is ""Shake It Off."""
00:28:24,00:28:25,Yeah.
00:28:25,00:28:26,Oh my God.
00:28:26,00:28:34,"It wasn't meant to be rude, but it's become rude."
00:28:34,00:28:38,"And so Max Martin, who incidentally started off on the French horn, which is interesting."
00:28:38,00:28:39,That's interesting.
00:28:39,00:28:40,A bit of information.
00:28:40,00:28:43,"Dennis Pop, by the way, couldn't play any instruments."
00:28:43,00:28:44,Really?
00:28:44,00:28:49,"No, he started taking the recorder when he was a child, but gave up after three attempts,"
00:28:49,00:28:51,because he thought musical instruments were boring.
00:28:51,00:28:54,But you don't have to play musical instruments to make pop songs.
00:28:54,00:28:55,You do not.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"He is, as you say, he made those hits."
00:28:58,00:29:03,"But really, if you look at the list, every single catchy, slightly trashy song that you're"
00:29:03,00:29:09,a bit embarrassed that you love from the last 30 years is basically written by Max Martin.
00:29:09,00:29:15,"It's so weird, like Maroon 5, Backstreet Boys 5, Pink, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Ariana Grande,"
00:29:15,00:29:17,name anyone with catchy songs.
00:29:17,00:29:20,They were all Taylor Swift.
00:29:20,00:29:21,Taylor Swift.
00:29:21,00:29:22,No.
00:29:22,00:29:23,He's written for Taylor Swift.
00:29:23,00:29:24,I'm so sorry to say it.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Hechler in the audience.
00:29:25,00:29:31,"Can someone get Kea Star Morale up here, please?"
00:29:31,00:29:34,It is crazy.
00:29:34,00:29:35,It is crazy.
00:29:35,00:29:40,"Also, they're a band of siblings, so three of them were related to each other."
00:29:40,00:29:41,Ace of Bays.
00:29:41,00:29:42,"Sorry, jumping back to Ace of Bays."
00:29:42,00:29:46,"Yeah, so you had Jonas, you had Lynn, and you had Jenny, and then they had a cousin,"
00:29:46,00:29:47,Ulf.
00:29:47,00:29:48,But they were siblings.
00:29:48,00:29:49,They were like the Jonas brothers.
00:29:49,00:29:55,"Actually, like literally, there was a Jonas brother in the band itself."
00:29:55,00:30:01,"And then the one person who wasn't a brother or sister was Nazi, I think, wasn't he?"
00:30:01,00:30:03,He wasn't a Nazi.
00:30:03,00:30:08,"Well, what was his yacht called?"
00:30:08,00:30:13,"He was called Ulf Eppurg, and he, as a child, had been a skinhead."
00:30:13,00:30:14,Or not a child.
00:30:14,00:30:15,It's a teenager.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"I mean, old children are right at the beginning of skinheads."
00:30:19,00:30:23,"""Oh, we've given birth to a Nazi!"""
00:30:23,00:30:30,"Oh, my God, yeah, as a teenager, he was a skinhead, and he later said that he regretted"
00:30:30,00:30:35,it and that actually Ace of Bays is supposed to be inclusive and lovely and everything.
00:30:35,00:30:37,"Well, all she wants is another baby."
00:30:37,00:30:43,It does sound like it's the Kinderkirche Kuche model of pro-Aryan family structure.
00:30:43,00:30:45,"So, anyway..."
00:30:45,00:30:49,I won't be a part of this conspiracy theory.
00:30:49,00:30:53,"I know we're talking about Dennis Poppin music production, but just Dan, as you mentioned,"
00:30:53,00:30:54,family bands.
00:30:54,00:30:55,Yeah.
00:30:55,00:30:59,"So I was reading the list of music considered the worst on Wikipedia, which is a real article,"
00:30:59,00:31:00,very good.
00:31:00,00:31:03,And it contains this band called The Shags.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"Oh, yeah, The Shags."
00:31:05,00:31:10,"So, 1969 album, I think it was the debut called Philosophy of the World, they were a band"
00:31:10,00:31:12,"of three sisters, right?"
00:31:12,00:31:16,And what marked them out as unusual in the music world is that they had no interest
00:31:16,00:31:25,"in being in a band, but their father's mother was a fortune teller and had told her son,"
00:31:25,00:31:28,"their dad, ""You will have some daughters,"" and they were going to form the greatest music"
00:31:28,00:31:30,group on the planet's history.
00:31:30,00:31:31,Wow.
00:31:31,00:31:35,"And their dad basically insisted they become musicians off the back of it, and they were"
00:31:35,00:31:36,not good.
00:31:36,00:31:37,Really?
00:31:37,00:31:42,"They apparently composed, I'm quoting here, ""bizarre songs with untuned guitars, erratic"
00:31:42,00:31:47,"time signatures, disconnected rhythms, wandering melodies, and rudimentary lyrics about pets."""
00:31:47,00:31:52,"They were cool though, they had attitude, they were awesome."
00:31:52,00:32:00,"People who were thought to be shit at first, actually, band origins."
00:32:00,00:32:05,"So where band started, Fleetwood Mac, similar kind of area to Ace of Base, did we say?"
00:32:05,00:32:08,I'm sure their fans would agree.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"Okay, cool."
00:32:09,00:32:12,I'm guessing that they were a band.
00:32:12,00:32:13,Yeah.
00:32:13,00:32:15,"Do you know who they're named after, Fleetwood Mac?"
00:32:15,00:32:16,"Yes, about, yeah."
00:32:16,00:32:20,"Well, they're named after two of the members, so if you know them, you'll know, Mick Fleetwood"
00:32:20,00:32:21,and John McVeigh.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"But McVeigh, the Mac, wasn't in the band when they started."
00:32:25,00:32:29,They basically named it Fleetwood Mac to lure him into the band.
00:32:29,00:32:30,No.
00:32:30,00:32:34,"So it was started by Peter Green as the other one, Peter Green and Fleetwood formed this"
00:32:34,00:32:39,"band, and they had been in a band with McVeigh, and McVeigh was like, ""I like the old band,"
00:32:39,00:32:44,"it's regular income, I'm staying here,"" and they called it Fleetwood Mac in order to persuade"
00:32:44,00:32:45,him.
00:32:45,00:32:46,That's amazing.
00:32:46,00:32:47,"They named a band after you now, mate."
00:32:47,00:32:48,"No, that is emotional, blackmail, I would say."
00:32:48,00:32:49,That's good.
00:32:49,00:32:50,Very clever.
00:32:50,00:32:51,Yeah.
00:32:51,00:32:54,"Simon and Garfield Cole weren't originally called Simon and Garfield Cole, were they,"
00:32:54,00:32:55,the band?
00:32:55,00:32:56,Really?
00:32:56,00:32:57,No.
00:32:57,00:33:01,"They didn't like their names, and so they changed their name to John Landis and Tom"
00:33:01,00:33:06,"Graff and called themselves Tom and Jerry, and Paul Simon changed his name to John Landis"
00:33:06,00:33:11,"because it was a girl that he had a crush on, was called Landis, and now Garfield Cole"
00:33:11,00:33:14,called himself Tom Graff because he really liked Graffs.
00:33:14,00:33:15,Wow.
00:33:15,00:33:16,Wow.
00:33:16,00:33:17,Nothing is...
00:33:17,00:33:18,Really?
00:33:18,00:33:19,Yeah.
00:33:19,00:33:23,"He used to do, like, he used to do, like, Graffs of how many records people were selling and"
00:33:23,00:33:24,stuff like that.
00:33:24,00:33:27,Do you know the band Joanna Gruesome?
00:33:27,00:33:28,No.
00:33:28,00:33:32,"They're pretty obscure, but I do love the way they found each other as bandmates."
00:33:32,00:33:37,They were all sent to the same anger management course.
00:33:37,00:33:38,"Oh, wow."
00:33:38,00:33:39,How good is that?
00:33:39,00:33:40,Yeah.
00:33:40,00:33:41,They were incredibly angry teenagers.
00:33:41,00:33:44,"They were at school, and they all got sent there."
00:33:44,00:33:45,"Hi, everybody."
00:33:45,00:33:46,Andy here.
00:33:46,00:33:48,"What a great fact about Joanna Gruesome that just was, right?"
00:33:48,00:33:52,"Well, there's only one problem, which is that it turns out it actually wasn't true."
00:33:52,00:33:56,There was someone in the audience at this gig who sent us an email.
00:33:56,00:34:01,"He's called George Ford, and he wrote, ""Hi, I was at your show on the 23rd of October,"
00:34:01,00:34:06,but the Joanna Gruesome fact of the band forming an anger management class is not correct.
00:34:06,00:34:08,They made this up for an interview.
00:34:08,00:34:12,"This was because they had no original formation, apart from just being friends."
00:34:12,00:34:17,My source is that the drummer was my design technology technician when I was at Heathside
00:34:17,00:34:19,"School in Weybridge."""
00:34:19,00:34:20,So that's from George.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"So sorry, that is not true."
00:34:22,00:34:26,"It's not true at all, and we thought we could either snip it out or record a bit of extra"
00:34:26,00:34:30,"bonus information, just a little bit of how the sausage gets made."
00:34:30,00:34:31,"Okay, back to the show."
00:34:31,00:34:32,Cheers.
00:34:32,00:34:33,Bye.
00:34:33,00:34:34,Pet Shop Boys.
00:34:34,00:34:35,How did they meet?
00:34:35,00:34:36,Is it in a pet shop?
00:34:36,00:34:37,It was at an electronics shop.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Really?
00:34:38,00:34:39,Harry Styles' bandmate Mitch.
00:34:39,00:34:42,Do you know how Harry Styles found Mitch?
00:34:42,00:34:43,In an advert?
00:34:43,00:34:44,They're usually in an advert?
00:34:44,00:34:45,In a pizza shop.
00:34:45,00:34:46,"A pizza shop, really?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,They just met at a pizza shop.
00:34:48,00:34:51,"Was he, hang on, was he like a musician, or was he making?"
00:34:51,00:34:52,He probably is a musician.
00:34:52,00:34:53,Okay.
00:34:53,00:34:57,"He wasn't making him a pizza, and Harry Styles looked at the way he made pizza and went,"
00:34:57,00:34:58,"""Do you know what those sounds would be great at?"
00:34:58,00:34:59,"Playing guitar."""
00:34:59,00:35:04,"When you finished arranging the pepperoni on that, coming to range, some great new songs."
00:35:04,00:35:05,My tunes.
00:35:05,00:35:06,Yeah.
00:35:06,00:35:07,I don't know about music.
00:35:07,00:35:10,It's becoming increasingly clear that none of us does.
00:35:10,00:35:11,I know.
00:35:11,00:35:15,"Actually, there's one more Swedish band, which I think I'd heard of."
00:35:15,00:35:20,"So, obviously, we've got Abo, we've got AcerBase, and The Hives, I think, a moderately famous"
00:35:20,00:35:21,Swedish band.
00:35:21,00:35:25,"They sung, I hate to say, I told you so, and do you know who all their songs are written"
00:35:25,00:35:26,by?
00:35:26,00:35:29,I thought they wrote them themselves.
00:35:29,00:35:30,"Well, they did not."
00:35:30,00:35:34,"They're all written by someone called Randy Fitzsimmons, and that's the reason they exist"
00:35:34,00:35:37,is because they once got a letter in the post from this Randy Fitzsimmons telling them to
00:35:37,00:35:42,"meet up in a certain place and form a band saying, ""You'll be massive if you do this."""
00:35:42,00:35:46,"This is in 1993, and he said, ""I've got all these tunes in nine for you,"" and he started"
00:35:46,00:35:51,"writing them songs, and he's written them songs ever since, and even up until very recently,"
00:35:51,00:35:54,"all the songs were credited to Randy Fitzsimmons, who wrote them."
00:35:54,00:35:56,No one knows who this person is.
00:35:56,00:36:01,"I think their latest album is called The Death of Randy Fitzsimmons, which is, and all the"
00:36:01,00:36:05,"music on that was composed by Chip, Montgomery, and Wilbur Fitzsimmons."
00:36:05,00:36:06,"Wait, what's going on?"
00:36:06,00:36:07,This is bullshit.
00:36:07,00:36:08,Is it?
00:36:08,00:36:11,Did they make him up?
00:36:11,00:36:15,"I think they made him up, yeah, but they've never admitted they made him up."
00:36:15,00:36:18,It's possible that Randy Fitzsimmons is just a great music writer.
00:36:18,00:36:20,Have you got any real facts?
00:36:20,00:36:21,Fake yachts?
00:36:21,00:36:22,Fake songwriters?
00:36:22,00:36:26,We've got a lot of stuff about how bands started.
00:36:26,00:36:29,I thought I'd look at what happened after they left.
00:36:29,00:36:35,"So these are people who were kind of big when I was younger, the cheeky girls."
00:36:35,00:36:39,They're now both working as second-hand car dealers.
00:36:39,00:36:40,Get out.
00:36:40,00:36:41,Yeah.
00:36:41,00:36:47,"One of them works in a Hyundai dealership in York, and the other one works in Lincolnshire."
00:36:47,00:36:48,What kind of dealership?
00:36:48,00:36:49,I didn't write it down.
00:36:49,00:36:53,"I think she might have got her sister the job, so I think it might also be Hyundai."
00:36:53,00:36:55,"Well, that would make sense, yeah?"
00:36:55,00:36:57,"Yeah, a bit cheeky."
00:36:57,00:37:04,"Lisa from Steps is now a head teacher at a school in Dubai, and Abs from Five went on"
00:37:04,00:37:11,"to become a farmer, but then in 2021 he said, ""The animals just all died."""
00:37:11,00:37:12,They all meant to.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"When you were a farmer, the plants weren't growing anymore."
00:37:15,00:37:21,"I'm a rubbish farmer, so I'm back in London."
00:37:21,00:37:25,"Because you're so right, Anna, like, the animals all died, could be the best farmer"
00:37:25,00:37:26,in the world.
00:37:26,00:37:31,"The animals all died on time and under budget, and they've become sausages."
00:37:31,00:37:35,"I think one of the favourite facts of our colleague Ann is about the origin, talking"
00:37:35,00:37:41,"of song origins, of the Hansen song Mbop, or what it means, and I just, I really enjoyed"
00:37:41,00:37:46,"an interview with Zach Hansen, who everyone will remember, who said, ""It's the most misunderstood"
00:37:46,00:37:49,"successful song of all time."""
00:37:49,00:37:50,And he said...
00:37:50,00:37:52,Is it about someone having another baby?
00:37:52,00:37:57,And that's the sound it makes.
00:37:57,00:38:02,Was that an impression of a woman in labour?
00:38:02,00:38:07,"I've not been at many births, but I go there, simple and relaxed affairs, I don't"
00:38:07,00:38:10,see it as a small...
00:38:10,00:38:13,"Makes sense, you're asked away outside."
00:38:13,00:38:15,That's not what it's about.
00:38:15,00:38:17,"Do people know what it means, Mbop?"
00:38:17,00:38:20,Because it just always makes me laugh.
00:38:20,00:38:24,"It represents a frame of time, and it's about how quickly time gets away from you, your"
00:38:24,00:38:26,life will disappear before you know it.
00:38:26,00:38:28,"In an Mbop, it's gone."
00:38:28,00:38:30,"Oh, that's deep."
00:38:30,00:38:32,It's so deep.
00:38:32,00:38:35,It's the deepest song you've ever heard without knowing it.
00:38:35,00:38:36,That's incredible.
00:38:36,00:38:37,It's really funny.
00:38:37,00:38:39,I still can't get over abs.
00:38:39,00:38:40,That's insane.
00:38:40,00:38:57,"He just decimated this whole farm, and then went back to London."
00:38:57,00:39:01,"We need to move on to our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:39:01,00:39:10,"OK, my fact this week is that being visited by a clown can help you get pregnant."
00:39:10,00:39:12,This gives you your answer to how she gets another baby.
00:39:12,00:39:15,That's not the first.
00:39:15,00:39:18,"Look, what does the clown have to do?"
00:39:18,00:39:24,"Well, it could be one sexy clown, he just goes around having sex with people, but no,"
00:39:24,00:39:27,they just need to clown around.
00:39:27,00:39:31,"It sounds sexy when you say clown around, it's never sounded sexy before."
00:39:31,00:39:36,"It didn't sound sexy to me, just to me."
00:39:36,00:39:43,"So this is from Benefits of Medical Clowning, a summary of the research by Amy J. Stephson."
00:39:43,00:39:51,"She references a 2011 study by S. Friedler, and they looked at 219 patients, 110 of whom"
00:39:51,00:39:57,"interacted with medical clowns, 109 who didn't, and the pregnancy rate in the clown group"
00:39:57,00:40:05,"was 36.4% compared to 20.2% in the control group, and that gave the clown group twice"
00:40:05,00:40:06,the odds of pregnancy.
00:40:06,00:40:07,So it was significant.
00:40:07,00:40:08,That's mega.
00:40:08,00:40:12,"And when they interacted with them, were they just doing clown stuff, like nose honking"
00:40:12,00:40:16,"and car stuffing and what have you, that's it?"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"Now it does sound sexy, I must say."
00:40:18,00:40:27,How many clowns can you fit in this phone box?
00:40:27,00:40:31,"They were just doing clowny stuff, and like you say it like, ah, ah, ah, ah, that kind"
00:40:31,00:40:32,of thing.
00:40:32,00:40:36,"On the left one, or the right one, or..."
00:40:36,00:40:43,"It's because I just didn't know that they were such an established thing, medical clowns,"
00:40:43,00:40:44,you say it.
00:40:44,00:40:45,They really are.
00:40:45,00:40:49,"But medical clowns are brought in, largely for children, right?"
00:40:49,00:40:54,"Hippocrates had clowns in ancient Greece, yeah, he had his own hospital on the island"
00:40:54,00:40:59,"of Kos, and he had constant troops of players and clowns who would come and play to the"
00:40:59,00:41:01,people to keep them happy.
00:41:01,00:41:05,"So in this study by S. Friedler, they said we are very surprised by the results, and"
00:41:05,00:41:11,"frankly, we can't explain it, but one theory that they had was maybe that stress reduction"
00:41:11,00:41:15,"might improve fertility, so you're a bit less stressed."
00:41:15,00:41:19,"They are extremely beneficial in other ways, and it is largely with children that they're"
00:41:19,00:41:23,"used, understandably, but there was a study that followed 51 children with pneumonia who"
00:41:23,00:41:28,"got, as well as getting ordinary treatment, got 15-minute visits from a medical clown"
00:41:28,00:41:31,"twice a day, and then it had the same number of children who didn't get the visits but"
00:41:31,00:41:36,"still had the treatment, and it was pretty much like half the length of time that the"
00:41:36,00:41:38,ones who were visited by the clown stayed in hospital.
00:41:38,00:41:44,"I know that sounds like they just said please get me out of here, but they were discharged"
00:41:44,00:41:45,sensibly.
00:41:45,00:41:50,They needed only two days of antibiotics compared to three days for those who hadn't had the
00:41:50,00:41:52,"clown, so they have an amazing impact."
00:41:52,00:41:59,"They also use them during pre-operative anesthesia, so as you're going down, you'll turn and"
00:41:59,00:42:06,"they'll just be a clown staring at you, and apparently that reduces stress and anxiety"
00:42:06,00:42:10,"as opposed to making you going, ""Wait, hang on one moment!"""
00:42:10,00:42:15,"So I read that down, but I read a doctor saying that in some minor surgeries a clown replaces"
00:42:15,00:42:20,"general anesthesia, which I think cannot be correct."
00:42:20,00:42:24,"Can you imagine if a kid's cut their finger and you need to give them two stitches, maybe"
00:42:24,00:42:25,it's a look at the clown?
00:42:25,00:42:28,Why are you giving them general anesthesia for two stitches?
00:42:28,00:42:33,"It raises more questions than an answer, you know, and what's the one disease a clown"
00:42:33,00:42:35,cannot help?
00:42:35,00:42:39,"Something to do with the nose, alcoholism, because it's all in the nose, alcoholism,"
00:42:39,00:42:40,it just gets better.
00:42:40,00:42:41,It's like chronic laughter.
00:42:41,00:42:42,Bingo.
00:42:42,00:42:43,Is it?
00:42:43,00:42:44,Oh!
00:42:44,00:42:49,This was a patient who lived in Hawaii and he had suffered uncontrollable lifelong laughter.
00:42:49,00:42:52,"He was 40, and from the age of eight he'd just been laughing, pretty much non-stop."
00:42:52,00:42:55,"Oh my God, did something happen when he was eight?"
00:42:55,00:42:58,That was just like the funniest thing that ever happened.
00:42:58,00:42:59,No.
00:42:59,00:43:04,"What it is, is he contracted a small non-cancerous tumour on his brain."
00:43:04,00:43:06,That's almost the opposite of funny.
00:43:06,00:43:07,It's the opposite of funny.
00:43:07,00:43:08,Yeah.
00:43:08,00:43:11,Can we say he went to see a Jimmy Carr?
00:43:11,00:43:13,Maybe just...
00:43:13,00:43:20,"No, it's a thing called a 'gelastic seizure', and 'gelastic' is the word for 'related"
00:43:20,00:43:21,to laughter'.
00:43:21,00:43:23,"Because I think 'ageelastic' means you can't laugh, right?"
00:43:23,00:43:28,"Exactly, and this guy was very 'gelastic' indeed, and it turns out it was due to a hypothalamic"
00:43:28,00:43:34,"haematoma, which is not funny, but was operable and so could be cured, but not by a clown."
00:43:34,00:43:35,That's nice.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"But when he'd been cured, did he never laugh again?"
00:43:37,00:43:42,"Well he just went to see Jimmy Carr, and that sorted him right out."
00:43:42,00:43:47,"There's a thing in New Zealand whereby, if you're about to be made redundant, you're"
00:43:47,00:43:51,"allowed to bring someone in to be a support friend, and there's a great story about a"
00:43:51,00:43:57,"guy who hired for $200 New Zealand a clown to come in with him, and so as the boss was"
00:43:57,00:44:02,"very sternly trying to tell him that he was no longer going to be employed by the company,"
00:44:02,00:44:09,"there was a man in full get-up next to him making balloon animals, and as he was told"
00:44:09,00:44:16,"and handed the sheet saying that he was going to be redundant, had the clown go 'ooh no!'"
00:44:16,00:44:19,doing the fake tears with his hand.
00:44:19,00:44:20,It's so good.
00:44:20,00:44:22,"I wrote about this guy too, Dad."
00:44:22,00:44:23,Josh Thompson is the name of the man.
00:44:23,00:44:25,The clown was called Joe.
00:44:25,00:44:29,"He had to be told to stop a few times the clown, because the squeaking of plastic as he made"
00:44:29,00:44:33,the balloon animals was too noisy for Josh to be fired.
00:44:33,00:44:34,It's just so good.
00:44:34,00:44:35,It's so amazing.
00:44:35,00:44:41,"I don't know, you guys know this about me, but one of my favourite things is whenever"
00:44:41,00:44:45,"a clown is put in a medical situation, so I'm probably the only person who loves the"
00:44:45,00:44:46,movie.
00:44:46,00:44:47,What?
00:44:47,00:44:49,It's not something that's why we know nothing about it.
00:44:49,00:44:50,"No, no, no."
00:44:50,00:44:51,Did you say we probably know this about you?
00:44:51,00:44:54,"Yeah, you know that MASH is my favourite TV series."
00:44:54,00:44:57,Describe Dan in one sense as well.
00:44:57,00:45:01,"Pat Chathams is one of my favourite movies, despite everyone hating that movie."
00:45:01,00:45:02,I absolutely loved it.
00:45:02,00:45:05,Pat Chathams is quite an interesting character.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"He's still alive, and he's quite alternative."
00:45:08,00:45:12,"I watched a YouTube video of him talking about the things he believes will cure stuff, so"
00:45:12,00:45:15,he doesn't really believe in depression.
00:45:15,00:45:17,He says you can avoid...
00:45:17,00:45:23,"And he has been severely depressed in his teens, to be fair to him, but he says things"
00:45:23,00:45:28,"like, you can avoid being depressed if you think about things like, what a beautiful"
00:45:28,00:45:34,"sunset, or if you take pleasure in stroking a purring cat."
00:45:34,00:45:38,"To hell with depression, just go out and sing to the world, hug a tree, and follow an ant"
00:45:38,00:45:39,as it walks across the ground.
00:45:39,00:45:40,There you go.
00:45:40,00:45:42,He's an interesting guy.
00:45:42,00:45:46,He named his first son Atomic Zagnut.
00:45:46,00:45:47,It's very interesting.
00:45:47,00:45:51,A lot of doctors do become clowns and they do go out into struggling countries that
00:45:51,00:45:52,are going through war and so on.
00:45:52,00:45:56,"There's one guy, Ping Pong, who's one of the clowns."
00:45:56,00:46:01,He had a thing where he was going through airport security and he got taken into a room
00:46:01,00:46:03,and they opened up his suitcase.
00:46:03,00:46:08,"And basically, they did it because he had 100 confetti cannons and all these ping pong"
00:46:08,00:46:11,balls and they didn't know what it was when they went through the scan.
00:46:11,00:46:14,"And according to Ping Pong, the guy went, what are you, some sort of clown?"
00:46:14,00:46:15,No.
00:46:15,00:46:19,"Laughter can be dangerous, though, kind of."
00:46:19,00:46:24,And there was a meta-analysis of 785 academic studies done by the University of Birmingham
00:46:24,00:46:32,"and they found that laughter can cause fainting, asthma, headaches, incontinence, dislocated"
00:46:32,00:46:34,"jaw, infectious diseases."
00:46:34,00:46:35,Hang on.
00:46:35,00:46:40,"That's the first one where I thought, I haven't actually done that."
00:46:40,00:46:42,How do you get an infectious disease when you're laughing?
00:46:42,00:46:46,"Well, if you're laughing so much, your mouth is open, isn't it?"
00:46:46,00:46:47,I was joking.
00:46:47,00:46:48,If you're near some other people.
00:46:48,00:46:52,"Basically, you're expelling more fine particulates from your mouth."
00:46:52,00:46:53,It is very dangerous.
00:46:53,00:46:54,Yeah.
00:46:54,00:46:58,"And there's a thing called Bohava's syndrome, which can rupture your esophagus if you laugh"
00:46:58,00:46:59,too much.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"And that is, that's actually fatal."
00:47:01,00:47:02,Wow.
00:47:02,00:47:03,Wow.
00:47:03,00:47:06,"So the rest of this show will be, no more jokes."
00:47:06,00:47:10,Do you know who's one of the chief villains for clowns?
00:47:10,00:47:11,The chief villains.
00:47:11,00:47:14,"Oh, one of the chief villains."
00:47:14,00:47:15,Is it someone else in the circus?
00:47:15,00:47:19,"Well, she was in a kind of circus, actually, a few years ago."
00:47:19,00:47:20,"Oh, Liz Truss?"
00:47:20,00:47:21,Thatcher?
00:47:21,00:47:22,Thatcher.
00:47:22,00:47:23,Margaret Thatcher.
00:47:23,00:47:24,Yeah.
00:47:24,00:47:31,"Do they just hate Thatcher because they love jumping on a bandwagon, squeezing into a car?"
00:47:31,00:47:36,"No, it's that in 1980, the clown's training school was closed due to government cuts,"
00:47:36,00:47:39,which was thanks to Margaret's pop.
00:47:39,00:47:43,"It wasn't like she said, shut these clowns down."
00:47:43,00:47:47,"But it was funded by the arts council, and there were some arts council cuts happening"
00:47:47,00:47:48,at the time.
00:47:48,00:47:53,"And she got a complaint about it from some children who said, why have you cut the clowns?"
00:47:53,00:47:56,"And she wrote back saying she was sorry that they were upset, but the clowns would continue"
00:47:56,00:47:59,receiving some kind of public funds.
00:47:59,00:48:01,"P.S., no more milk for you."
00:48:01,00:48:02,Bye.
00:48:02,00:48:06,There's a great story I write about Jimmy Hendricks.
00:48:06,00:48:11,"He was, for his first, I think it was his first tour in the UK, and he went to Liverpool."
00:48:11,00:48:17,"They did a gig, and they went to a bar afterwards, and the bartender was incredibly suspicious"
00:48:17,00:48:23,"of Jimmy Hendricks as he was walking in, and he went, we don't serve your kind here."
00:48:23,00:48:24,"And he went, what?"
00:48:24,00:48:27,"And it was a really intense moment, and everyone froze."
00:48:27,00:48:32,"And the bartender went, read the sign, buddy, and it read, no clowns allowed."
00:48:32,00:48:38,"And basically, Hendricks' 60s get-up, which was very flamboyant and colorful, and there"
00:48:38,00:48:39,was a circus up the road.
00:48:39,00:48:43,"The guy thought, wait, if I let you in, all the fucking clowns are going to come in here."
00:48:43,00:48:45,I don't want it being overrun.
00:48:45,00:48:46,Why?
00:48:46,00:48:48,"They'd have a sign made, say no clowns."
00:48:48,00:48:49,No clowns allowed.
00:48:49,00:48:51,How much clown-related trouble have they had?
00:48:51,00:48:55,"I think something had happened there, hadn't it, a few days earlier."
00:48:55,00:48:56,Yeah.
00:48:56,00:48:58,Do you know where the word clown comes from?
00:48:58,00:48:59,"Oh, no."
00:48:59,00:49:00,Clown.
00:49:00,00:49:01,No.
00:49:01,00:49:06,It's probably from the Danish klunt.
00:49:06,00:49:11,"Come on, guys, which means log or block, and then it meant like a blockhead, and then it"
00:49:11,00:49:13,meant like a silly person.
00:49:13,00:49:18,And some other words for clown in the Oxford English Dictionary.
00:49:18,00:49:26,"Bagpudding, clod hopper, cluster fist, lobcock, and Mary Andrew."
00:49:26,00:49:27,Oh!
00:49:27,00:49:28,Mary Andrew.
00:49:28,00:49:29,Mary Andrew.
00:49:29,00:49:31,Sometimes I feel like the OED doesn't have its finger on the pulse.
00:49:31,00:49:34,Do you ever get that?
00:49:34,00:49:38,"This fact was about getting pregnant, so I have a loosely related getting pregnant fact"
00:49:38,00:49:44,"that I happened upon this week, which is that everyone knows the 12 labours of Hercules,"
00:49:44,00:49:45,right?
00:49:45,00:49:46,"I mean, you don't have to recite them now."
00:49:46,00:49:47,I'm not going to test anyone.
00:49:47,00:49:51,"But like the clean out the stables and bring back the dog with three heads, Cerberus, and"
00:49:51,00:49:52,there's a river to--
00:49:52,00:49:53,Exactly.
00:49:53,00:49:54,"Something about a lion, maybe."
00:49:54,00:49:55,Kill the lion.
00:49:55,00:49:56,Exactly.
00:49:56,00:49:57,Kill the lion.
00:49:57,00:49:58,Do all the big stuff.
00:49:58,00:50:01,"So 12 labours of Hercules, these big things you have to do."
00:50:01,00:50:04,Who knows about the 13th labour of Hercules?
00:50:04,00:50:05,No.
00:50:05,00:50:09,"Well, this was written about the same time, and his 13th labour was to impregnate 50 women"
00:50:09,00:50:10,in one night.
00:50:10,00:50:11,Whoa!
00:50:11,00:50:15,I'm going to need a lot of clowns.
00:50:15,00:50:16,Yeah.
00:50:16,00:50:22,"That's 50 additional labours of Hercules, right?"
00:50:22,00:50:24,I think they counted as one 50th of a labour each.
00:50:24,00:50:25,"No, no, it's a labour."
00:50:25,00:50:26,Is that a labour?
00:50:26,00:50:28,Because you'd go into labour when you're--
00:50:28,00:50:29,Sorry.
00:50:29,00:50:30,"No, there's a pun."
00:50:30,00:50:31,No.
00:50:31,00:50:32,No.
00:50:32,00:50:41,That is it.
00:50:41,00:50:42,That is it.
00:50:42,00:50:43,That is all of our facts.
00:50:43,00:50:44,Thank you so much.
00:50:44,00:50:49,"We'll be back again next week with another episode, but very quickly, Drury Lane."
