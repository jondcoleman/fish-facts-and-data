00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:03,520
 Hey everyone, welcome to this week's episode of Fish!

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,080
 Before we get going, I just want to let you know that we have a really exciting guest on the show this week.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:16,520
 So Anna Tyshinski unfortunately is away, but in her place we have an absolute big dog of the popular science writing world.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,560
 It is the wonderful Ed Yong.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,760
 Ed Yong, I'm sure you must be aware of him.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,560
 We've certainly been littering his work all through the last eight years of fish recordings

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,560
 and anywhere that we can get our hands on any bit of writing from the guy we do.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,560
 Be it his tweets, his books, his articles for the Atlantic, which are absolutely just perfect science writing.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,680
 We track them all down and we mow through them.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,080
 Ed is also recently a Pulitzer Prize winner.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,600
 He got it for the category of explanatory journalism and it was for his coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:01:02,360
 And then on top of that, he's also a best-selling New York Times author with his latest book which is called "An Immense World - How Animal Senses Reveal the Hidden Realms Around Us".

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,760
 And you've got to say the subtitle in that slightly mysterious and I hope not too creepy kind of way because the book is just awesome.

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,600
 It's like a science fiction book, but everything is real.

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
 It's all about how animals perceive the world differently to us and all the incredible abilities that they have.

16
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 It's also the story of how scientists are looking into all of their abilities and trying to work out this any way that we can harness them and apply them to our own lives.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 It's just classic Ed Yong writing, it's so interesting, it's funny, it distills really hard science into really interesting anecdotes.

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 And it's just a wonderful book to read and have on your shelf.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
 So make sure to get your copy today.

20
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Okay, on with the show.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:55,600
 [Music]

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:05,600
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed locations around the world.

23
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,600
 My name is Dan Shriver, I am sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and special guest, it's Ed Yong.

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:20,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we go.

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,600
 Starting with fact number one, that is Ed.

26
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 My fact today is that when hummingbirds drink, their tongues split in two.

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 What?

28
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
 Yeah, that's also what I thought.

29
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 So this was a, hang on Ed, you mean snakes?

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
 No, I know you're a very eminent biological animal.

31
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,600
 And the other thing is, when they split in two, if they had like a bottle of Coca-Cola and a bottle of Fanta, would they be able to drink a little bit of each?

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,600
 They could not, unfortunately, because the splitting in two trick only works when the tongue actually hits nectar.

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:03,600
 So they can't like force the tongue to turn into a fork in midair. It's something that automatically happens whenever they take a drink.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,600
 It's amazing.

35
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 It is amazing and it's also completely different to how I think people thought that hummingbirds drink.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 I don't know if like any of you spend much of your time going around thinking, how do hummingbirds drink?

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:22,600
 But the traditional idea is that it worked through capillary action, which is what happens when you take a really thin straw and you put it in water.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
 A lot of the liquid just automatically rises up.

39
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 And that was like the textbook version for a long time.

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 But an ornithologist named Margaret Rubega realized that that just couldn't work because capillary action is very slow.

41
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 Hummingbirds are like famously very fast.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:48,600
 So she and her student, Alejandro Rico Guevara, set up this really convoluted filming system where they got these artificial glass flowers.

43
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 And then they use high-speed cameras to film hummingbirds drinking from that.

44
00:03:52,600 --> 00:04:00,600
 And when they looked at the footage, what they saw was that when the tongue hits the nectar, it splits in two.

45
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
 It's like two halves that are zipped together.

46
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:11,600
 And then each half has like these little flanges that are like an enclosed fist and the fist opens up into these splayed fingertips.

47
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,600
 And then when the bird retracts its tongue, all of that closes up.

48
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,600
 So the fingertips close back up and the tongue knits back together.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,600
 So it's like the hummingbird is reaching forward with two hands, grabbing like two fistfuls of nectar and then yanking that into its face.

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:37,600
 Can I ask, how can scientists sort of have assumed that they used the method of how they were drinking, as you said before, was sort of like a straw, right?

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
 Basically, are we not checking stuff out in science anymore?

52
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
 Like, what's going on?

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
 Yeah, that is theoretically what we're meant to do.

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 But it's really interesting how like with a lot of nature stuff, there are all these facts, quote unquote, that get taken as dogma and that people just sort of don't check.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:07,600
 This isn't the first time I've written about something like this, where like a little bit of textbook knowledge gets like passed down through the generations.

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 And then someone actually goes, wait a minute, maybe we should do that step where we actually check it.

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
 Wasn't there a thing where Aristotle wrote that flies had four legs?

58
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:25,600
 And pretty much that just got copied down textbook by textbook for hundreds and hundreds of years until someone went, wait a minute, last one I saw had six legs.

59
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 Right, I feel like Aristotle is the progenitor of a lot of these things.

60
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,600
 Sorry to Aristotle stands listening to this podcast, but yeah, half our audience gone. Thanks.

61
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 I read that when a hummingbird drinks in a flower, its tongue goes in and out of its mouth 15 or 20 times a second.

62
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
 What?

63
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
 Is that right?

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
 Incredible.

65
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 So is that what that punch movement?

66
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
 Well, you don't kiss the band, they always stick the tongue out and go in and out loads of times.

67
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 Gene Simmons, yes.

68
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 Yeah.

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:10,600
 Gene Simmons has a very long tongue and basically majority of his life as a once he started in the band, there's just been rumors that he's had his tongue extended in order to have that done.

70
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,600
 So having a bit of the bottom of the tongue cut so that he can flop it out even longer.

71
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,600
 But then there was another idea that he had a cow's tongue grafted into his existing tongue.

72
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 Just on top.

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,600
 But yeah, and that was a rumor that he said it's his favorite kiss rumor of all time that he somehow had surgery.

74
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 You should get a hummingbird tongue grafted into the end of the cow tongue.

75
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Have you noticed my tongue can now split in half?

76
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
 I can't really see it, Gene.

77
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,600
 If you were to put a cow's tongue into your body, grass, right, would taste quite good.

78
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
 But then other things would taste different.

79
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
 Or is that not true with animals?

80
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 Do they all taste the same?

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
 No, animals do taste really differently.

82
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,600
 So like cats don't have a sweet tooth, for example.

83
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 And a lot of birds can't taste sugar either.

84
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,600
 And the exceptions to that are hummingbirds and songbirds.

85
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:12,600
 So like all the like really familiar backyard birds like finches and tits and all the like, they can taste sugar.

86
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
 And there was a really interesting study that came out, I think last year,

87
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,600
 that linked the evolution of sweet sugar tasting in these birds with like their evolutionary success.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,600
 So all of those songbirds originated in Australia, of all places.

89
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,600
 And Australia is a place that is just loaded with sugar in plants.

90
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 Like the flowers have tons of nectar.

91
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,600
 Some of the trees are like just they're so rich in sugar that they're exuding it in sap from their box.

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,600
 So one idea is that this family of birds, because they managed to re-evolve the ability to sense sugar,

93
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 were really able to take advantage of this like bountiful source of calories

94
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 and could then spread all around the world and do the same wherever they landed up.

95
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:05,600
 So maybe the evolution of sugar sensing was one of the secrets of the success of this group of birds,

96
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,600
 which is now like all over the world and I think is like half of all bird species.

97
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 Wow.

98
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 Wow.

99
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
 But I'm afraid that you haven't heard about these birds.

100
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 [Laughter]

101
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,600
 I really was trying to divert us away from it, but good job on bringing us back to it.

102
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 I don't know whether if you grafted a cow tongue in place of your own tongue,

103
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
 whether grass would taste differently, I think.

104
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
 Gotta be worth a go.

105
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,600
 Right.

106
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 Isn't it true?

107
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 I think it's true that birds can't taste or certainly garden birds can't taste chilli.

108
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 Oh yeah, that is true.

109
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 There's anti-squirrel bird food, which does contain small amounts of chilli.

110
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Wow.

111
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 And squirrels hate the taste of chilli, so they naturally don't go for the bird feeder

112
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,600
 after the first couple of times they've tried it or they can even smell it,

113
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,600
 whereas the garden birds can't taste that.

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
 Do they still feel the burn on the other side?

115
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 No, they don't.

116
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,600
 The burn is due to capsaicin and birds are insensitive to that chemical.

117
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
 So yeah, they shouldn't feel it at either end.

118
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
 So is it possible?

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 But I don't think anyone's ever asked, Dan.

120
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,600
 You know, we've always pitched an idea of doing a show called "Can I Ask a Stupid Question?"

121
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
 and I feel like we're in it.

122
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 We're in the show, we've always wanted to make.

123
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
 Anyway, where were we?

124
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 HUMMING BIRDS.

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 The other thing that I read, this was about a flower called Heliconia,

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,600
 which almost does a reverse of what this hummingbird mouth does.

127
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,600
 When the hummingbird goes into the plant, it kind of jumps out like a jack in the box

128
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
 and kind of shoves its stamens into the hummingbird's face.

129
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
 Amazing.

130
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 There's also, I don't know if you guys saw Green Planet,

131
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 the most recent Attenborough documentary,

132
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
 but it has this really great example of very aggressive pollination tactics.

133
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,600
 There's this flower called the Hammer Orchid,

134
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,600
 which has a little hinged bit that looks like a very specific kind of wasp

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
 and it releases a pheromone that mimics that wasp.

136
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 And when the wasp lands on it,

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,600
 it poings that entire bit of flower with the wasp attached to it

138
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
 onto like two prongs that have pollen bits on them.

139
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 And then as the wasp is buzzing presumably in confusion,

140
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,600
 it then like mashes the pollen onto its back.

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 Wow.

142
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
 It's a bit like, have you ever seen one of those,

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,600
 are they called squirting cucumbers or something?

144
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 They look a bit like cucumbers and then when you touch them,

145
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,600
 they just explode and the seeds go everywhere.

146
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,600
 They're really cool.

147
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
 Very cool.

148
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 Really cool, yeah.

149
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
 Nature.

150
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,600
 How does your narration get going, Dan?

151
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 It's just blank footage and at the end of every five minutes,

152
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 you just say, ah, nature.

153
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
 David's successor is obvious, I think.

154
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
 Hummingbirds, I was reading about the way that they make nests for their young

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
 and there's one called the ruby-throated hummingbird.

156
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,600
 It's such a cool process.

157
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,600
 The nests are so tiny, it's like the size of a penny,

158
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
 the circumference of the inside.

159
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,600
 And the way that they build this nest is that they go around

160
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
 and they collect weird things like tiny little animal bones

161
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,600
 and little leaves and so on, but then they get spider's webs.

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
 And so the idea is that the spider's web not only holds it together,

163
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,600
 but as the hummingbird chicks get bigger within the nest,

164
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
 it can expand with them.

165
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
 Amazing.

166
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,600
 I really want a pair of trousers made of spider's web now.

167
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,600
 Those ruby-throated hummingbirds that you just mentioned, they're done.

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,600
 I think, I'm right in saying, they can bend the lower half of their beaks.

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
 Yes.

170
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
 It just goes and bends down a bit.

171
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
 Do they need to press it again?

172
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,600
 Is it like Charlie Chaplin's cane or can they just do it without?

173
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 I think they don't have to lean against something to bend it down.

174
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,600
 I think they have a little bit of gift.

175
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
 Well, I'm not sure whether there's a food thing,

176
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
 but I think there is a fighting element to it,

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,600
 which is where they're bashing other hummingbirds with their open mouths.

178
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
 Right.

179
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
 I think that's part of it.

180
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
 Yeah.

181
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
 And there's also a food aspect to it.

182
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
 So Margaret Rubaga, the same woman who showed the tongue splitting

183
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,600
 in half thing that I told you about, also showed that,

184
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,600
 like, so some hummingbirds catch insects in air as well as drinking from flowers.

185
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
 And that's quite a difficult thing for a bird like a hummingbird to do.

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,600
 Like, the way Margaret explained to me, it's like flying around with a pair

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
 of chopsticks on your face trying to catch a moving rice grain.

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
 Oh, my God.

189
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
 But so instead of trying to like pick things up with like the tips of the bill,

190
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
 what they do is they bend the lower half of the bill

191
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,600
 and then they just try and ram the insects with their open mouths.

192
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
 Crazy.

193
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,600
 It's a really interesting relationship they have with insects, isn't it?

194
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 Because they're kind of, they're in the same niche.

195
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,600
 They're going for the pollen of the plants and stuff.

196
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
 And they also eat a lot of insects,

197
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
 but then there are some insects that eat them,

198
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
 like prey mantises can eat hummingbirds.

199
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 And sometimes like wasps will attack them and stuff like that.

200
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
 They're so tidy.

201
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
 I don't think we've properly said how small these things are.

202
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
 It's like a bee.

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
 Yeah.

204
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,600
 Like a big bee.

205
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
 They're so small.

206
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
 They're the smallest sort of living dinosaur, aren't they?

207
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
 I guess if you count all birds as dinosaurs,

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,600
 this is pretty much as small as you get as a dinosaur,

209
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,600
 I think, from what they found even through fossil records.

210
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,600
 There's one smaller dinosaur which was Oculandetavis calangrae,

211
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,600
 which was, it was like an avian dinosaur.

212
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
 So it's like a bird before birds.

213
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
 We only have a skull of it.

214
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
 And it's about the size of a fingernail.

215
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,600
 And we think it was possibly smaller than the smallest hummingbird.

216
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
 But obviously we only have a skull.

217
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
 So maybe it had a massive body and a tiny head.

218
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
 I don't know.

219
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 It was found in resin, wasn't it?

220
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
 I've seen a photo of it.

221
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
 Yeah.

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,600
 Once again, bringing my theory that we should put all the important shit in resin.

223
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
 It's the only thing that survives.

224
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,600
 What's the important shit?

225
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,600
 Well, anything that we, you know, like a...

226
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
 Gene Simmons' cow tongue.

227
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 There we go.

228
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,600
 Absolutely.

229
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,600
 Oh my God, I don't want to see that Jurassic Park

230
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
 where they bring back Gene Simmons with his cow tongue.

231
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,600
 Oh wow.

232
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
 Simmons Park, yeah.

233
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
 God, do you want to know something about tongues?

234
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
 Oh yeah.

235
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,600
 Okay, this is right.

236
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,600
 This is actually a bit of US news.

237
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 And it's from 2020.

238
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,600
 There was a house in Florida and there was a builder was brought in.

239
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,600
 The woman who owned the house brought a builder in to just look at something in the foundations.

240
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,600
 And he was down in the, at the crawl space under the house.

241
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
 I think it's the thing that lots of US houses have.

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 And what he found there was he found six gallons of human tongues.

243
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:39,600
 He found six one gallon jars full, absolutely crammed with human tongues and associated matter.

244
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,600
 And it belonged to a scientist from the University of Florida,

245
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,600
 an oral pathologist called Ronald A. Boffman.

246
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,600
 It's B-A-U-G-A, I think that's Bob.

247
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,600
 Yeah, like Frank Boff.

248
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,600
 I don't think he had a crawl space full of human tongues, but I wouldn't put it past him.

249
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
 We're not sure.

250
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,600
 But Boffman was a scientist.

251
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
 It's actually Boffman's monster.

252
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,600
 Sorry.

253
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,600
 Just made entirely of tongues.

254
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
 And he'd put them there to keep them cool.

255
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 And he was meaning to do some experiments on them.

256
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
 This is all about 50 years ago.

257
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,600
 And then he and his wife got divorced and his wife was the one who stayed on living in the house.

258
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,600
 But everyone forgot the presence of these tongues and they just stay there for 50 years.

259
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,600
 How do you forget the presence of your basement full of tongues?

260
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
 How is that just a thing that just skips your mind?

261
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,600
 I was looking at like animals tasting things and I'm currently not in the UK.

262
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,600
 I'm on holiday and I'm being eaten alive by mosquitoes.

263
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,600
 As I was interested to see what mosquitoes can taste.

264
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,600
 And it turns out that they've got like taste buds that can detect quite a few different substances in human blood, apparently.

265
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
 So it's reading.

266
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,600
 I saw this interview with a woman called Leslie Voss Hall from Rockefeller University about this.

267
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
 They said, what does human blood taste like to the mosquitoes?

268
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,600
 And she said, well, you can't really tell because it's like no human experience can be like a mosquito experience.

269
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
 But it's kind of probably, if you can imagine something that's a bit salty and a bit sweet.

270
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
 So two different tastes that kind of go together really well that they like.

271
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
 Like salted caramel, I guess.

272
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,600
 Or a Snickers bar or something like that.

273
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
 I've actually visited Leslie's lab.

274
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 Oh, really?

275
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 Yeah.

276
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,600
 So she's great and their labs are amazing.

277
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,600
 And one interesting thing about mosquito tastes is that they're quite picky.

278
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
 Like it's actually very hard to feed like captive mosquitoes.

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,600
 Like if you just have like a petri dish of blood, they won't drink from it.

280
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,600
 They want like the taste of it, the smell of human.

281
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,600
 They want like the heat of human skin.

282
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:52,600
 So one thing they sometimes do is they'll like slightly microwave the blood and then take like a bit of paraffin, rub it on their own skin and then stretch it over the surface of the blood.

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,600
 So now you have something that feels warm and smells a bit like human that allows the mosquitoes to actually like stab through.

284
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
 But that's all very complicated.

285
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:12,600
 And by far the simplest way they have a feeding their mosquitoes is just sticking their arm inside the mosquito cage and just sitting there while like several hundred mosquitoes drink from them.

286
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 Oh my God.

287
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
 That's the worst thing in the world.

288
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:22,600
 And there's like, I think there's like a lab rotor where like people take it in turns to feed the mosquitoes on that day.

289
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:31,600
 So everyone I've spoken to has done this is that like it's horrible the first few times you do it and then you rapidly become mostly immune to it.

290
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,600
 So it'll it'll it's a little bit, but it's not too bad.

291
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:43,600
 It's really just the gross out factor and like the boredom of having to sit there like reading a book or like scrolling through Twitter while like your arm gets drained.

292
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:49,600
 So obviously even hundreds of mosquitoes drinking couldn't take enough blood from you to do you any harm.

293
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,600
 That's right. It's not like there's a pile of like deflated students in the corner.

294
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:06,600
 OK, it is time for fact number two and that is James.

295
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:17,600
 OK, my fact this week is that in London's only ketamine clinic, the ketamine is kept in a locked box inside another locked box that's padlocked to the floor.

296
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 Right. Where'd you get that from?

297
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
 Yes. Well, when I say my fact this week, this is Anna's fact this week.

298
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,600
 Anna can't be with us as she senses this stuff about ketamine and we haven't seen her for days. I don't know.

299
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 No, Anna is sick.

300
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,600
 So she senses this and she found it in a online magazine called Technology Networks.

301
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:52,600
 And it is about a clinic in London called Awaken Clinic, which is near King's Cross and it's London's first clinic for psychedelic psychotherapy.

302
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:06,600
 And the idea is that all around the world, more in America for sure, but just starting to come in the UK now, people are using these drugs that are illegal in lots of places, but giving them in smaller doses.

303
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:14,600
 And they're helping against various things like depression or addiction, lots of, you know, problems like that.

304
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 Is ketamine addictive?

305
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:25,600
 It can be, yes. In small doses, I think it's OK. I mean, don't, if you're listening to this, it's illegal in the UK, so I wouldn't bother.

306
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,600
 But if you're going to a clinic and it's under controlled circumstances, then I think it's OK.

307
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
 But I think one of the reasons we don't use it more, because it started off as an anaesthetic.

308
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:45,600
 One of the reasons we don't use it anymore is because you need to use more and more and more because you get a buildup to it and it can have psychological problems if you use it too much.

309
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,600
 But yeah, this is a new clinic.

310
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,600
 And actually, the exciting thing I learned about this clinic when Anna sent it round is that it's on a road called Duke's Road.

311
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:05,600
 And it's just opened this spring. And one of the last people to go into the building before they put all the ketamine there was me, it turns out.

312
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:14,600
 Because my wife used to work in that building and her company moved and we helped kind of clear it out and like get rid of some of the stuff out of there.

313
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
 So just before they left, we went in there.

314
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,600
 And I want to know, we were going to take, there's a huge sort of tree stump that was like fossilized or petrified or whatever.

315
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,600
 And we were going to take it, but it was so heavy, there was four of us and we couldn't move it.

316
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
 So I reckon it must still be there.

317
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
 Yes.

318
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
 It must be, right?

319
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
 Yeah.

320
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
 I reckon you could hide the ketamine underneath that tree stump and no one would ever get it.

321
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
 You don't need to.

322
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,600
 Now it's getting a bit fantasy, right?

323
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,600
 It's like in a locked box inside a tree stump, guarded by a wizard who has three riddles for you.

324
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:55,600
 I do love that the clinic that has the ketamine in the locked box and the other locked box is part of a program of psychotherapy called

325
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,600
 ketamine in the reduction of alcohol relapse or care.

326
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 But care with a K, which I feel is unfortunate because everyone knows that if you take a C word and turn it into a K word, it makes it evil.

327
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
 Like with kiss, mortal combat.

328
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
 Yeah.

329
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 Kodos and Kang.

330
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
 Don't put a K.

331
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
 That's just sending the wrong vibe.

332
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
 Magic with the K at the end.

333
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
 That's something dark magic.

334
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,600
 And the clinic is called, I'm sure it's pronounced awaken, but it's spelled Awaken.

335
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,600
 Awaken?

336
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,600
 They've knocked out the E. And so it looks a bit like, you know, chicken, that fake chicken stuff.

337
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:39,600
 John Lilly, who is one of the really old ketamine researchers, he said that when he took ketamine, he could make contact with aliens.

338
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,600
 And that the ketamine told him that he was getting a lot of knowledge from it.

339
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
 He said the ketamine knew everything.

340
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,600
 And he said that the ketamine told him that knowledge starts with K for a reason.

341
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
 So maybe there's something in the evil K with John Lilly.

342
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,600
 Food for thought.

343
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
 The clinic is really interesting, isn't it?

344
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,600
 Because it's got to be sort of clinical and you're supervised when you're taking the drugs themselves.

345
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:13,600
 But it's also accessible and it's not, you don't want to be in a totally spartan clinical environment because you perceive things differently when you have ketamine, don't you?

346
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,600
 So your brain gets disassociated from your sensory input.

347
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,600
 So you might think that your limbs are getting longer or you might feel like you're floating or whatever it is.

348
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,600
 So they've got to have a sofa to lie on once you've had the drugs, but also they've got to keep it slightly professional.

349
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,600
 And it comes with therapy as well, which I think some clinics in the USA don't do, do they?

350
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,600
 They just give you the drugs.

351
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 Right.

352
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
 Oh, really?

353
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
 Yeah, that's what this is.

354
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,600
 It's 11 sessions, four of which are the doping sessions and then the rest of them are the therapy sessions.

355
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:49,600
 So you break them up and you come back in and then you talk about, you know, you know, well, you thought you're an astronaut in that last trip, you know, kind of thing.

356
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
 And then your problem is not just about you.

357
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
 There was one US researcher.

358
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,600
 So this was some kind of help that they gave the subjects in America.

359
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,600
 They said that the patients are seeing loads of things like one person thought they were hiding lemons in the room everywhere.

360
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,600
 And there was another person who thought they could see vibrating collars and stuff.

361
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,600
 But apparently some people got really upset about it.

362
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,600
 And, you know, the reality has changed.

363
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
 They get really worried about it.

364
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,600
 And they said that everyone to a person feels better if they play some Enya in the background.

365
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,600
 They play a bit of Enya.

366
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
 It doesn't matter if you're a heavy metal, if you're a kiss fan, if you're a maiden fan or anything.

367
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,600
 If you play a little bit of Enya, apparently it calms you right down.

368
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 Well, that's so interesting.

369
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:40,600
 Because in America, in Fort Worth, in Texas, they actually at one point in the 1970s opened up a clinic for people who were tripping on LSD who needed to come down to come to.

370
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,600
 And they would just play them the Beach Boys album Smiley Smile.

371
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,600
 And that was the only thing that you had there.

372
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,600
 So I can see why Enya would be even more powerful than a Beach Boys album.

373
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,600
 I love this idea that every drug has a musical antidote to it.

374
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
 Yeah, exactly.

375
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,600
 So, James mentioned John Lilly, who was also really famous for doing research on dolphins.

376
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,600
 And like some of his work was actually hugely influential in like, and he inspired like a lot of modern day dolphin researchers.

377
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,600
 But he was also, he also had some very like out there ideas about like communicating with dolphins.

378
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,600
 And that was, I think that was heavily influenced by like his experiences with ketamine.

379
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:33,600
 But I found this vice article, which talked about how Lilly's experiences with both dolphins and ketamine might have influenced the game Echo the Dolphin.

380
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,600
 Did anybody play that on the Sega Mega Drive?

381
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,600
 It's a great game.

382
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
 Right.

383
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,600
 So it was an amazing game on the on the Mega Drive, Genesis for American listeners.

384
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,600
 And you played a dolphin and you had to go around like beating up sharks and surviving.

385
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:57,600
 But there was also this like, this overarching plot about aliens who were, I don't know, trying to like take of the world or like kidnap animals.

386
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 And you Echo the Dolphin had to fight off these aliens.

387
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:08,600
 And that's like very clearly linked to like Lilly and his like his alien stuff and his his ketamine stuff.

388
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
 Yeah, he was a consultant on the video game.

389
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
 Was it really?

390
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,600
 Yeah, yeah, they asked him.

391
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,600
 And he did go absolutely bonkers post the dolphin experiments that he had.

392
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
 He did weird stuff with dolphins.

393
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
 Didn't he, John Lilly?

394
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
 Or am I wrong?

395
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
 No, he did.

396
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:28,600
 Yeah, it was more Margaret Howe, who was the the experimenter who was living in the dolphin houses that they had.

397
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
 He was he was part of the house.

398
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,600
 He was upstairs, but he didn't interact with her except telepathically from his flotation tank.

399
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 Wait, he was sorry.

400
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
 He was upstairs in the dolphin house.

401
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
 There was the dolphin house that he created.

402
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
 Yeah.

403
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,600
 And he wants to know how the dolphins get up the stairs.

404
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
 I thank you very much.

405
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 I do.

406
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
 They're not allowed upstairs.

407
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
 Just on ketamine.

408
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
 Oh, yeah.

409
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,600
 What I know it as is horse tranquilizer because that's the thing that it gets described as all the time as in.

410
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,600
 Oh, it's a party drug, but it's actually these kids are taking horse tranquilizer and it's not.

411
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
 It's not really.

412
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
 No.

413
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
 It will knock out a horse if you use enough of it.

414
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
 It's used on multiple animals, including humans.

415
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:18,600
 So the New Zealand Drug Foundation website, they say it's used on elephants, camels, gorillas, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, rabbits, snakes, guinea pigs, birds, gerbils and mice.

416
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,600
 But you never hear it described as a gerbil tranquilizer.

417
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
 Like it's less scary, isn't it?

418
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
 It's also less cool, isn't it?

419
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,600
 If you're friends after me, some gerbil tranquilizer.

420
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,600
 I also feel like the situations in life when one needs to tranquilize a gerbil are probably few and far between.

421
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,600
 Oh, no, there's a runaway gerbil. How are we going to stop it?

422
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,600
 Oh, dear.

423
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:54,600
 So I do love that the Wikipedia entry on ketamine does end with this absolute banger of the sentence, which is ketamine appears not to produce sedation or anesthesia in snails.

424
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,600
 Instead, it appears to have an excitatory effect.

425
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
 What?

426
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
 Oh, wow.

427
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,600
 That's amazing.

428
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,600
 That's why they keep it at the lockboxes. It's the case of snails.

429
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,600
 I've not actually followed up on the source behind this. The statement, I want to just let it stand.

430
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
 That's exciting.

431
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,600
 When you say it has an excitatory effect on snails, do you mean the snails are now like zooming around at hummingbird speed?

432
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 Or are they just moving slightly less slowly than before?

433
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:33,600
 Having the time of its life and the human watching it, just watching it slowly.

434
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,600
 I've also got a story that's sort of related to this about the difficulties of scientists doing experiments with illicit substances.

435
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
 Oh, yeah.

436
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,600
 And this happens sort of inadvertently.

437
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:55,600
 So I was talking to this guy called Matt Casson who studies parasites and he studies this fungus that infects cicadas and it makes their butts fall off.

438
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,600
 And the cicadas fly around with this ball full of like fungal spores behind them, what Casson calls these flying salt shakers of death.

439
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,600
 But you might then ask like, how is it that the cicada is okay with like a third of its body having fallen off?

440
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:22,600
 And when they looked at the fungus and they did a chemical analysis of the chemicals that the fungus produces, they found that it produces psilocybin, which is the stuff that makes shrooms trippy.

441
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:31,600
 So these cicadas are flying around probably off their faces shedding fungal spores from what used to be their butts.

442
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 But the twist is like psilocybin is you can't do research on it without a very specific permit.

443
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,600
 And so this poor scientist suddenly discovers that, oh no, I'm actually a psilocybin lab.

444
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,600
 And I don't know if like the DEA is going to suddenly come in and like tow me away.

445
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:56,600
 So he has to do this like very embarrassed call to the DEA going, I don't know if you have any protocols for this.

446
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,600
 But it turns out that my fungus-infested cicadas are full of psilocybin. What do I do?

447
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,600
 Do we know what happened? Did they tell him to, they got him a permit maybe, I guess?

448
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,600
 I think they said it was okay because the amount of psilocybin inside the cicadas is very, very small.

449
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,600
 So it's not like you could crunch your way through a bag full of cicadas.

450
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:22,600
 I was going to say, how many cicadas without a bum would I have to lick to get a bit of a trick?

451
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,600
 Right, I actually have an answer to this because I asked him that question.

452
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,600
 He said, based on the ones we looked at, it will probably take a dozen or more.

453
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,600
 That's actually not that many cicadas.

454
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,600
 God, after this podcast, forests are just going to be packed with drug dealers waiting for cicadas to be born.

455
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,600
 But those cicadas, are they the ones that come out only every 17 years or something like that?

456
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,600
 Yeah, that's right. But then they come out on mass.

457
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,600
 So it feels like you really should be able to, like when it happened this year,

458
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,600
 I was getting really panicked as my dog started eating every cicada he could find.

459
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,600
 It's like walking in front of him and just checking them going, does it look white?

460
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 Does it sit back still there? It's not there, you're not eating it.

461
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,600
 Ketamine's effect on sheep is amazing. It turns them off and turns them back on again.

462
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,600
 In a sexual way?

463
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,600
 Not in a sexual way. Their brain activity just literally turns off.

464
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:21,600
 I think this was Cambridge scientists. Yeah, they gave sheep very high doses of ketamine

465
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,600
 and basically all electrical activity just shut down.

466
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 So is it like being hit on the head in a cartoon?

467
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,600
 It's exactly like that. The sheep forgot key information about their lives

468
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 and then they hit them again and they were back.

469
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,600
 That's amazing. Ket, is this true? Is this true?

470
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
 Can a brain just shut off?

471
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,600
 My brain's doing that right now. You're watching it happen in real time.

472
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:56,600
 OK, it is time for fact number three and that is Andy.

473
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,600
 My fact this week is that Britain has several libraries

474
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
 whose collections are completely invisible to the naked eye.

475
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
 Oh, very interesting.

476
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,600
 See, naked eyes.

477
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
 So, OK, tiny books.

478
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,600
 Well, it's the books of life by which I mean microorganisms.

479
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,600
 There are otherwise known the books of life.

480
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,600
 This is these things. They're called the National Culture Libraries.

481
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,600
 There was this amazing piece in the Economist actually about them

482
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,600
 and they are there are four National Culture Libraries

483
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
 and each one does something slightly different.

484
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,600
 So one has bacteria, one has viruses, one has fungi and one has cell lines

485
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:52,600
 and they all store various significant cultures, cells that matter

486
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,600
 and they're for scientists to do experiments on.

487
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,600
 So you can, if you like, buy some salmonella or some anthrax or some cholera.

488
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,600
 You can buy some anthrax. That doesn't sound.

489
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
 I know.

490
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,600
 I don't think you, the listener, can buy some anthrax to be clear.

491
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,600
 It might be able to. It's only £321.

492
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,600
 It's really affordable.

493
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,600
 Like on delivery.

494
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,600
 So, yeah, you're right.

495
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,600
 Yes, you do need several layers of security and licensing

496
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,600
 and they need to know that you've got the right sort of fridge

497
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,600
 with the right sort of locks, the right sort of tupperware or whatever.

498
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,600
 But it's really useful and it's for researchers who want to sequence the DNA

499
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,600
 of particular diseases or fungi or whatever it might be

500
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,600
 and work out how changes in the DNA might mean they spread

501
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,600
 or look at historical examples and see how they've altered between previous pandemics and now

502
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 and they're quite secretive, but they are, these are real organisations

503
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,600
 and they're quite, historically quite.

504
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
 Oh, it's really amazing.

505
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,600
 Incredibly interesting.

506
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,600
 And it's so much in there.

507
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,600
 So that was the price, by the way, for anthrax.

508
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
 You can get it for £321.

509
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,600
 If you want some human coronavirus, that's going to set you back £282.

510
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,600
 I've got some of that left from last week.

511
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,600
 And then they have just amazing other bits of bacteria that you can get your hands on.

512
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,600
 So there's hemophilus influenza, which they say they believe

513
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
 has come directly from the nose of Alexander Fleming.

514
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
 They think that their sample is directly from his nostrils.

515
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
 Surely not.

516
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
 That's what they say.

517
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,600
 And they've also got a bit of his original penicillin in there as well.

518
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
 That's really cool.

519
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,600
 And this is just in North London, this particular one,

520
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
 the National Collection of Type Cultures.

521
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,600
 The thing about Fleming is really interesting.

522
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,600
 I was just reading about him because his stuff is in this place, in this library.

523
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
 When he got his penicillin, the first clinical trial that he did,

524
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,600
 he tried to treat someone who had influenza.

525
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 And obviously influenza is a virus, so penicillin won't help.

526
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,600
 But he gave his penicillin to someone else to do some tests as well.

527
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
 A guy called Arthur Dixon Wright.

528
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
 This is in 1928.

529
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,600
 And I think this is probably the first ever clinical trial for penicillin that this guy did.

530
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,600
 He said that it seemed to work satisfactorily.

531
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:18,600
 And Arthur Dixon Wright is the father of Clarissa Dixon Wright,

532
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,600
 who is one of the two fat ladies that he represents.

533
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600
 Wow!

534
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
 Isn't that amazing?

535
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
 That is sick.

536
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,600
 And her dad did the first clinical trial in penicillin.

537
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
 That's amazing.

538
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,600
 I do love that this culture library, the London one in the Economist piece,

539
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:40,600
 it opened in 1920, which is actually like eight years before Fleming identified penicillin.

540
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
 It's opening at this really weird time in the history of bacteriology,

541
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:51,600
 where it's only really a few decades after germ theory became widely known and accepted.

542
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,600
 It's like a remarkably prescient thing to do at this time

543
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
 when microbiology is still a very young science.

544
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
 Yeah, that is amazing.

545
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,600
 Obviously they couldn't do DNA sequencing on these samples for what?

546
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
 Six decades?

547
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
 Seven decades?

548
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
 Yeah.

549
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,600
 So I find that extraordinary that they wanted to know that it was going to become useful in that way.

550
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
 Yeah, I guess they were just collecting it, right?

551
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
 How did they keep them alive, Andy?

552
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,600
 Do you know, did they have to go and feed them every day and stuff?

553
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,600
 Well, so some of the samples are dehydrated, I know that much,

554
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
 but also when they sent them out to scientists.

555
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,600
 So these days they cost a few hundred quid per sample,

556
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,600
 but in the old days they were delivered to scientists free and alive, these bacteria.

557
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,600
 They were funded in a different way, and they sent the bacteria.

558
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,600
 They sent the living bacteria through the post on a medium

559
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,600
 that was made from dorset egg yolks and sealed with wax.

560
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,600
 So the bacteria had something to feed on during the journey.

561
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
 They wouldn't go hungry.

562
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
 Through the mail.

563
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,600
 I guess I think it was just through the mail.

564
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
 Oh my God.

565
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
 Just sealed up.

566
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
 That's incredible.

567
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
 I do wonder if they get submissions in the other directions,

568
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
 especially now that articles like this come out.

569
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,600
 Do you think that they'll just get like envelopes?

570
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,600
 I get random mail from people all the time,

571
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,600
 and do they have a protocol where they get an envelope

572
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
 in someone's handwriting that immediately incinerates it?

573
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
 I wonder if Anna's sick at the moment,

574
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
 whether we can get her to show something up her nose

575
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,600
 and send some celebrity bacteria over.

576
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,600
 Great idea.

577
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,600
 I think they did have sort of very random contributors to the library.

578
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,600
 I was looking on Twitter between staff members who were talking about it.

579
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600
 When one guy wrote,

580
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,600
 "What was the name of John the Stuffer?"

581
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,600
 The guy who picked up Roadkill on his motorbike commute

582
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,600
 and freeze dried it in the NCTC,

583
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,600
 the National Collection of Type Cultures.

584
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
 You never knew what you were going to find in the cold room.

585
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,600
 And so basically there was this guy, John the Stuffer,

586
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
 who just used to come and bring random Roadkill.

587
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,600
 He must have then taken it and stuffed it, right?

588
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,600
 Otherwise, why the name?

589
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,600
 Yeah, exactly.

590
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,600
 Then they don't know his name.

591
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
 The conversation ends.

592
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,600
 I haven't got to the bottom of who John the Stuffer was

593
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
 or what he did.

594
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
 Ed, what's the weird post that you get?

595
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,600
 Are there any super strange examples of things that you've been sent

596
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,600
 as part of your career?

597
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,600
 That's a good question.

598
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,600
 I don't think I've ever been sent anything in the post,

599
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
 but I've just published this book.

600
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
 And what happens when you publish a book

601
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
 is a million people email you to say,

602
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,600
 "I also have written a book about something completely related."

603
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,600
 Or like, "That's most of it."

604
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 But then there's also like, "I wrote a song that I think you might enjoy."

605
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,600
 Yeah.

606
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
 There's a lot of people who are like,

607
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
 "You put this thing out in the world.

608
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,600
 I also do a thing.

609
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
 Let me share it with you."

610
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
 Right.

611
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
 That's nice.

612
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,600
 That's too late because you can't get in the book.

613
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,600
 That's always annoying, right?

614
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
 Right.

615
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
 This happened recently.

616
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,600
 We got posted a penis good, Ed,

617
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,600
 because we've discussed the podcast.

618
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
 About five years ago, though, that's the thing.

619
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,600
 And it's just come through from, I think, Vanuatu or somewhere.

620
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
 New Guinea, maybe, was it?

621
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
 New Guinea.

622
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,600
 We've sent it on to the Bacteria Library anyway,

623
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,600
 haven't we, for a scraping.

624
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
 Yeah.

625
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
 Although I am now known as Andy, the stuff.

626
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,600
 I'm not looking forward to the jar of tongues

627
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,600
 we're about to be sent when this goes.

628
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,600
 To the question of how they store it,

629
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
 I'm pretty sure they've got to freeze it, right?

630
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
 Because the idea is you've got historical records

631
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,600
 of what these microbes were like

632
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,600
 at whatever decade they were collected,

633
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,600
 and you can compare that to how they are now.

634
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
 If you keep them alive,

635
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 they're just going to continue evolving

636
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
 and changing over that time.

637
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,600
 But the thing that always frustrates me a little bit

638
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,600
 with articles about these collections is

639
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,600
 I really want to know what they're actually physically like.

640
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,600
 Is the collection just a freezer somewhere?

641
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,600
 What I really hope for is that they have actually got

642
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,600
 a small doll's house with small frozen microwave slides

643
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
 inside it.

644
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
 So it actually looks like a proper library,

645
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
 but on a mini scale.

646
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
 Yeah.

647
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
 That would be amazing.

648
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
 I think I read that it was a filing cabinet,

649
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,600
 which is quite now an old fashioned thing to have.

650
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
 I can't remember that.

651
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,600
 Yeah, I saw a photo of that as well,

652
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,600
 but not from the London one, from a different one,

653
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
 where it looked like a filing cabinet,

654
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,600
 and then these really cool fridges that they had as well.

655
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
 They've also got the national collection of type cultures.

656
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:25,600
 They've got the hardest Christmas quiz I have ever seen.

657
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
 Do you want to hear a sample?

658
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,600
 Okay, this is from the most recent Christmas quiz.

659
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
 And yeah, points for the winner.

660
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
 Okay.

661
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,600
 What is the ECACC number for the standard cell line

662
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,600
 used for producing virus stocks of SARS-CoV-2?

663
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,600
 Is it A, 85020209?

664
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,600
 B, 85020207?

665
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,600
 Or C, 85020206?

666
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
 C.

667
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
 B.

668
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
 James?

669
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
 Well, I'm going to have to go for A,

670
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,600
 and if the others have gone for B and C.

671
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,600
 Well, Dan, by getting in there quickly with C,

672
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
 that is the correct answer.

673
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,600
 We all knew the answer, but Dan said it so quickly,

674
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
 we had to go for the other ones.

675
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
 Exactly, it's unfair.

676
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
 I had a bit of a cheat.

677
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
 I was the quiz master that year,

678
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,600
 so I did write that question.

679
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
 That's amazing.

680
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,600
 At least it's multiple choice.

681
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
 Yeah, I know.

682
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
 A lot of the questions in the quiz are not multiple choice,

683
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,600
 and they're that hard.

684
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
 It's so funny.

685
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,600
 Just on bacteria, generally,

686
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,600
 outside of the libraries and in the world,

687
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,600
 I read this amazing quote about humans

688
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
 and the amount of bacteria that we have on us.

689
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
 So, the quote goes,

690
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,600
 "Are we humans or just bacteria in a human shape?"

691
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
 Is that a quiz question?

692
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,600
 Yes, we are humans.

693
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,600
 Okay, are we humans or are we dancers?

694
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
 Okay, so a quiz question then.

695
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,600
 Who wrote this phrase?

696
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,600
 "Are we humans or just bacteria in a human-shaped sack?"

697
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,600
 Okay, someone 20th century, right?

698
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
 Yeah.

699
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,600
 It's someone you've heard of.

700
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
 Are we humans?

701
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
 Einstein.

702
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
 Ed Young?

703
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,600
 Is it Ed Young in one of these books?

704
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
 Surely it's not.

705
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
 It's Ed Young.

706
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
 Oh, my God.

707
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
 How embarrassing.

708
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
 I'm sitting here going,

709
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
 "I don't know.

710
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
 It sounds so familiar."

711
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
 It's just so profound.

712
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
 It must have been one of the greats.

713
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
 I hope it was you.

714
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,600
 If it wasn't, then it's me, I guess.

715
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,600
 I said it.

716
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
 I'll take that.

717
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
 It could be someone else.

718
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
 Yeah, sorry, Einstein, if I've misattributed that.

719
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,600
 But it's incredible how much bacteria is on us

720
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,600
 and to the point that there's more bacteria on us,

721
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,600
 basically, than there is our own living cells, I believe.

722
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,600
 Do you mean on our surface?

723
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
 Yeah, exactly.

724
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
 I think you wrote that as well, Ed.

725
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
 I'm just going to throw it to you for each.

726
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,600
 There's a really common stat that it's like 10 bacterial cells

727
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
 to one human cell.

728
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,600
 And I think that's actually wrong.

729
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,600
 So that's one of those misconceptions like hummingbirds

730
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,600
 drinking through a straw tongue that just got passed around.

731
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
 But it is comparable.

732
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,600
 I think the ratio is like 1.3 to 1 or something like that.

733
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
 That was the last I saw.

734
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
 So it's not that we're massively outnumbered,

735
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,600
 but it is like, you know, I'm basically half bacteria right now.

736
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,600
 When I was reading about the culture collections,

737
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,600
 you know, I was thinking that basically any kind of collection

738
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,600
 is de facto a bacteria collection.

739
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
 It's just that this one happens to be very specifically

740
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,600
 a bacteria collection.

741
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,600
 Because everything that we have is like loaded with bacteria

742
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,600
 all over it.

743
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,600
 So wait, are you saying that basically everything is,

744
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
 like every library, every museum is basically

745
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,600
 a collection of bacteria, but with some other stuff around the end?

746
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,600
 Yeah.

747
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,600
 That's really interesting.

748
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
 It's amazing.

749
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,600
 There's a fun guy that kind of makes the carters do weird things.

750
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,600
 Yeah.

751
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,600
 How much are they controlling us, the bacteria?

752
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,600
 Like your gut bacteria can change your mood and stuff, right?

753
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,600
 James, do you ever get the compulsion to eat raw, dorset egg yolks?

754
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,600
 Cover yourself in wax, because that's a suck.

755
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
 Yeah, there's been a lot of research about this,

756
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,600
 like the so-called gut mind axis.

757
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,600
 Bacteria inside us are also producing a ton of chemicals

758
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
 that can affect our moods and our behaviors.

759
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,600
 Bacteria in our gut produce a ton of serotonin, dopamine,

760
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,600
 like other chemicals that we think of as brain signaling chemicals.

761
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,600
 And there's a lot of really interesting work on changing

762
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,600
 the gut bacteria of rodents and seeing if they behave differently.

763
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:30,600
 I don't know if I've seen anything that's massively compelling

764
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:35,600
 on the idea that whether there's some kind of manipulation going on

765
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,600
 or whether that's just a byproduct of what they're doing.

766
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
 But I wouldn't be surprised.

767
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,600
 There's so many examples of microbes manipulating the host

768
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,600
 in the animal kingdom, like the fungus that makes the circadian butts fall off.

769
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
 It feels totally plausible to me.

770
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
 I'm just not sure that there's actually a firm example of that yet.

771
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
 They just found a really big bacteria.

772
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,600
 The biggest one in Guadalupe, in the mangroves in Guadalupe.

773
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,600
 Apparently it's about one centimetre long, this bacteria.

774
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,600
 The person who found it, I saw the quote that they said,

775
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,600
 "It's the equivalent for humans to encounter another human

776
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,600
 who is as tall as Mount Everest."

777
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,600
 That's amazing.

778
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,600
 That is how big this is.

779
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,600
 It's visible to the naked eye, right?

780
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,600
 One centimetre.

781
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,600
 It's the size of a tiny dinosaur bird's head, almost.

782
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,600
 Is it extremely thin, though?

783
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,600
 They're like filaments.

784
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,600
 But that's really cool.

785
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
 It's amazing. Imagine if you could lash them together,

786
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,600
 like make a rope out of bacteria.

787
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,600
 Or make trousers out of them.

788
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
 Yes.

789
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
 Pretty sexy stuff.

790
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,600
 Can I tell you one bacteria study that's going on?

791
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
 This is a really exciting study.

792
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,600
 It's the world's longest bacteria study.

793
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:04,600
 It started in 2014 at the University of Edinburgh

794
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
 by a guy called Charles Cockle, who's an astrobiologist.

795
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
 Nice.

796
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,600
 It started in 2014, and you've heard me say it's the longest

797
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,600
 bacteria study ever.

798
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,600
 That's because of not because of how long it's been going so far,

799
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
 but because of when it's planned to end.

800
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,600
 It's intended to go until the year 2514.

801
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,600
 As this guy got funding all the way through today.

802
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,600
 It's basically a funding club.

803
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,600
 That's what he's doing.

804
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,600
 It's to try and find out how long bacteria last

805
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,600
 to study their lifespans.

806
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,600
 It's actually got almost no funding, the experimental,

807
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,600
 because it's so basic.

808
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,600
 The experiment consists of a box,

809
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,600
 and the box contains lots of smaller boxes,

810
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,600
 which contain small vials of dried bacteria.

811
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,600
 And every 25 years, those are the waypoints along the way,

812
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,600
 whoever has the box at that point,

813
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,600
 whichever of his colleagues or future colleagues,

814
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,600
 will take a selection of vials to Scotland,

815
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
 and those will be opened up,

816
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,600
 and those bacteria will be compared with an identical experiment,

817
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,600
 which is happening in Edinburgh.

818
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,600
 And then whoever has the box at that point,

819
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,600
 has to rewrite the instructions in modern English,

820
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,600
 or whatever the modern version of English is

821
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,600
 at the time that's done,

822
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,600
 and then close the box for the next 25 years.

823
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,600
 Because language is going to change so much.

824
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,600
 - Yeah. - What language was it like 500 years ago?

825
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,600
 - That's amazing. - Yeah.

826
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,600
 - That's the experiment. - That's so cool.

827
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,600
 - So it's also a linguistic experiment,

828
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,600
 as well as a bacterial experiment.

829
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
 - Yeah, that's really interesting.

830
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,600
 You can compare the evolution of the English language

831
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,600
 and the bacteria over the same time period.

832
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
 - Oh, yeah. - That'd be awesome.

833
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,600
 - What a hero. I just think it's such a cool idea.

834
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,600
 - Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

835
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600
 - I wish someone had thought of that 20,000 years ago.

836
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
 - Yeah. - It's like,

837
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,600
 it's now used to us, this experiment, is it?

838
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
 - Yeah. - What's the point for us?

839
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
 What do we get out of it?

840
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,600
 - That's science.

841
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,600
 No media benefit to you.

842
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,600
 - Screw it.

843
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:02,600
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

844
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,600
 and that is my fact.

845
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,600
 My fact this week is that in 2014,

846
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,600
 a survey about the praying habits of Americans

847
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
 revealed that 7% admitted that they prayed to God,

848
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,600
 asking him to help them find a good car park spot,

849
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:20,600
 and 5% admitted to praying for success in something

850
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,600
 they knew wouldn't please God.

851
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,600
 - So... - That's good.

852
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
 I mean, that's useful, right?

853
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,600
 Like I was saying in the last back,

854
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,600
 what's the point of praying for world peace or stuff?

855
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,600
 You might as well pray for something

856
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,600
 that's actually going to help you in the short term.

857
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,600
 - Yeah.

858
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,600
 - And you're saying James,

859
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
 that God should be working on that world peace stuff anyway.

860
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,600
 - Yeah, exactly.

861
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,600
 - And a God that really loved you

862
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,600
 would help you found your new religion,

863
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,600
 which doesn't worship him.

864
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,600
 - Do you know my favorite fact,

865
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
 the favorite thing about the survey that this fact comes from

866
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,600
 is that it founds that 48% of Americans pray every day.

867
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,600
 48%, so whoa, they're halfway there.

868
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,600
 Whoa, living on a prayer.

869
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,600
 - Actually, just a bit of background

870
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,600
 behind what this survey was.

871
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,600
 This was by a group called Lifeway Research,

872
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,600
 and they're an evangelical research firm,

873
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,600
 and it was 1,137 Americans.

874
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
 What's really nice about this is that every single person

875
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,600
 in this is a religious person,

876
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,600
 so we're getting a really good idea

877
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
 of their praying habits.

878
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
 It's not atheists who are just jumping in on this as well.

879
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,600
 - But what it means possibly is that the number of people

880
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,600
 who pray for a parking spot could be less than 7%

881
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,600
 over the whole population.

882
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,600
 - Absolutely, yeah, that's right, yes.

883
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,600
 But so, I mean, other things that were in the percentages

884
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,600
 of people admitting to what they prayed for,

885
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,600
 5% praying for someone's relationship to end,

886
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,600
 5% saying that they wanted someone to get fired,

887
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,600
 4% saying they wanted someone else to fail,

888
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,600
 - These are very low numbers, to be honest.

889
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,600
 - It could be just like there are a couple of dozen assholes

890
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
 in this survey who just pray for all this stuff,

891
00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,600
 couldn't it?

892
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
 - Yeah, they're praying for all this,

893
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,600
 one person's praying for all of this stuff

894
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,600
 that'll be weighted in the figures.

895
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,600
 - They call themselves a Catholic with a K.

896
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,600
 - I like that 21% pray to win the lottery,

897
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,600
 but 20% pray for success at something

898
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
 they put almost no effort in,

899
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
 which means that 1% of Americans

900
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,600
 think they're putting a lot of work into the lottery.

901
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:25,600
 - You're gonna go to the shop, you're gonna find,

902
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,600
 you're gonna fill those numbers in?

903
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,600
 - Syndicate stuff, yeah.

904
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,600
 And the other thing was about the results,

905
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
 so whether the prayers were answered.

906
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
 So 25% said that their prayers were answered all the time

907
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,600
 impressive, 21% most of the time,

908
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,600
 37% some of the time and 3% none of the time,

909
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,600
 literally no results from prayer for them.

910
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,600
 But 14% said I don't know

911
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,600
 whether my prayers are answered or not,

912
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,600
 which is interesting 'cause it implies that they're praying

913
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,600
 for things that are quite nebulous

914
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,600
 and it's unclear to them whether there are results.

915
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,600
 - Is there world peace now? I don't know.

916
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,600
 - Yeah, food for thought.

917
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,600
 If you want to pray for a parking space,

918
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
 then it's a good idea to pray

919
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:13,600
 for St. Francesca Cabrini,

920
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,600
 who is the unofficial patron saint of parking spaces.

921
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,600
 (laughing)

922
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
 - Unofficial. - Unofficial.

923
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,600
 - Like against a church gonna close this, yeah.

924
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,600
 - According to one priest,

925
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
 the reason that she is this unofficial patron state

926
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,600
 is that she lived in New York City,

927
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,600
 so she understands traffic.

928
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
 But she was the first American citizen

929
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,600
 to be canonized by the church.

930
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,600
 And Reverend Richard Coles says

931
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,600
 that if you want to pray to Francesca Cabrini,

932
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,600
 this is a good prayer to do.

933
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
 Mother Cabrini, mother Cabrini,

934
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:51,600
 please find me a space for my parking machine.

935
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,600
 - Okay.

936
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,600
 (laughing)

937
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,600
 - That's just what you can do.

938
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
 - I do like, you can go online

939
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,600
 and find prayers for basically anything in America.

940
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,600
 I was looking into one woman's website

941
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,600
 where she's put up a bunch of prayers

942
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,600
 for anyone who's selling their house.

943
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,600
 And so it's not even just the one prayer

944
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
 for the selling of the house.

945
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
 She gives this big list of multiple prayers.

946
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,600
 So the titles include prayer to sell our home quickly,

947
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,600
 and that's sort of like, oh, Lord, mighty in power,

948
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
 I pray for our home to sell quickly and goes on and on.

949
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,600
 Prayer for the right buyer.

950
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,600
 You have a prayer for smooth sales processes.

951
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
 There's the prayer for endurance during the sale of our home.

952
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,600
 And prayer for the bias financing.

953
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,600
 - Dan, is there a prayer not to find six gallons of tons?

954
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
 (laughing)

955
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
 - Doesn't work. Just doesn't work.

956
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,600
 (laughing)

957
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
 One of my favorite things is to make

958
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
 completely inappropriate comparisons

959
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
 between two unrelated surveys.

960
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
 So for example, in this prayer one,

961
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
 5% of Americans admitted to praying

962
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,600
 for success in something you knew wouldn't please God.

963
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,600
 And in a different survey,

964
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
 6% of Americans think that they could beat

965
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
 a grizzly bear in a fight.

966
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,600
 So are these the same people?

967
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,600
 - Would it please God

968
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,600
 to beat a grizzly bear in a fight?

969
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,600
 - Brian Blessed claims that he punched

970
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
 a polar bear in the face.

971
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
 - Oh, yeah.

972
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
 - You know, won the battle.

973
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,600
 - Was it on catamine?

974
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,600
 (laughing)

975
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:21,600
 - I've got an interesting prayer thing

976
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,600
 that I've never heard of before.

977
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,600
 This is when Muslims are praying,

978
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
 it's a thing that they can develop if they pray

979
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,600
 sort of a bit too hard.

980
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,600
 And I don't mean like the prayer itself,

981
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,600
 it's the physical thing.

982
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,600
 It's called a prayer callus,

983
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,600
 or the prayer bump.

984
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,600
 And it forms on the front of their forehead

985
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,600
 from when they're bending down into the ground.

986
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,600
 And if they're pushing too far down,

987
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,600
 it can slowly develop on their head.

988
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
 So you can actually see photos online

989
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,600
 of people who've just got these giant calluses

990
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
 on the front of their foreheads.

991
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,600
 - Is it also like a good thing to have

992
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
 because it shows how devout you are

993
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,600
 because you pray so much.

994
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:58,600
 - Yes, exactly.

995
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,600
 It's like a sign of look how dedicated I am

996
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,600
 to the prayers that are going on.

997
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,600
 - Well, Dan, have you heard of a prayer nut?

998
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
 - No.

999
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,600
 - So this is a, it's not a medical condition.

1000
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,600
 It's a completely unrelated thing actually,

1001
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,600
 but it's a carved nut that you wear

1002
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,600
 around your neck or you pop it onto your belt.

1003
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,600
 And it opens up, it's a carved nut shell

1004
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,600
 that has been carved on the inside

1005
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,600
 with incredibly detailed scenes of,

1006
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,600
 it's a Christian thing.

1007
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,600
 So it's the crucifixion or Virgin Mary

1008
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,600
 or Moses and the serpent, all sorts.

1009
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,600
 And these are about 500 years old.

1010
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,600
 So to put that into context,

1011
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,600
 that's as long as a really long experiment

1012
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:41,600
 into some bacteria.

1013
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:48,600
 - I read a survey about which saints people prayed for

1014
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,600
 to fight against COVID infections.

1015
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,600
 And they did a little survey and said,

1016
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,600
 "You've been praying against COVID, who did you pray to?"

1017
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,600
 And the number one person that people prayed to most

1018
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,600
 was Saint Rita, who is the patron saint of lost causes.

1019
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,600
 She was always invoked in really difficult situations

1020
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,600
 by Catholics quite a lot.

1021
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,600
 There was another one, Saint Roche of Montpellier,

1022
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,600
 and he was prayed to because he got the plague

1023
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,600
 and then he got better.

1024
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
 And whenever he went anywhere in Europe,

1025
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,600
 the plague would suddenly disappear from wherever he went

1026
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
 according to the stories.

1027
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
 - Wow.

1028
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,600
 - Some people also prayed to Saint Corona, who he was.

1029
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
 - Who was Saint Corona?

1030
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
 - James, can I go back to the first one?

1031
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,600
 Why is there a patron saint of lost causes?

1032
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,600
 As in, if you're praying to the patron saint of lost causes.

1033
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
 - Yeah, maybe you're that 3% of people

1034
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
 who don't get anything back from the prayers.

1035
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,600
 That's who they're praying to.

1036
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
 - I don't understand, I'm praying every day.

1037
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:52,600
 Prayer has been modernized a bit.

1038
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
 There was a brilliant piece in the Guardian earlier this year,

1039
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
 and I'm just going to quite directly from it now, right?

1040
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
 So this is the author.

1041
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,600
 When my 87-year-old mother, Patricia Collinson,

1042
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,600
 was given an Alexa speaker by my sister,

1043
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,600
 she was delighted to find she could ask it to say the Hail Mary.

1044
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,600
 Every morning for a week, the devout Catholic

1045
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
 asked Alexa to recite the prayer.

1046
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,600
 Unfortunately, what this elderly lady didn't realize

1047
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,600
 was that she had ordered a premium subscription,

1048
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,600
 payable through Amazon, to a private company called

1049
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
 Catholic Prayers, which then charges you, I don't know,

1050
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,600
 a couple of quid a prayer or a tenor a month or whatever.

1051
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,600
 And because it's a voice-activated thing,

1052
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,600
 it doesn't read out all the terms and conditions

1053
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:35,600
 and say, "You are, by the way, buying these prayers."

1054
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
 So that's a problem.

1055
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
 - But then, I would have thought,

1056
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,600
 I'm not that religious anymore, I grew up religious,

1057
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,600
 but I'm not now, but I would have thought that

1058
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,600
 you're the one who has to say the prayer, right?

1059
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,600
 You can't just get a machine to do it for you.

1060
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,600
 Imagine getting to the pearly gates

1061
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:53,600
 and seeing your Alexa get into heaven ahead of you.

1062
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,600
 - Alexa, open gates.

1063
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,600
 Alexa, open gates.

1064
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,600
 There's quite a few studies on whether prayer works or not,

1065
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
 as you can imagine.

1066
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,600
 And there was a recent meta study that I read

1067
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,600
 that began with prayer has been reported to improve outcomes

1068
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,600
 in human as well as non-human species

1069
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,600
 to have no effect on outcomes, to worsen outcomes,

1070
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:21,600
 and to have retrospective healing effects.

1071
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,600
 So basically, all sorts of studies saying lots of different things.

1072
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
 But there's one idea.

1073
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,600
 I saw one study from 2006, which was quite scientifically rigorous,

1074
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,600
 and they seem to find that patients who knew they'd been prayed for

1075
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,600
 had higher rates of postoperative complications.

1076
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:44,600
 And the idea being that because the expectations had been increased,

1077
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,600
 they perhaps got more stressed about it and got more sick.

1078
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:52,600
 But also, I saw another paper which said that praying is good

1079
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
 because it's a bit like meditation,

1080
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,600
 especially if you're chanting things again and again and again.

1081
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,600
 And meditation has been shown to kind of reduce heart rate

1082
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:06,600
 and to increase levels of serotonin and stuff like that.

1083
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
 So it could be that when you're praying,

1084
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,600
 it's not good for the person you're praying for,

1085
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,600
 but it's not bad for you.

1086
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,600
 I love praying. I've been getting into it recently,

1087
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
 and I'm not religious at all,

1088
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,600
 but it's a nice mental space to think about people

1089
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,600
 where there's no other format of that elsewhere,

1090
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,600
 where you actively sit down silently and think of people.

1091
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,600
 So that must be why I've been getting all these amazing parking spots done.

1092
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,600
 Thanks for that.

1093
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,600
 Is it why I've been suffering lots of complications from operations I haven't even had?

1094
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
 It's really a dank.

1095
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,600
 Can you knock it off?

1096
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,600
 Your heart's in terrible shape.

1097
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,600
 It matters.

1098
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
 Andy, I found a thing you might like.

1099
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,600
 I mean, it's just a religious prayer thing,

1100
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,600
 and it's Casio do prayer watches.

1101
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
 No.

1102
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,600
 Yeah, they are for, you need to be Muslim for it to be an effective thing,

1103
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,600
 but what they come with is basically a little dial

1104
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,600
 that shows you where Mecca is, so it can point to it.

1105
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,600
 Should you need to know where it is,

1106
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,600
 and also has five alarms on it for the five times of the day

1107
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
 that you need for the prayer to go.

1108
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
 It's just alarms to let you know you look down,

1109
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,600
 you see where Mecca is, you get going.

1110
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,600
 Yeah, that's so good.

1111
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,600
 So I've got something that's clearly tangentially related,

1112
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,600
 but this demonstrates my incredible ability

1113
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,600
 to turn literally anything into an animal story.

1114
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:29,600
 The praying mantis has a single ear in the middle of its chest.

1115
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:33,600
 It has like a cyclopean unpaired ear.

1116
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,600
 So does that mean that it can't,

1117
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,600
 you know how you have two eyes so you can tell depth perception?

1118
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
 Yeah.

1119
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,600
 Does that mean that it doesn't have any hearing, depth perception?

1120
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,600
 Yeah, so our two ears allows to localize where sounds coming from,

1121
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:47,600
 and the mantis doesn't really need to do that.

1122
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,600
 So all it's listening out for is the echolocation sounds of bats,

1123
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,600
 and when it hears that, it just drops.

1124
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,600
 Like it's flying along and it hears a bat,

1125
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
 and it just drops out of the sky.

1126
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,600
 So it doesn't need to know where the bat's coming from.

1127
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,600
 All it needs to do is go, "Ugh!"

1128
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,600
 and like duck out of the way.

1129
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,600
 That's amazing.

1130
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,600
 Is it the only animal with one ear?

1131
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,600
 I don't know.

1132
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,600
 I think I'm pretty sure.

1133
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,600
 I've not heard of any other animals with one ear.

1134
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
 Okay.

1135
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,600
 Picasso.

1136
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,600
 Van Gogh.

1137
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,600
 Van Gogh.

1138
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:26,600
 He also is just like ducking whenever he hears a bat.

1139
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,600
 Whenever he saw a sunflower, he would just drop to the ground.

1140
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,600
 I just want to quickly add,

1141
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,600
 because Ed, you just mentioned the praying mantis with the ear

1142
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,600
 and its hearing ability to escape predators.

1143
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,600
 There was something in your new book, which I absolutely love,

1144
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,600
 which is Tree Frog Embryos,

1145
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,600
 and how basically they're still in their unhatched shell,

1146
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,600
 and what they can do is they can detect vibrations

1147
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,600
 of an attacking predator,

1148
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,600
 and what they do is then they release an enzyme from their face,

1149
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,600
 and it dissolves the casing,

1150
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,600
 and then they can make an escape away from the predator,

1151
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
 while still an embryo.

1152
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,600
 Yeah, it's amazing.

1153
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,600
 They can make active decisions about when they're going to hatch,

1154
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,600
 based on stuff that they sense around the egg,

1155
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,600
 and they can tell...

1156
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,600
 So the thing that's most likely to threaten them is a snake,

1157
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,600
 and they can distinguish between the kinds of vibrations

1158
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,600
 made by a snake numbing on one of their siblings,

1159
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,600
 and just wind, or even an earthquake.

1160
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,600
 So it's not like any kind of shaking

1161
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,600
 will make them go, "Burr!"

1162
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
 and burst out of the egg.

1163
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,600
 It's specifically the kinds of rhythms

1164
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
 that a protruding predator makes.

1165
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:41,600
 So how on earth can they know that without having experienced it?

1166
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,600
 Is that knowledge...

1167
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,600
 It's got to be instinct, I think.

1168
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,600
 It's got to be some pre-programmed thing,

1169
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,600
 but yeah, it's wild.

1170
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,600
 It's really wild that they can do that

1171
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,600
 without any kind of experience,

1172
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,600
 without literally having been born yet.

1173
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,600
 Nature.

1174
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:03,600
 Dan will be returning to BBC Two next week at 10pm.

1175
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:10,600
 OK, that's it. That's all of our facts.

1176
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,600
 Thank you so much for listening.

1177
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,600
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

1178
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,600
 about the things that we've said over the course of this podcast,

1179
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,600
 we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

1180
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,600
 I'm on @Sriberland, Andy...

1181
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,600
 @AndrewHunterM, James...

1182
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,600
 @JamesHarken, and @Ed...

1183
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,600
 @EdYong209.

1184
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:28,600
 That's right, and also just a reminder,

1185
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,600
 Ed's new book, An Immense World.

1186
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,600
 How animal senses reveal the hidden realms around us is out now.

1187
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
 It's absolutely awesome.

1188
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,600
 It's packed, basically, just paragraph by paragraph,

1189
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,600
 with more facts than we could ever fit

1190
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,600
 into 400 episodes of this show.

1191
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
 It's just absolutely awesome.

1192
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
 It's a New York Times best-selling book right this minute.

1193
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,600
 Congratulations, Ed, on that.

1194
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:50,600
 That's absolutely awesome.

1195
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,600
 And if anyone wants to chat to the group of No Such Thing,

1196
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
 generally, go to @NoSuchThing on our Twitter account,

1197
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,600
 or go to NoSuchThingasafish.com,

1198
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,600
 check out all of our previous episodes up there.

1199
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,600
 But, you know, why not just get Ed's book instead?

1200
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,600
 It's much better.

1201
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,600
 Do you want to send Ed a song about something that you've done?

1202
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,600
 Yes.

1203
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,600
 If you've got a spare tongue and a jar that you feel at home...

1204
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,600
 Yeah, dorset, egg yolks, envelopes that you need to get rid of.

1205
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,600
 OK, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

1206
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,600
 We'll see you then. Goodbye.

1207
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,600
 ( music playing )

1208
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,600
 ( music playing )

1209
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,600
 ( music playing )

1210
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,180
 (upbeat music)
