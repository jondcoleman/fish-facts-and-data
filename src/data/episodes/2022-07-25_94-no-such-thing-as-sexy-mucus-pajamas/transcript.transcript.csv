00:00:09,00:00:15,(cheering and applause)
00:00:15,00:00:19,"Hello and welcome to another episode of ""Those Such Things As A Fish"""
00:00:19,00:00:21,a weekly podcast this week coming to you
00:00:21,00:00:23,from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Grennitch.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Triber.
00:00:24,00:00:26,"I'm joined as ever by Annachosinski,"
00:00:26,00:00:28,James Harkin and Andy Murray.
00:00:28,00:00:30,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,"
00:00:30,00:00:33,but this time with your favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:33,00:00:36,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:36,00:00:37,Okay.
00:00:37,00:00:40,I have a fact about the silver age of comics.
00:00:40,00:00:41,Who's that from?
00:00:41,00:00:42,"Hey, hello."
00:00:42,00:00:44,Should we do a Twitter fact while we're waiting
00:00:44,00:00:45,for the microphones to get over?
00:00:45,00:00:50,So this was sent in to us by John Winterholt.
00:00:50,00:00:52,There is a chemical called our soul.
00:00:52,00:00:53,(laughter)
00:00:53,00:00:55,Nobody knows what it smells like yet.
00:00:55,00:00:57,(laughter)
00:00:57,00:00:59,"I tweeted him back to say, ""Is that true?"""
00:00:59,00:01:01,"And he said, ""Yeah, I study our soul for a living."""
00:01:01,00:01:04,(laughter)
00:01:04,00:01:05,Apparently true.
00:01:05,00:01:09,"He also told me that there's another one called ourspane,"
00:01:09,00:01:10,which is true as well.
00:01:10,00:01:13,"And he said, interestingly, there's a mineral found"
00:01:13,00:01:15,"near the town of Cummington, Massachusetts,"
00:01:15,00:01:17,"and that's been called ""Coming Tonight."""
00:01:17,00:01:19,(laughter)
00:01:19,00:01:22,"There's one called ""Wellshite."""
00:01:22,00:01:22,"It was ""Wellshite,"""
00:01:22,00:01:25,"but it's named after a guy called somebody ""Wellsh."""
00:01:25,00:01:26,"Nobody ""Wellsh"" or something."
00:01:26,00:01:27,"It's ""Wellsh."""
00:01:27,00:01:31,"There's a molecule called, I think it's nitrogen triiodide."
00:01:31,00:01:34,It's one of the most crazy molecules you can get.
00:01:34,00:01:36,"For a molecule, it's pretty crazy."
00:01:36,00:01:41,But apparently it will blow up if a mosquito lands on it.
00:01:41,00:01:42,Really?
00:01:42,00:01:44,"Yeah, it's the energy of a mosquito landing on it"
00:01:44,00:01:46,will make it explode.
00:01:46,00:01:48,Is the mosquito alright?
00:01:48,00:01:50,"It's just a molecule, isn't it? It's probably fine."
00:01:50,00:01:51,Yeah.
00:01:51,00:01:52,Shall we go to the front?
00:01:52,00:01:53,What's your name?
00:01:53,00:01:54,Charlie.
00:01:54,00:01:55,"What's your fact, Charlie?"
00:01:55,00:01:56,This is my major comics.
00:01:56,00:01:59,"In the late 50s, last 60s, comics with gorillas on the front,"
00:01:59,00:02:01,so consider to be more than comics without.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"DC Comics, but gorillas on every single copy,"
00:02:04,00:02:06,even if there's no gorillas inside.
00:02:06,00:02:07,(laughter)
00:02:07,00:02:08,That's so good.
00:02:08,00:02:09,Amazing.
00:02:09,00:02:10,Pretty good.
00:02:10,00:02:11,Wow.
00:02:11,00:02:15,(applause)
00:02:15,00:02:18,So Superman would just be tackling a gorilla on the front
00:02:18,00:02:21,and then it had no relevance to the story.
00:02:21,00:02:27,"A comic we've seen from Man and a gorilla would sign him a ticket or like a zoo ticket, I think."
00:02:27,00:02:29,Why would a gorilla be selling a zoo ticket?
00:02:29,00:02:30,(laughter)
00:02:30,00:02:32,That's them colluding in their own imprisonment.
00:02:32,00:02:36,(laughter)
00:02:36,00:02:38,Do you know what gorillas favorite films are?
00:02:38,00:02:39,No.
00:02:39,00:02:40,No.
00:02:40,00:02:42,This sounds like a stat of a joke.
00:02:42,00:02:44,(laughter)
00:02:44,00:02:47,"Now, this was, I read this, this weekend,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"in the Sunday Times somewhere, and it's by a musician who's really famous"
00:02:50,00:02:52,but I can't remember who it is 'cause I don't know anything about music.
00:02:52,00:02:56,But he hung out with people who've studied gorillas and they gave him a bunch of films
00:02:56,00:03:01,and they worked out which ones the gorillas asked with their hands to watch the most frequently.
00:03:01,00:03:04,And what do you reckon the gorillas favorite film is?
00:03:04,00:03:05,Planet of the Apes.
00:03:05,00:03:06,Very good.
00:03:06,00:03:07,No.
00:03:07,00:03:08,"Planet of the Apes, yeah."
00:03:08,00:03:09,Really.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"And then the second favorite was a film about a Sasquatch, a Yessie."
00:03:13,00:03:15,So obviously they feel very close to Yessies.
00:03:15,00:03:18,"Maybe they are genetically somehow related, I think, they think."
00:03:18,00:03:20,The first favorite was just done stand-up.
00:03:20,00:03:22,(laughter)
00:03:22,00:03:25,They didn't subject them to that James.
00:03:25,00:03:27,(laughter)
00:03:27,00:03:29,The RSPCA we're getting for.
00:03:29,00:03:31,(laughter)
00:03:31,00:03:34,I watched the Mummy 3 on the weekend.
00:03:34,00:03:35,That did too.
00:03:35,00:03:36,There's a Mummy 3.
00:03:36,00:03:39,There's a scene in it where there's just so much chaos going on.
00:03:39,00:03:41,The terracotta warriors have become alive.
00:03:41,00:03:45,There's this old Chinese group of skeletons that have come back up.
00:03:45,00:03:46,It's Jason and the Argonaut style.
00:03:46,00:03:49,And then suddenly these two giant Yetties come in.
00:03:49,00:03:51,"And the good guys go, oh, oh, Yetties."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"And the Yetties are like, we're good guys."
00:03:53,00:03:54,"And they go, great."
00:03:54,00:03:56,And then everyone just accepts it.
00:03:56,00:03:58,(laughter)
00:03:58,00:03:59,It's just fine.
00:03:59,00:04:02,We've got Yettie Allies now who are helping us.
00:04:02,00:04:04,Do Yetties in the myths about Yetties?
00:04:04,00:04:05,Do they attack people?
00:04:05,00:04:06,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:06,00:04:07,Okay.
00:04:07,00:04:08,They can be kind as well.
00:04:08,00:04:09,There's a...
00:04:09,00:04:11,(laughter)
00:04:11,00:04:13,I regret asking my original question.
00:04:13,00:04:19,There's a lady in Bhutan who claims that she lived and had children with Yettie.
00:04:19,00:04:22,"And the Yettie, they had about six children."
00:04:22,00:04:25,And then she said that she was going back to society.
00:04:25,00:04:27,She wanted to bring the children with them.
00:04:27,00:04:29,But the Yetties said that's not going to happen.
00:04:29,00:04:33,So they went to Yettie Court and the Yettie won custody of the children.
00:04:33,00:04:35,And that's why she doesn't have them.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"In Bhutan, this is a stretch of a link."
00:04:38,00:04:45,But every government policy has to justify itself according to its world happiness index rating.
00:04:45,00:04:46,Doesn't it?
00:04:46,00:04:47,Doesn't that mean that we don't have gross national happiness?
00:04:47,00:04:48,Yeah.
00:04:48,00:04:51,"So every time you make a policy, you have to say how it's going to affect the gross national happiness."
00:04:51,00:04:54,It's the only country where it's like made that and put that into policy.
00:04:54,00:04:55,I've been to Bhutan.
00:04:55,00:04:56,I've been to Bhutan.
00:04:56,00:04:57,"Yeah, I have been to Bhutan."
00:04:57,00:05:01,I remember I went to the National Museum because I wanted to see the world's biggest book.
00:05:01,00:05:03,They claim to have the world's biggest book.
00:05:03,00:05:05,And it's a book about Bhutan.
00:05:05,00:05:08,How convenient.
00:05:08,00:05:12,And I was in the museum and there was that they had a rat problem.
00:05:12,00:05:13,Someone had seen a rat.
00:05:13,00:05:18,"But because it was run by monks, because it's quite a, you know, a Buddhist country,"
00:05:18,00:05:21,they weren't allowed to hurt the rat in any way.
00:05:21,00:05:25,So they weren't allowed to put poison down or they weren't allowed to put traps down or anything like that.
00:05:25,00:05:29,So all the monks were just chasing this rat.
00:05:29,00:05:30,Wow.
00:05:30,00:05:35,"What's the name of the very famous gorilla who's in, we talked about it on the cocoa."
00:05:35,00:05:36,Coco.
00:05:36,00:05:37,Do you know what cocoa's favourite movie is?
00:05:37,00:05:39,"I read this on the weekend, bizarrely."
00:05:39,00:05:40,"Okay, so let's just say who cocoa is."
00:05:40,00:05:41,Yes.
00:05:41,00:05:44,"So cocoa is a gorilla who learns sign language, I think, right?"
00:05:44,00:05:45,Yeah.
00:05:45,00:05:48,And learn more words in sign language than anyone else.
00:05:48,00:05:53,300 people just pick me up about today.
00:05:53,00:05:54,Yeah.
00:05:54,00:05:57,And it's often held up as a fact that animals might be able to learn language.
00:05:57,00:05:58,Yeah.
00:05:58,00:06:00,"So favourite movie, Pretty Woman."
00:06:00,00:06:01,Really?
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Oh, no."
00:06:02,00:06:03,So aspirational.
00:06:03,00:06:04,Yeah.
00:06:04,00:06:05,"Well done, huh?"
00:06:05,00:06:10,"By the way, Pretty Woman, the movie, they did a thing where they, the hotel that it was filmed in,"
00:06:10,00:06:13,now offers a Pretty Woman package so you can go.
00:06:13,00:06:15,Which is the worst message.
00:06:15,00:06:16,Oh.
00:06:16,00:06:19,I don't think they plot that footage properly.
00:06:19,00:06:21,Who's it for?
00:06:21,00:06:24,"It's for couples, yeah."
00:06:24,00:06:25,It's for couples.
00:06:25,00:06:26,Yeah.
00:06:26,00:06:27,Wow.
00:06:27,00:06:28,I've got a fact about movies.
00:06:28,00:06:29,This is a fact about the movie Leon.
00:06:29,00:06:30,Who's fact is about Leon.
00:06:30,00:06:32,Who's fact is about the film Leon?
00:06:32,00:06:33,"Oh, so over there."
00:06:33,00:06:34,"Oh, hey, over there."
00:06:34,00:06:36,"If you put your hand up, Alex will come and find you."
00:06:36,00:06:37,Cool.
00:06:37,00:06:40,"In the meantime, I've got a fact that came from Twitter."
00:06:40,00:06:43,And this is from someone called @riptor.
00:06:43,00:06:49,And the fact was that the 25th amendment allows vice presidents to take over as president
00:06:49,00:06:51,when the president incapacitated.
00:06:51,00:06:58,It's happened three times and each time the president was having a colonoscopy.
00:06:58,00:07:01,Those are the only three times presidents have been incapacitated.
00:07:01,00:07:07,Since the amendment has been shot and killed.
00:07:07,00:07:09,I keep going.
00:07:09,00:07:12,"No, since the amendment was made."
00:07:12,00:07:15,There's a thing about colonoscopies that you can explode during a colonoscopy.
00:07:15,00:07:16,Do you know that?
00:07:16,00:07:17,What?
00:07:17,00:07:22,"Yeah, because you have a lot of gas build up in your lower intestines."
00:07:22,00:07:27,And sometimes they'll use like a cotorizing heat thing.
00:07:27,00:07:29,"If you've got a cot, they try and kind of burn it."
00:07:29,00:07:34,And so that heat and the gases can cause people to actually explode.
00:07:34,00:07:35,Right.
00:07:35,00:07:39,"You would have thought, are they putting some kind of safeguards in place to stop this happening?"
00:07:39,00:07:44,"Or is it just, you know, 50/50, you'll either explode or..."
00:07:44,00:07:46,"That's kind of like what happens to trees, right?"
00:07:46,00:07:48,When they get colonoscopies.
00:07:48,00:07:49,What do you mean?
00:07:49,00:07:53,"Similar kind of, you know when trees are on fire, then sometimes it gets so hot"
00:07:53,00:07:55,and there's a build up of gas inside them and they explode.
00:07:55,00:07:57,There's really good videos of trees exploding.
00:07:57,00:08:02,"Well, lightning hits a tree that can explode because all the water turns immediately to water vapor"
00:08:02,00:08:04,and lots of it is near at the middle side.
00:08:04,00:08:05,It just goes out.
00:08:05,00:08:06,It's cool.
00:08:06,00:08:07,Not for the tree. It's about for the tree.
00:08:07,00:08:10,"But we have Leon fact, yeah."
00:08:10,00:08:11,Okay.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"So there's a scene in the movie, Leon."
00:08:13,00:08:17,Where there are loads of police cars parked outside a building.
00:08:17,00:08:22,"And while they were filming that scene, a man who had just run a shop, ran onto the movie set,"
00:08:22,00:08:25,thought it was the real police and handed himself in.
00:08:25,00:08:33,It's such amazing.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"So, what's your name?"
00:08:35,00:08:36,Suzy.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Suzy. That's an amazing guy.
00:08:37,00:08:40,"I mean, how long did they let the Gerard continue?"
00:08:40,00:08:43,They were method actors. They probably would have.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"Take them to the station, then they would have got in trouble themselves."
00:08:46,00:08:50,Gary Oldman is going to be arresting you today. Very exciting.
00:08:50,00:08:52,Someone actually tweeted in.
00:08:52,00:08:57,This is from Twitter earlier that Gary Newman is actually three weeks younger than Gary Oldman.
00:08:57,00:08:59,Unfortunately.
00:08:59,00:09:05,Didn't think that thought about police.
00:09:05,00:09:10,"In ancient Egypt, the head of the police was called the chief of the hitters."
00:09:10,00:09:15,That's why we've talked on the podcast about the world's oldest parking fine issued by traffic wardens.
00:09:15,00:09:20,"Which was to be decapitated, I believe."
00:09:20,00:09:22,"Oh, no, no."
00:09:22,00:09:25,"It was to be impaled, wasn't it?"
00:09:25,00:09:28,Yeah. On a spike for crossing on the King's land.
00:09:28,00:09:31,"That was when, yeah, the King owned all of the roads."
00:09:31,00:09:33,So I think it was quite hard to get around.
00:09:33,00:09:41,"The first, the first ever British parking ticket that was given was accidentally given to a doctor who was making an emergency call to a house."
00:09:41,00:09:44,And so they had to override the parking ticket.
00:09:44,00:09:47,So the first parking ticket was a cock up and they had to undo it.
00:09:47,00:09:50,And I think the first American one was overwritten as well.
00:09:50,00:09:54,The first American one was a guy who said I literally just went into the shop for five minutes and I've come back and my tickets here.
00:09:54,00:09:57,"And he, you know, appealed and got it overwritten."
00:09:57,00:09:59,Has any parking ticket ever been successful?
00:09:59,00:10:00,No.
00:10:00,00:10:02,All the ones that I've ever got have been.
00:10:02,00:10:09,I've never told you about the guy in London in that I think it was the 60s or might be in early 70s who electrocuted his car.
00:10:09,00:10:14,"So that when traffic wardens tried to put a ticket on them, they got electrocuted."
00:10:14,00:10:15,Wow.
00:10:15,00:10:18,He was in like the newspapers and stuff. He became really famous.
00:10:18,00:10:20,"Yeah, when he was arrested, right?"
00:10:20,00:10:26,"Yeah, well, he was arrested, but they let him off in the end because he'd become such a kind of cause celebra."
00:10:26,00:10:31,Surely electrocuting a policeman is a bigger crime than parking on a double yellow line.
00:10:31,00:10:35,"Sorry, like not electrocuted because the word electrocuting means killing by electricity."
00:10:35,00:10:39,"He electrified them, let's say, with like a little bit of a shot."
00:10:39,00:10:41,They should have charged him.
00:10:41,00:10:42,Yes.
00:10:42,00:10:51,"That's, he's like an angle grinder man in Kent."
00:10:51,00:11:00,He was that superhero. He called himself the real life superhero and he went around with his angle grinder removing clamps from a car that had been clamped.
00:11:00,00:11:04,No one knew who he was for a long time until he did an interview with a newspaper and people did.
00:11:04,00:11:05,Yeah.
00:11:05,00:11:07,"You know at the end of Iron Man when he says, ""I'm Iron Man."""
00:11:07,00:11:10,"It's like, ""Whaah, was he like I'm Iron, Iron, Iron, Iron Man?"""
00:11:10,00:11:14,"And they went, ""Mmm, I mean he could pronounce it, so that helped."""
00:11:14,00:11:18,But I escaped that.
00:11:18,00:11:23,"Okay, genuinely as well. Just ran with it and went, ""I'm just going to mush it up so hard."""
00:11:23,00:11:25,"I was like, ""I'm a work ironman."""
00:11:25,00:11:28,"And then, ""Oh, shall we move on to another fact?"""
00:11:28,00:11:30,"Yeah, yeah, let's move on to our next fact."
00:11:30,00:11:35,"Okay, so this is about a ghost army in World War II."
00:11:35,00:11:38,"Alright, so while we're waiting for the mics to get over, here's another Twitter one."
00:11:38,00:11:41,This is from Matthew Oglesby.
00:11:41,00:11:45,The new organist of Leeds Cathedral is David Pipe.
00:11:45,00:11:47,That's quite nice.
00:11:47,00:11:48,There he is.
00:11:48,00:11:51,I'm a massive fan of nominative determinism.
00:11:51,00:11:54,Did you meet the guy who coined the term?
00:11:54,00:11:57,"Yeah, we met him very many times."
00:11:57,00:12:00,"Yeah, we met him very many times."
00:12:00,00:12:03,"Yeah, nominative determinism."
00:12:03,00:12:05,What was the...
00:12:05,00:12:08,"Remember you found the ultimate one, which was to do with..."
00:12:08,00:12:09,"Oh, Henry Head."
00:12:09,00:12:10,"Yeah, that was it."
00:12:10,00:12:14,"Yeah, so there was a neuroscientist called Henry Head."
00:12:14,00:12:17,And he discovered this thing called head zones.
00:12:17,00:12:22,"You don't have one in your head, but you do have one in the head of your genitals if you're a man."
00:12:22,00:12:26,But he was the head of a journal called Brain.
00:12:26,00:12:33,"And when he left this head of the journal Brain, he was taken over by a guy called Brain."
00:12:33,00:12:37,So head was the head of Brain until he wasn't the head of Brain anymore.
00:12:37,00:12:41,"And he was taken over as the head of Brain by Brain, who became the head of Brain."
00:12:41,00:12:42,So good.
00:12:42,00:12:44,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:12:44,00:12:50,"I mean, no one knew what was going on in that organisation."
00:12:50,00:12:52,"I saw one the other day, actually."
00:12:52,00:12:53,I tweeted about it.
00:12:53,00:12:54,Let me think.
00:12:54,00:12:57,It was a guy who'd written a book about swearing.
00:12:57,00:13:00,And he was called Sega Dam.
00:13:00,00:13:01,That's good.
00:13:01,00:13:02,That's good.
00:13:02,00:13:03,"S-A-I, his first name, Sega Dam."
00:13:03,00:13:04,That's nice.
00:13:04,00:13:09,"Someone sent me one on Twitter the other day, which was a herdler whose surname is Stumble over."
00:13:09,00:13:11,"Oh, he's so good."
00:13:11,00:13:14,I think he actually famously fell over a hurdle.
00:13:14,00:13:15,It was a sheet.
00:13:15,00:13:16,A sheet.
00:13:16,00:13:18,"Yeah, potato potato."
00:13:18,00:13:22,"I think, didn't she stumble over a hurdle in quite an important moment?"
00:13:22,00:13:23,"Yeah, maybe really six, yeah."
00:13:23,00:13:24,Yeah.
00:13:24,00:13:25,"Okay, shall we go on to the facts?"
00:13:25,00:13:27,"Yes, so your name and your fact, please."
00:13:27,00:13:28,All right.
00:13:28,00:13:29,I'm Nora.
00:13:29,00:13:40,"So my fact was that there was a ghost army in the Second World War, where the Allies used rubber, inflatable tanks and recorded troop sounds to trick the German army into thinking the enemy was there."
00:13:40,00:13:42,But there's a ghost army.
00:13:42,00:13:45,They call it a mass army because they didn't actually exist.
00:13:45,00:13:46,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:13:46,00:13:47,"No, no, no, no."
00:13:47,00:13:48,"No, no, no."
00:13:48,00:13:49,"No, no, no."
00:13:49,00:13:50,"No, no, no."
00:13:50,00:13:51,"No, no, no."
00:13:51,00:13:52,"No, no, no."
00:13:52,00:13:53,"No, no, no."
00:13:53,00:13:54,"No, no, no."
00:13:54,00:13:55,"No, no, no."
00:13:55,00:13:56,"No, no, no."
00:13:56,00:13:57,"No, no, no."
00:13:57,00:13:58,"No, no, no."
00:13:58,00:13:59,"No, no, no."
00:13:59,00:14:00,"No, no, no."
00:14:00,00:14:01,"No, no, no."
00:14:01,00:14:02,"No, no, no."
00:14:02,00:14:03,"No, no, no."
00:14:03,00:14:04,"No, no, no."
00:14:04,00:14:05,"No, no, no."
00:14:05,00:14:06,"No, no, no."
00:14:06,00:14:07,"No, no, no."
00:14:07,00:14:08,"No, no, no."
00:14:08,00:14:09,"No, no, no."
00:14:09,00:14:10,"No, no."
00:14:10,00:14:11,"No, no, no."
00:14:11,00:14:12,"No, no."
00:14:12,00:14:17,"It was, I think Churchill was at the head of the organization which was, you know, pioneering"
00:14:17,00:14:22,tank making and they were called something like land ships. It was called like the land
00:14:22,00:14:25,ships organization or something like that in the First World War when they were developing
00:14:25,00:14:28,them. And they just decided to call them tanks as a code word because they were going to send
00:14:28,00:14:32,"them into Russia disguised as water tanks. And first of all, they wanted to call them, they"
00:14:32,00:14:37,"called them W's, they called them water compartments at first but because war obviously tended to abbreviate"
00:14:37,00:14:42,things. People kept mixing them up. People kept going and urinating on the military vehicles.
00:14:42,00:14:46,"So they said we can't call them W's, but they called them tanks because they wanted the Russians"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"to think they were tanks of water. But yeah, the Russians were on our side in the First World War."
00:14:50,00:14:53,"I know, I said Russians and I hoped again, like down that no one came up with it."
00:14:53,00:15:02,You're just a little thing like website we were fighting. People made these mistakes all the time.
00:15:02,00:15:07,"Okay, I think we're going to have to keep moving on because we're shot of time aren't we?"
00:15:07,00:15:18,"Okay, who is Jennifer Matthews? Jennifer Matthews is over here. So, um, Parrotfish, where pajamas,"
00:15:18,00:15:25,"protective pajamas at night time, and then they eat them in the morning. Wow, does anything"
00:15:25,00:15:35,"special about that? No, that's it. We said interesting facts. No, that's amazing. So they"
00:15:35,00:15:41,agreed a mucous that has a hole in the front and the hole in the back so that water can flow through.
00:15:41,00:15:47,And the mucous is apparently meant to stop predators from spelling them. And it means that
00:15:47,00:15:52,"they're protected overnight while they sleep, but it's a vital source of protein so they eat"
00:15:52,00:16:03,"it in the morning. Oh my god, no, it's amazing. Yeah. It's not the sexiest pajamas of the world,"
00:16:03,00:16:08,"is it? When you say, I'm just going to go slip into something, I'll just get a little"
00:16:08,00:16:15,slip into something more you can see. How do you like your breakfast?
00:16:15,00:16:27,"And Parrotfish, they're the guys who they, um, they make sand as well, do they? Yeah, they poop"
00:16:27,00:16:37,"islands. Yeah. Yeah. Bit by bit. Well, for an average Parrotfish, they poop 275 grams per day,"
00:16:37,00:16:45,but the biggest Parrotfish can make 90 kilograms. In 90 kilograms a day? I don't actually
00:16:45,00:16:51,"know of it today. It might be for you, but the biggest Parrotfish. That's quite a different,"
00:16:51,00:17:01,"when you go to your doctor, how much are you pooing? It's either twice a day or twice a year. How big an"
00:17:01,00:17:08,"island have you produced? But yeah, that's the, it's this white kind of, white sand that they get"
00:17:08,00:17:13,"in the Caribbean and stuff, don't they? Yeah, so they eat coral, and when they eat coral, they eat"
00:17:13,00:17:19,"the tissue of the coral, and then they digest the calcium carbonate skeleton and poop the sand,"
00:17:19,00:17:25,and then the entire island in the Caribbean have been made up by the sand. Wow. So you could basically lie
00:17:25,00:17:32,in a pile of sand. I do that anyway. How do you know so much about Parrotfish? I'm a marine
00:17:32,00:17:47,biologist. Are you? You're going to walk whistle for that in the evening. Should we move on to
00:17:47,00:17:53,"that? Yeah, let's keep going. Okay. So this is about the new tallest building in London."
00:17:53,00:17:59,"Who's that? Ah, I'm not. Any Twitter one? Actually, this is really similar to the thing we just had,"
00:17:59,00:18:06,"the fringe limb tree frog, fringe limb tree frog parents grow extra layers of skin to feed their tadpoles."
00:18:06,00:18:13,"And this is, I like this so much because it's reminded me of my favourite fact at the moment,"
00:18:13,00:18:22,which is that breast milk. Mother's breast milk is made from arses. When you have a baby and you
00:18:22,00:18:26,"start producing breast milk, it's got fat cells in it, and the fat cells that are taken literally from"
00:18:26,00:18:34,the mother's bottom first is where they go from. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of spiders who will
00:18:34,00:18:40,eat their mother aren't there? There's at least a few of them. Really? So they'll give birth to the
00:18:40,00:18:50,"live spiders inside them and they'll eat their way out. Spiders. Okay, what's your name and what is"
00:18:50,00:18:57,"your facts, please? So my name is Bapinda, and my fact is that the new tallest building in London"
00:18:57,00:19:04,is going to be called undershaft. Amazing. It's really in the jersehs back. It's unbelievable.
00:19:04,00:19:10,Why is it so why is it being called that? I don't know. I just read it on the Guardian and laughed a lot.
00:19:10,00:19:19,"That's literally the extent that I do my research. Actually, I was reading the other day. It's a"
00:19:19,00:19:24,"building we've mentioned on the podcast before, but a building in London got voted the ugliest"
00:19:24,00:19:29,"or the most horrible building around, and it's the walkie talkie, and it was cited for being so bad"
00:19:29,00:19:36,because it keeps blowing people over and melting cars is the angle of the building has this magnifying
00:19:36,00:19:41,"on it that it's just melting cars, and the wind that is trapping, it's literally blowing people"
00:19:41,00:19:46,"onto the street, and people are furious. The architect who made it has designed another building in"
00:19:46,00:19:53,"America, which also has melted cars, and he's not learning his mistakes. He actually puts that on his"
00:19:53,00:20:02,"CV now. You've got a car, you need melted. This can be designed a multi-billion dollar building for you."
00:20:02,00:20:11,Alex was actually just telling me earlier that the shard in London goes down as deeper than Nelson's
00:20:11,00:20:19,column. I thought you were going to say it goes down deeper than it goes up. I thought he was going to
00:20:19,00:20:23,"say that, but I was quite disappointed. Something that does do that is the angel of and off. That goes"
00:20:23,00:20:28,"really. It's pretty much exact. It goes down deeper than the shard. And the underside is devilshaped,"
00:20:28,00:20:39,"isn't it? Yeah. That's tough. I'll wait, can I just say because I find this really interesting,"
00:20:39,00:20:44,"and I think I've never been allowed to say it on the podcast before, but we only recently discovered"
00:20:44,00:20:50,"how tall Nelson's column was. So it's been up since Nelson, so 200 years, and they just measured it"
00:20:50,00:20:55,"a couple of years ago, and they realised I think it's four metres higher than we thought, or it's"
00:20:55,00:21:00,"maybe it's four feet. Isn't that weird? We've never measured Nelson's column. Yeah, that's pretty"
00:21:00,00:21:05,"cool. You know, there are loads of Nelson's columns all over the place. I mean, not like millions."
00:21:07,00:21:11,"There I think a good dozen of them all over the UK, and there's one in Norfolk, which is where he"
00:21:11,00:21:18,"was from, I think, and it's just got an earn at the top of it, not Nelson. So there you go. But it"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"isn't Nelson's column. Nelson used to, I don't know if we ever put, I tried to get this on the podcast,"
00:21:22,00:21:28,"I don't know if it ever made on, but Nelson used to have a little hat for his eye. He just had a tiny"
00:21:28,00:21:34,"hat for his eye, and no one talks about it, and they shut. Because he naturally tried to get that"
00:21:34,00:21:38,"on every single week for a lot of time. Because it was like, you know, when you see American movies"
00:21:38,00:21:42,"where they're like doing accounts, and they had that sort of tennis hat that had the green"
00:21:42,00:21:46,"that you could see through, Nelson had that on his eye, this little green thing, so that he could,"
00:21:46,00:21:50,"because his eye got too much sun, and he was like, I want to get less sun, so they created"
00:21:50,00:21:55,"a little hat. I have a fact about Nelson. Okay, go on. Do you have it? It's from Brian. Brian,"
00:21:55,00:22:00,"by the way. You there? Hey, we'll go for a Twitter fact first. Okay, we'll go for a Twitter fact."
00:22:00,00:22:08,"And so this was sent to me by someone called Tim Worth 89, and he said that in 1774, one newspaper"
00:22:08,00:22:17,"estimated that out of the 872,564 married couples in England, only nine were entirely happy."
00:22:17,00:22:28,"You could read that as a whole nine. He was totally happy. He sent me a clipping,"
00:22:28,00:22:34,"an image of the clipping as well. It's so good. They had a breakdown of the whole 872,000,"
00:22:34,00:22:44,"and it's like 1300. The wives had he loapt, 2300. The husband had run away. There's about 19,000"
00:22:44,00:22:54,"that were in a state of open war. 16,000 had a lot of inward hatred about each other. Not"
00:22:54,00:23:00,"inward, if they're telling me into it. And 51 couples were living in a state of indifferent hate."
00:23:00,00:23:11,"Indifferent hate. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense at all. What period was this? This was in 1774."
00:23:11,00:23:21,"You know, between, it's for about 200 years, but between about 1675 and 1850, only about 370"
00:23:21,00:23:25,couples in England got divorced. And everyone needed an act of parliament?
00:23:25,00:23:29,"Exactly. How exciting is that? It's almost worth getting divorced. Every time you got divorced,"
00:23:29,00:23:33,they had to debate it in parliament. I think they look good together.
00:23:33,00:23:44,That was hardly a Hillary bed. Shall we move on to that?
00:23:44,00:23:53,"Yeah, sorry. In the Aberlton office in Nelson used to go for reports and stuff. And he had a small"
00:23:53,00:23:58,"mahogany box to stand on, because firstly he was quite short. And secondly, the Aberl sat on a"
00:23:58,00:24:04,"raised platform to make them higher than everybody that would come before them to speak,"
00:24:04,00:24:09,"so they maintained their authority. And yeah, he was the only person that ever had that concession."
00:24:09,00:24:13,"Wow. And I got to stand on that box, but I had to take my boots off first."
00:24:13,00:24:20,Did he have to take his boots off first?
00:24:20,00:24:24,"No, because I was just saying that. That would have come from her authority."
00:24:24,00:24:26,"Kind of negated the concession, wouldn't it really? Yeah, indeed."
00:24:26,00:24:28,"Stand up, take your boots off, oh, same height."
00:24:28,00:24:34,"I think Gillian Anderson used to have to do that in the ex files, Dana Scully."
00:24:34,00:24:38,She used to have to stand on a box when they were filming. She's quite a bit smaller than
00:24:38,00:24:42,"David Decoveny. And so for scenes where they were standing chatting, she would stand on a box."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"And yeah, that happens a lot in movies, I think."
00:24:45,00:24:48,"Oh, Charles and Lady Diana apparently did this as well."
00:24:48,00:24:53,"I have a Twitter fact about Charles and Lady Diana actually, so when we lead into that,"
00:24:53,00:24:59,"when Prince Charles married Lady Diana, the TV cables put in place for the wedding were run by a"
00:24:59,00:25:05,ferret. And I googled it and it's true. What? Yeah. What do you mean?
00:25:05,00:25:09,I don't mean he was physically with like a thing in the tank.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"All right, camera two, let's do this. Got a three, got a three."
00:25:13,00:25:19,"It was, it was, they had to get cables, I guess, into a mate, I'm guessing Westminster Abbey."
00:25:19,00:25:23,They have to go into small little holes and this is you tie it to a ferret and they run through.
00:25:23,00:25:29,"And they, yeah, I think British aerospace abused it for some kind of aeroplane."
00:25:29,00:25:32,"Yeah, they have, I think for building aeroplanes, it was amazing."
00:25:32,00:25:35,"That's what I thought, that's what I was going to say, but I thought it sounded so ridiculous."
00:25:36,00:25:42,"Ferrets, build aeroplane. But I think they actually cancelled that eventually because they kept"
00:25:42,00:25:46,jumping through the wires. So I think they ended up being quite unreliable. I seem to remember.
00:25:46,00:25:52,Someone sent me a tweet at Bangai Shot you sent me a tweet. And it's almost the same as this.
00:25:52,00:25:56,"It's like, there was a ferret called Misty who ran the cabling for the US Space Command,"
00:25:56,00:26:01,"for the Y2K Centre, and her fee was a strawberry pop tart."
00:26:02,00:26:07,Who negotiated that? That sounds like she actually asked for that.
00:26:07,00:26:13,"Yeah, it reminds me this of, there's a bridge over the Niagara River near the Niagara Falls."
00:26:13,00:26:18,"And the problem with bridges is, how do you get the first kind of thing over?"
00:26:18,00:26:22,"So once you've got a bit of a string over there, then you can pull something over,"
00:26:22,00:26:25,"and then you can pull something bigger over and bigger over, and then you eventually have a bridge."
00:26:25,00:26:29,"But if it's a really big, good preface, you use a bird."
00:26:29,00:26:33,"Well, it wasn't a bird, but it's close. Frisbee. Frisbee."
00:26:33,00:26:37,"No, it was a kite, a kite. Oh, nice."
00:26:37,00:26:41,"So they flew a kite up, and then it kind of went over, and then someone was on the other side,"
00:26:41,00:26:44,"and they could grab the kite, and then you had a string over, and then they could attach a"
00:26:44,00:26:48,"bit of wire onto that, and pull it across, and then a bit of a bigger wire."
00:26:48,00:26:51,"And then a tiny bit of wood, and then a little bit, a bigger bit of wood, and then eventually a bridge."
00:26:51,00:26:57,You can't get a Frisbee across Niagara Falls. I think.
00:26:57,00:27:02,"This is true, so you know. How good are you at Frisbee?"
00:27:02,00:27:06,You can get it across Niagara Falls. You can make it hover in the air while it deposits building materials.
00:27:06,00:27:14,"It's incredible. You know, you guys know the aerobie super disk?"
00:27:14,00:27:19,"Yeah. It's a great Frisbee, guys. It's the one that's completely hollow."
00:27:19,00:27:23,"It's plastic, and it's got a tough frame in the middle, so it keeps rigidity and stability."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"But it's rubber on the outside, so it doesn't hurt your hands."
00:27:27,00:27:29,"Anyway, this week's podcast is brought to you."
00:27:29,00:27:36,"It's the bee's knees, and they can get you, they've thrown one across Niagara Falls."
00:27:36,00:27:39,When have you ever had a friend to throw a Frisbee stick?
00:27:39,00:27:44,"It does take a while to play when I'm playing with the Frisbee super disk, because it goes so far."
00:27:44,00:27:47,Have you ever thought about getting a boomerang?
00:27:47,00:27:54,"Okay, let's move on with another fact."
00:27:54,00:27:58,Who has a fact that's about penises and the London Underground?
00:27:58,00:28:01,"James, you're going to need to narrow it down a bit."
00:28:01,00:28:09,"Hi, my name's Tom. So when the new headquarters of the London Underground Building was opened in 1929,"
00:28:09,00:28:15,"the statue of the front of a naked boy was so controversial, and there was such public outcry"
00:28:15,00:28:19,that the sculptor had to reduce the size of his penis by one and a half inches.
00:28:21,00:28:24,"Wow, that we ask from what?"
00:28:24,00:28:29,"12 is too much, 10 and a half will be fine."
00:28:29,00:28:36,"So is it the shorter the penis, the lower the rating of the film?"
00:28:36,00:28:38,"It was the film, it was the statue."
00:28:38,00:28:42,"Yeah, I'm sorry, I was extrapolating, but if that made it less obscene in the statue,"
00:28:42,00:28:44,it becomes less obscene the smaller the penis.
00:28:48,00:28:51,Are you sensing an opening for some small and bowed people?
00:28:51,00:29:05,"What was the, do you know any more about why they had a statue of a naked boy in the first place?"
00:29:05,00:29:10,"Yeah, yeah, kind of, so it was by Jacob Epstein who is this avant-garde, quite brutalist sculptor,"
00:29:10,00:29:13,and it was one of his first major commissions.
00:29:13,00:29:18,He has this quite long history of creating sculptures like he has one on what's now
00:29:18,00:29:22,"his in Bobway House on the Strand, and that's also been massively defaced because it was just"
00:29:22,00:29:26,full of naked people and people didn't like that in Edwardian Britain.
00:29:26,00:29:29,"But this one, it was kind of a compromise because there was public outcry and the head"
00:29:29,00:29:36,"of the tube at the time offered his resignation to keep the statue, it was that big a deal,"
00:29:36,00:29:40,"and they wanted to keep the head of the CEO of the London Underground, but as a compromise,"
00:29:40,00:29:44,"they said, ""Okay, well just trim the penis a little bit."""
00:29:44,00:29:46,Does that happen to all ancient statues?
00:29:46,00:29:50,"Like, the David have a massive cock originally, and they thought it was more civilized,"
00:29:50,00:29:54,"to have a small wedding day, but it was better to be small because if it was too big,"
00:29:54,00:29:56,you would lose heat and lose vigor.
00:29:56,00:30:05,"But this website had a picture of what had been done to the statue,"
00:30:05,00:30:08,"and underneath it just said, ""Yeah, this has actually happened,"
00:30:08,00:30:11,"and you thought the cuts to the London Underground today were controversial."""
00:30:11,00:30:15,That's very good.
00:30:15,00:30:19,"Hey, we should wrap up soon, so maybe let's just do a couple more."
00:30:19,00:30:21,"Let's, why don't we do a Twitter one each, so we all like?"
00:30:21,00:30:26,I'll start with mine. This was sent in by Jonathan Warlow.
00:30:26,00:30:31,Claire Danes and all her movies were banned from the Philippines after she badmouthed it in an
00:30:31,00:30:34,"interview, so they just said, ""No more Claire Danes movies."""
00:30:34,00:30:38,"Yeah, I'm kind of using this as an excuse, though, to talk about the Philippines,"
00:30:38,00:30:44,"because my dad's a hairdresser, and he also, he likes to sing Bee Gees Covers,"
00:30:44,00:30:48,"and he's got a really nice voice, and on the equivalent of Jonathan Ross there,"
00:30:48,00:30:51,they don't really have many people there to go on the show.
00:30:51,00:30:56,"So he often got asked to go on and sing Bee Gees Covers on this equivalent of Jonathan Ross,"
00:30:56,00:30:59,"called the Johnny Littins Show, and he was on it one day, and a Melder Marcos saw it,"
00:30:59,00:31:02,"and she called him up, and well, like Centro Letter's saying,"
00:31:02,00:31:07,"""I'd like to invite you to sing karaoke with me once a week."""
00:31:07,00:31:12,"And you can't really say no to someone like a Melder Marcos, so he had to do it."
00:31:12,00:31:15,"This is the fact that I learned of him through the back of doing that,"
00:31:15,00:31:18,"is that she said to him one day when they were mid Bee Gees song, ""Roger,"
00:31:18,00:31:23,"I get so tired about people talking about my having the largest shoe collection all the time."""
00:31:23,00:31:26,No one talks about the fact that I have the largest collection of spoons.
00:31:26,00:31:32,And she apparently likes to brag that she has the largest collection of silverware
00:31:32,00:31:34,"in the world, and no one talks about it, all the shoes."
00:31:34,00:31:38,"Oh yeah, the fucking shoes. No one talks about the silverware."
00:31:38,00:31:41,"So Anna, final fact?"
00:31:41,00:31:47,"Yeah, so my favourite fact on Twitter actually was that this is from @gulbatasaurus,"
00:31:47,00:31:52,and it was that the Korean term for grinding in a club is boobie boobie.
00:31:52,00:31:59,"Apparently, very like that. Andy, what do you got?"
00:31:59,00:32:04,"I really like the fact, and this is exactly how it was worded"
00:32:04,00:32:12,"as from Mina Kuzluka. Ottoman Emperor Abdul Havett made it illegal to use the words sibling,"
00:32:12,00:32:16,"star, bedbug, and nose. And then in brackets, he had a weird nose."
00:32:16,00:32:21,And James?
00:32:21,00:32:31,"Okay, this fact came from IDKT, IDKT, and it is that in the olden days to send paper money"
00:32:31,00:32:36,"through the post, people used to tear it in two pieces and post the halves separately."
00:32:36,00:32:42,"I don't even know if it's true, but I just really liked the ingenious idea of doing that."
00:32:42,00:32:46,"I'm trying to present a cellulite up 10 pound note of the musicians, and they didn't like it."
00:32:46,00:32:53,"But there was a guy in China, he didn't trust banks, and so he buried all of his money on the ground."
00:32:53,00:32:55,And then it all got eaten by worms.
00:32:55,00:32:57,Oh wow.
00:32:57,00:33:00,And he managed to kind of save about a third of it.
00:33:00,00:33:04,There was all in pieces and took it to the bank in a big bag of soil.
00:33:04,00:33:07,"And then said, ""Is there anything you can do with this?"""
00:33:07,00:33:10,And they managed to retrieve about a third of his money.
00:33:10,00:33:14,So the very thing that he didn't trust ended up saving some of his cash.
00:33:14,00:33:14,Oh wow.
00:33:14,00:33:16,And then he's convinced that the worms were working for the bank.
00:33:16,00:33:23,"I read ages ago that all astronauts, when they initially were going to the moon,"
00:33:23,00:33:29,"that they were all given half notes of $1 note in America, American money."
00:33:29,00:33:34,"They would get the half, and they would have to present it back to NASA when they arrived."
00:33:34,00:33:40,"And so they could put the two halves together, so that they could check whether or not aliens had cloned them and come back."
00:33:40,00:33:46,But the idea that the aliens would not have the technology to just keep hold of a half dollar bill.
00:33:46,00:33:52,"Well, we could clone a human, but that half dollar bill is no way of doing that."
00:33:52,00:33:53,"All right, let's wrap it up on that."
00:33:53,00:33:58,"All right, that's it. That's all of your facts."
00:33:58,00:33:59,Thank you so much for listening.
00:33:59,00:34:02,"If you want to get in contact with us about the things that we said,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,don't get in contact with the people who said them.
00:34:04,00:34:06,They're all on Twitter.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"You can reach them out there at Twitter handles, or you can track down the people"
00:34:09,00:34:10,who are in this room.
00:34:10,00:34:12,"We do have a list of their names, and we will make it public."
00:34:12,00:34:16,And we'll see you again next week with another episode.
00:34:16,00:34:17,Goodbye.
00:34:17,00:34:27,[APPLAUSE]
