00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
 (playing the piano)

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.400
 (playing the piano)

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.300
 (playing the piano)

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.440
 (cheering and applause)

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.700
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "Those Such Things As A Fish"

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.680
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.600
 from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Grennitch.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.800
 My name is Dan Triber.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.800
 I'm joined as ever by Annachosinski,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.400
 James Harkin and Andy Murray.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.600
 but this time with your favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 Okay.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.400
 I have a fact about the silver age of comics.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.600
 Who's that from?

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.400
 Hey, hello.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.000
 Should we do a Twitter fact while we're waiting

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 for the microphones to get over?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
 So this was sent in to us by John Winterholt.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 There is a chemical called our soul.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.800
 (laughter)

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 Nobody knows what it smells like yet.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 (laughter)

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 I tweeted him back to say, "Is that true?"

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 And he said, "Yeah, I study our soul for a living."

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 (laughter)

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
 Apparently true.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 He also told me that there's another one called ourspane,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400
 which is true as well.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.200
 And he said, interestingly, there's a mineral found

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.600
 near the town of Cummington, Massachusetts,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
 and that's been called "Coming Tonight."

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.600
 (laughter)

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 There's one called "Wellshite."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.800
 It was "Wellshite,"

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.200
 but it's named after a guy called somebody "Wellsh."

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.000
 Nobody "Wellsh" or something.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 It's "Wellsh."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 There's a molecule called, I think it's nitrogen triiodide.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000
 It's one of the most crazy molecules you can get.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 For a molecule, it's pretty crazy.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 But apparently it will blow up if a mosquito lands on it.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Really?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Yeah, it's the energy of a mosquito landing on it

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 will make it explode.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Is the mosquito alright?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
 It's just a molecule, isn't it? It's probably fine.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Yeah.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 Shall we go to the front?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 What's your name?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Charlie.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 What's your fact, Charlie?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 This is my major comics.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.400
 In the late 50s, last 60s, comics with gorillas on the front,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
 so consider to be more than comics without.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.400
 DC Comics, but gorillas on every single copy,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 even if there's no gorillas inside.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.400
 (laughter)

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400
 That's so good.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400
 Amazing.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 Pretty good.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 Wow.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.600
 (applause)

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600
 So Superman would just be tackling a gorilla on the front

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.400
 and then it had no relevance to the story.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.400
 A comic we've seen from Man and a gorilla would sign him a ticket or like a zoo ticket, I think.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.400
 Why would a gorilla be selling a zoo ticket?

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 (laughter)

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
 That's them colluding in their own imprisonment.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.400
 (laughter)

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 Do you know what gorillas favorite films are?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 No.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
 No.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.400
 This sounds like a stat of a joke.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 (laughter)

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.400
 Now, this was, I read this, this weekend,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.800
 in the Sunday Times somewhere, and it's by a musician who's really famous

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.800
 but I can't remember who it is 'cause I don't know anything about music.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.800
 But he hung out with people who've studied gorillas and they gave him a bunch of films

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800
 and they worked out which ones the gorillas asked with their hands to watch the most frequently.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.800
 And what do you reckon the gorillas favorite film is?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 Planet of the Apes.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800
 Very good.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800
 No.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800
 Planet of the Apes, yeah.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 Really.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.800
 And then the second favorite was a film about a Sasquatch, a Yessie.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800
 So obviously they feel very close to Yessies.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 Maybe they are genetically somehow related, I think, they think.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.800
 The first favorite was just done stand-up.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.800
 (laughter)

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.800
 They didn't subject them to that James.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800
 (laughter)

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
 The RSPCA we're getting for.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
 (laughter)

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800
 I watched the Mummy 3 on the weekend.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800
 That did too.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800
 There's a Mummy 3.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 There's a scene in it where there's just so much chaos going on.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800
 The terracotta warriors have become alive.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.800
 There's this old Chinese group of skeletons that have come back up.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 It's Jason and the Argonaut style.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.800
 And then suddenly these two giant Yetties come in.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 And the good guys go, oh, oh, Yetties.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 And the Yetties are like, we're good guys.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.800
 And they go, great.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 And then everyone just accepts it.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.800
 (laughter)

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.800
 It's just fine.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800
 We've got Yettie Allies now who are helping us.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800
 Do Yetties in the myths about Yetties?

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 Do they attack people?

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800
 Okay.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
 They can be kind as well.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.800
 There's a...

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.800
 (laughter)

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.800
 I regret asking my original question.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.800
 There's a lady in Bhutan who claims that she lived and had children with Yettie.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.800
 And the Yettie, they had about six children.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 And then she said that she was going back to society.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.800
 She wanted to bring the children with them.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800
 But the Yetties said that's not going to happen.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 So they went to Yettie Court and the Yettie won custody of the children.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.800
 And that's why she doesn't have them.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.800
 In Bhutan, this is a stretch of a link.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 But every government policy has to justify itself according to its world happiness index rating.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.800
 Doesn't it?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.800
 Doesn't that mean that we don't have gross national happiness?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 Yeah.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.800
 So every time you make a policy, you have to say how it's going to affect the gross national happiness.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 It's the only country where it's like made that and put that into policy.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.800
 I've been to Bhutan.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.800
 I've been to Bhutan.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 Yeah, I have been to Bhutan.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 I remember I went to the National Museum because I wanted to see the world's biggest book.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800
 They claim to have the world's biggest book.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 And it's a book about Bhutan.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.800
 How convenient.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.800
 And I was in the museum and there was that they had a rat problem.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800
 Someone had seen a rat.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 But because it was run by monks, because it's quite a, you know, a Buddhist country,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 they weren't allowed to hurt the rat in any way.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 So they weren't allowed to put poison down or they weren't allowed to put traps down or anything like that.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.800
 So all the monks were just chasing this rat.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 Wow.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 What's the name of the very famous gorilla who's in, we talked about it on the cocoa.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 Coco.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 Do you know what cocoa's favourite movie is?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.800
 I read this on the weekend, bizarrely.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.800
 Okay, so let's just say who cocoa is.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800
 Yes.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
 So cocoa is a gorilla who learns sign language, I think, right?

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.800
 Yeah.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.800
 And learn more words in sign language than anyone else.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.800
 300 people just pick me up about today.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.800
 Yeah.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.800
 And it's often held up as a fact that animals might be able to learn language.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.800
 Yeah.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.800
 So favourite movie, Pretty Woman.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 Really?

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800
 Oh, no.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800
 So aspirational.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 Yeah.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
 Well done, huh?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 By the way, Pretty Woman, the movie, they did a thing where they, the hotel that it was filmed in,

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.800
 now offers a Pretty Woman package so you can go.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
 Which is the worst message.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
 Oh.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.800
 I don't think they plot that footage properly.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800
 Who's it for?

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800
 It's for couples, yeah.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.800
 It's for couples.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.800
 Yeah.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.800
 Wow.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.800
 I've got a fact about movies.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.800
 This is a fact about the movie Leon.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800
 Who's fact is about Leon.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.800
 Who's fact is about the film Leon?

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.800
 Oh, so over there.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800
 Oh, hey, over there.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800
 If you put your hand up, Alex will come and find you.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 Cool.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.800
 In the meantime, I've got a fact that came from Twitter.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 And this is from someone called @riptor.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.800
 And the fact was that the 25th amendment allows vice presidents to take over as president

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800
 when the president incapacitated.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.800
 It's happened three times and each time the president was having a colonoscopy.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.800
 Those are the only three times presidents have been incapacitated.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.800
 Since the amendment has been shot and killed.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.800
 I keep going.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.800
 No, since the amendment was made.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.800
 There's a thing about colonoscopies that you can explode during a colonoscopy.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800
 Do you know that?

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800
 What?

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.800
 Yeah, because you have a lot of gas build up in your lower intestines.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.800
 And sometimes they'll use like a cotorizing heat thing.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.800
 If you've got a cot, they try and kind of burn it.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.800
 And so that heat and the gases can cause people to actually explode.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
 Right.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.800
 You would have thought, are they putting some kind of safeguards in place to stop this happening?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.800
 Or is it just, you know, 50/50, you'll either explode or...

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.800
 That's kind of like what happens to trees, right?

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.800
 When they get colonoscopies.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.800
 What do you mean?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.800
 Similar kind of, you know when trees are on fire, then sometimes it gets so hot

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.800
 and there's a build up of gas inside them and they explode.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.800
 There's really good videos of trees exploding.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.800
 Well, lightning hits a tree that can explode because all the water turns immediately to water vapor

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.800
 and lots of it is near at the middle side.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
 It just goes out.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.800
 It's cool.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.800
 Not for the tree. It's about for the tree.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.800
 But we have Leon fact, yeah.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800
 Okay.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
 So there's a scene in the movie, Leon.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.800
 Where there are loads of police cars parked outside a building.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.800
 And while they were filming that scene, a man who had just run a shop, ran onto the movie set,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.800
 thought it was the real police and handed himself in.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:33.800
 It's such amazing.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.800
 So, what's your name?

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.800
 Suzy.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.800
 Suzy. That's an amazing guy.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.800
 I mean, how long did they let the Gerard continue?

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.800
 They were method actors. They probably would have.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.800
 Take them to the station, then they would have got in trouble themselves.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.800
 Gary Oldman is going to be arresting you today. Very exciting.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.800
 Someone actually tweeted in.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.800
 This is from Twitter earlier that Gary Newman is actually three weeks younger than Gary Oldman.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.800
 Unfortunately.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:05.800
 Didn't think that thought about police.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:10.800
 In ancient Egypt, the head of the police was called the chief of the hitters.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.800
 That's why we've talked on the podcast about the world's oldest parking fine issued by traffic wardens.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.800
 Which was to be decapitated, I believe.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.800
 Oh, no, no.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.800
 It was to be impaled, wasn't it?

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.800
 Yeah. On a spike for crossing on the King's land.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.800
 That was when, yeah, the King owned all of the roads.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.800
 So I think it was quite hard to get around.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:41.800
 The first, the first ever British parking ticket that was given was accidentally given to a doctor who was making an emergency call to a house.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.800
 And so they had to override the parking ticket.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.800
 So the first parking ticket was a cock up and they had to undo it.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.800
 And I think the first American one was overwritten as well.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 The first American one was a guy who said I literally just went into the shop for five minutes and I've come back and my tickets here.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.800
 And he, you know, appealed and got it overwritten.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.800
 Has any parking ticket ever been successful?

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800
 No.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.800
 All the ones that I've ever got have been.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:09.800
 I've never told you about the guy in London in that I think it was the 60s or might be in early 70s who electrocuted his car.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:14.800
 So that when traffic wardens tried to put a ticket on them, they got electrocuted.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.800
 Wow.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.800
 He was in like the newspapers and stuff. He became really famous.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.800
 Yeah, when he was arrested, right?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.800
 Yeah, well, he was arrested, but they let him off in the end because he'd become such a kind of cause celebra.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.800
 Surely electrocuting a policeman is a bigger crime than parking on a double yellow line.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.800
 Sorry, like not electrocuted because the word electrocuting means killing by electricity.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.800
 He electrified them, let's say, with like a little bit of a shot.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.800
 They should have charged him.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.800
 Yes.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:51.800
 That's, he's like an angle grinder man in Kent.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:11:00.800
 He was that superhero. He called himself the real life superhero and he went around with his angle grinder removing clamps from a car that had been clamped.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.800
 No one knew who he was for a long time until he did an interview with a newspaper and people did.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
 Yeah.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800
 You know at the end of Iron Man when he says, "I'm Iron Man."

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.800
 It's like, "Whaah, was he like I'm Iron, Iron, Iron, Iron Man?"

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.800
 And they went, "Mmm, I mean he could pronounce it, so that helped."

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.800
 But I escaped that.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.800
 Okay, genuinely as well. Just ran with it and went, "I'm just going to mush it up so hard."

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.800
 I was like, "I'm a work ironman."

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.800
 And then, "Oh, shall we move on to another fact?"

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.800
 Yeah, yeah, let's move on to our next fact.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.800
 Okay, so this is about a ghost army in World War II.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.800
 Alright, so while we're waiting for the mics to get over, here's another Twitter one.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.800
 This is from Matthew Oglesby.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.800
 The new organist of Leeds Cathedral is David Pipe.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.800
 That's quite nice.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800
 There he is.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.800
 I'm a massive fan of nominative determinism.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.800
 Did you meet the guy who coined the term?

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800
 Yeah, we met him very many times.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.800
 Yeah, we met him very many times.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.800
 Yeah, nominative determinism.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800
 What was the...

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.800
 Remember you found the ultimate one, which was to do with...

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800
 Oh, Henry Head.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.800
 Yeah, that was it.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.800
 Yeah, so there was a neuroscientist called Henry Head.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.800
 And he discovered this thing called head zones.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.800
 You don't have one in your head, but you do have one in the head of your genitals if you're a man.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.800
 But he was the head of a journal called Brain.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:33.800
 And when he left this head of the journal Brain, he was taken over by a guy called Brain.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.800
 So head was the head of Brain until he wasn't the head of Brain anymore.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.800
 And he was taken over as the head of Brain by Brain, who became the head of Brain.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.800
 So good.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.800
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.800
 I mean, no one knew what was going on in that organisation.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800
 I saw one the other day, actually.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.800
 I tweeted about it.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.800
 Let me think.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.800
 It was a guy who'd written a book about swearing.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.800
 And he was called Sega Dam.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.800
 That's good.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.800
 That's good.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.800
 S-A-I, his first name, Sega Dam.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.800
 That's nice.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.800
 Someone sent me one on Twitter the other day, which was a herdler whose surname is Stumble over.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800
 Oh, he's so good.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.800
 I think he actually famously fell over a hurdle.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 It was a sheet.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800
 A sheet.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.800
 Yeah, potato potato.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.800
 I think, didn't she stumble over a hurdle in quite an important moment?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800
 Yeah, maybe really six, yeah.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800
 Yeah.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.800
 Okay, shall we go on to the facts?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.800
 Yes, so your name and your fact, please.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800
 All right.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.800
 I'm Nora.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:40.800
 So my fact was that there was a ghost army in the Second World War, where the Allies used rubber, inflatable tanks and recorded troop sounds to trick the German army into thinking the enemy was there.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.800
 But there's a ghost army.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.800
 They call it a mass army because they didn't actually exist.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:46.800
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800
 No, no, no, no.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800
 No, no, no.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800
 No, no.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800
 No, no, no.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800
 No, no.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.600
 It was, I think Churchill was at the head of the organization which was, you know, pioneering

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.040
 tank making and they were called something like land ships. It was called like the land

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.280
 ships organization or something like that in the First World War when they were developing

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.680
 them. And they just decided to call them tanks as a code word because they were going to send

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.680
 them into Russia disguised as water tanks. And first of all, they wanted to call them, they

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:37.520
 called them W's, they called them water compartments at first but because war obviously tended to abbreviate

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.360
 things. People kept mixing them up. People kept going and urinating on the military vehicles.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.640
 So they said we can't call them W's, but they called them tanks because they wanted the Russians

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.680
 to think they were tanks of water. But yeah, the Russians were on our side in the First World War.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.760
 I know, I said Russians and I hoped again, like down that no one came up with it.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:02.960
 You're just a little thing like website we were fighting. People made these mistakes all the time.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.880
 Okay, I think we're going to have to keep moving on because we're shot of time aren't we?

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:18.040
 Okay, who is Jennifer Matthews? Jennifer Matthews is over here. So, um, Parrotfish, where pajamas,

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:25.560
 protective pajamas at night time, and then they eat them in the morning. Wow, does anything

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:35.280
 special about that? No, that's it. We said interesting facts. No, that's amazing. So they

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.200
 agreed a mucous that has a hole in the front and the hole in the back so that water can flow through.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.600
 And the mucous is apparently meant to stop predators from spelling them. And it means that

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.000
 they're protected overnight while they sleep, but it's a vital source of protein so they eat

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.440
 it in the morning. Oh my god, no, it's amazing. Yeah. It's not the sexiest pajamas of the world,

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:08.880
 is it? When you say, I'm just going to go slip into something, I'll just get a little

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.520
 slip into something more you can see. How do you like your breakfast?

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:27.120
 And Parrotfish, they're the guys who they, um, they make sand as well, do they? Yeah, they poop

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:37.840
 islands. Yeah. Yeah. Bit by bit. Well, for an average Parrotfish, they poop 275 grams per day,

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:45.680
 but the biggest Parrotfish can make 90 kilograms. In 90 kilograms a day? I don't actually

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:51.440
 know of it today. It might be for you, but the biggest Parrotfish. That's quite a different,

00:16:51.440 --> 00:17:01.360
 when you go to your doctor, how much are you pooing? It's either twice a day or twice a year. How big an

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:08.240
 island have you produced? But yeah, that's the, it's this white kind of, white sand that they get

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.520
 in the Caribbean and stuff, don't they? Yeah, so they eat coral, and when they eat coral, they eat

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.840
 the tissue of the coral, and then they digest the calcium carbonate skeleton and poop the sand,

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.840
 and then the entire island in the Caribbean have been made up by the sand. Wow. So you could basically lie

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.720
 in a pile of sand. I do that anyway. How do you know so much about Parrotfish? I'm a marine

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:47.760
 biologist. Are you? You're going to walk whistle for that in the evening. Should we move on to

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:53.600
 that? Yeah, let's keep going. Okay. So this is about the new tallest building in London.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:59.360
 Who's that? Ah, I'm not. Any Twitter one? Actually, this is really similar to the thing we just had,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:06.080
 the fringe limb tree frog, fringe limb tree frog parents grow extra layers of skin to feed their tadpoles.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:13.040
 And this is, I like this so much because it's reminded me of my favourite fact at the moment,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:22.320
 which is that breast milk. Mother's breast milk is made from arses. When you have a baby and you

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.480
 start producing breast milk, it's got fat cells in it, and the fat cells that are taken literally from

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:34.160
 the mother's bottom first is where they go from. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of spiders who will

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.000
 eat their mother aren't there? There's at least a few of them. Really? So they'll give birth to the

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:50.160
 live spiders inside them and they'll eat their way out. Spiders. Okay, what's your name and what is

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:57.120
 your facts, please? So my name is Bapinda, and my fact is that the new tallest building in London

00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:04.080
 is going to be called undershaft. Amazing. It's really in the jersehs back. It's unbelievable.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:10.800
 Why is it so why is it being called that? I don't know. I just read it on the Guardian and laughed a lot.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:19.280
 That's literally the extent that I do my research. Actually, I was reading the other day. It's a

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.160
 building we've mentioned on the podcast before, but a building in London got voted the ugliest

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.520
 or the most horrible building around, and it's the walkie talkie, and it was cited for being so bad

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:36.880
 because it keeps blowing people over and melting cars is the angle of the building has this magnifying

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.120
 on it that it's just melting cars, and the wind that is trapping, it's literally blowing people

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.240
 onto the street, and people are furious. The architect who made it has designed another building in

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:53.600
 America, which also has melted cars, and he's not learning his mistakes. He actually puts that on his

00:19:53.600 --> 00:20:02.480
 CV now. You've got a car, you need melted. This can be designed a multi-billion dollar building for you.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:11.840
 Alex was actually just telling me earlier that the shard in London goes down as deeper than Nelson's

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:19.200
 column. I thought you were going to say it goes down deeper than it goes up. I thought he was going to

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.280
 say that, but I was quite disappointed. Something that does do that is the angel of and off. That goes

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.960
 really. It's pretty much exact. It goes down deeper than the shard. And the underside is devilshaped,

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:39.840
 isn't it? Yeah. That's tough. I'll wait, can I just say because I find this really interesting,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.160
 and I think I've never been allowed to say it on the podcast before, but we only recently discovered

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.480
 how tall Nelson's column was. So it's been up since Nelson, so 200 years, and they just measured it

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.280
 a couple of years ago, and they realised I think it's four metres higher than we thought, or it's

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.160
 maybe it's four feet. Isn't that weird? We've never measured Nelson's column. Yeah, that's pretty

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.520
 cool. You know, there are loads of Nelson's columns all over the place. I mean, not like millions.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.680
 There I think a good dozen of them all over the UK, and there's one in Norfolk, which is where he

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.640
 was from, I think, and it's just got an earn at the top of it, not Nelson. So there you go. But it

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.960
 isn't Nelson's column. Nelson used to, I don't know if we ever put, I tried to get this on the podcast,

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.800
 I don't know if it ever made on, but Nelson used to have a little hat for his eye. He just had a tiny

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:34.720
 hat for his eye, and no one talks about it, and they shut. Because he naturally tried to get that

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.560
 on every single week for a lot of time. Because it was like, you know, when you see American movies

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.400
 where they're like doing accounts, and they had that sort of tennis hat that had the green

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.640
 that you could see through, Nelson had that on his eye, this little green thing, so that he could,

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:50.400
 because his eye got too much sun, and he was like, I want to get less sun, so they created

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.680
 a little hat. I have a fact about Nelson. Okay, go on. Do you have it? It's from Brian. Brian,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:22:00.480
 by the way. You there? Hey, we'll go for a Twitter fact first. Okay, we'll go for a Twitter fact.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:08.400
 And so this was sent to me by someone called Tim Worth 89, and he said that in 1774, one newspaper

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:17.920
 estimated that out of the 872,564 married couples in England, only nine were entirely happy.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:28.320
 You could read that as a whole nine. He was totally happy. He sent me a clipping,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:34.800
 an image of the clipping as well. It's so good. They had a breakdown of the whole 872,000,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:44.400
 and it's like 1300. The wives had he loapt, 2300. The husband had run away. There's about 19,000

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:54.480
 that were in a state of open war. 16,000 had a lot of inward hatred about each other. Not

00:22:54.480 --> 00:23:00.320
 inward, if they're telling me into it. And 51 couples were living in a state of indifferent hate.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:11.200
 Indifferent hate. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense at all. What period was this? This was in 1774.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:21.200
 You know, between, it's for about 200 years, but between about 1675 and 1850, only about 370

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.680
 couples in England got divorced. And everyone needed an act of parliament?

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.600
 Exactly. How exciting is that? It's almost worth getting divorced. Every time you got divorced,

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.840
 they had to debate it in parliament. I think they look good together.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:44.080
 That was hardly a Hillary bed. Shall we move on to that?

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:53.120
 Yeah, sorry. In the Aberlton office in Nelson used to go for reports and stuff. And he had a small

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.800
 mahogany box to stand on, because firstly he was quite short. And secondly, the Aberl sat on a

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.000
 raised platform to make them higher than everybody that would come before them to speak,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.440
 so they maintained their authority. And yeah, he was the only person that ever had that concession.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.360
 Wow. And I got to stand on that box, but I had to take my boots off first.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:20.560
 Did he have to take his boots off first?

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.000
 No, because I was just saying that. That would have come from her authority.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.960
 Kind of negated the concession, wouldn't it really? Yeah, indeed.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.880
 Stand up, take your boots off, oh, same height.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.000
 I think Gillian Anderson used to have to do that in the ex files, Dana Scully.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.080
 She used to have to stand on a box when they were filming. She's quite a bit smaller than

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:42.480
 David Decoveny. And so for scenes where they were standing chatting, she would stand on a box.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.360
 And yeah, that happens a lot in movies, I think.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.640
 Oh, Charles and Lady Diana apparently did this as well.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.920
 I have a Twitter fact about Charles and Lady Diana actually, so when we lead into that,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.840
 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana, the TV cables put in place for the wedding were run by a

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.520
 ferret. And I googled it and it's true. What? Yeah. What do you mean?

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.360
 I don't mean he was physically with like a thing in the tank.

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.520
 All right, camera two, let's do this. Got a three, got a three.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:19.440
 It was, it was, they had to get cables, I guess, into a mate, I'm guessing Westminster Abbey.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.840
 They have to go into small little holes and this is you tie it to a ferret and they run through.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:29.120
 And they, yeah, I think British aerospace abused it for some kind of aeroplane.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.160
 Yeah, they have, I think for building aeroplanes, it was amazing.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.280
 That's what I thought, that's what I was going to say, but I thought it sounded so ridiculous.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.240
 Ferrets, build aeroplane. But I think they actually cancelled that eventually because they kept

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.880
 jumping through the wires. So I think they ended up being quite unreliable. I seem to remember.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.560
 Someone sent me a tweet at Bangai Shot you sent me a tweet. And it's almost the same as this.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.960
 It's like, there was a ferret called Misty who ran the cabling for the US Space Command,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.200
 for the Y2K Centre, and her fee was a strawberry pop tart.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.200
 Who negotiated that? That sounds like she actually asked for that.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.200
 Yeah, it reminds me this of, there's a bridge over the Niagara River near the Niagara Falls.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.720
 And the problem with bridges is, how do you get the first kind of thing over?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.320
 So once you've got a bit of a string over there, then you can pull something over,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.760
 and then you can pull something bigger over and bigger over, and then you eventually have a bridge.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.920
 But if it's a really big, good preface, you use a bird.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.520
 Well, it wasn't a bird, but it's close. Frisbee. Frisbee.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:37.040
 No, it was a kite, a kite. Oh, nice.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.040
 So they flew a kite up, and then it kind of went over, and then someone was on the other side,

00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.800
 and they could grab the kite, and then you had a string over, and then they could attach a

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.080
 bit of wire onto that, and pull it across, and then a bit of a bigger wire.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.840
 And then a tiny bit of wood, and then a little bit, a bigger bit of wood, and then eventually a bridge.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:57.520
 You can't get a Frisbee across Niagara Falls. I think.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.000
 This is true, so you know. How good are you at Frisbee?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.800
 You can get it across Niagara Falls. You can make it hover in the air while it deposits building materials.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:14.080
 It's incredible. You know, you guys know the aerobie super disk?

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.280
 Yeah. It's a great Frisbee, guys. It's the one that's completely hollow.

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.920
 It's plastic, and it's got a tough frame in the middle, so it keeps rigidity and stability.

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.920
 But it's rubber on the outside, so it doesn't hurt your hands.

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.920
 Anyway, this week's podcast is brought to you.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:36.480
 It's the bee's knees, and they can get you, they've thrown one across Niagara Falls.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.200
 When have you ever had a friend to throw a Frisbee stick?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.080
 It does take a while to play when I'm playing with the Frisbee super disk, because it goes so far.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.280
 Have you ever thought about getting a boomerang?

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:54.800
 Okay, let's move on with another fact.

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.160
 Who has a fact that's about penises and the London Underground?

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.280
 James, you're going to need to narrow it down a bit.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:09.520
 Hi, my name's Tom. So when the new headquarters of the London Underground Building was opened in 1929,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:15.600
 the statue of the front of a naked boy was so controversial, and there was such public outcry

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.520
 that the sculptor had to reduce the size of his penis by one and a half inches.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.080
 Wow, that we ask from what?

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.440
 12 is too much, 10 and a half will be fine.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:36.080
 So is it the shorter the penis, the lower the rating of the film?

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.000
 It was the film, it was the statue.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.160
 Yeah, I'm sorry, I was extrapolating, but if that made it less obscene in the statue,

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.960
 it becomes less obscene the smaller the penis.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.760
 Are you sensing an opening for some small and bowed people?

00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:05.360
 What was the, do you know any more about why they had a statue of a naked boy in the first place?

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:10.960
 Yeah, yeah, kind of, so it was by Jacob Epstein who is this avant-garde, quite brutalist sculptor,

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.120
 and it was one of his first major commissions.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:18.400
 He has this quite long history of creating sculptures like he has one on what's now

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.320
 his in Bobway House on the Strand, and that's also been massively defaced because it was just

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.080
 full of naked people and people didn't like that in Edwardian Britain.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.760
 But this one, it was kind of a compromise because there was public outcry and the head

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.240
 of the tube at the time offered his resignation to keep the statue, it was that big a deal,

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.480
 and they wanted to keep the head of the CEO of the London Underground, but as a compromise,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.080
 they said, "Okay, well just trim the penis a little bit."

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.480
 Does that happen to all ancient statues?

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:50.640
 Like, the David have a massive cock originally, and they thought it was more civilized,

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:54.720
 to have a small wedding day, but it was better to be small because if it was too big,

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.320
 you would lose heat and lose vigor.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:05.200
 But this website had a picture of what had been done to the statue,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.480
 and underneath it just said, "Yeah, this has actually happened,

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.600
 and you thought the cuts to the London Underground today were controversial."

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.120
 That's very good.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.120
 Hey, we should wrap up soon, so maybe let's just do a couple more.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.280
 Let's, why don't we do a Twitter one each, so we all like?

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.400
 I'll start with mine. This was sent in by Jonathan Warlow.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.280
 Claire Danes and all her movies were banned from the Philippines after she badmouthed it in an

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.160
 interview, so they just said, "No more Claire Danes movies."

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:38.240
 Yeah, I'm kind of using this as an excuse, though, to talk about the Philippines,

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:44.400
 because my dad's a hairdresser, and he also, he likes to sing Bee Gees Covers,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.240
 and he's got a really nice voice, and on the equivalent of Jonathan Ross there,

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.040
 they don't really have many people there to go on the show.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.000
 So he often got asked to go on and sing Bee Gees Covers on this equivalent of Jonathan Ross,

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.920
 called the Johnny Littins Show, and he was on it one day, and a Melder Marcos saw it,

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.960
 and she called him up, and well, like Centro Letter's saying,

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.920
 "I'd like to invite you to sing karaoke with me once a week."

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.560
 And you can't really say no to someone like a Melder Marcos, so he had to do it.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.520
 This is the fact that I learned of him through the back of doing that,

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.880
 is that she said to him one day when they were mid Bee Gees song, "Roger,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.680
 I get so tired about people talking about my having the largest shoe collection all the time."

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.160
 No one talks about the fact that I have the largest collection of spoons.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.320
 And she apparently likes to brag that she has the largest collection of silverware

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.400
 in the world, and no one talks about it, all the shoes.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.320
 Oh yeah, the fucking shoes. No one talks about the silverware.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.200
 So Anna, final fact?

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.120
 Yeah, so my favourite fact on Twitter actually was that this is from @gulbatasaurus,

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:52.640
 and it was that the Korean term for grinding in a club is boobie boobie.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:59.040
 Apparently, very like that. Andy, what do you got?

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.000
 I really like the fact, and this is exactly how it was worded

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:12.000
 as from Mina Kuzluka. Ottoman Emperor Abdul Havett made it illegal to use the words sibling,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.480
 star, bedbug, and nose. And then in brackets, he had a weird nose.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.600
 And James?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:31.840
 Okay, this fact came from IDKT, IDKT, and it is that in the olden days to send paper money

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.400
 through the post, people used to tear it in two pieces and post the halves separately.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.240
 I don't even know if it's true, but I just really liked the ingenious idea of doing that.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.880
 I'm trying to present a cellulite up 10 pound note of the musicians, and they didn't like it.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:53.840
 But there was a guy in China, he didn't trust banks, and so he buried all of his money on the ground.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:55.600
 And then it all got eaten by worms.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.680
 Oh wow.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.480
 And he managed to kind of save about a third of it.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.080
 There was all in pieces and took it to the bank in a big bag of soil.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:07.600
 And then said, "Is there anything you can do with this?"

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.320
 And they managed to retrieve about a third of his money.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.160
 So the very thing that he didn't trust ended up saving some of his cash.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:14.640
 Oh wow.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.640
 And then he's convinced that the worms were working for the bank.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:23.840
 I read ages ago that all astronauts, when they initially were going to the moon,

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:29.760
 that they were all given half notes of $1 note in America, American money.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.560
 They would get the half, and they would have to present it back to NASA when they arrived.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.400
 And so they could put the two halves together, so that they could check whether or not aliens had cloned them and come back.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:46.800
 But the idea that the aliens would not have the technology to just keep hold of a half dollar bill.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.160
 Well, we could clone a human, but that half dollar bill is no way of doing that.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.440
 All right, let's wrap it up on that.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:58.240
 All right, that's it. That's all of your facts.

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.680
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.720
 If you want to get in contact with us about the things that we said,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.960
 don't get in contact with the people who said them.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.400
 They're all on Twitter.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.680
 You can reach them out there at Twitter handles, or you can track down the people

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.400
 who are in this room.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.800
 We do have a list of their names, and we will make it public.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.240
 And we'll see you again next week with another episode.

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.040
 Goodbye.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:27.040
 [APPLAUSE]

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.620
 (upbeat music)
