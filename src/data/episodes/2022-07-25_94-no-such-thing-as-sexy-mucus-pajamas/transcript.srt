1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
 (playing the piano)

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:07,400
 (playing the piano)

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,300
 (playing the piano)

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,440
 (cheering and applause)

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,700
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "Those Such Things As A Fish"

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,680
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
 from the Up the Creek Comedy Club in Grennitch.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
 My name is Dan Triber.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 I'm joined as ever by Annachosinski,

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
 James Harkin and Andy Murray.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,600
 but this time with your favorite facts from the last seven days

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
 and in no particular order, here we go.

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 Okay.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
 I have a fact about the silver age of comics.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,600
 Who's that from?

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,400
 Hey, hello.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
 Should we do a Twitter fact while we're waiting

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
 for the microphones to get over?

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,000
 So this was sent in to us by John Winterholt.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,400
 There is a chemical called our soul.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,800
 (laughter)

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
 Nobody knows what it smells like yet.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
 (laughter)

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
 I tweeted him back to say, "Is that true?"

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,600
 And he said, "Yeah, I study our soul for a living."

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
 (laughter)

28
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,600
 Apparently true.

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,000
 He also told me that there's another one called ourspane,

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
 which is true as well.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,200
 And he said, interestingly, there's a mineral found

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
 near the town of Cummington, Massachusetts,

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
 and that's been called "Coming Tonight."

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,600
 (laughter)

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,000
 There's one called "Wellshite."

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
 It was "Wellshite,"

37
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,200
 but it's named after a guy called somebody "Wellsh."

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
 Nobody "Wellsh" or something.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 It's "Wellsh."

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,600
 There's a molecule called, I think it's nitrogen triiodide.

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
 It's one of the most crazy molecules you can get.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 For a molecule, it's pretty crazy.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But apparently it will blow up if a mosquito lands on it.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Really?

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Yeah, it's the energy of a mosquito landing on it

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 will make it explode.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Is the mosquito alright?

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 It's just a molecule, isn't it? It's probably fine.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Yeah.

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Shall we go to the front?

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 What's your name?

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Charlie.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 What's your fact, Charlie?

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 This is my major comics.

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,400
 In the late 50s, last 60s, comics with gorillas on the front,

56
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
 so consider to be more than comics without.

57
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 DC Comics, but gorillas on every single copy,

58
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
 even if there's no gorillas inside.

59
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
 (laughter)

60
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 That's so good.

61
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 Amazing.

62
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 Pretty good.

63
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
 Wow.

64
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,600
 (applause)

65
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
 So Superman would just be tackling a gorilla on the front

66
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
 and then it had no relevance to the story.

67
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,400
 A comic we've seen from Man and a gorilla would sign him a ticket or like a zoo ticket, I think.

68
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Why would a gorilla be selling a zoo ticket?

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 (laughter)

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
 That's them colluding in their own imprisonment.

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
 (laughter)

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
 Do you know what gorillas favorite films are?

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
 No.

74
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
 No.

75
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
 This sounds like a stat of a joke.

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
 (laughter)

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
 Now, this was, I read this, this weekend,

78
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,800
 in the Sunday Times somewhere, and it's by a musician who's really famous

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
 but I can't remember who it is 'cause I don't know anything about music.

80
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
 But he hung out with people who've studied gorillas and they gave him a bunch of films

81
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,800
 and they worked out which ones the gorillas asked with their hands to watch the most frequently.

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,800
 And what do you reckon the gorillas favorite film is?

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
 Planet of the Apes.

84
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,800
 Very good.

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
 No.

86
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 Planet of the Apes, yeah.

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,800
 Really.

88
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,800
 And then the second favorite was a film about a Sasquatch, a Yessie.

89
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
 So obviously they feel very close to Yessies.

90
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 Maybe they are genetically somehow related, I think, they think.

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 The first favorite was just done stand-up.

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
 (laughter)

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,800
 They didn't subject them to that James.

94
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
 (laughter)

95
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
 The RSPCA we're getting for.

96
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
 (laughter)

97
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,800
 I watched the Mummy 3 on the weekend.

98
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
 That did too.

99
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 There's a Mummy 3.

100
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
 There's a scene in it where there's just so much chaos going on.

101
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 The terracotta warriors have become alive.

102
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,800
 There's this old Chinese group of skeletons that have come back up.

103
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 It's Jason and the Argonaut style.

104
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
 And then suddenly these two giant Yetties come in.

105
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 And the good guys go, oh, oh, Yetties.

106
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 And the Yetties are like, we're good guys.

107
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
 And they go, great.

108
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
 And then everyone just accepts it.

109
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
 (laughter)

110
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
 It's just fine.

111
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,800
 We've got Yettie Allies now who are helping us.

112
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
 Do Yetties in the myths about Yetties?

113
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
 Do they attack people?

114
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,800
 Yeah, yeah.

115
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
 Okay.

116
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
 They can be kind as well.

117
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
 There's a...

118
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
 (laughter)

119
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,800
 I regret asking my original question.

120
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,800
 There's a lady in Bhutan who claims that she lived and had children with Yettie.

121
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 And the Yettie, they had about six children.

122
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,800
 And then she said that she was going back to society.

123
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
 She wanted to bring the children with them.

124
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
 But the Yetties said that's not going to happen.

125
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,800
 So they went to Yettie Court and the Yettie won custody of the children.

126
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
 And that's why she doesn't have them.

127
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,800
 In Bhutan, this is a stretch of a link.

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,800
 But every government policy has to justify itself according to its world happiness index rating.

129
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
 Doesn't it?

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
 Doesn't that mean that we don't have gross national happiness?

131
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
 Yeah.

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,800
 So every time you make a policy, you have to say how it's going to affect the gross national happiness.

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 It's the only country where it's like made that and put that into policy.

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
 I've been to Bhutan.

135
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
 I've been to Bhutan.

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 Yeah, I have been to Bhutan.

137
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,800
 I remember I went to the National Museum because I wanted to see the world's biggest book.

138
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
 They claim to have the world's biggest book.

139
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
 And it's a book about Bhutan.

140
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
 How convenient.

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,800
 And I was in the museum and there was that they had a rat problem.

142
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
 Someone had seen a rat.

143
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,800
 But because it was run by monks, because it's quite a, you know, a Buddhist country,

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
 they weren't allowed to hurt the rat in any way.

145
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,800
 So they weren't allowed to put poison down or they weren't allowed to put traps down or anything like that.

146
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,800
 So all the monks were just chasing this rat.

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
 Wow.

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,800
 What's the name of the very famous gorilla who's in, we talked about it on the cocoa.

149
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
 Coco.

150
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 Do you know what cocoa's favourite movie is?

151
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
 I read this on the weekend, bizarrely.

152
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
 Okay, so let's just say who cocoa is.

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
 Yes.

154
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
 So cocoa is a gorilla who learns sign language, I think, right?

155
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
 Yeah.

156
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
 And learn more words in sign language than anyone else.

157
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 300 people just pick me up about today.

158
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
 Yeah.

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,800
 And it's often held up as a fact that animals might be able to learn language.

160
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
 Yeah.

161
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
 So favourite movie, Pretty Woman.

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 Really?

163
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
 Oh, no.

164
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
 So aspirational.

165
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
 Yeah.

166
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
 Well done, huh?

167
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,800
 By the way, Pretty Woman, the movie, they did a thing where they, the hotel that it was filmed in,

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,800
 now offers a Pretty Woman package so you can go.

169
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,800
 Which is the worst message.

170
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
 Oh.

171
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
 I don't think they plot that footage properly.

172
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
 Who's it for?

173
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,800
 It's for couples, yeah.

174
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
 It's for couples.

175
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
 Yeah.

176
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
 Wow.

177
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 I've got a fact about movies.

178
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
 This is a fact about the movie Leon.

179
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
 Who's fact is about Leon.

180
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 Who's fact is about the film Leon?

181
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
 Oh, so over there.

182
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,800
 Oh, hey, over there.

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
 If you put your hand up, Alex will come and find you.

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
 Cool.

185
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,800
 In the meantime, I've got a fact that came from Twitter.

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
 And this is from someone called @riptor.

187
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,800
 And the fact was that the 25th amendment allows vice presidents to take over as president

188
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
 when the president incapacitated.

189
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,800
 It's happened three times and each time the president was having a colonoscopy.

190
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,800
 Those are the only three times presidents have been incapacitated.

191
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,800
 Since the amendment has been shot and killed.

192
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
 I keep going.

193
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 No, since the amendment was made.

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
 There's a thing about colonoscopies that you can explode during a colonoscopy.

195
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
 Do you know that?

196
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
 What?

197
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,800
 Yeah, because you have a lot of gas build up in your lower intestines.

198
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,800
 And sometimes they'll use like a cotorizing heat thing.

199
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
 If you've got a cot, they try and kind of burn it.

200
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,800
 And so that heat and the gases can cause people to actually explode.

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
 Right.

202
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
 You would have thought, are they putting some kind of safeguards in place to stop this happening?

203
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
 Or is it just, you know, 50/50, you'll either explode or...

204
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
 That's kind of like what happens to trees, right?

205
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
 When they get colonoscopies.

206
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
 What do you mean?

207
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,800
 Similar kind of, you know when trees are on fire, then sometimes it gets so hot

208
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,800
 and there's a build up of gas inside them and they explode.

209
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
 There's really good videos of trees exploding.

210
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,800
 Well, lightning hits a tree that can explode because all the water turns immediately to water vapor

211
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
 and lots of it is near at the middle side.

212
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
 It just goes out.

213
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
 It's cool.

214
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
 Not for the tree. It's about for the tree.

215
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 But we have Leon fact, yeah.

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 Okay.

217
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
 So there's a scene in the movie, Leon.

218
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,800
 Where there are loads of police cars parked outside a building.

219
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,800
 And while they were filming that scene, a man who had just run a shop, ran onto the movie set,

220
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
 thought it was the real police and handed himself in.

221
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,800
 It's such amazing.

222
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,800
 So, what's your name?

223
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
 Suzy.

224
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
 Suzy. That's an amazing guy.

225
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
 I mean, how long did they let the Gerard continue?

226
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,800
 They were method actors. They probably would have.

227
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,800
 Take them to the station, then they would have got in trouble themselves.

228
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 Gary Oldman is going to be arresting you today. Very exciting.

229
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
 Someone actually tweeted in.

230
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,800
 This is from Twitter earlier that Gary Newman is actually three weeks younger than Gary Oldman.

231
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 Unfortunately.

232
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,800
 Didn't think that thought about police.

233
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,800
 In ancient Egypt, the head of the police was called the chief of the hitters.

234
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,800
 That's why we've talked on the podcast about the world's oldest parking fine issued by traffic wardens.

235
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,800
 Which was to be decapitated, I believe.

236
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
 Oh, no, no.

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
 It was to be impaled, wasn't it?

238
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,800
 Yeah. On a spike for crossing on the King's land.

239
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
 That was when, yeah, the King owned all of the roads.

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
 So I think it was quite hard to get around.

241
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:41,800
 The first, the first ever British parking ticket that was given was accidentally given to a doctor who was making an emergency call to a house.

242
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,800
 And so they had to override the parking ticket.

243
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
 So the first parking ticket was a cock up and they had to undo it.

244
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
 And I think the first American one was overwritten as well.

245
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
 The first American one was a guy who said I literally just went into the shop for five minutes and I've come back and my tickets here.

246
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,800
 And he, you know, appealed and got it overwritten.

247
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
 Has any parking ticket ever been successful?

248
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
 No.

249
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
 All the ones that I've ever got have been.

250
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,800
 I've never told you about the guy in London in that I think it was the 60s or might be in early 70s who electrocuted his car.

251
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 So that when traffic wardens tried to put a ticket on them, they got electrocuted.

252
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
 Wow.

253
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
 He was in like the newspapers and stuff. He became really famous.

254
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
 Yeah, when he was arrested, right?

255
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,800
 Yeah, well, he was arrested, but they let him off in the end because he'd become such a kind of cause celebra.

256
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,800
 Surely electrocuting a policeman is a bigger crime than parking on a double yellow line.

257
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,800
 Sorry, like not electrocuted because the word electrocuting means killing by electricity.

258
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,800
 He electrified them, let's say, with like a little bit of a shot.

259
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
 They should have charged him.

260
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
 Yes.

261
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:51,800
 That's, he's like an angle grinder man in Kent.

262
00:10:51,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 He was that superhero. He called himself the real life superhero and he went around with his angle grinder removing clamps from a car that had been clamped.

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,800
 No one knew who he was for a long time until he did an interview with a newspaper and people did.

264
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
 Yeah.

265
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
 You know at the end of Iron Man when he says, "I'm Iron Man."

266
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,800
 It's like, "Whaah, was he like I'm Iron, Iron, Iron, Iron Man?"

267
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
 And they went, "Mmm, I mean he could pronounce it, so that helped."

268
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 But I escaped that.

269
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,800
 Okay, genuinely as well. Just ran with it and went, "I'm just going to mush it up so hard."

270
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
 I was like, "I'm a work ironman."

271
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
 And then, "Oh, shall we move on to another fact?"

272
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
 Yeah, yeah, let's move on to our next fact.

273
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,800
 Okay, so this is about a ghost army in World War II.

274
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
 Alright, so while we're waiting for the mics to get over, here's another Twitter one.

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,800
 This is from Matthew Oglesby.

276
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,800
 The new organist of Leeds Cathedral is David Pipe.

277
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
 That's quite nice.

278
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,800
 There he is.

279
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
 I'm a massive fan of nominative determinism.

280
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,800
 Did you meet the guy who coined the term?

281
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
 Yeah, we met him very many times.

282
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,800
 Yeah, we met him very many times.

283
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
 Yeah, nominative determinism.

284
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
 What was the...

285
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,800
 Remember you found the ultimate one, which was to do with...

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,800
 Oh, Henry Head.

287
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
 Yeah, that was it.

288
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
 Yeah, so there was a neuroscientist called Henry Head.

289
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
 And he discovered this thing called head zones.

290
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,800
 You don't have one in your head, but you do have one in the head of your genitals if you're a man.

291
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,800
 But he was the head of a journal called Brain.

292
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,800
 And when he left this head of the journal Brain, he was taken over by a guy called Brain.

293
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
 So head was the head of Brain until he wasn't the head of Brain anymore.

294
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,800
 And he was taken over as the head of Brain by Brain, who became the head of Brain.

295
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
 So good.

296
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
 Yeah, absolutely.

297
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
 I mean, no one knew what was going on in that organisation.

298
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
 I saw one the other day, actually.

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
 I tweeted about it.

300
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
 Let me think.

301
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,800
 It was a guy who'd written a book about swearing.

302
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,800
 And he was called Sega Dam.

303
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
 That's good.

304
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
 That's good.

305
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 S-A-I, his first name, Sega Dam.

306
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
 That's nice.

307
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,800
 Someone sent me one on Twitter the other day, which was a herdler whose surname is Stumble over.

308
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
 Oh, he's so good.

309
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
 I think he actually famously fell over a hurdle.

310
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
 It was a sheet.

311
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
 A sheet.

312
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
 Yeah, potato potato.

313
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
 I think, didn't she stumble over a hurdle in quite an important moment?

314
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
 Yeah, maybe really six, yeah.

315
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
 Yeah.

316
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,800
 Okay, shall we go on to the facts?

317
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
 Yes, so your name and your fact, please.

318
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,800
 All right.

319
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
 I'm Nora.

320
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:40,800
 So my fact was that there was a ghost army in the Second World War, where the Allies used rubber, inflatable tanks and recorded troop sounds to trick the German army into thinking the enemy was there.

321
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
 But there's a ghost army.

322
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,800
 They call it a mass army because they didn't actually exist.

323
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
 No, no, no, no, no.

324
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
 No, no, no, no.

325
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
 No, no, no.

326
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,800
 No, no, no.

327
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
 No, no, no.

328
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,800
 No, no, no.

329
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
 No, no, no.

330
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
 No, no, no.

331
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 No, no, no.

332
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,800
 No, no, no.

333
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 No, no, no.

334
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,800
 No, no, no.

335
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
 No, no, no.

336
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,800
 No, no, no.

337
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,800
 No, no, no.

338
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
 No, no, no.

339
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
 No, no, no.

340
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,800
 No, no, no.

341
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
 No, no, no.

342
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
 No, no, no.

343
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
 No, no, no.

344
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
 No, no, no.

345
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 No, no, no.

346
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
 No, no, no.

347
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
 No, no.

348
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
 No, no, no.

349
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
 No, no.

350
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,600
 It was, I think Churchill was at the head of the organization which was, you know, pioneering

351
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,040
 tank making and they were called something like land ships. It was called like the land

352
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,280
 ships organization or something like that in the First World War when they were developing

353
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,680
 them. And they just decided to call them tanks as a code word because they were going to send

354
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,680
 them into Russia disguised as water tanks. And first of all, they wanted to call them, they

355
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,520
 called them W's, they called them water compartments at first but because war obviously tended to abbreviate

356
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,360
 things. People kept mixing them up. People kept going and urinating on the military vehicles.

357
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,640
 So they said we can't call them W's, but they called them tanks because they wanted the Russians

358
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,680
 to think they were tanks of water. But yeah, the Russians were on our side in the First World War.

359
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,760
 I know, I said Russians and I hoped again, like down that no one came up with it.

360
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:02,960
 You're just a little thing like website we were fighting. People made these mistakes all the time.

361
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,880
 Okay, I think we're going to have to keep moving on because we're shot of time aren't we?

362
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:18,040
 Okay, who is Jennifer Matthews? Jennifer Matthews is over here. So, um, Parrotfish, where pajamas,

363
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,560
 protective pajamas at night time, and then they eat them in the morning. Wow, does anything

364
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:35,280
 special about that? No, that's it. We said interesting facts. No, that's amazing. So they

365
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,200
 agreed a mucous that has a hole in the front and the hole in the back so that water can flow through.

366
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,600
 And the mucous is apparently meant to stop predators from spelling them. And it means that

367
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,000
 they're protected overnight while they sleep, but it's a vital source of protein so they eat

368
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:03,440
 it in the morning. Oh my god, no, it's amazing. Yeah. It's not the sexiest pajamas of the world,

369
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,880
 is it? When you say, I'm just going to go slip into something, I'll just get a little

370
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,520
 slip into something more you can see. How do you like your breakfast?

371
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:27,120
 And Parrotfish, they're the guys who they, um, they make sand as well, do they? Yeah, they poop

372
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:37,840
 islands. Yeah. Yeah. Bit by bit. Well, for an average Parrotfish, they poop 275 grams per day,

373
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:45,680
 but the biggest Parrotfish can make 90 kilograms. In 90 kilograms a day? I don't actually

374
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,440
 know of it today. It might be for you, but the biggest Parrotfish. That's quite a different,

375
00:16:51,440 --> 00:17:01,360
 when you go to your doctor, how much are you pooing? It's either twice a day or twice a year. How big an

376
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,240
 island have you produced? But yeah, that's the, it's this white kind of, white sand that they get

377
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,520
 in the Caribbean and stuff, don't they? Yeah, so they eat coral, and when they eat coral, they eat

378
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,840
 the tissue of the coral, and then they digest the calcium carbonate skeleton and poop the sand,

379
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,840
 and then the entire island in the Caribbean have been made up by the sand. Wow. So you could basically lie

380
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:32,720
 in a pile of sand. I do that anyway. How do you know so much about Parrotfish? I'm a marine

381
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:47,760
 biologist. Are you? You're going to walk whistle for that in the evening. Should we move on to

382
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,600
 that? Yeah, let's keep going. Okay. So this is about the new tallest building in London.

383
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,360
 Who's that? Ah, I'm not. Any Twitter one? Actually, this is really similar to the thing we just had,

384
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,080
 the fringe limb tree frog, fringe limb tree frog parents grow extra layers of skin to feed their tadpoles.

385
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:13,040
 And this is, I like this so much because it's reminded me of my favourite fact at the moment,

386
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:22,320
 which is that breast milk. Mother's breast milk is made from arses. When you have a baby and you

387
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,480
 start producing breast milk, it's got fat cells in it, and the fat cells that are taken literally from

388
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,160
 the mother's bottom first is where they go from. Wow. Yeah. There's a lot of spiders who will

389
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:40,000
 eat their mother aren't there? There's at least a few of them. Really? So they'll give birth to the

390
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,160
 live spiders inside them and they'll eat their way out. Spiders. Okay, what's your name and what is

391
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,120
 your facts, please? So my name is Bapinda, and my fact is that the new tallest building in London

392
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:04,080
 is going to be called undershaft. Amazing. It's really in the jersehs back. It's unbelievable.

393
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,800
 Why is it so why is it being called that? I don't know. I just read it on the Guardian and laughed a lot.

394
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:19,280
 That's literally the extent that I do my research. Actually, I was reading the other day. It's a

395
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,160
 building we've mentioned on the podcast before, but a building in London got voted the ugliest

396
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,520
 or the most horrible building around, and it's the walkie talkie, and it was cited for being so bad

397
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,880
 because it keeps blowing people over and melting cars is the angle of the building has this magnifying

398
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
 on it that it's just melting cars, and the wind that is trapping, it's literally blowing people

399
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,240
 onto the street, and people are furious. The architect who made it has designed another building in

400
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,600
 America, which also has melted cars, and he's not learning his mistakes. He actually puts that on his

401
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:02,480
 CV now. You've got a car, you need melted. This can be designed a multi-billion dollar building for you.

402
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:11,840
 Alex was actually just telling me earlier that the shard in London goes down as deeper than Nelson's

403
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,200
 column. I thought you were going to say it goes down deeper than it goes up. I thought he was going to

404
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
 say that, but I was quite disappointed. Something that does do that is the angel of and off. That goes

405
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,960
 really. It's pretty much exact. It goes down deeper than the shard. And the underside is devilshaped,

406
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:39,840
 isn't it? Yeah. That's tough. I'll wait, can I just say because I find this really interesting,

407
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,160
 and I think I've never been allowed to say it on the podcast before, but we only recently discovered

408
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:50,480
 how tall Nelson's column was. So it's been up since Nelson, so 200 years, and they just measured it

409
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,280
 a couple of years ago, and they realised I think it's four metres higher than we thought, or it's

410
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,160
 maybe it's four feet. Isn't that weird? We've never measured Nelson's column. Yeah, that's pretty

411
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:05,520
 cool. You know, there are loads of Nelson's columns all over the place. I mean, not like millions.

412
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,680
 There I think a good dozen of them all over the UK, and there's one in Norfolk, which is where he

413
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,640
 was from, I think, and it's just got an earn at the top of it, not Nelson. So there you go. But it

414
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
 isn't Nelson's column. Nelson used to, I don't know if we ever put, I tried to get this on the podcast,

415
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,800
 I don't know if it ever made on, but Nelson used to have a little hat for his eye. He just had a tiny

416
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,720
 hat for his eye, and no one talks about it, and they shut. Because he naturally tried to get that

417
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,560
 on every single week for a lot of time. Because it was like, you know, when you see American movies

418
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,400
 where they're like doing accounts, and they had that sort of tennis hat that had the green

419
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,640
 that you could see through, Nelson had that on his eye, this little green thing, so that he could,

420
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,400
 because his eye got too much sun, and he was like, I want to get less sun, so they created

421
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,680
 a little hat. I have a fact about Nelson. Okay, go on. Do you have it? It's from Brian. Brian,

422
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,480
 by the way. You there? Hey, we'll go for a Twitter fact first. Okay, we'll go for a Twitter fact.

423
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:08,400
 And so this was sent to me by someone called Tim Worth 89, and he said that in 1774, one newspaper

424
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:17,920
 estimated that out of the 872,564 married couples in England, only nine were entirely happy.

425
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:28,320
 You could read that as a whole nine. He was totally happy. He sent me a clipping,

426
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,800
 an image of the clipping as well. It's so good. They had a breakdown of the whole 872,000,

427
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:44,400
 and it's like 1300. The wives had he loapt, 2300. The husband had run away. There's about 19,000

428
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:54,480
 that were in a state of open war. 16,000 had a lot of inward hatred about each other. Not

429
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,320
 inward, if they're telling me into it. And 51 couples were living in a state of indifferent hate.

430
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:11,200
 Indifferent hate. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense at all. What period was this? This was in 1774.

431
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:21,200
 You know, between, it's for about 200 years, but between about 1675 and 1850, only about 370

432
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,680
 couples in England got divorced. And everyone needed an act of parliament?

433
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,600
 Exactly. How exciting is that? It's almost worth getting divorced. Every time you got divorced,

434
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,840
 they had to debate it in parliament. I think they look good together.

435
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:44,080
 That was hardly a Hillary bed. Shall we move on to that?

436
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:53,120
 Yeah, sorry. In the Aberlton office in Nelson used to go for reports and stuff. And he had a small

437
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,800
 mahogany box to stand on, because firstly he was quite short. And secondly, the Aberl sat on a

438
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:04,000
 raised platform to make them higher than everybody that would come before them to speak,

439
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,440
 so they maintained their authority. And yeah, he was the only person that ever had that concession.

440
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
 Wow. And I got to stand on that box, but I had to take my boots off first.

441
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,560
 Did he have to take his boots off first?

442
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,000
 No, because I was just saying that. That would have come from her authority.

443
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,960
 Kind of negated the concession, wouldn't it really? Yeah, indeed.

444
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
 Stand up, take your boots off, oh, same height.

445
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,000
 I think Gillian Anderson used to have to do that in the ex files, Dana Scully.

446
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,080
 She used to have to stand on a box when they were filming. She's quite a bit smaller than

447
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,480
 David Decoveny. And so for scenes where they were standing chatting, she would stand on a box.

448
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,360
 And yeah, that happens a lot in movies, I think.

449
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,640
 Oh, Charles and Lady Diana apparently did this as well.

450
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,920
 I have a Twitter fact about Charles and Lady Diana actually, so when we lead into that,

451
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,840
 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana, the TV cables put in place for the wedding were run by a

452
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,520
 ferret. And I googled it and it's true. What? Yeah. What do you mean?

453
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,360
 I don't mean he was physically with like a thing in the tank.

454
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,520
 All right, camera two, let's do this. Got a three, got a three.

455
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,440
 It was, it was, they had to get cables, I guess, into a mate, I'm guessing Westminster Abbey.

456
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,840
 They have to go into small little holes and this is you tie it to a ferret and they run through.

457
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,120
 And they, yeah, I think British aerospace abused it for some kind of aeroplane.

458
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,160
 Yeah, they have, I think for building aeroplanes, it was amazing.

459
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,280
 That's what I thought, that's what I was going to say, but I thought it sounded so ridiculous.

460
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,240
 Ferrets, build aeroplane. But I think they actually cancelled that eventually because they kept

461
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,880
 jumping through the wires. So I think they ended up being quite unreliable. I seem to remember.

462
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,560
 Someone sent me a tweet at Bangai Shot you sent me a tweet. And it's almost the same as this.

463
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,960
 It's like, there was a ferret called Misty who ran the cabling for the US Space Command,

464
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,200
 for the Y2K Centre, and her fee was a strawberry pop tart.

465
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,200
 Who negotiated that? That sounds like she actually asked for that.

466
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,200
 Yeah, it reminds me this of, there's a bridge over the Niagara River near the Niagara Falls.

467
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,720
 And the problem with bridges is, how do you get the first kind of thing over?

468
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
 So once you've got a bit of a string over there, then you can pull something over,

469
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,760
 and then you can pull something bigger over and bigger over, and then you eventually have a bridge.

470
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,920
 But if it's a really big, good preface, you use a bird.

471
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,520
 Well, it wasn't a bird, but it's close. Frisbee. Frisbee.

472
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,040
 No, it was a kite, a kite. Oh, nice.

473
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,040
 So they flew a kite up, and then it kind of went over, and then someone was on the other side,

474
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,800
 and they could grab the kite, and then you had a string over, and then they could attach a

475
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,080
 bit of wire onto that, and pull it across, and then a bit of a bigger wire.

476
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,840
 And then a tiny bit of wood, and then a little bit, a bigger bit of wood, and then eventually a bridge.

477
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,520
 You can't get a Frisbee across Niagara Falls. I think.

478
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,000
 This is true, so you know. How good are you at Frisbee?

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,800
 You can get it across Niagara Falls. You can make it hover in the air while it deposits building materials.

480
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:14,080
 It's incredible. You know, you guys know the aerobie super disk?

481
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,280
 Yeah. It's a great Frisbee, guys. It's the one that's completely hollow.

482
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,920
 It's plastic, and it's got a tough frame in the middle, so it keeps rigidity and stability.

483
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,920
 But it's rubber on the outside, so it doesn't hurt your hands.

484
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,920
 Anyway, this week's podcast is brought to you.

485
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:36,480
 It's the bee's knees, and they can get you, they've thrown one across Niagara Falls.

486
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,200
 When have you ever had a friend to throw a Frisbee stick?

487
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,080
 It does take a while to play when I'm playing with the Frisbee super disk, because it goes so far.

488
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,280
 Have you ever thought about getting a boomerang?

489
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:54,800
 Okay, let's move on with another fact.

490
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,160
 Who has a fact that's about penises and the London Underground?

491
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,280
 James, you're going to need to narrow it down a bit.

492
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:09,520
 Hi, my name's Tom. So when the new headquarters of the London Underground Building was opened in 1929,

493
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:15,600
 the statue of the front of a naked boy was so controversial, and there was such public outcry

494
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,520
 that the sculptor had to reduce the size of his penis by one and a half inches.

495
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,080
 Wow, that we ask from what?

496
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,440
 12 is too much, 10 and a half will be fine.

497
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,080
 So is it the shorter the penis, the lower the rating of the film?

498
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,000
 It was the film, it was the statue.

499
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,160
 Yeah, I'm sorry, I was extrapolating, but if that made it less obscene in the statue,

500
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,960
 it becomes less obscene the smaller the penis.

501
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,760
 Are you sensing an opening for some small and bowed people?

502
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:05,360
 What was the, do you know any more about why they had a statue of a naked boy in the first place?

503
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,960
 Yeah, yeah, kind of, so it was by Jacob Epstein who is this avant-garde, quite brutalist sculptor,

504
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
 and it was one of his first major commissions.

505
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,400
 He has this quite long history of creating sculptures like he has one on what's now

506
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,320
 his in Bobway House on the Strand, and that's also been massively defaced because it was just

507
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,080
 full of naked people and people didn't like that in Edwardian Britain.

508
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,760
 But this one, it was kind of a compromise because there was public outcry and the head

509
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,240
 of the tube at the time offered his resignation to keep the statue, it was that big a deal,

510
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,480
 and they wanted to keep the head of the CEO of the London Underground, but as a compromise,

511
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,080
 they said, "Okay, well just trim the penis a little bit."

512
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,480
 Does that happen to all ancient statues?

513
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,640
 Like, the David have a massive cock originally, and they thought it was more civilized,

514
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,720
 to have a small wedding day, but it was better to be small because if it was too big,

515
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
 you would lose heat and lose vigor.

516
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:05,200
 But this website had a picture of what had been done to the statue,

517
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,480
 and underneath it just said, "Yeah, this has actually happened,

518
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
 and you thought the cuts to the London Underground today were controversial."

519
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,120
 That's very good.

520
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
 Hey, we should wrap up soon, so maybe let's just do a couple more.

521
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,280
 Let's, why don't we do a Twitter one each, so we all like?

522
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:26,400
 I'll start with mine. This was sent in by Jonathan Warlow.

523
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,280
 Claire Danes and all her movies were banned from the Philippines after she badmouthed it in an

524
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,160
 interview, so they just said, "No more Claire Danes movies."

525
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,240
 Yeah, I'm kind of using this as an excuse, though, to talk about the Philippines,

526
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:44,400
 because my dad's a hairdresser, and he also, he likes to sing Bee Gees Covers,

527
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,240
 and he's got a really nice voice, and on the equivalent of Jonathan Ross there,

528
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,040
 they don't really have many people there to go on the show.

529
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:56,000
 So he often got asked to go on and sing Bee Gees Covers on this equivalent of Jonathan Ross,

530
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,920
 called the Johnny Littins Show, and he was on it one day, and a Melder Marcos saw it,

531
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,960
 and she called him up, and well, like Centro Letter's saying,

532
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:07,920
 "I'd like to invite you to sing karaoke with me once a week."

533
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,560
 And you can't really say no to someone like a Melder Marcos, so he had to do it.

534
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,520
 This is the fact that I learned of him through the back of doing that,

535
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,880
 is that she said to him one day when they were mid Bee Gees song, "Roger,

536
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,680
 I get so tired about people talking about my having the largest shoe collection all the time."

537
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,160
 No one talks about the fact that I have the largest collection of spoons.

538
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:32,320
 And she apparently likes to brag that she has the largest collection of silverware

539
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,400
 in the world, and no one talks about it, all the shoes.

540
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,320
 Oh yeah, the fucking shoes. No one talks about the silverware.

541
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,200
 So Anna, final fact?

542
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,120
 Yeah, so my favourite fact on Twitter actually was that this is from @gulbatasaurus,

543
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,640
 and it was that the Korean term for grinding in a club is boobie boobie.

544
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,040
 Apparently, very like that. Andy, what do you got?

545
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,000
 I really like the fact, and this is exactly how it was worded

546
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 as from Mina Kuzluka. Ottoman Emperor Abdul Havett made it illegal to use the words sibling,

547
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
 star, bedbug, and nose. And then in brackets, he had a weird nose.

548
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,600
 And James?

549
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:31,840
 Okay, this fact came from IDKT, IDKT, and it is that in the olden days to send paper money

550
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,400
 through the post, people used to tear it in two pieces and post the halves separately.

551
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,240
 I don't even know if it's true, but I just really liked the ingenious idea of doing that.

552
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,880
 I'm trying to present a cellulite up 10 pound note of the musicians, and they didn't like it.

553
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,840
 But there was a guy in China, he didn't trust banks, and so he buried all of his money on the ground.

554
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,600
 And then it all got eaten by worms.

555
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
 Oh wow.

556
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,480
 And he managed to kind of save about a third of it.

557
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,080
 There was all in pieces and took it to the bank in a big bag of soil.

558
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,600
 And then said, "Is there anything you can do with this?"

559
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
 And they managed to retrieve about a third of his money.

560
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,160
 So the very thing that he didn't trust ended up saving some of his cash.

561
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:14,640
 Oh wow.

562
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,640
 And then he's convinced that the worms were working for the bank.

563
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,840
 I read ages ago that all astronauts, when they initially were going to the moon,

564
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,760
 that they were all given half notes of $1 note in America, American money.

565
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,560
 They would get the half, and they would have to present it back to NASA when they arrived.

566
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:40,400
 And so they could put the two halves together, so that they could check whether or not aliens had cloned them and come back.

567
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,800
 But the idea that the aliens would not have the technology to just keep hold of a half dollar bill.

568
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,160
 Well, we could clone a human, but that half dollar bill is no way of doing that.

569
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,440
 All right, let's wrap it up on that.

570
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,240
 All right, that's it. That's all of your facts.

571
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
 Thank you so much for listening.

572
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,720
 If you want to get in contact with us about the things that we said,

573
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,960
 don't get in contact with the people who said them.

574
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,400
 They're all on Twitter.

575
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,680
 You can reach them out there at Twitter handles, or you can track down the people

576
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,400
 who are in this room.

577
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,800
 We do have a list of their names, and we will make it public.

578
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
 And we'll see you again next week with another episode.

579
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,040
 Goodbye.

580
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:27,040
 [APPLAUSE]

581
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,620
 (upbeat music)
