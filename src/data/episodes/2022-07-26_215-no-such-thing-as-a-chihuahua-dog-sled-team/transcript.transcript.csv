00:00:00,00:00:03,"Hey guys, just before we begin this week's show, we have a little announcement to make,"
00:00:03,00:00:07,which is that we have something for you to look at.
00:00:07,00:00:09,"That's a bit disgusting, aren't we?"
00:00:09,00:00:11,"Well, I wouldn't say so, don't you?"
00:00:11,00:00:12,It's a bit inappropriate.
00:00:12,00:00:17,"No, it's a wonderful kind of behind-the-scenes video of tall life on a tall."
00:00:17,00:00:18,A documentary behind the girls.
00:00:18,00:00:20,"Behind the girls, exactly."
00:00:20,00:00:21,"No, why aren't you wearing any trousers?"
00:00:21,00:00:25,"We don't have time to get into that now, and at the point is, we've released this thing."
00:00:27,00:00:31,"And it's our tour, isn't it? We filmed loads of stuff for it, loads of behind-the-scenes"
00:00:31,00:00:34,interviews and videos of us backstage getting ready.
00:00:34,00:00:39,"Yeah, it was super fun. We had a great time on tour, and we just filmed some of the chats we had,"
00:00:39,00:00:43,some interviews where you can learn some deep dark secrets from our pasts.
00:00:43,00:00:45,"Childhood photos, that kind of thing."
00:00:45,00:00:48,"Yeah, so it's been available in the UK for a little while."
00:00:48,00:00:52,"So hopefully all you guys have got it, but if you haven't then get it now, but the big news is,"
00:00:52,00:00:58,"it's now available in America, so if you go to Amazon, if you go to Google Play,"
00:00:58,00:01:01,"if you go to iTunes, you'll be able to get hold of it now."
00:01:01,00:01:05,"That's true, or you can just go to qi.com/gills where you'll find all the links."
00:01:05,00:01:07,"Okay, where are my trousers?"
00:01:07,00:01:10,"Oh, no, they're so..."
00:01:10,00:01:22,(music)
00:01:22,00:01:31,"Oh, and welcome to another episode of ""No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weakly Podcast"""
00:01:31,00:01:36,coming to you this week live from Debra!
00:01:36,00:01:42,(applause)
00:01:42,00:01:48,"My name is Jan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter-Marie,"
00:01:48,00:01:52,"and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our"
00:01:52,00:01:55,"four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order,"
00:01:55,00:01:59,"here we go, starting with you, Chazinski."
00:01:59,00:02:04,My fact this week is that every competitor at the world's longest dog sled race
00:02:04,00:02:07,brings about 600 spare pairs of shoes with them.
00:02:07,00:02:10,And they're for the dogs.
00:02:10,00:02:15,"This is amazing, so this is the..."
00:02:15,00:02:18,I've did a road race which happens in Alaska every year.
00:02:18,00:02:22,"It's very long, it's roughly a thousand miles through Alaska."
00:02:22,00:02:27,"And yeah, the dogs have to wear shoes, and so by the rules of the game,"
00:02:27,00:02:30,they actually have to bring eight extra shoes on the sled with them.
00:02:30,00:02:34,"So at any one time, there have to be eight pairs of dog shoes on the sled."
00:02:34,00:02:37,I was going to say on a pair of dog shoes is that four shoes are two shoes.
00:02:37,00:02:42,"I didn't know how to word this, but it's..."
00:02:42,00:02:46,"So it's a pair is for the front pair, and then you have a second pair for the back pair,"
00:02:46,00:02:48,"the way I see it, but it basically..."
00:02:48,00:02:52,Do dogs have different foot sizes on the front sets to the back sets?
00:02:52,00:02:56,"They actually, they can do, they can do, yeah, sometimes they do, yeah."
00:02:56,00:02:58,"So if you're buying, if you're buying your dog shoes,"
00:02:59,00:03:06,"then number one you're insane. But number two, you have to get both sides measured."
00:03:06,00:03:07,What's the biggest difference between the back...
00:03:07,00:03:11,"Like there's some dogs with tiny, tiny front paws and a massive back paws."
00:03:11,00:03:14,"That would be good. Like a penny-farthing, but in dog form."
00:03:14,00:03:17,"Like a kangaroo on all fours, yeah."
00:03:17,00:03:19,Yeah. Yeah. I believe not.
00:03:19,00:03:24,"And the facts get in the way, but otherwise pleasing bit of whimsy."
00:03:27,00:03:31,"Byte, so I didn't actually look that much into the size range of the dog shoes."
00:03:31,00:03:34,"I will say that the moshes, the guys..."
00:03:34,00:03:36,We're calling the moshes or moshes.
00:03:36,00:03:38,Moshes. So moshes.
00:03:38,00:03:39,Yeah.
00:03:39,00:03:41,So these are the due to riding the sled?
00:03:41,00:03:43,This is guys riding the sled or the woman who's riding the sled.
00:03:43,00:03:47,"They usually make the dog shoes themselves, so I guess they can tailor into each dog's foot size."
00:03:47,00:03:52,"And like I say, in the rules, per dog you have to have eight extra shoes on board the sled."
00:03:52,00:03:57,"And so yeah, they usually bring over a thousand pairs of shoes, like 13, 14, 100 shoes."
00:03:57,00:04:00,"And then the dogs have to drag the weights of those shoes, as well, don't they?"
00:04:00,00:04:03,"I guess. Yeah, they do kind of change them like that, though."
00:04:03,00:04:06,"So you know, in Formula One, you have pit stops where you're going to get filled out with petrol."
00:04:06,00:04:09,But that's what happens. You have your pit stops on the sled race.
00:04:09,00:04:11,Where you go and you have to change your dog shoes.
00:04:11,00:04:13,That's amazing. They bring the guys at the side.
00:04:13,00:04:15,They're bringing 16 trees for the dog to piss again.
00:04:15,00:04:27,"Some drivers, moshes, rather, they bring 3,000 little booties for the kids."
00:04:27,00:04:31,"Because you've got 16 dogs pulling each sled, I think that's right, so that's 64 feet."
00:04:31,00:04:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:32,00:04:37,What happens? Do they lose their shoe on the run or do they wear through?
00:04:37,00:04:38,Why do they need to change so much?
00:04:38,00:04:40,It gets worn through.
00:04:40,00:04:42,"So the reason they have shoes, it's not because of the colder."
00:04:42,00:04:46,"Anything dogs feet are very good at managing the cold, so it's totally covered in ice and snow."
00:04:46,00:04:51,But the reason they need it is for the kind of lumps and bumps and the grit and the sharp bits of ice
00:04:51,00:04:52,that might get stuck in their paws.
00:04:52,00:04:56,"And so that wears away at the shoes and just, you know, they're running pretty hardcore."
00:04:56,00:04:57,That's cool. That's fun.
00:04:57,00:05:02,"I read a really cool thing about the, because this is a big event that happens annually."
00:05:02,00:05:05,And it brings people from all over the planet to come and compete.
00:05:05,00:05:12,"And in 2010, the event saw its first ever Jamaican team entering it."
00:05:12,00:05:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:05:14,00:05:17,"Yeah, he's, yeah, he's called The Mushroom Mon."
00:05:17,00:05:18,That's what he calls himself.
00:05:18,00:05:22,"And he, yeah, he's been competing for years."
00:05:22,00:05:23,"That's a nickname, isn't it?"
00:05:23,00:05:24,"Yeah, no, it's his. He calls himself."
00:05:24,00:05:26,"That's his nickname, yeah. That's cool."
00:05:26,00:05:27,Yeah.
00:05:27,00:05:30,"It's just, because I thought there was one guy called Newton Marshall."
00:05:30,00:05:31,That's him. That's him.
00:05:31,00:05:34,"So, you know, the amazing thing about Newton Marshall is such a cool story."
00:05:34,00:05:39,"So basically, in 2014, there was another sledar called Scott Janssen."
00:05:39,00:05:43,"And he came off his sled and he was really, really badly injured, but he was off the track."
00:05:43,00:05:45,And he didn't know if anyone was going to find him.
00:05:45,00:05:49,And Newton Marshall came by on his sled and he noticed that this sled had been overturned
00:05:49,00:05:51,and that someone was really badly injured.
00:05:51,00:05:54,"Like, he'd been seriously concast, he'd broken his ankle."
00:05:54,00:05:56,And so he went and he saved him.
00:05:56,00:05:58,This guy called Newton Marshall went and he raised the alarm
00:05:58,00:06:00,and he sort of made him a little bed in the snow.
00:06:00,00:06:02,And they waited for him to be saved.
00:06:02,00:06:03,"And he was rescued, he was fine."
00:06:03,00:06:05,So that was what Newton Marshall did.
00:06:05,00:06:09,"But the bizarre thing about this is that two years earlier in the same race,"
00:06:09,00:06:11,Scott Janssen's dog had collapsed.
00:06:11,00:06:15,And he'd had to revive him with mouth to snout resuscitation.
00:06:15,00:06:17,So he'd been as good as dead for five minutes.
00:06:17,00:06:19,And Scott Janssen is a funeral home director.
00:06:19,00:06:22,"So he said, I know what dead looks like."
00:06:22,00:06:25,"That dog was dead, but he gave him mouth to snout."
00:06:25,00:06:30,And the bizarre thing about this is that the dog was called Marshall.
00:06:30,00:06:33,So he saved a Marshall.
00:06:33,00:06:35,What are you suggesting?
00:06:35,00:06:39,I genuinely don't know.
00:06:39,00:06:44,I think what I'm clearly missing is the dog Marshall has been reincarnated
00:06:44,00:06:49,in the person Marshall who's then come to save him as a thank you for saving the dog.
00:06:49,00:06:50,So it could subsequently die from this.
00:06:50,00:06:51,I know.
00:06:51,00:06:54,"And Newton, the human will be, you know, one year old."
00:06:54,00:06:56,"He wouldn't be in, I think."
00:06:56,00:06:58,We got to know all the answers.
00:06:58,00:07:02,"Also, I find it a bit weird that just because he works at a funeral home this guy,"
00:07:02,00:07:04,that he should be good at mouth to mouth resuscitation.
00:07:04,00:07:11,"And people brought him and he's like, we can still save him."
00:07:11,00:07:13,Give me five minutes.
00:07:13,00:07:17,I wouldn't trust that guy.
00:07:17,00:07:21,"My favorite, my favorite musher is a guy called John Souter."
00:07:21,00:07:26,"And he thought, you know what, all these guys are doing it wrong with these huskies."
00:07:26,00:07:27,I'm going to do it with poodles.
00:07:27,00:07:33,And so he got some poodles to carry his sled or to pull his sled along.
00:07:33,00:07:35,"He got them, he brought them up with huskies."
00:07:35,00:07:37,So they kind of learned what to do with the huskies.
00:07:37,00:07:40,"But unfortunately, they all got frozen feet."
00:07:40,00:07:43,"Because the huskies have got special padding, haven't they?"
00:07:43,00:07:47,And now it's banned and you have to have only certain types of dog that you're allowed.
00:07:47,00:07:49,There used to be that you could have any dog you wanted.
00:07:49,00:07:52,"But truly, there weren't many winners from the Chihuahua team."
00:07:52,00:07:57,Do you know what the idea for what it's based on?
00:07:57,00:08:02,It's based on an event which happened in 1925 called The Great Race of Mercy.
00:08:02,00:08:03,And this was a real crisis.
00:08:03,00:08:09,So there was a town in Nome which had an epidemic of death area and it was beginning.
00:08:09,00:08:11,"And it was, you know, people were starting to die."
00:08:11,00:08:12,A few people had already died.
00:08:12,00:08:15,And the nearest anti-toxin was a thousand miles away.
00:08:15,00:08:18,"In 1925, there were only three planes in the whole of Alaska"
00:08:18,00:08:21,"and they were elderly, unreliable biplanes."
00:08:21,00:08:24,So they couldn't be guaranteed to get there.
00:08:24,00:08:25,So they went with dogs.
00:08:25,00:08:30,And there were hero dogs and hero musherers who got the anti-toxin a thousand miles to the town of Nome.
00:08:30,00:08:36,"And the guy who approved this, the governor of Alaska who approved this."
00:08:36,00:08:37,His name was Scott Bone.
00:08:37,00:08:40,So there's a coincidence.
00:08:40,00:08:44,I'm not saying he was a reincarnated dog.
00:08:44,00:08:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:08:47,00:08:50,"And afterwards, the lead dog, Balto."
00:08:50,00:08:50,He became a celebrity.
00:08:50,00:08:55,He was as famous as Rinton Tin or Lassie or all these other celebrity dogs of the 1920s.
00:08:55,00:08:59,And the mayor of Los Angeles awarded Balto a bone-shaped key to the city.
00:08:59,00:09:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:00,00:09:00,"Oh, please."
00:09:00,00:09:02,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:02,00:09:05,"I've got a couple of favourites, favourites, races."
00:09:05,00:09:10,"So this is two people, a guy called Dallas and a guy called Mitch,"
00:09:10,00:09:11,their father and son.
00:09:11,00:09:13,And they seem to have this ongoing rivalry.
00:09:13,00:09:17,"So in 2012, Dallas Ceevy became the youngest winner."
00:09:17,00:09:19,He was 25 years old and he won it.
00:09:19,00:09:22,"In 2013, his father became the oldest ever winner."
00:09:22,00:09:24,This went on.
00:09:24,00:09:26,So Dallas kept on winning it year after year.
00:09:26,00:09:30,"In 2016, he broke the record for the fastest time it's ever been done."
00:09:30,00:09:32,So he did it in eight days and 11 hours.
00:09:32,00:09:39,"And in 2017, the following year, his dad broke the record again in eight days and three hours."
00:09:39,00:09:44,"And actually, that year, the son Dallas's dogs turned out to be doped."
00:09:44,00:09:47,"Now, they were weirdly, they were doped with a tramadol,"
00:09:47,00:09:50,which everyone agreed would not be of any benefit at all.
00:09:50,00:09:51,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:51,00:09:54,Surely they'd get a nice night's sleep at the end of the day.
00:09:54,00:09:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:55,00:09:57,"But yeah, I should say his father was not a suspect"
00:09:57,00:09:59,for doping his son's dogs or anything.
00:09:59,00:10:02,"But this year, he decided he didn't want to do it, right?"
00:10:02,00:10:05,"Because they said that, basically, he doped his dogs."
00:10:05,00:10:06,"He said, I definitely didn't do it."
00:10:06,00:10:07,Someone else must have done it.
00:10:07,00:10:09,And he wasn't happy about it.
00:10:09,00:10:10,And now he's kind of pulled out.
00:10:10,00:10:11,"Oh, is that why he didn't do it?"
00:10:11,00:10:12,"I believe so, yeah."
00:10:12,00:10:14,And it was done so much lower this year.
00:10:14,00:10:15,"It was like nine days, something."
00:10:15,00:10:16,It was rubbish.
00:10:16,00:10:18,"Yeah, what would they do?"
00:10:18,00:10:22,"But actually, I should just say, a lot of people don't like the dog sledding,"
00:10:22,00:10:23,don't they?
00:10:23,00:10:24,They think it's kind of cruel.
00:10:24,00:10:26,Because a lot of the dogs get sick.
00:10:26,00:10:27,Some of them die.
00:10:27,00:10:28,We all die.
00:10:28,00:10:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:10:31,00:10:34,"Well, how did you like to pull a sled?"
00:10:34,00:10:35,"Well, the old guy."
00:10:35,00:10:38,He might as well just pull a fucking sled.
00:10:38,00:10:40,"I'm just saying, life is hard."
00:10:40,00:10:44,It's a lot harder if you're pulling a sled.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"That's a good point, sorry, yeah."
00:10:45,00:10:48,"Well, the other thing is, there's lots of things that can happen there."
00:10:48,00:10:49,"I mean, they do die."
00:10:49,00:10:53,One of the worst things they get is scrotal and penile frostbite.
00:10:53,00:10:54,Wow.
00:10:54,00:10:55,OK.
00:10:55,00:10:55,Yeah?
00:10:55,00:10:56,There's a frostbite.
00:10:56,00:11:02,"No, I'd like to announce, I'm pulling out of the next day as a general."
00:11:02,00:11:05,And then I thought I would check to see if humans can get frostbite.
00:11:05,00:11:06,On the penises.
00:11:06,00:11:08,Because I just didn't trust you.
00:11:08,00:11:09,I just didn't trust you.
00:11:09,00:11:10,That's why you went to Iceland.
00:11:10,00:11:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:12,00:11:15,The zoo's all gone off.
00:11:15,00:11:18,Not why mom shops there.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"Well, apparently, according to the internet,"
00:11:21,00:11:25,the classic account of humans getting frostbite on their genitals
00:11:25,00:11:28,is from the New England Journal of Medicine in 1977.
00:11:28,00:11:31,And there's a doctor called Melvin Hirschkowitz.
00:11:31,00:11:34,And he went running in very cold weather.
00:11:34,00:11:36,And he got that.
00:11:36,00:11:38,And it's notable.
00:11:38,00:11:42,"The paper is notable because, once he writes about what happened,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,"and at one stage, his wife comes home and finds him standing"
00:11:45,00:11:48,"legs apart in the bedroom, nude below the waist,"
00:11:48,00:11:50,"holding the tip of his penis in his right hand,"
00:11:50,00:11:53,and turning the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine.
00:11:53,00:11:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:55,00:12:00,I was just looking up weird dog competitions.
00:12:00,00:12:03,And there's a magazine called Veterinary Practice News.
00:12:03,00:12:05,And it has an annual x-ray competition awarded
00:12:05,00:12:08,to dogs who eat in the weirdest things.
00:12:08,00:12:12,"So recently, one of the winners was Lola, a seven-kilototus,"
00:12:12,00:12:14,who'd eaten a turtle pendant.
00:12:14,00:12:15,But--
00:12:15,00:12:15,I think it took.
00:12:15,00:12:17,"Is our dogs, are they?"
00:12:17,00:12:19,"No, sorry, it was just pett, just pett."
00:12:19,00:12:19,"Oh, right."
00:12:19,00:12:21,"I mean, we're things, sorry."
00:12:21,00:12:22,But my favorite one was the Rotweiler.
00:12:22,00:12:24,I want to see one pulling the sled.
00:12:24,00:12:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:26,00:12:32,"My favorite one of these winners was the Rotweiler,"
00:12:32,00:12:33,who had swallowed her own as wristwatch.
00:12:33,00:12:35,"But the alarm was still on, telling her when"
00:12:35,00:12:37,to take her insulin.
00:12:37,00:12:41,So she had to listen to the dog to find the one to take her pedals.
00:12:41,00:12:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:42,00:12:49,"All right, it is time for fact number two."
00:12:49,00:12:51,And that is my fact.
00:12:51,00:12:55,"My fact this week is that 3,000 feet up a mountain in France"
00:12:55,00:12:58,is a block of sandstone commemorating the exact spot
00:12:58,00:13:01,where the author Victor Hugo's parents conceived him.
00:13:01,00:13:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:03,00:13:05,"Yeah, it's--"
00:13:05,00:13:08,this was revealed that that was the spot where it happened
00:13:08,00:13:12,"in a letter written by his dad, who bragged about it a lot."
00:13:12,00:13:15,"It was at the top of this mountain, called Mount Denon,"
00:13:15,00:13:18,"in France, and he made it to the top."
00:13:18,00:13:21,"And it was years later, this wasn't done in his lifetime,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,"but years later, a museum curator thought,"
00:13:23,00:13:25,I've got to commemorate this and brought a sandstone.
00:13:25,00:13:27,And it's there to this day.
00:13:27,00:13:28,"It was kind of a prank, wasn't it?"
00:13:28,00:13:31,"By the guy from the museum in the '60s, was it?"
00:13:31,00:13:33,I think it was like a practical joke in the 1960s.
00:13:33,00:13:35,But did you know that Victor Hugo denied
00:13:35,00:13:36,that that was where it happened?
00:13:36,00:13:39,"Because he was kind of ashamed of this mountain,"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"big amount, and that wasn't super famous,"
00:13:41,00:13:42,not everyone knew about it.
00:13:42,00:13:45,"So whenever he retold the story of when he was conceived,"
00:13:45,00:13:50,"as we all do, he made lots of little changes."
00:13:50,00:13:52,"So there'd been a Celtic temple on Mount Denon,"
00:13:52,00:13:55,and he changed that to a Roman temple of love.
00:13:55,00:13:57,"And he changed the mountain range to the Alps,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,because everyone's heard of the Alps.
00:13:59,00:14:02,"And he made it Montblanc, because that's 3,000 feet taller."
00:14:02,00:14:05,"And so his version, he was a storyteller."
00:14:05,00:14:06,That was what he did.
00:14:06,00:14:10,"Yeah, you run at the risk of frostbite to the scrotum."
00:14:10,00:14:12,If you try to conceive of that altitude.
00:14:12,00:14:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:15,00:14:21,"He did-- he told a lot of stories, obviously."
00:14:21,00:14:22,Namely little.
00:14:22,00:14:23,He knew his room.
00:14:23,00:14:25,"Yeah, fine, fine."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"He claimed that he and his wife, Adele,"
00:14:30,00:14:32,had sex nine times on their wedding night.
00:14:32,00:14:35,"And the telegraph wrote that, apparently,"
00:14:35,00:14:38,she lost her taste for intercourse after that first night.
00:14:38,00:14:39,And I'm not surprised.
00:14:39,00:14:41,"Well, he was a sex addict, wasn't he?"
00:14:41,00:14:42,Yes.
00:14:42,00:14:45,He was constantly going to brothels.
00:14:45,00:14:47,"He almost had a sort of, like, breakfast"
00:14:47,00:14:50,sex and then lunchtime sex and dinner sex.
00:14:50,00:14:53,"There was almost a menu on a day-to-day basis with Victor Hugo,"
00:14:53,00:14:56,to the point that he was so popular amongst the brothels of Paris
00:14:56,00:14:59,"that when he died, the brothels of Paris"
00:14:59,00:15:02,closed down for the day so that everyone working there
00:15:02,00:15:05,could come to the funeral procession to pay tribute.
00:15:05,00:15:08,"I read one account, and I'm not sure this can be true."
00:15:08,00:15:11,But the prostitutes of Paris draped their vaginas
00:15:11,00:15:12,"in black, crepe paper."
00:15:12,00:15:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:15,00:15:24,"That's according to a guy called Edmund Gonca,"
00:15:24,00:15:27,who was there at the time of the world.
00:15:27,00:15:30,How did he know?
00:15:30,00:15:32,He can't have tested them all.
00:15:32,00:15:38,"But what happened was, when he died,"
00:15:38,00:15:40,everyone thought he was going to die.
00:15:40,00:15:42,And then he kind of stuck around for a few weeks.
00:15:42,00:15:44,"And so people came to Paris, expecting for him to die,"
00:15:44,00:15:46,and they were going to celebrate his life.
00:15:46,00:15:47,But it went so long.
00:15:47,00:15:49,More and more and more people came.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"And in the end, there were a crowd of 2 million people"
00:15:51,00:15:54,"at this funeral, which was more than the normal population"
00:15:54,00:15:55,of Paris.
00:15:55,00:15:56,Wow.
00:15:56,00:15:57,It was rammed.
00:15:57,00:16:01,And everyone-- because he was like a famous sex addict
00:16:01,00:16:05,"or whatever, and he was a partier, everyone just got drunk."
00:16:05,00:16:06,Everyone had sex.
00:16:06,00:16:07,There was this story that always happens
00:16:07,00:16:09,"that people say that nine months later,"
00:16:09,00:16:10,there were loads of babies born.
00:16:10,00:16:13,"So people were saying that during the funeral,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,everyone was just having sex everywhere.
00:16:15,00:16:17,"There was a parade at his funeral,"
00:16:17,00:16:20,and it took six hours for it to get to the end.
00:16:20,00:16:22,And there were delegations of different professions there.
00:16:22,00:16:26,"So there were veterans, civil servants, writers, animal lovers,"
00:16:26,00:16:28,"a schoolchildren, suffrageers."
00:16:28,00:16:30,"Sorry, can we give it back?"
00:16:30,00:16:33,What-- his-- was animal lover a formal profession?
00:16:33,00:16:34,No.
00:16:34,00:16:39,Who's paying for that?
00:16:39,00:16:46,"But apparently, the suffrageers got really annoyed,"
00:16:46,00:16:50,because they were behind the gymnasts in the department stores.
00:16:50,00:16:52,"They said, we deserve better than this."
00:16:52,00:16:57,"Wow, but it was just after his 79th birthday."
00:16:57,00:17:00,So he had an 80th birthday party on his 79th birthday
00:17:00,00:17:02,as he was entering his 80th year.
00:17:02,00:17:04,"And for that one, half a million people just walked past his house"
00:17:04,00:17:07,as he sat outside waving at them.
00:17:07,00:17:11,"And then the next day, because that was his apartment in Paris,"
00:17:11,00:17:14,they changed the street name from where he was living.
00:17:14,00:17:17,So it got changed to become avenue Victor Hugo.
00:17:17,00:17:20,"So his remaining days, he lived on the street"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"named after him, and he would say that he would--"
00:17:23,00:17:26,he wanted all the future mail that came to him
00:17:26,00:17:31,"to be addressed to Mr. Victor in his avenue, Paris."
00:17:31,00:17:33,And that would make it to him.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"He said he wanted a pauper's burial, a pauper's funeral,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,and he obviously had the complete opposite.
00:17:38,00:17:41,But I'm not totally convinced he wants it.
00:17:41,00:17:43,"There's one biography of him, which kind of seems"
00:17:43,00:17:45,to suggest that he was obviously famous for being
00:17:45,00:17:48,a proponent of helping out the poor.
00:17:48,00:17:50,And then Mr. Arbor has all about the awful conditions
00:17:50,00:17:51,people lived in.
00:17:51,00:17:52,But he really liked people to know it.
00:17:52,00:17:54,"So for instance, apparently, he liked people"
00:17:54,00:17:57,to ask him why he was wearing his coat inside out.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"Because then he'd say to them, I just wear it inside out"
00:18:00,00:18:01,rather than buying a new one.
00:18:01,00:18:03,And then I can give that money to the poor.
00:18:03,00:18:07,And he really-- he really liked to invite this kind of worker.
00:18:07,00:18:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:11,00:18:11,"I know, right?"
00:18:11,00:18:13,"Apparently, according to this person,"
00:18:13,00:18:16,he actually left in his will what the biographer
00:18:16,00:18:19,"describes as an ""exeguous summer,"" a very small amount"
00:18:19,00:18:23,"in his will to the poor, because he knew how rumours work."
00:18:23,00:18:25,And he knew that that would become an enormous amount
00:18:25,00:18:26,within a short amount of time.
00:18:26,00:18:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:18:27,00:18:27,Sorry.
00:18:27,00:18:29,"He was so famous when he was living in Guernsey,"
00:18:29,00:18:32,that admirers would save the pebbles
00:18:32,00:18:34,that he walked upon when he was walking across the beach.
00:18:34,00:18:35,Wow.
00:18:35,00:18:37,"So they would be like, he's still on that one."
00:18:37,00:18:39,I'll take that.
00:18:39,00:18:40,Wow.
00:18:40,00:18:40,Yeah.
00:18:40,00:18:41,Apparently.
00:18:41,00:18:44,"I mean, it doesn't sound very true, does it?"
00:18:44,00:18:46,Is it from-- did he tell us that?
00:18:46,00:18:47,Or--
00:18:47,00:18:48,It's hard to tell.
00:18:48,00:18:50,"He was kind of-- he was paid in a very unusual way,"
00:18:50,00:18:52,"for the lamez, because he said, I think,"
00:18:52,00:18:54,"to his publisher-- his publisher said, how much do you want?"
00:18:54,00:18:56,And he made him a quite a high offer.
00:18:56,00:18:57,"And he said, no, that's not enough."
00:18:57,00:19:00,"And he said, I think he said, I'd like to be paid more than anyone else"
00:19:00,00:19:02,has ever been paid to write a book.
00:19:02,00:19:05,I'll give some to the poor.
00:19:05,00:19:07,But the publisher didn't have the money to pay.
00:19:07,00:19:09,"It was, I think, equivalent of about 3 million pounds,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,which is a huge amount of money.
00:19:11,00:19:12,And the publisher didn't have that money.
00:19:12,00:19:15,So he had to borrow all of that from a bank.
00:19:15,00:19:19,"So it was kind of a private finance initiative novel, basically."
00:19:19,00:19:21,And then the publisher just borrowed in the assumption
00:19:21,00:19:22,that it would pay off.
00:19:22,00:19:22,And it did.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Yeah, it was huge, wasn't it?"
00:19:23,00:19:25,"When it was published, people turned up with wheelbarrows"
00:19:25,00:19:27,to buy copies of it.
00:19:27,00:19:27,What?
00:19:27,00:19:28,How big was it?
00:19:28,00:19:28,It is a big book.
00:19:28,00:19:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:30,00:19:32,And wheelbarrows at the time were very small.
00:19:32,00:19:33,Yeah.
00:19:33,00:19:37,But what happened is you would go in.
00:19:37,00:19:39,"If you were a worker, and you could get some time off,"
00:19:39,00:19:41,"and you could afford to get the book,"
00:19:41,00:19:44,"and you could queue up and get there in time with your wheelbarrow,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,then you could sell it to your friends.
00:19:46,00:19:48,And you could make a massive profit on it.
00:19:48,00:19:51,"It was like a ticket town to kind of think, yeah, wow."
00:19:51,00:19:54,"He wasn't quite arrogant, though, wasn't he?"
00:19:54,00:19:54,That was it.
00:19:54,00:19:56,He wanted to be paid all the money in the world.
00:19:56,00:19:58,And he used to-- he was a party animal.
00:19:58,00:20:01,So he apparently used to have 30 guests
00:20:01,00:20:04,"surrounded in every single night, right up until he was 80,"
00:20:04,00:20:05,when he died.
00:20:05,00:20:07,But he then did at these big dinner parties.
00:20:07,00:20:10,He used to spend the whole time talking about how great he was.
00:20:10,00:20:13,"He would say, there is only one classical writer"
00:20:13,00:20:14,in this country.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"One, do you hear me?"
00:20:16,00:20:17,I am the only one.
00:20:17,00:20:20,I know the French language better than anyone else alive.
00:20:20,00:20:21,And then he was better.
00:20:21,00:20:23,"Sorry, I just asked if you wanted red or white one."
00:20:23,00:20:27,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:27,00:20:30,And then he'd catalog all like Bullsack and Racine
00:20:30,00:20:32,and all the other great writers
00:20:32,00:20:34,and explain why they were not as good as he was.
00:20:34,00:20:37,There was one time when he wouldn't talk about himself
00:20:37,00:20:37,in these parties.
00:20:37,00:20:39,"And that was when he did his party trick,"
00:20:39,00:20:42,"which was putting a whole orange into his mouth,"
00:20:42,00:20:45,and then thrusting as many pieces of sugar as possible
00:20:45,00:20:48,"into his cheeks, and then scrunching it all up,"
00:20:48,00:20:50,"swallowing two liquor glasses of kish,"
00:20:50,00:20:53,"and then opening his mouth and saying, I've just eaten it all."
00:20:53,00:20:54,So now this is tricky.
00:20:54,00:20:57,Could it eat an orange and a lotus sugar really quickly?
00:20:57,00:20:58,"Oh, awesome."
00:20:58,00:21:02,"And people still talk about his novel, or something."
00:21:02,00:21:04,We're going to have to move on very shortly.
00:21:04,00:21:07,"The guy who wrote the lyrics for the musical of Les Mis,"
00:21:07,00:21:09,he was a guy called James Fenton.
00:21:09,00:21:11,"He wrote the first lyrics, lots of people."
00:21:11,00:21:12,I had it how to get out of the lyrics.
00:21:12,00:21:14,"But when he was given the book and told,"
00:21:14,00:21:15,"hey, why don't you have a look at the lyrics"
00:21:15,00:21:17,for this turning this novel into lyrics.
00:21:17,00:21:20,He was on a three-month trip looking for headhunters in Borneo.
00:21:20,00:21:22,And it was a really heavy book.
00:21:22,00:21:24,"And he said that he spent three months in a canoe,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"reading Les Mis, and every time he finished a chapter,"
00:21:27,00:21:28,"he threw it to the crocodile,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,so he could save a bit of weight in the canoe.
00:21:31,00:21:32,That's very cool.
00:21:32,00:21:35,Did you know he trended on Twitter in 2014
00:21:35,00:21:37,for a kind of related reason?
00:21:37,00:21:39,So he trended on Twitter and not in a good way.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"It turned out, the BBC reported this,"
00:21:41,00:21:43,that he was suddenly Victor Hugo was receiving
00:21:43,00:21:45,all these death threats on Twitter.
00:21:45,00:21:46,"And he was being called, lots of stuff."
00:21:46,00:21:49,He was called the son of a prostitute.
00:21:49,00:21:51,His daughter was called a big bitch.
00:21:51,00:21:58,And it turned out what happened was one of his poems
00:21:58,00:22:01,had been set in a French baccalaureate exam.
00:22:01,00:22:03,And they were so annoyed about it.
00:22:03,00:22:05,Because it's so factual that all the students
00:22:05,00:22:07,got online afterwards.
00:22:07,00:22:08,They got him trending.
00:22:08,00:22:09,Isn't that--
00:22:09,00:22:11,I think you know you've made it when you're getting death threats
00:22:11,00:22:13,on Twitter 200 years.
00:22:13,00:22:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:22:16,00:22:19,"OK, it's time to move on to fact number three."
00:22:19,00:22:20,And that is James.
00:22:20,00:22:25,"OK, my fact this week is in the event of a zombie apocalypse,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,only one country will survive.
00:22:27,00:22:31,And that country is North Korea.
00:22:31,00:22:32,Really?
00:22:32,00:22:33,Yeah.
00:22:33,00:22:36,So this is a study by some mathematicians in Brazil.
00:22:36,00:22:38,And they've kind of done a model of what's going to happen.
00:22:38,00:22:41,And it's going to be like a straight fight between human and zombie.
00:22:41,00:22:43,And the zombie's always going to win.
00:22:43,00:22:46,"But if you get a human with a gun, like in the army,"
00:22:46,00:22:47,then the human might win.
00:22:47,00:22:49,And they've worked out that what you're going to need
00:22:49,00:22:54,"is 47 soldiers per 1,000 capital in order to survive."
00:22:54,00:22:56,And there's only one country with that many people.
00:22:56,00:22:58,And that is North Korea.
00:22:58,00:22:59,And they have also the advantage
00:22:59,00:23:01,of being completely separate from everyone else.
00:23:01,00:23:04,So it's going to be difficult for the zombies to get in.
00:23:04,00:23:07,The borders are very guarded and stuff like that.
00:23:07,00:23:10,"So if the zombies come, that's where it's the best place to go."
00:23:10,00:23:12,"Oh, right."
00:23:12,00:23:14,"In all of the circumstances, I don't love that."
00:23:14,00:23:21,"I was reading, my assumption is, if you were killed by a zombie,"
00:23:21,00:23:24,it would be through your brains being eaten and you being attacked.
00:23:24,00:23:27,"According to Max Brooks, Max Brooks is an author who"
00:23:27,00:23:29,wrote the zombie survival guide.
00:23:29,00:23:31,"He wrote the movie World War Z, the book"
00:23:31,00:23:34,"or other World War Z, which was made into the Brad Pitt movie."
00:23:34,00:23:36,So he studied in a very serious way
00:23:36,00:23:39,what he thought would be the way that you would be most likely
00:23:39,00:23:40,to die in a zombie apocalypse.
00:23:40,00:23:43,And his main reason for anyone's death
00:23:43,00:23:47,is that you would die from explosive diarrhea.
00:23:47,00:23:50,And it's because water would become so scarce
00:23:50,00:23:52,that you would be forced to drink from puddles.
00:23:52,00:23:53,Puddles are very dangerous to get water from.
00:23:53,00:23:56,You can see why they don't make most of the zombie films
00:23:56,00:24:01,about the whole explosive diarrhea puddle issue.
00:24:01,00:24:02,Yeah.
00:24:02,00:24:03,I wouldn't want to.
00:24:03,00:24:06,"I did look up, because there are so many zombie films."
00:24:06,00:24:07,"And they're quite cheap to make, obviously,"
00:24:07,00:24:10,because all you need is some willing extras with a load of makeup on.
00:24:10,00:24:12,And a load of them are quite low quality.
00:24:12,00:24:15,But I went through a list of all the zombie films I could find online.
00:24:15,00:24:19,"I just wanted to share a few of the titles, because they're great."
00:24:19,00:24:23,"So there are classic things like boy, eat, girl, free, clever."
00:24:23,00:24:26,There's erotic nights of the living dead.
00:24:26,00:24:30,"There's flights of the living dead, which is a plane-based zombie film."
00:24:30,00:24:31,My favorite one is--
00:24:31,00:24:33,I like the explosive diarrhea one.
00:24:33,00:24:37,The shites of the living dead.
00:24:37,00:24:44,I've got a third one.
00:24:44,00:24:45,It's not as good as that.
00:24:45,00:24:50,"It's called ""Poltery Guysed Night of the Chicken Dead."""
00:24:50,00:24:57,"A tiny little nugget about the World War Z movie, by the way,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,"that was made, which is just a cool bit of trivia, which"
00:24:59,00:25:03,is that one of the actors in the movie was Peter Capaldi.
00:25:04,00:25:08,And Peter Capaldi was cast as a World Health Organization Doctor.
00:25:08,00:25:12,"So he was a whew, Doctor."
00:25:12,00:25:18,And what it was is that the filmmakers had
00:25:18,00:25:21,inside knowledge that he was going to be announced as the Doctor.
00:25:21,00:25:23,This was before Doctor Who.
00:25:23,00:25:27,"And so it's a subtle, like Easter Egg here."
00:25:27,00:25:29,"Oh, and none of us guessed based on that."
00:25:29,00:25:32,We should have known these stories in the face.
00:25:32,00:25:34,People at scientists and people at universities
00:25:34,00:25:38,are always writing analyses of what happens in a zombie apocalypse.
00:25:38,00:25:39,It happens really in a lot of places.
00:25:39,00:25:42,And I think it's kind of a way of engaging people
00:25:42,00:25:43,when making something sound fun.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"When actually, it's a paper about statistical projections."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"That could be fun, Ella."
00:25:49,00:25:51,"Which, for a lot of people, is fun."
00:25:51,00:25:55,But one example of this was the University of Ottawa
00:25:55,00:25:58,"a few years ago, published a paper with an equation in it,"
00:25:58,00:26:01,explaining how fast we'd have to deal with the zombie apocalypse.
00:26:01,00:26:03,"So the paper's called, when zombies attack,"
00:26:03,00:26:06,mathematical modeling of an outbreak of zombie infection.
00:26:06,00:26:08,"And one of the papers authors, the professor in charge,"
00:26:08,00:26:12,"was called Robert J. Smith, question mark."
00:26:12,00:26:16,And it turns out that the guy here at this paper
00:26:16,00:26:18,has put a question mark on the end of his name.
00:26:18,00:26:19,And I looked him up.
00:26:19,00:26:23,"And if you go to his academic page on the website at the university,"
00:26:23,00:26:25,"he says, yeah, that's not a typo."
00:26:25,00:26:27,I really do have a question mark on the end of my name.
00:26:27,00:26:30,Do you have any idea what it's like to live with such an incredibly
00:26:30,00:26:33,common name that you'll never ever show up on Google?
00:26:33,00:26:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:36,00:26:38,I had to do something.
00:26:38,00:26:40,How do you think he pronounced his it?
00:26:40,00:26:41,Did his Robert Smith?
00:26:41,00:26:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:43,00:26:43,Or Smith?
00:26:43,00:26:44,Definitely.
00:26:44,00:26:46,"Oh, he might just say question mark at the end, maybe."
00:26:46,00:26:47,Yeah.
00:26:47,00:26:49,"But he then also says, I did go to his page."
00:26:49,00:26:50,I saw this as well.
00:26:50,00:26:52,"He then follows up by saying, how do you stick out on Google?"
00:26:52,00:26:55,"He then goes, actually, you still don't stick out on Google"
00:26:55,00:26:57,when you put it on your mark.
00:26:57,00:26:58,So it hasn't really worked.
00:26:58,00:27:00,I like the other one who he wanted to stick out
00:27:00,00:27:01,"against, who is Robert Smith."
00:27:01,00:27:03,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:03,00:27:11,I've got a bit of good news in the zombie world to come.
00:27:11,00:27:11,"Oh, good."
00:27:11,00:27:12,We're going to win.
00:27:12,00:27:13,It's going to be fine.
00:27:13,00:27:15,It's going to be absolutely fine.
00:27:15,00:27:17,"We're going to win within about a week, guys."
00:27:17,00:27:18,"OK, there's someone booth."
00:27:18,00:27:21,There's like a bit of a weird zombie wall.
00:27:21,00:27:25,"How many of the priorities, mate?"
00:27:25,00:27:26,So there's an article by a scientist
00:27:26,00:27:28,called David Misagewski.
00:27:28,00:27:30,And he said that nature would destroy zombies
00:27:30,00:27:32,before they could destroy us.
00:27:32,00:27:34,"So obviously, all animals will be packing away at them."
00:27:34,00:27:34,They're dead.
00:27:34,00:27:36,They're not very fast with the reactions.
00:27:36,00:27:38,But the main thing is microorganisms
00:27:38,00:27:40,would go to town on them.
00:27:40,00:27:43,"Bacteria, fungi, molds, insects, flesh-eating beetles."
00:27:43,00:27:45,"I think it's a bit cocky for you to say,"
00:27:45,00:27:47,we're going to win in that situation.
00:27:47,00:27:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:48,00:27:52,Allies in the microorganism world will join us
00:27:52,00:27:57,in a coalition of the live.
00:27:57,00:27:59,That's a really good point.
00:27:59,00:28:00,That's such good logic.
00:28:00,00:28:02,They can decompose a rabbit right down to the bones in a week.
00:28:02,00:28:05,So they'll go to town on these things.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"Misagewski, he did say that in his kind of world,"
00:28:09,00:28:12,animals can't get the same disease that humans were getting.
00:28:12,00:28:13,Do you know what I mean?
00:28:13,00:28:16,So the animals can't become zombies in his kind of idea.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"If the animals can become zombies as well,"
00:28:18,00:28:20,then it's a whole different ballgame.
00:28:20,00:28:25,"If you're getting attacked by zombie microwarkers,"
00:28:25,00:28:26,that is not a great movie either.
00:28:26,00:28:29,"I must admit, but there's someone else"
00:28:29,00:28:32,who's published advice on how to escape zombies.
00:28:32,00:28:34,"How to survive a zombie attack is the CDC,"
00:28:34,00:28:37,the Center for Disease Control in America.
00:28:37,00:28:39,And this was obviously kind of a PR thing
00:28:39,00:28:41,to try and get people actually onto their website.
00:28:41,00:28:44,So they learned how to survive genuine crises.
00:28:44,00:28:47,"But it's quite funny, because if you do go to the site now,"
00:28:47,00:28:49,"they've got a zombie preparedness page,"
00:28:49,00:28:50,a zombie preparedness blog.
00:28:50,00:28:54,They've got a zombie preparedness booklet for educators
00:28:54,00:28:55,that they will send out.
00:28:55,00:28:58,But they don't really conceal their true purpose very well.
00:28:58,00:29:01,"So the tips they give are things like,"
00:29:01,00:29:03,"stock up on water, food, and other supplies"
00:29:03,00:29:05,to get you through the first couple of days
00:29:05,00:29:08,before you can locate a zombie-free refugee camp.
00:29:08,00:29:11,"Brackets or, in the case of a natural disaster,"
00:29:11,00:29:13,it will buy you some time to get to an evacuation shelter
00:29:13,00:29:16,"or until utility lines are restored, close brackets."
00:29:16,00:29:20,"It's always like, you know, first aid supplies,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,in case that horrible zombie bites you.
00:29:22,00:29:25,"Also, we'll come in handy in a tornado or a hurricane."
00:29:25,00:29:28,LAUGHTER
00:29:28,00:29:31,And one other thing that might help us if the zombies attack
00:29:31,00:29:34,to win is the reverse zombie tick.
00:29:34,00:29:35,Cool.
00:29:35,00:29:37,"OK, this is an animal, a little tick."
00:29:37,00:29:41,"And if it bites you, it makes you allergic to meat."
00:29:41,00:29:43,And so the idea is what we might do
00:29:43,00:29:45,is kind of work out what makes that happen.
00:29:45,00:29:47,"And then we can inject it into the zombies,"
00:29:47,00:29:51,"make them allergic to eating us, and then we're saved."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"But just because the zombies got hives,"
00:29:53,00:29:57,doesn't mean that you're not then a zombie.
00:29:57,00:29:58,Yeah.
00:29:58,00:29:59,Wait.
00:29:59,00:30:02,LAUGHTER
00:30:02,00:30:03,How?
00:30:03,00:30:05,Do you guys know that zombies make an appearance
00:30:05,00:30:08,in Amazon's terms and services conditions?
00:30:08,00:30:12,"You know that when you go and you sign that massive 26,000 words?"
00:30:12,00:30:14,"Yeah, we all read it."
00:30:14,00:30:17,"But then you, oh, then this won't be a surprise."
00:30:17,00:30:19,"Someone did read the whole thing, and they discovered"
00:30:19,00:30:22,"that there's a passage in it, which reads, however,"
00:30:22,00:30:23,so that it just comes into this.
00:30:23,00:30:26,"However, this restriction will not apply"
00:30:26,00:30:29,in the event of the occurrence of a widespread viral infection
00:30:29,00:30:32,transmitted via bites or contact with bubbly fluids
00:30:32,00:30:34,that cause human corpses to reanimate
00:30:34,00:30:38,"and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain,"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"or nerve tissue, and is likely to result"
00:30:40,00:30:44,in the fall of organized civilization.
00:30:44,00:30:47,That's in Amazon's actual terms.
00:30:47,00:30:48,That's very funny.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"And conditions, yeah."
00:30:49,00:30:51,It feels like they're testing us to check we're reading them.
00:30:51,00:30:52,Exactly.
00:30:52,00:30:54,"And as the news of the last two months has told us,"
00:30:54,00:30:57,nobody has read any of them.
00:30:57,00:30:59,"Oh, we need to move on shortly."
00:30:59,00:31:04,There is just on animal zombie sort of parasites
00:31:04,00:31:05,and the way they spread.
00:31:05,00:31:07,"There is a flight called Apocephalus Borealis,"
00:31:07,00:31:09,and it lays eggs inside bumblebees.
00:31:09,00:31:11,And the amazing thing is that the infected bee
00:31:11,00:31:14,"then stops working, and it starts acting like a moth."
00:31:14,00:31:17,"It starts being flying around lights and this kind of thing,"
00:31:17,00:31:21,"while the other parasite is preparing to burst out, basically."
00:31:21,00:31:24,But that means that there are zom bees.
00:31:24,00:31:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:25,00:31:27,Oh!
00:31:27,00:31:28,"Yeah, that's good."
00:31:28,00:31:32,[APPLAUSE]
00:31:32,00:31:33,Very cool.
00:31:33,00:31:38,It's a very forgiving audience tonight.
00:31:38,00:31:41,"OK, it is time for our final fact to the show."
00:31:41,00:31:42,And that is Andy.
00:31:42,00:31:45,"My fact is that the 1930s actor, George Arles,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,once booked himself into the left luggage
00:31:47,00:31:49,office at Charring Cross as a parcel
00:31:49,00:31:51,in order to escape people who wanted his autograph.
00:31:51,00:31:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:53,00:31:56,What a guy I'd never had of this guy before.
00:31:56,00:31:57,But he was very famous at the time.
00:31:57,00:32:00,And he wrote in his memoir that he was being chased
00:32:00,00:32:03,by people who were desperate for his autograph.
00:32:03,00:32:05,"And so he said, with presence of mind"
00:32:05,00:32:06,"worthy of a great general, I thought"
00:32:06,00:32:08,that left luggage office.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"It was just behind me, close to the platform."
00:32:10,00:32:12,I turned to the man in charge and demanded the right to book
00:32:12,00:32:14,myself in as a parcel.
00:32:14,00:32:16,"I paid my two pints, and the man took me over the counter."
00:32:16,00:32:17,And I was saved.
00:32:17,00:32:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:18,00:32:21,"Well, he took him over the counter."
00:32:21,00:32:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:23,00:32:26,It's amazing what you could get for two pennies in those days.
00:32:26,00:32:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:29,00:32:31,He was-- I hadn't heard of him either.
00:32:31,00:32:33,And he was very famous in his time.
00:32:33,00:32:36,He was the first British actor to ever win an Academy
00:32:36,00:32:37,award for a leading actor.
00:32:37,00:32:41,"Yes, he won it as well for playing Benjamin Disraeli,"
00:32:41,00:32:43,the British Prime Minister.
00:32:43,00:32:48,And he then won it again for years later for playing Benjamin
00:32:48,00:32:49,Disraeli.
00:32:49,00:32:51,He played the same role and got given it twice.
00:32:51,00:32:54,He was the first person to do that reprising a role
00:32:54,00:32:56,and getting it a second time.
00:32:56,00:32:58,"And was that-- one was silent, wasn't it?"
00:32:58,00:32:59,And then the other one was a talky thing.
00:32:59,00:33:00,"Yeah, that's right."
00:33:00,00:33:04,"And he also, Victor Hugoly, was very"
00:33:04,00:33:06,egotistical as well.
00:33:06,00:33:08,He had to do a court appearance once.
00:33:08,00:33:11,He was called to a just a court hearing
00:33:11,00:33:12,and get to give a testament.
00:33:12,00:33:17,And he called himself the world's greatest living actor.
00:33:17,00:33:21,"And to explain his statement, he said, you see, I'm on oath."
00:33:21,00:33:24,So he was a real kind of dick.
00:33:24,00:33:25,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:25,00:33:27,I really like Victor Hugoly.
00:33:27,00:33:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:30,00:33:32,There was one other instance of his egotism
00:33:32,00:33:35,"that I read about was in a film called ""The Man Who"
00:33:35,00:33:38,"Played God,"" which was about a concert pianist who then"
00:33:38,00:33:39,fell on hard times.
00:33:39,00:33:41,"But he stuck to the script totally,"
00:33:41,00:33:44,except there was one bit of the script where the line was--
00:33:44,00:33:47,someone came up to the pianist after the show
00:33:47,00:33:50,and congratulated him on the performance.
00:33:50,00:33:52,"And the line was, so glad you liked it."
00:33:52,00:33:56,"And he changed it to, so glad you liked me."
00:33:56,00:33:58,Someone's just gone through the script and the film
00:33:58,00:34:01,"and gone, oh, he changed that, didn't he?"
00:34:01,00:34:02,"Ah, man."
00:34:02,00:34:06,"And so on autograph hunting, autograph collectors."
00:34:06,00:34:06,I didn't know this.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"There is a magazine called ""Autograph Collector,"""
00:34:08,00:34:10,"which is all about collecting autographs, how to do it,"
00:34:10,00:34:13,"how to get different people, and various tactics"
00:34:13,00:34:14,and things like that.
00:34:14,00:34:16,And they do a lot on the history of autograph collecting
00:34:16,00:34:18,"too, because some people sell them."
00:34:18,00:34:20,"Obviously, some people collect loads and loads of them"
00:34:20,00:34:21,at the same time.
00:34:21,00:34:21,Yeah.
00:34:21,00:34:24,And they described one incident in 1934
00:34:24,00:34:26,when the Australian cricket team came to England.
00:34:26,00:34:29,"And in those days, they had to get the ship to England"
00:34:29,00:34:31,to play the ashes and so on.
00:34:31,00:34:33,"And the junior batsman, Arthur Chippenfield,"
00:34:33,00:34:37,had to spend almost the entire journey on the steamship
00:34:37,00:34:39,"forging on bats and on cheese a paper,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"the signatures of the rest of the team,"
00:34:41,00:34:43,who couldn't be asked to sign this paper.
00:34:43,00:34:46,"Luckily, that was the last time the Australian team did anything"
00:34:46,00:34:47,fraudulent.
00:34:47,00:34:51,[APPLAUSE]
00:34:51,00:34:58,And we will be touring Australia in May.
00:34:58,00:35:02,"They weren't available, but some of them now come available."
00:35:02,00:35:04,It's really odd.
00:35:04,00:35:05,Wow.
00:35:05,00:35:08,"And there was autograph hunter, quite a famous one,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,in his little area.
00:35:10,00:35:12,He was called Tommy Skullian.
00:35:12,00:35:14,He was an Irish grocery driver.
00:35:14,00:35:19,And his family are in tonight.
00:35:19,00:35:23,He devoted his whole lives to getting autographs.
00:35:23,00:35:26,"He had more than 40,000 in total."
00:35:26,00:35:27,I had Picasso.
00:35:27,00:35:28,He had Franco.
00:35:28,00:35:29,He had Charles Manson.
00:35:29,00:35:30,He had the great wins.
00:35:30,00:35:33,"Oh, so he wasn't discriminating."
00:35:33,00:35:37,In the whole Good V Evil metric.
00:35:37,00:35:41,"I'll be honest, there's not much good in this list."
00:35:41,00:35:43,"But he left a will, in the end, he died quite recently."
00:35:43,00:35:45,"He left a will, and he bequeathed his collection"
00:35:45,00:35:47,to the Village Museum.
00:35:47,00:35:53,"Unfortunately, in his hometown, there was no Village Museum."
00:35:53,00:35:55,So they auctioned it instead.
00:35:57,00:35:59,They have these people have been around so much longer
00:35:59,00:36:01,than I imagined autograph hunters.
00:36:01,00:36:04,So they were particularly prevalent
00:36:04,00:36:06,"in the late 19th century, early 20th century."
00:36:06,00:36:08,And they were thought of as a total scourge.
00:36:08,00:36:10,So if you look back and old newspapers
00:36:10,00:36:14,"from the early 1900s, they're written"
00:36:14,00:36:15,about in such an awful way.
00:36:15,00:36:18,There was an article in New York Times in 1901
00:36:18,00:36:21,that said autograph hunters excel in ways that are dark
00:36:21,00:36:22,and tricks that are vain.
00:36:22,00:36:24,Mark Twain hated them.
00:36:24,00:36:28,Mark Twain had a letter pre-printed that explained his refusal
00:36:28,00:36:29,when people wrote to him for an autograph.
00:36:29,00:36:32,"And the letter explained that if he answered all these requests,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,he wouldn't have time to get anything else done.
00:36:34,00:36:36,"And also, the asking for an autograph"
00:36:36,00:36:38,is asking for example of his writing.
00:36:38,00:36:39,And he's a writer.
00:36:39,00:36:42,So you're asking for example of his own work.
00:36:42,00:36:45,"And he said, it wouldn't be fair to ask a doctor"
00:36:45,00:36:47,"for one of his corpses to remember him by, would it?"
00:36:47,00:36:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:48,00:36:51,What a stupid analogy.
00:36:51,00:36:56,The corpse is another work that doctors produce.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"Well, some very bad doctors."
00:36:57,00:37:00,"Some of them doctors, yeah."
00:37:00,00:37:02,I just made this.
00:37:02,00:37:03,"So you're free to try the mouth, the mouth,"
00:37:03,00:37:07,"the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, and we'll love it."
00:37:07,00:37:11,Two more things about your statement.
00:37:11,00:37:13,"Yes, yes, you are."
00:37:13,00:37:16,"Firstly, sometimes artists can help people with their art."
00:37:16,00:37:18,There was a-- I read that Mozart used to when he
00:37:18,00:37:19,was walking the streets.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"If he came across someone who was homeless,"
00:37:21,00:37:23,"asking him for money, there's one instance"
00:37:23,00:37:25,that's recorded where he didn't have anything on him.
00:37:25,00:37:27,But he was so quick at writing music that he got a paper
00:37:27,00:37:30,"and pen composed a new piece, gave it to the person,"
00:37:30,00:37:32,"and said, there's a music publisher that will give you money"
00:37:32,00:37:34,"for this, so take this there."
00:37:34,00:37:34,That's point number one.
00:37:34,00:37:37,Point number two is that--
00:37:37,00:37:38,"That's amazing, Mozart."
00:37:38,00:37:39,"Yeah, Mozart."
00:37:39,00:37:41,"Yes, yes, someone shouted out, ""Jubian."""
00:37:41,00:37:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:43,00:37:45,"But no, the other thing is that--"
00:37:45,00:37:47,"so you said that Mark Twain said this, sent them this letter"
00:37:47,00:37:49,"saying, I'm not going to sign you a signature."
00:37:49,00:37:52,"Steve Martin, the comedian, actor, he does the same thing,"
00:37:52,00:37:53,but in a positive way.
00:37:53,00:37:55,"So he doesn't do signatures, either."
00:37:55,00:37:57,"What he does is if you meet Steve Martin,"
00:37:57,00:38:00,"he gives you a card, a business card that's pre-signed,"
00:38:00,00:38:03,"and on it is written the words, this certifies"
00:38:03,00:38:06,"that you have had a personal encounter with me,"
00:38:06,00:38:10,"and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent, and funny."
00:38:10,00:38:11,That's great.
00:38:11,00:38:15,And that's what he gives everyone who meets him.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"Last year, there was a collection of Beatles autographs,"
00:38:18,00:38:22,"which sold for £2,000, even though three of them were fake."
00:38:22,00:38:23,OK?
00:38:23,00:38:25,"And the reason they sold for £2,000 is"
00:38:25,00:38:28,that they were all done by John Lennon.
00:38:28,00:38:31,"Oh, cool."
00:38:31,00:38:32,"Because in the early days, sometimes they"
00:38:32,00:38:34,went all there or only one of those who would just fake it.
00:38:34,00:38:35,"Yeah, that's cool."
00:38:35,00:38:38,"So he was doing a prank at the time, because he may blame--"
00:38:38,00:38:40,"Well, he kind of got them almost all right."
00:38:40,00:38:41,"He got George and Ringo bang on, but he"
00:38:41,00:38:43,didn't really bother with Paul.
00:38:43,00:38:45,"Even in the early days, the signs were there of the car."
00:38:45,00:38:48,[LAUGHTER]
00:38:48,00:38:51,I went on to eBay to look for the most expensive autographs
00:38:51,00:38:52,at the moment.
00:38:52,00:38:55,"The most expensive one, when I checked, which was a day ago,"
00:38:55,00:39:01,"was £351,493.85."
00:39:01,00:39:04,"And it was, looks like you're going to guess, Andy."
00:39:04,00:39:06,Is this live or dead?
00:39:06,00:39:06,Dead.
00:39:06,00:39:07,Male or female?
00:39:07,00:39:08,Male.
00:39:08,00:39:08,Thank you.
00:39:08,00:39:09,Him or the eighth?
00:39:09,00:39:10,No.
00:39:10,00:39:12,"Oh, god, god, god, god."
00:39:12,00:39:15,"Oh, god, god."
00:39:15,00:39:17,You've tried the two biggies.
00:39:17,00:39:19,How do you get your guitar list?
00:39:19,00:39:20,You're just not going to guess.
00:39:20,00:39:21,"Oh, OK."
00:39:21,00:39:22,Who is it?
00:39:22,00:39:23,"Actually, I think he's dead."
00:39:23,00:39:24,Hugh Heffner.
00:39:24,00:39:25,"Yes, yes, yes."
00:39:25,00:39:26,He died last year.
00:39:26,00:39:27,"£3,150,000."
00:39:27,00:39:28,"Yeah, yeah."
00:39:28,00:39:28,So he's--
00:39:28,00:39:29,He's a Hugh Heffner.
00:39:29,00:39:30,"I know, I know."
00:39:30,00:39:34,"It's a number one edition of Playboy, with his signature on."
00:39:34,00:39:36,"But that is £351,000."
00:39:36,00:39:39,"Bob Dylan signed handwritten lyrics to Leica Rolling Stone,"
00:39:39,00:39:44,"only £140,597.54."
00:39:44,00:39:45,"It's still a lot of money, guys."
00:39:45,00:39:46,Don't be too outraged.
00:39:46,00:39:50,"It's a lot of people are going, oh, I'm sure, lose change."
00:39:50,00:39:54,"But a fifth, a fifth, the price of the Hugh Heffner one,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,"for £70,000, you can get the Apollo 11 space-flow"
00:39:57,00:40:01,US flag signed by all three astronauts on the Apollo 11.
00:40:01,00:40:06,"All right, that actually we could share between us all of us."
00:40:06,00:40:07,We've been in a tenor each.
00:40:07,00:40:08,We can do it.
00:40:08,00:40:10,And then we'll have to have an incredibly complicated
00:40:10,00:40:13,time share.
00:40:13,00:40:16,"And the lowest prices, £75,000,"
00:40:16,00:40:20,"an EastEnders signed photo of Simon Williams,"
00:40:20,00:40:23,who plays Hugo in EastEnders.
00:40:23,00:40:26,He's actually got an exclamation mark up to it.
00:40:26,00:40:28,"Actually, I've never heard of him."
00:40:28,00:40:31,"We ages ago, when our vinyl came out,"
00:40:31,00:40:36,"we went to a record shop and did a signing at a record shop,"
00:40:36,00:40:39,and we did a few signatures on ones that they hand-sold
00:40:39,00:40:41,that they were going to keep online in their store.
00:40:41,00:40:46,"So we checked if they were still in stock online, they were."
00:40:46,00:40:52,The unsigned vinyl was £19.99.
00:40:52,00:40:57,The signed vinyl was £20.
00:40:57,00:41:01,We are worth between us one penny.
00:41:01,00:41:02,Wow.
00:41:02,00:41:05,[APPLAUSE]
00:41:05,00:41:09,I will be signing that to the show tonight.
00:41:09,00:41:12,"Just on the astronauts, Apollo 11 thing,"
00:41:12,00:41:15,one of the things that was a contingency for the families
00:41:15,00:41:18,"of the Apollo 11 space mission was that Neil Armstrong,"
00:41:18,00:41:21,"Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins signed a lot of signatures"
00:41:21,00:41:24,"to give to their family so that if they didn't make it back,"
00:41:24,00:41:26,the families could sell the signatures
00:41:26,00:41:30,to make money to keep the family going OK.
00:41:30,00:41:32,"They signed hundreds of signatures going,"
00:41:32,00:41:33,"if we don't make it back, sell these."
00:41:33,00:41:36,And this will help my family continue.
00:41:36,00:41:38,Yeah.
00:41:38,00:41:41,Stephen King.
00:41:41,00:41:43,That's very sad.
00:41:43,00:41:44,It's not sad.
00:41:44,00:41:45,They were OK.
00:41:45,00:41:49,"Oh, that's spoiling me."
00:41:49,00:41:52,He's only one type for 30 years.
00:41:52,00:41:55,He's only on Apollo 10.
00:41:55,00:41:58,The next one's really good.
00:41:58,00:42:03,It is one of the few where the sequels get better and better.
00:42:03,00:42:06,We're going to have to wrap up shortly.
00:42:06,00:42:08,There's one amazing story about autographs
00:42:08,00:42:12,that Stephen King tells was watching him give a talk on stage
00:42:12,00:42:15,about this thing that happened when he was 26 years old.
00:42:15,00:42:17,And he'd never been recognized and asked
00:42:17,00:42:18,for an autograph before.
00:42:18,00:42:21,"It was in his early days, and he was in a restaurant."
00:42:21,00:42:23,And he was really sick.
00:42:23,00:42:24,He was really ill.
00:42:24,00:42:25,He had some kind of horrible stomach bug.
00:42:25,00:42:27,And so he had to be really close to the bathrooms at all times.
00:42:27,00:42:30,"And at one point, he had to rush to the bathrooms."
00:42:30,00:42:31,And he went in.
00:42:31,00:42:32,"And I don't know what kind of weird restaurant this was,"
00:42:32,00:42:37,but there were no doors on the bathroom on the toilet stalls.
00:42:37,00:42:40,So he just had to have his stomach complaint
00:42:40,00:42:42,and full view of the rest of the bathroom.
00:42:42,00:42:45,"And so he went in, and he sort of explosively"
00:42:45,00:42:47,shat all into this toilet.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Zombie, zombie."
00:42:48,00:42:51,He'll tell a sign.
00:42:51,00:42:53,"And he did this, and he's feeling terrible."
00:42:53,00:42:55,He was saying he was on this toilet door opening.
00:42:55,00:42:57,Things can't get any worse.
00:42:57,00:42:58,And there was a toilet attendant in there
00:42:58,00:43:00,who he said was about 180 years old.
00:43:00,00:43:04,"And while he was in the middle of this awful experience,"
00:43:04,00:43:06,the toilet attendant came up to him
00:43:06,00:43:08,"with a pallopaper and a pen and said,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,"""On you, Stephen King?"""
00:43:11,00:43:13,"""Come have your autograph please, mate."""
00:43:13,00:43:16,So Stephen King gave his first requested autograph
00:43:16,00:43:18,on the Lou while having diaries.
00:43:18,00:43:22,[APPLAUSE]
00:43:22,00:43:23,Very cool.
00:43:23,00:43:25,Thank you.
00:43:25,00:43:26,"OK, that is it."
00:43:26,00:43:28,That is all of our facts.
