00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
 Hey guys, just before we begin this week's show, we have a little announcement to make,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,440
 which is that we have something for you to look at.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,760
 That's a bit disgusting, aren't we?

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,440
 Well, I wouldn't say so, don't you?

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,320
 It's a bit inappropriate.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,040
 No, it's a wonderful kind of behind-the-scenes video of tall life on a tall.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,800
 A documentary behind the girls.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,080
 Behind the girls, exactly.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,440
 No, why aren't you wearing any trousers?

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,920
 We don't have time to get into that now, and at the point is, we've released this thing.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,120
 And it's our tour, isn't it? We filmed loads of stuff for it, loads of behind-the-scenes

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,320
 interviews and videos of us backstage getting ready.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,280
 Yeah, it was super fun. We had a great time on tour, and we just filmed some of the chats we had,

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,680
 some interviews where you can learn some deep dark secrets from our pasts.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,520
 Childhood photos, that kind of thing.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,400
 Yeah, so it's been available in the UK for a little while.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,480
 So hopefully all you guys have got it, but if you haven't then get it now, but the big news is,

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,560
 it's now available in America, so if you go to Amazon, if you go to Google Play,

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,120
 if you go to iTunes, you'll be able to get hold of it now.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,920
 That's true, or you can just go to qi.com/gills where you'll find all the links.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,600
 Okay, where are my trousers?

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,560
 Oh, no, they're so...

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:22,240
 (music)

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:31,840
 Oh, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weakly Podcast"

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,080
 coming to you this week live from Debra!

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,720
 (applause)

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,160
 My name is Jan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter-Marie,

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,000
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,840
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order,

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,120
 here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,400
 My fact this week is that every competitor at the world's longest dog sled race

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,280
 brings about 600 spare pairs of shoes with them.

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,320
 And they're for the dogs.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,200
 This is amazing, so this is the...

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
 I've did a road race which happens in Alaska every year.

36
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,080
 It's very long, it's roughly a thousand miles through Alaska.

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
 And yeah, the dogs have to wear shoes, and so by the rules of the game,

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,960
 they actually have to bring eight extra shoes on the sled with them.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,160
 So at any one time, there have to be eight pairs of dog shoes on the sled.

40
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,520
 I was going to say on a pair of dog shoes is that four shoes are two shoes.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,400
 I didn't know how to word this, but it's...

42
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,800
 So it's a pair is for the front pair, and then you have a second pair for the back pair,

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,320
 the way I see it, but it basically...

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,160
 Do dogs have different foot sizes on the front sets to the back sets?

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,000
 They actually, they can do, they can do, yeah, sometimes they do, yeah.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
 So if you're buying, if you're buying your dog shoes,

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,160
 then number one you're insane. But number two, you have to get both sides measured.

48
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,920
 What's the biggest difference between the back...

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
 Like there's some dogs with tiny, tiny front paws and a massive back paws.

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,160
 That would be good. Like a penny-farthing, but in dog form.

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,760
 Like a kangaroo on all fours, yeah.

52
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,760
 Yeah. Yeah. I believe not.

53
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,800
 And the facts get in the way, but otherwise pleasing bit of whimsy.

54
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
 Byte, so I didn't actually look that much into the size range of the dog shoes.

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,320
 I will say that the moshes, the guys...

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,000
 We're calling the moshes or moshes.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
 Moshes. So moshes.

58
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,440
 Yeah.

59
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,120
 So these are the due to riding the sled?

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,840
 This is guys riding the sled or the woman who's riding the sled.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,680
 They usually make the dog shoes themselves, so I guess they can tailor into each dog's foot size.

62
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,960
 And like I say, in the rules, per dog you have to have eight extra shoes on board the sled.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,280
 And so yeah, they usually bring over a thousand pairs of shoes, like 13, 14, 100 shoes.

64
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,720
 And then the dogs have to drag the weights of those shoes, as well, don't they?

65
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,760
 I guess. Yeah, they do kind of change them like that, though.

66
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,960
 So you know, in Formula One, you have pit stops where you're going to get filled out with petrol.

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,840
 But that's what happens. You have your pit stops on the sled race.

68
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,440
 Where you go and you have to change your dog shoes.

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,040
 That's amazing. They bring the guys at the side.

70
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
 They're bringing 16 trees for the dog to piss again.

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:27,200
 Some drivers, moshes, rather, they bring 3,000 little booties for the kids.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,680
 Because you've got 16 dogs pulling each sled, I think that's right, so that's 64 feet.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,880
 Yeah, yeah.

74
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,520
 What happens? Do they lose their shoe on the run or do they wear through?

75
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
 Why do they need to change so much?

76
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
 It gets worn through.

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,240
 So the reason they have shoes, it's not because of the colder.

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
 Anything dogs feet are very good at managing the cold, so it's totally covered in ice and snow.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,200
 But the reason they need it is for the kind of lumps and bumps and the grit and the sharp bits of ice

80
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,640
 that might get stuck in their paws.

81
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,320
 And so that wears away at the shoes and just, you know, they're running pretty hardcore.

82
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
 That's cool. That's fun.

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,720
 I read a really cool thing about the, because this is a big event that happens annually.

84
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
 And it brings people from all over the planet to come and compete.

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,640
 And in 2010, the event saw its first ever Jamaican team entering it.

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,240
 Oh, yeah.

87
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
 Yeah, he's, yeah, he's called The Mushroom Mon.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
 That's what he calls himself.

89
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
 And he, yeah, he's been competing for years.

90
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,040
 That's a nickname, isn't it?

91
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
 Yeah, no, it's his. He calls himself.

92
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,880
 That's his nickname, yeah. That's cool.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,360
 Yeah.

94
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
 It's just, because I thought there was one guy called Newton Marshall.

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,280
 That's him. That's him.

96
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
 So, you know, the amazing thing about Newton Marshall is such a cool story.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,920
 So basically, in 2014, there was another sledar called Scott Janssen.

98
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,520
 And he came off his sled and he was really, really badly injured, but he was off the track.

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,440
 And he didn't know if anyone was going to find him.

100
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,920
 And Newton Marshall came by on his sled and he noticed that this sled had been overturned

101
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
 and that someone was really badly injured.

102
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
 Like, he'd been seriously concast, he'd broken his ankle.

103
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,240
 And so he went and he saved him.

104
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,640
 This guy called Newton Marshall went and he raised the alarm

105
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,320
 and he sort of made him a little bed in the snow.

106
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,480
 And they waited for him to be saved.

107
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
 And he was rescued, he was fine.

108
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,040
 So that was what Newton Marshall did.

109
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,360
 But the bizarre thing about this is that two years earlier in the same race,

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
 Scott Janssen's dog had collapsed.

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,200
 And he'd had to revive him with mouth to snout resuscitation.

112
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,920
 So he'd been as good as dead for five minutes.

113
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,680
 And Scott Janssen is a funeral home director.

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,640
 So he said, I know what dead looks like.

115
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,440
 That dog was dead, but he gave him mouth to snout.

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,080
 And the bizarre thing about this is that the dog was called Marshall.

117
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
 So he saved a Marshall.

118
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
 What are you suggesting?

119
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
 I genuinely don't know.

120
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,480
 I think what I'm clearly missing is the dog Marshall has been reincarnated

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,040
 in the person Marshall who's then come to save him as a thank you for saving the dog.

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,560
 So it could subsequently die from this.

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,760
 I know.

124
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,560
 And Newton, the human will be, you know, one year old.

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
 He wouldn't be in, I think.

126
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,000
 We got to know all the answers.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
 Also, I find it a bit weird that just because he works at a funeral home this guy,

128
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
 that he should be good at mouth to mouth resuscitation.

129
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,360
 And people brought him and he's like, we can still save him.

130
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,760
 Give me five minutes.

131
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,840
 I wouldn't trust that guy.

132
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,520
 My favorite, my favorite musher is a guy called John Souter.

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,720
 And he thought, you know what, all these guys are doing it wrong with these huskies.

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,920
 I'm going to do it with poodles.

135
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,680
 And so he got some poodles to carry his sled or to pull his sled along.

136
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,920
 He got them, he brought them up with huskies.

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
 So they kind of learned what to do with the huskies.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,560
 But unfortunately, they all got frozen feet.

139
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,520
 Because the huskies have got special padding, haven't they?

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,280
 And now it's banned and you have to have only certain types of dog that you're allowed.

141
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,440
 There used to be that you could have any dog you wanted.

142
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,400
 But truly, there weren't many winners from the Chihuahua team.

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,760
 Do you know what the idea for what it's based on?

144
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,160
 It's based on an event which happened in 1925 called The Great Race of Mercy.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,760
 And this was a real crisis.

146
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,200
 So there was a town in Nome which had an epidemic of death area and it was beginning.

147
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,840
 And it was, you know, people were starting to die.

148
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,960
 A few people had already died.

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,600
 And the nearest anti-toxin was a thousand miles away.

150
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,720
 In 1925, there were only three planes in the whole of Alaska

151
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,040
 and they were elderly, unreliable biplanes.

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,240
 So they couldn't be guaranteed to get there.

153
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,280
 So they went with dogs.

154
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,800
 And there were hero dogs and hero musherers who got the anti-toxin a thousand miles to the town of Nome.

155
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,320
 And the guy who approved this, the governor of Alaska who approved this.

156
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,520
 His name was Scott Bone.

157
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,560
 So there's a coincidence.

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,480
 I'm not saying he was a reincarnated dog.

159
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
 [LAUGHTER]

160
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
 And afterwards, the lead dog, Balto.

161
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
 He became a celebrity.

162
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,120
 He was as famous as Rinton Tin or Lassie or all these other celebrity dogs of the 1920s.

163
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,440
 And the mayor of Los Angeles awarded Balto a bone-shaped key to the city.

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,240
 [LAUGHTER]

165
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,880
 Oh, please.

166
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,320
 [LAUGHTER]

167
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,280
 I've got a couple of favourites, favourites, races.

168
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,320
 So this is two people, a guy called Dallas and a guy called Mitch,

169
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
 their father and son.

170
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,520
 And they seem to have this ongoing rivalry.

171
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,360
 So in 2012, Dallas Ceevy became the youngest winner.

172
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,280
 He was 25 years old and he won it.

173
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,720
 In 2013, his father became the oldest ever winner.

174
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,240
 This went on.

175
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,880
 So Dallas kept on winning it year after year.

176
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,480
 In 2016, he broke the record for the fastest time it's ever been done.

177
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,800
 So he did it in eight days and 11 hours.

178
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,040
 And in 2017, the following year, his dad broke the record again in eight days and three hours.

179
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,000
 And actually, that year, the son Dallas's dogs turned out to be doped.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
 Now, they were weirdly, they were doped with a tramadol,

181
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,160
 which everyone agreed would not be of any benefit at all.

182
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,840
 [LAUGHTER]

183
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,080
 Surely they'd get a nice night's sleep at the end of the day.

184
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,600
 [LAUGHTER]

185
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
 But yeah, I should say his father was not a suspect

186
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
 for doping his son's dogs or anything.

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
 But this year, he decided he didn't want to do it, right?

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,520
 Because they said that, basically, he doped his dogs.

189
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,800
 He said, I definitely didn't do it.

190
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,840
 Someone else must have done it.

191
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,120
 And he wasn't happy about it.

192
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
 And now he's kind of pulled out.

193
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,440
 Oh, is that why he didn't do it?

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,400
 I believe so, yeah.

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,560
 And it was done so much lower this year.

196
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
 It was like nine days, something.

197
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
 It was rubbish.

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
 Yeah, what would they do?

199
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,960
 But actually, I should just say, a lot of people don't like the dog sledding,

200
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,440
 don't they?

201
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,880
 They think it's kind of cruel.

202
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
 Because a lot of the dogs get sick.

203
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,920
 Some of them die.

204
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,560
 We all die.

205
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,040
 [LAUGHTER]

206
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,480
 Well, how did you like to pull a sled?

207
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,440
 Well, the old guy.

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
 He might as well just pull a fucking sled.

209
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,800
 I'm just saying, life is hard.

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,640
 It's a lot harder if you're pulling a sled.

211
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,760
 That's a good point, sorry, yeah.

212
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,400
 Well, the other thing is, there's lots of things that can happen there.

213
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,200
 I mean, they do die.

214
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,840
 One of the worst things they get is scrotal and penile frostbite.

215
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,160
 Wow.

216
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,040
 OK.

217
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,520
 Yeah?

218
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,640
 There's a frostbite.

219
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,080
 No, I'd like to announce, I'm pulling out of the next day as a general.

220
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,360
 And then I thought I would check to see if humans can get frostbite.

221
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,560
 On the penises.

222
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,160
 Because I just didn't trust you.

223
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
 I just didn't trust you.

224
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,920
 That's why you went to Iceland.

225
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,320
 [LAUGHTER]

226
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,200
 The zoo's all gone off.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,880
 Not why mom shops there.

228
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,160
 Well, apparently, according to the internet,

229
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,040
 the classic account of humans getting frostbite on their genitals

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,560
 is from the New England Journal of Medicine in 1977.

231
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,240
 And there's a doctor called Melvin Hirschkowitz.

232
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,440
 And he went running in very cold weather.

233
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,600
 And he got that.

234
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,760
 And it's notable.

235
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,240
 The paper is notable because, once he writes about what happened,

236
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,560
 and at one stage, his wife comes home and finds him standing

237
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,320
 legs apart in the bedroom, nude below the waist,

238
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,800
 holding the tip of his penis in his right hand,

239
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,600
 and turning the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine.

240
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,280
 [LAUGHTER]

241
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,280
 I was just looking up weird dog competitions.

242
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,240
 And there's a magazine called Veterinary Practice News.

243
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,520
 And it has an annual x-ray competition awarded

244
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,480
 to dogs who eat in the weirdest things.

245
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,040
 So recently, one of the winners was Lola, a seven-kilototus,

246
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,080
 who'd eaten a turtle pendant.

247
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,120
 But--

248
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,920
 I think it took.

249
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
 Is our dogs, are they?

250
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,120
 No, sorry, it was just pett, just pett.

251
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,880
 Oh, right.

252
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,360
 I mean, we're things, sorry.

253
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,920
 But my favorite one was the Rotweiler.

254
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,680
 I want to see one pulling the sled.

255
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,920
 [LAUGHTER]

256
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:32,120
 My favorite one of these winners was the Rotweiler,

257
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,760
 who had swallowed her own as wristwatch.

258
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,720
 But the alarm was still on, telling her when

259
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,080
 to take her insulin.

260
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,280
 So she had to listen to the dog to find the one to take her pedals.

261
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,840
 [LAUGHTER]

262
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,840
 All right, it is time for fact number two.

263
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
 And that is my fact.

264
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,000
 My fact this week is that 3,000 feet up a mountain in France

265
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,440
 is a block of sandstone commemorating the exact spot

266
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,760
 where the author Victor Hugo's parents conceived him.

267
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,680
 [LAUGHTER]

268
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,800
 Yeah, it's--

269
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,440
 this was revealed that that was the spot where it happened

270
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,240
 in a letter written by his dad, who bragged about it a lot.

271
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,880
 It was at the top of this mountain, called Mount Denon,

272
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,880
 in France, and he made it to the top.

273
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,080
 And it was years later, this wasn't done in his lifetime,

274
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,440
 but years later, a museum curator thought,

275
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,680
 I've got to commemorate this and brought a sandstone.

276
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,560
 And it's there to this day.

277
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,840
 It was kind of a prank, wasn't it?

278
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,720
 By the guy from the museum in the '60s, was it?

279
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,840
 I think it was like a practical joke in the 1960s.

280
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,640
 But did you know that Victor Hugo denied

281
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,720
 that that was where it happened?

282
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,560
 Because he was kind of ashamed of this mountain,

283
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,280
 big amount, and that wasn't super famous,

284
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,320
 not everyone knew about it.

285
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,240
 So whenever he retold the story of when he was conceived,

286
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,440
 as we all do, he made lots of little changes.

287
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,800
 So there'd been a Celtic temple on Mount Denon,

288
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
 and he changed that to a Roman temple of love.

289
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,880
 And he changed the mountain range to the Alps,

290
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
 because everyone's heard of the Alps.

291
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,640
 And he made it Montblanc, because that's 3,000 feet taller.

292
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
 And so his version, he was a storyteller.

293
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
 That was what he did.

294
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,600
 Yeah, you run at the risk of frostbite to the scrotum.

295
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
 If you try to conceive of that altitude.

296
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,120
 [LAUGHTER]

297
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,320
 He did-- he told a lot of stories, obviously.

298
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
 Namely little.

299
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,840
 He knew his room.

300
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,040
 Yeah, fine, fine.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,200
 He claimed that he and his wife, Adele,

302
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,880
 had sex nine times on their wedding night.

303
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,080
 And the telegraph wrote that, apparently,

304
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,720
 she lost her taste for intercourse after that first night.

305
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,640
 And I'm not surprised.

306
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,480
 Well, he was a sex addict, wasn't he?

307
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
 Yes.

308
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,720
 He was constantly going to brothels.

309
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,920
 He almost had a sort of, like, breakfast

310
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,160
 sex and then lunchtime sex and dinner sex.

311
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,120
 There was almost a menu on a day-to-day basis with Victor Hugo,

312
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
 to the point that he was so popular amongst the brothels of Paris

313
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,240
 that when he died, the brothels of Paris

314
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,520
 closed down for the day so that everyone working there

315
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,200
 could come to the funeral procession to pay tribute.

316
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,360
 I read one account, and I'm not sure this can be true.

317
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,400
 But the prostitutes of Paris draped their vaginas

318
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,680
 in black, crepe paper.

319
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,440
 [LAUGHTER]

320
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:24,680
 That's according to a guy called Edmund Gonca,

321
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,360
 who was there at the time of the world.

322
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,840
 How did he know?

323
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
 He can't have tested them all.

324
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,920
 But what happened was, when he died,

325
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,160
 everyone thought he was going to die.

326
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,400
 And then he kind of stuck around for a few weeks.

327
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,960
 And so people came to Paris, expecting for him to die,

328
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,640
 and they were going to celebrate his life.

329
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,440
 But it went so long.

330
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,280
 More and more and more people came.

331
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,760
 And in the end, there were a crowd of 2 million people

332
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,640
 at this funeral, which was more than the normal population

333
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,400
 of Paris.

334
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
 Wow.

335
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,480
 It was rammed.

336
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,400
 And everyone-- because he was like a famous sex addict

337
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,000
 or whatever, and he was a partier, everyone just got drunk.

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,240
 Everyone had sex.

339
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,800
 There was this story that always happens

340
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,440
 that people say that nine months later,

341
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,600
 there were loads of babies born.

342
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,280
 So people were saying that during the funeral,

343
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,680
 everyone was just having sex everywhere.

344
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,480
 There was a parade at his funeral,

345
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,920
 and it took six hours for it to get to the end.

346
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
 And there were delegations of different professions there.

347
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,480
 So there were veterans, civil servants, writers, animal lovers,

348
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,160
 a schoolchildren, suffrageers.

349
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,200
 Sorry, can we give it back?

350
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,640
 What-- his-- was animal lover a formal profession?

351
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
 No.

352
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,720
 Who's paying for that?

353
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:46,800
 But apparently, the suffrageers got really annoyed,

354
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,360
 because they were behind the gymnasts in the department stores.

355
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,320
 They said, we deserve better than this.

356
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,160
 Wow, but it was just after his 79th birthday.

357
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,400
 So he had an 80th birthday party on his 79th birthday

358
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,280
 as he was entering his 80th year.

359
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,760
 And for that one, half a million people just walked past his house

360
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,880
 as he sat outside waving at them.

361
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,200
 And then the next day, because that was his apartment in Paris,

362
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,640
 they changed the street name from where he was living.

363
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,720
 So it got changed to become avenue Victor Hugo.

364
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,160
 So his remaining days, he lived on the street

365
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,440
 named after him, and he would say that he would--

366
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,400
 he wanted all the future mail that came to him

367
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,920
 to be addressed to Mr. Victor in his avenue, Paris.

368
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,680
 And that would make it to him.

369
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,840
 He said he wanted a pauper's burial, a pauper's funeral,

370
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,800
 and he obviously had the complete opposite.

371
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
 But I'm not totally convinced he wants it.

372
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,880
 There's one biography of him, which kind of seems

373
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,600
 to suggest that he was obviously famous for being

374
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,120
 a proponent of helping out the poor.

375
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,080
 And then Mr. Arbor has all about the awful conditions

376
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
 people lived in.

377
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,480
 But he really liked people to know it.

378
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,760
 So for instance, apparently, he liked people

379
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,600
 to ask him why he was wearing his coat inside out.

380
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,120
 Because then he'd say to them, I just wear it inside out

381
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,280
 rather than buying a new one.

382
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,440
 And then I can give that money to the poor.

383
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,320
 And he really-- he really liked to invite this kind of worker.

384
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,020
 [LAUGHTER]

385
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,920
 I know, right?

386
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,480
 Apparently, according to this person,

387
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,200
 he actually left in his will what the biographer

388
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,480
 describes as an "exeguous summer," a very small amount

389
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,000
 in his will to the poor, because he knew how rumours work.

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,080
 And he knew that that would become an enormous amount

391
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
 within a short amount of time.

392
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,040
 [LAUGHTER]

393
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,540
 Sorry.

394
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,720
 He was so famous when he was living in Guernsey,

395
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,080
 that admirers would save the pebbles

396
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,920
 that he walked upon when he was walking across the beach.

397
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,760
 Wow.

398
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
 So they would be like, he's still on that one.

399
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
 I'll take that.

400
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,040
 Wow.

401
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:40,720
 Yeah.

402
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,560
 Apparently.

403
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,320
 I mean, it doesn't sound very true, does it?

404
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,120
 Is it from-- did he tell us that?

405
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,640
 Or--

406
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,320
 It's hard to tell.

407
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
 He was kind of-- he was paid in a very unusual way,

408
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,680
 for the lamez, because he said, I think,

409
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,880
 to his publisher-- his publisher said, how much do you want?

410
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,440
 And he made him a quite a high offer.

411
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,560
 And he said, no, that's not enough.

412
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,280
 And he said, I think he said, I'd like to be paid more than anyone else

413
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,640
 has ever been paid to write a book.

414
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,960
 I'll give some to the poor.

415
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,880
 But the publisher didn't have the money to pay.

416
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,800
 It was, I think, equivalent of about 3 million pounds,

417
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
 which is a huge amount of money.

418
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,760
 And the publisher didn't have that money.

419
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,480
 So he had to borrow all of that from a bank.

420
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,600
 So it was kind of a private finance initiative novel, basically.

421
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,320
 And then the publisher just borrowed in the assumption

422
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,080
 that it would pay off.

423
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,800
 And it did.

424
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 Yeah, it was huge, wasn't it?

425
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,880
 When it was published, people turned up with wheelbarrows

426
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,120
 to buy copies of it.

427
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:27,640
 What?

428
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,120
 How big was it?

429
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,880
 It is a big book.

430
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,840
 [LAUGHTER]

431
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,600
 And wheelbarrows at the time were very small.

432
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 Yeah.

433
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,240
 But what happened is you would go in.

434
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,600
 If you were a worker, and you could get some time off,

435
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,720
 and you could afford to get the book,

436
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,680
 and you could queue up and get there in time with your wheelbarrow,

437
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,800
 then you could sell it to your friends.

438
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,200
 And you could make a massive profit on it.

439
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,760
 It was like a ticket town to kind of think, yeah, wow.

440
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,080
 He wasn't quite arrogant, though, wasn't he?

441
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,400
 That was it.

442
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
 He wanted to be paid all the money in the world.

443
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,920
 And he used to-- he was a party animal.

444
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,320
 So he apparently used to have 30 guests

445
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,040
 surrounded in every single night, right up until he was 80,

446
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,080
 when he died.

447
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,840
 But he then did at these big dinner parties.

448
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,280
 He used to spend the whole time talking about how great he was.

449
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,400
 He would say, there is only one classical writer

450
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,480
 in this country.

451
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,400
 One, do you hear me?

452
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,720
 I am the only one.

453
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,560
 I know the French language better than anyone else alive.

454
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,520
 And then he was better.

455
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
 Sorry, I just asked if you wanted red or white one.

456
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,040
 [LAUGHTER]

457
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,120
 And then he'd catalog all like Bullsack and Racine

458
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,120
 and all the other great writers

459
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,880
 and explain why they were not as good as he was.

460
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,000
 There was one time when he wouldn't talk about himself

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,840
 in these parties.

462
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
 And that was when he did his party trick,

463
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,720
 which was putting a whole orange into his mouth,

464
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,320
 and then thrusting as many pieces of sugar as possible

465
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,520
 into his cheeks, and then scrunching it all up,

466
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,800
 swallowing two liquor glasses of kish,

467
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,960
 and then opening his mouth and saying, I've just eaten it all.

468
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,880
 So now this is tricky.

469
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,960
 Could it eat an orange and a lotus sugar really quickly?

470
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,800
 Oh, awesome.

471
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,760
 And people still talk about his novel, or something.

472
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

473
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,840
 The guy who wrote the lyrics for the musical of Les Mis,

474
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,360
 he was a guy called James Fenton.

475
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
 He wrote the first lyrics, lots of people.

476
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,640
 I had it how to get out of the lyrics.

477
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,320
 But when he was given the book and told,

478
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
 hey, why don't you have a look at the lyrics

479
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,160
 for this turning this novel into lyrics.

480
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,480
 He was on a three-month trip looking for headhunters in Borneo.

481
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,080
 And it was a really heavy book.

482
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,680
 And he said that he spent three months in a canoe,

483
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,280
 reading Les Mis, and every time he finished a chapter,

484
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,520
 he threw it to the crocodile,

485
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,040
 so he could save a bit of weight in the canoe.

486
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,200
 That's very cool.

487
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,280
 Did you know he trended on Twitter in 2014

488
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,520
 for a kind of related reason?

489
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,960
 So he trended on Twitter and not in a good way.

490
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,640
 It turned out, the BBC reported this,

491
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,880
 that he was suddenly Victor Hugo was receiving

492
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
 all these death threats on Twitter.

493
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,880
 And he was being called, lots of stuff.

494
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,160
 He was called the son of a prostitute.

495
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,440
 His daughter was called a big bitch.

496
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:58,480
 And it turned out what happened was one of his poems

497
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,080
 had been set in a French baccalaureate exam.

498
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,520
 And they were so annoyed about it.

499
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,640
 Because it's so factual that all the students

500
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,480
 got online afterwards.

501
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,880
 They got him trending.

502
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 Isn't that--

503
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,760
 I think you know you've made it when you're getting death threats

504
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
 on Twitter 200 years.

505
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 [LAUGHTER]

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,040
 OK, it's time to move on to fact number three.

507
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,600
 And that is James.

508
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,120
 OK, my fact this week is in the event of a zombie apocalypse,

509
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,800
 only one country will survive.

510
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,320
 And that country is North Korea.

511
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
 Really?

512
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,200
 Yeah.

513
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,560
 So this is a study by some mathematicians in Brazil.

514
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,880
 And they've kind of done a model of what's going to happen.

515
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,720
 And it's going to be like a straight fight between human and zombie.

516
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,560
 And the zombie's always going to win.

517
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,520
 But if you get a human with a gun, like in the army,

518
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,920
 then the human might win.

519
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,520
 And they've worked out that what you're going to need

520
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,360
 is 47 soldiers per 1,000 capital in order to survive.

521
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,400
 And there's only one country with that many people.

522
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,240
 And that is North Korea.

523
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,880
 And they have also the advantage

524
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,840
 of being completely separate from everyone else.

525
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,320
 So it's going to be difficult for the zombies to get in.

526
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,160
 The borders are very guarded and stuff like that.

527
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,560
 So if the zombies come, that's where it's the best place to go.

528
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,240
 Oh, right.

529
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,160
 In all of the circumstances, I don't love that.

530
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:21,120
 I was reading, my assumption is, if you were killed by a zombie,

531
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,800
 it would be through your brains being eaten and you being attacked.

532
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,920
 According to Max Brooks, Max Brooks is an author who

533
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,400
 wrote the zombie survival guide.

534
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,720
 He wrote the movie World War Z, the book

535
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,920
 or other World War Z, which was made into the Brad Pitt movie.

536
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,760
 So he studied in a very serious way

537
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,160
 what he thought would be the way that you would be most likely

538
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,880
 to die in a zombie apocalypse.

539
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,480
 And his main reason for anyone's death

540
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,440
 is that you would die from explosive diarrhea.

541
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,040
 And it's because water would become so scarce

542
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,080
 that you would be forced to drink from puddles.

543
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,960
 Puddles are very dangerous to get water from.

544
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,600
 You can see why they don't make most of the zombie films

545
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:01,640
 about the whole explosive diarrhea puddle issue.

546
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,640
 Yeah.

547
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,600
 I wouldn't want to.

548
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
 I did look up, because there are so many zombie films.

549
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,560
 And they're quite cheap to make, obviously,

550
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,760
 because all you need is some willing extras with a load of makeup on.

551
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,720
 And a load of them are quite low quality.

552
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,480
 But I went through a list of all the zombie films I could find online.

553
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,120
 I just wanted to share a few of the titles, because they're great.

554
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,320
 So there are classic things like boy, eat, girl, free, clever.

555
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,840
 There's erotic nights of the living dead.

556
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,880
 There's flights of the living dead, which is a plane-based zombie film.

557
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 My favorite one is--

558
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,840
 I like the explosive diarrhea one.

559
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,480
 The shites of the living dead.

560
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,360
 I've got a third one.

561
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,440
 It's not as good as that.

562
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,920
 It's called "Poltery Guysed Night of the Chicken Dead."

563
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:57,280
 A tiny little nugget about the World War Z movie, by the way,

564
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,720
 that was made, which is just a cool bit of trivia, which

565
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,800
 is that one of the actors in the movie was Peter Capaldi.

566
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,960
 And Peter Capaldi was cast as a World Health Organization Doctor.

567
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,640
 So he was a whew, Doctor.

568
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,880
 And what it was is that the filmmakers had

569
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
 inside knowledge that he was going to be announced as the Doctor.

570
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,120
 This was before Doctor Who.

571
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,240
 And so it's a subtle, like Easter Egg here.

572
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,280
 Oh, and none of us guessed based on that.

573
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,200
 We should have known these stories in the face.

574
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,840
 People at scientists and people at universities

575
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:38,400
 are always writing analyses of what happens in a zombie apocalypse.

576
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,960
 It happens really in a lot of places.

577
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,400
 And I think it's kind of a way of engaging people

578
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,880
 when making something sound fun.

579
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,640
 When actually, it's a paper about statistical projections.

580
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,400
 That could be fun, Ella.

581
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,480
 Which, for a lot of people, is fun.

582
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,040
 But one example of this was the University of Ottawa

583
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,520
 a few years ago, published a paper with an equation in it,

584
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,120
 explaining how fast we'd have to deal with the zombie apocalypse.

585
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,480
 So the paper's called, when zombies attack,

586
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,240
 mathematical modeling of an outbreak of zombie infection.

587
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,800
 And one of the papers authors, the professor in charge,

588
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,120
 was called Robert J. Smith, question mark.

589
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,320
 And it turns out that the guy here at this paper

590
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,640
 has put a question mark on the end of his name.

591
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,560
 And I looked him up.

592
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,200
 And if you go to his academic page on the website at the university,

593
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
 he says, yeah, that's not a typo.

594
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,440
 I really do have a question mark on the end of my name.

595
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,160
 Do you have any idea what it's like to live with such an incredibly

596
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,280
 common name that you'll never ever show up on Google?

597
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,400
 [LAUGHTER]

598
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,040
 I had to do something.

599
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,120
 How do you think he pronounced his it?

600
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,520
 Did his Robert Smith?

601
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,200
 [LAUGHTER]

602
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,880
 Or Smith?

603
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,560
 Definitely.

604
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,520
 Oh, he might just say question mark at the end, maybe.

605
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,120
 Yeah.

606
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
 But he then also says, I did go to his page.

607
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,120
 I saw this as well.

608
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,680
 He then follows up by saying, how do you stick out on Google?

609
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,320
 He then goes, actually, you still don't stick out on Google

610
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,000
 when you put it on your mark.

611
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,280
 So it hasn't really worked.

612
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,320
 I like the other one who he wanted to stick out

613
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,920
 against, who is Robert Smith.

614
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,120
 [LAUGHTER]

615
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:11,120
 I've got a bit of good news in the zombie world to come.

616
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,720
 Oh, good.

617
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,920
 We're going to win.

618
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,760
 It's going to be fine.

619
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,000
 It's going to be absolutely fine.

620
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,040
 We're going to win within about a week, guys.

621
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,080
 OK, there's someone booth.

622
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,320
 There's like a bit of a weird zombie wall.

623
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,120
 How many of the priorities, mate?

624
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,960
 So there's an article by a scientist

625
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,120
 called David Misagewski.

626
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,720
 And he said that nature would destroy zombies

627
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
 before they could destroy us.

628
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,440
 So obviously, all animals will be packing away at them.

629
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:34,960
 They're dead.

630
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,600
 They're not very fast with the reactions.

631
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,440
 But the main thing is microorganisms

632
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,040
 would go to town on them.

633
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,520
 Bacteria, fungi, molds, insects, flesh-eating beetles.

634
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,200
 I think it's a bit cocky for you to say,

635
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,280
 we're going to win in that situation.

636
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,200
 [LAUGHTER]

637
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,600
 Allies in the microorganism world will join us

638
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,960
 in a coalition of the live.

639
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,320
 That's a really good point.

640
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,360
 That's such good logic.

641
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,760
 They can decompose a rabbit right down to the bones in a week.

642
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,640
 So they'll go to town on these things.

643
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,360
 Misagewski, he did say that in his kind of world,

644
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,640
 animals can't get the same disease that humans were getting.

645
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,560
 Do you know what I mean?

646
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,680
 So the animals can't become zombies in his kind of idea.

647
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,880
 If the animals can become zombies as well,

648
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,400
 then it's a whole different ballgame.

649
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,280
 If you're getting attacked by zombie microwarkers,

650
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,720
 that is not a great movie either.

651
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
 I must admit, but there's someone else

652
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,160
 who's published advice on how to escape zombies.

653
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,840
 How to survive a zombie attack is the CDC,

654
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,440
 the Center for Disease Control in America.

655
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
 And this was obviously kind of a PR thing

656
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,920
 to try and get people actually onto their website.

657
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,280
 So they learned how to survive genuine crises.

658
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,240
 But it's quite funny, because if you do go to the site now,

659
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,480
 they've got a zombie preparedness page,

660
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,760
 a zombie preparedness blog.

661
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,000
 They've got a zombie preparedness booklet for educators

662
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,920
 that they will send out.

663
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,520
 But they don't really conceal their true purpose very well.

664
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,640
 So the tips they give are things like,

665
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
 stock up on water, food, and other supplies

666
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,040
 to get you through the first couple of days

667
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,560
 before you can locate a zombie-free refugee camp.

668
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,280
 Brackets or, in the case of a natural disaster,

669
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,480
 it will buy you some time to get to an evacuation shelter

670
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,480
 or until utility lines are restored, close brackets.

671
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,680
 It's always like, you know, first aid supplies,

672
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 in case that horrible zombie bites you.

673
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,080
 Also, we'll come in handy in a tornado or a hurricane.

674
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,080
 LAUGHTER

675
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,480
 And one other thing that might help us if the zombies attack

676
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,480
 to win is the reverse zombie tick.

677
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
 Cool.

678
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,320
 OK, this is an animal, a little tick.

679
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,480
 And if it bites you, it makes you allergic to meat.

680
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,200
 And so the idea is what we might do

681
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,840
 is kind of work out what makes that happen.

682
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,720
 And then we can inject it into the zombies,

683
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,040
 make them allergic to eating us, and then we're saved.

684
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,240
 But just because the zombies got hives,

685
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,040
 doesn't mean that you're not then a zombie.

686
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
 Yeah.

687
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
 Wait.

688
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,040
 LAUGHTER

689
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
 How?

690
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,440
 Do you guys know that zombies make an appearance

691
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,280
 in Amazon's terms and services conditions?

692
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,280
 You know that when you go and you sign that massive 26,000 words?

693
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
 Yeah, we all read it.

694
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,280
 But then you, oh, then this won't be a surprise.

695
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,520
 Someone did read the whole thing, and they discovered

696
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,880
 that there's a passage in it, which reads, however,

697
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
 so that it just comes into this.

698
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,040
 However, this restriction will not apply

699
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,400
 in the event of the occurrence of a widespread viral infection

700
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,320
 transmitted via bites or contact with bubbly fluids

701
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,840
 that cause human corpses to reanimate

702
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,480
 and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain,

703
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,600
 or nerve tissue, and is likely to result

704
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,560
 in the fall of organized civilization.

705
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,120
 That's in Amazon's actual terms.

706
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
 That's very funny.

707
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,320
 And conditions, yeah.

708
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,800
 It feels like they're testing us to check we're reading them.

709
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
 Exactly.

710
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,440
 And as the news of the last two months has told us,

711
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,320
 nobody has read any of them.

712
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,200
 Oh, we need to move on shortly.

713
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,400
 There is just on animal zombie sort of parasites

714
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,400
 and the way they spread.

715
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,600
 There is a flight called Apocephalus Borealis,

716
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
 and it lays eggs inside bumblebees.

717
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,240
 And the amazing thing is that the infected bee

718
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,160
 then stops working, and it starts acting like a moth.

719
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 It starts being flying around lights and this kind of thing,

720
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,560
 while the other parasite is preparing to burst out, basically.

721
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,520
 But that means that there are zom bees.

722
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
 [LAUGHTER]

723
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,600
 Oh!

724
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,920
 Yeah, that's good.

725
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,600
 [APPLAUSE]

726
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,960
 Very cool.

727
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,240
 It's a very forgiving audience tonight.

728
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,200
 OK, it is time for our final fact to the show.

729
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,760
 And that is Andy.

730
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,640
 My fact is that the 1930s actor, George Arles,

731
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,680
 once booked himself into the left luggage

732
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,520
 office at Charring Cross as a parcel

733
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,760
 in order to escape people who wanted his autograph.

734
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,720
 [LAUGHTER]

735
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,120
 What a guy I'd never had of this guy before.

736
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,800
 But he was very famous at the time.

737
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,480
 And he wrote in his memoir that he was being chased

738
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,360
 by people who were desperate for his autograph.

739
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,280
 And so he said, with presence of mind

740
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,800
 worthy of a great general, I thought

741
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
 that left luggage office.

742
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,280
 It was just behind me, close to the platform.

743
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,440
 I turned to the man in charge and demanded the right to book

744
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,080
 myself in as a parcel.

745
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,360
 I paid my two pints, and the man took me over the counter.

746
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,680
 And I was saved.

747
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
 [LAUGHTER]

748
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,160
 Well, he took him over the counter.

749
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,760
 [LAUGHTER]

750
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,160
 It's amazing what you could get for two pennies in those days.

751
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,160
 [LAUGHTER]

752
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
 He was-- I hadn't heard of him either.

753
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,280
 And he was very famous in his time.

754
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,160
 He was the first British actor to ever win an Academy

755
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,880
 award for a leading actor.

756
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,720
 Yes, he won it as well for playing Benjamin Disraeli,

757
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,080
 the British Prime Minister.

758
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,920
 And he then won it again for years later for playing Benjamin

759
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,480
 Disraeli.

760
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,920
 He played the same role and got given it twice.

761
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,880
 He was the first person to do that reprising a role

762
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,360
 and getting it a second time.

763
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,080
 And was that-- one was silent, wasn't it?

764
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,720
 And then the other one was a talky thing.

765
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,640
 Yeah, that's right.

766
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,360
 And he also, Victor Hugoly, was very

767
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,560
 egotistical as well.

768
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,840
 He had to do a court appearance once.

769
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,120
 He was called to a just a court hearing

770
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,360
 and get to give a testament.

771
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,280
 And he called himself the world's greatest living actor.

772
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,000
 And to explain his statement, he said, you see, I'm on oath.

773
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,360
 So he was a real kind of dick.

774
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,640
 [LAUGHTER]

775
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,200
 I really like Victor Hugoly.

776
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,400
 [LAUGHTER]

777
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,920
 There was one other instance of his egotism

778
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,160
 that I read about was in a film called "The Man Who

779
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,520
 Played God," which was about a concert pianist who then

780
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,840
 fell on hard times.

781
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
 But he stuck to the script totally,

782
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,960
 except there was one bit of the script where the line was--

783
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,680
 someone came up to the pianist after the show

784
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,080
 and congratulated him on the performance.

785
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,200
 And the line was, so glad you liked it.

786
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,200
 And he changed it to, so glad you liked me.

787
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,320
 Someone's just gone through the script and the film

788
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,400
 and gone, oh, he changed that, didn't he?

789
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
 Ah, man.

790
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,000
 And so on autograph hunting, autograph collectors.

791
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,520
 I didn't know this.

792
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,440
 There is a magazine called "Autograph Collector,"

793
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,760
 which is all about collecting autographs, how to do it,

794
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,320
 how to get different people, and various tactics

795
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,400
 and things like that.

796
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,480
 And they do a lot on the history of autograph collecting

797
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,560
 too, because some people sell them.

798
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,320
 Obviously, some people collect loads and loads of them

799
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,480
 at the same time.

800
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:21,680
 Yeah.

801
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:24,600
 And they described one incident in 1934

802
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,880
 when the Australian cricket team came to England.

803
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,120
 And in those days, they had to get the ship to England

804
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,000
 to play the ashes and so on.

805
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,880
 And the junior batsman, Arthur Chippenfield,

806
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,160
 had to spend almost the entire journey on the steamship

807
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,400
 forging on bats and on cheese a paper,

808
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,080
 the signatures of the rest of the team,

809
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,760
 who couldn't be asked to sign this paper.

810
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,480
 Luckily, that was the last time the Australian team did anything

811
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,400
 fraudulent.

812
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,520
 [APPLAUSE]

813
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,400
 And we will be touring Australia in May.

814
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,240
 They weren't available, but some of them now come available.

815
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,760
 It's really odd.

816
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,880
 Wow.

817
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,960
 And there was autograph hunter, quite a famous one,

818
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,840
 in his little area.

819
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,320
 He was called Tommy Skullian.

820
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,640
 He was an Irish grocery driver.

821
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,880
 And his family are in tonight.

822
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,440
 He devoted his whole lives to getting autographs.

823
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,160
 He had more than 40,000 in total.

824
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,240
 I had Picasso.

825
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 He had Franco.

826
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,480
 He had Charles Manson.

827
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,640
 He had the great wins.

828
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,120
 Oh, so he wasn't discriminating.

829
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:37,720
 In the whole Good V Evil metric.

830
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,440
 I'll be honest, there's not much good in this list.

831
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,840
 But he left a will, in the end, he died quite recently.

832
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,920
 He left a will, and he bequeathed his collection

833
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,680
 to the Village Museum.

834
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,320
 Unfortunately, in his hometown, there was no Village Museum.

835
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,080
 So they auctioned it instead.

836
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,280
 They have these people have been around so much longer

837
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,920
 than I imagined autograph hunters.

838
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,120
 So they were particularly prevalent

839
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,920
 in the late 19th century, early 20th century.

840
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,920
 And they were thought of as a total scourge.

841
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,840
 So if you look back and old newspapers

842
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,040
 from the early 1900s, they're written

843
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,200
 about in such an awful way.

844
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,480
 There was an article in New York Times in 1901

845
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,400
 that said autograph hunters excel in ways that are dark

846
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
 and tricks that are vain.

847
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,520
 Mark Twain hated them.

848
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,160
 Mark Twain had a letter pre-printed that explained his refusal

849
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,920
 when people wrote to him for an autograph.

850
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,920
 And the letter explained that if he answered all these requests,

851
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,880
 he wouldn't have time to get anything else done.

852
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,640
 And also, the asking for an autograph

853
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,680
 is asking for example of his writing.

854
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,840
 And he's a writer.

855
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,280
 So you're asking for example of his own work.

856
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,200
 And he said, it wouldn't be fair to ask a doctor

857
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,880
 for one of his corpses to remember him by, would it?

858
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,800
 [LAUGHTER]

859
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,840
 What a stupid analogy.

860
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,520
 The corpse is another work that doctors produce.

861
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,800
 Well, some very bad doctors.

862
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,240
 Some of them doctors, yeah.

863
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,200
 I just made this.

864
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,600
 So you're free to try the mouth, the mouth,

865
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,480
 the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, and we'll love it.

866
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,440
 Two more things about your statement.

867
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
 Yes, yes, you are.

868
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,040
 Firstly, sometimes artists can help people with their art.

869
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,240
 There was a-- I read that Mozart used to when he

870
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
 was walking the streets.

871
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,200
 If he came across someone who was homeless,

872
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,040
 asking him for money, there's one instance

873
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,240
 that's recorded where he didn't have anything on him.

874
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,760
 But he was so quick at writing music that he got a paper

875
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,600
 and pen composed a new piece, gave it to the person,

876
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,600
 and said, there's a music publisher that will give you money

877
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,120
 for this, so take this there.

878
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,920
 That's point number one.

879
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,160
 Point number two is that--

880
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,520
 That's amazing, Mozart.

881
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,560
 Yeah, Mozart.

882
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,560
 Yes, yes, someone shouted out, "Jubian."

883
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,040
 [LAUGHTER]

884
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
 But no, the other thing is that--

885
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,840
 so you said that Mark Twain said this, sent them this letter

886
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,520
 saying, I'm not going to sign you a signature.

887
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,520
 Steve Martin, the comedian, actor, he does the same thing,

888
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,480
 but in a positive way.

889
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,520
 So he doesn't do signatures, either.

890
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,360
 What he does is if you meet Steve Martin,

891
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,680
 he gives you a card, a business card that's pre-signed,

892
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,200
 and on it is written the words, this certifies

893
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,240
 that you have had a personal encounter with me,

894
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,440
 and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent, and funny.

895
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,800
 That's great.

896
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,400
 And that's what he gives everyone who meets him.

897
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,120
 Last year, there was a collection of Beatles autographs,

898
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:22,760
 which sold for £2,000, even though three of them were fake.

899
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,520
 OK?

900
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,800
 And the reason they sold for £2,000 is

901
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,200
 that they were all done by John Lennon.

902
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,200
 Oh, cool.

903
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,360
 Because in the early days, sometimes they

904
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,600
 went all there or only one of those who would just fake it.

905
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
 Yeah, that's cool.

906
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,200
 So he was doing a prank at the time, because he may blame--

907
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,040
 Well, he kind of got them almost all right.

908
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,400
 He got George and Ringo bang on, but he

909
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,120
 didn't really bother with Paul.

910
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,120
 Even in the early days, the signs were there of the car.

911
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,000
 [LAUGHTER]

912
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
 I went on to eBay to look for the most expensive autographs

913
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,560
 at the moment.

914
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
 The most expensive one, when I checked, which was a day ago,

915
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,000
 was £351,493.85.

916
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,280
 And it was, looks like you're going to guess, Andy.

917
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,120
 Is this live or dead?

918
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,640
 Dead.

919
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,440
 Male or female?

920
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,040
 Male.

921
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,880
 Thank you.

922
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,800
 Him or the eighth?

923
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,640
 No.

924
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,960
 Oh, god, god, god, god.

925
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,440
 Oh, god, god.

926
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,920
 You've tried the two biggies.

927
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,520
 How do you get your guitar list?

928
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,920
 You're just not going to guess.

929
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,520
 Oh, OK.

930
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,360
 Who is it?

931
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,440
 Actually, I think he's dead.

932
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,760
 Hugh Heffner.

933
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,760
 Yes, yes, yes.

934
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,760
 He died last year.

935
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,400
 £3,150,000.

936
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,320
 Yeah, yeah.

937
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,960
 So he's--

938
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,800
 He's a Hugh Heffner.

939
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
 I know, I know.

940
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,200
 It's a number one edition of Playboy, with his signature on.

941
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,800
 But that is £351,000.

942
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,960
 Bob Dylan signed handwritten lyrics to Leica Rolling Stone,

943
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,360
 only £140,597.54.

944
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,720
 It's still a lot of money, guys.

945
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,880
 Don't be too outraged.

946
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,760
 It's a lot of people are going, oh, I'm sure, lose change.

947
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,200
 But a fifth, a fifth, the price of the Hugh Heffner one,

948
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,320
 for £70,000, you can get the Apollo 11 space-flow

949
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,600
 US flag signed by all three astronauts on the Apollo 11.

950
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:06,360
 All right, that actually we could share between us all of us.

951
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,320
 We've been in a tenor each.

952
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,360
 We can do it.

953
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
 And then we'll have to have an incredibly complicated

954
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,840
 time share.

955
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,760
 And the lowest prices, £75,000,

956
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,840
 an EastEnders signed photo of Simon Williams,

957
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,240
 who plays Hugo in EastEnders.

958
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,600
 He's actually got an exclamation mark up to it.

959
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,640
 Actually, I've never heard of him.

960
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,480
 We ages ago, when our vinyl came out,

961
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:36,360
 we went to a record shop and did a signing at a record shop,

962
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,360
 and we did a few signatures on ones that they hand-sold

963
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,080
 that they were going to keep online in their store.

964
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,480
 So we checked if they were still in stock online, they were.

965
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,840
 The unsigned vinyl was £19.99.

966
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,160
 The signed vinyl was £20.

967
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,600
 We are worth between us one penny.

968
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,600
 Wow.

969
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,600
 [APPLAUSE]

970
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:09,840
 I will be signing that to the show tonight.

971
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,440
 Just on the astronauts, Apollo 11 thing,

972
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,280
 one of the things that was a contingency for the families

973
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,320
 of the Apollo 11 space mission was that Neil Armstrong,

974
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,200
 Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins signed a lot of signatures

975
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,040
 to give to their family so that if they didn't make it back,

976
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,040
 the families could sell the signatures

977
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:30,400
 to make money to keep the family going OK.

978
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,360
 They signed hundreds of signatures going,

979
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,920
 if we don't make it back, sell these.

980
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,400
 And this will help my family continue.

981
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
 Yeah.

982
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,200
 Stephen King.

983
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,040
 That's very sad.

984
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,320
 It's not sad.

985
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
 They were OK.

986
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,240
 Oh, that's spoiling me.

987
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,240
 He's only one type for 30 years.

988
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,040
 He's only on Apollo 10.

989
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,440
 The next one's really good.

990
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,800
 It is one of the few where the sequels get better and better.

991
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,560
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

992
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,440
 There's one amazing story about autographs

993
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,280
 that Stephen King tells was watching him give a talk on stage

994
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,320
 about this thing that happened when he was 26 years old.

995
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,000
 And he'd never been recognized and asked

996
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,440
 for an autograph before.

997
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,080
 It was in his early days, and he was in a restaurant.

998
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,200
 And he was really sick.

999
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,000
 He was really ill.

1000
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,600
 He had some kind of horrible stomach bug.

1001
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,640
 And so he had to be really close to the bathrooms at all times.

1002
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,000
 And at one point, he had to rush to the bathrooms.

1003
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,160
 And he went in.

1004
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
 And I don't know what kind of weird restaurant this was,

1005
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,320
 but there were no doors on the bathroom on the toilet stalls.

1006
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,400
 So he just had to have his stomach complaint

1007
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,320
 and full view of the rest of the bathroom.

1008
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,160
 And so he went in, and he sort of explosively

1009
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,320
 shat all into this toilet.

1010
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,600
 Zombie, zombie.

1011
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,760
 He'll tell a sign.

1012
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,600
 And he did this, and he's feeling terrible.

1013
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,640
 He was saying he was on this toilet door opening.

1014
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,080
 Things can't get any worse.

1015
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,680
 And there was a toilet attendant in there

1016
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,600
 who he said was about 180 years old.

1017
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,160
 And while he was in the middle of this awful experience,

1018
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,000
 the toilet attendant came up to him

1019
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,160
 with a pallopaper and a pen and said,

1020
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,120
 "On you, Stephen King?"

1021
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,120
 "Come have your autograph please, mate."

1022
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,880
 So Stephen King gave his first requested autograph

1023
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,920
 on the Lou while having diaries.

1024
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,200
 [APPLAUSE]

1025
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,360
 Very cool.

1026
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,160
 Thank you.

1027
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,800
 OK, that is it.

1028
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,640
 That is all of our facts.

1029
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,520
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,360
