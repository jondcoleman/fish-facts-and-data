WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Hey guys, just before we begin this week's show, we have a little announcement to make,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.440
 which is that we have something for you to look at.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.760
 That's a bit disgusting, aren't we?

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.440
 Well, I wouldn't say so, don't you?

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.320
 It's a bit inappropriate.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 No, it's a wonderful kind of behind-the-scenes video of tall life on a tall.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.800
 A documentary behind the girls.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.080
 Behind the girls, exactly.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.440
 No, why aren't you wearing any trousers?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.920
 We don't have time to get into that now, and at the point is, we've released this thing.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.120
 And it's our tour, isn't it? We filmed loads of stuff for it, loads of behind-the-scenes

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.320
 interviews and videos of us backstage getting ready.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280
 Yeah, it was super fun. We had a great time on tour, and we just filmed some of the chats we had,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.680
 some interviews where you can learn some deep dark secrets from our pasts.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.520
 Childhood photos, that kind of thing.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.400
 Yeah, so it's been available in the UK for a little while.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.480
 So hopefully all you guys have got it, but if you haven't then get it now, but the big news is,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.560
 it's now available in America, so if you go to Amazon, if you go to Google Play,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.120
 if you go to iTunes, you'll be able to get hold of it now.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.920
 That's true, or you can just go to qi.com/gills where you'll find all the links.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.600
 Okay, where are my trousers?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 Oh, no, they're so...

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:22.240
 (music)

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.840
 Oh, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish, a Weakly Podcast"

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.080
 coming to you this week live from Debra!

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.720
 (applause)

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.160
 My name is Jan Schreiber, and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter-Marie,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000
 and James Harkin, and once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.840
 four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.120
 here we go, starting with you, Chazinski.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.400
 My fact this week is that every competitor at the world's longest dog sled race

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.280
 brings about 600 spare pairs of shoes with them.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.320
 And they're for the dogs.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.200
 This is amazing, so this is the...

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.720
 I've did a road race which happens in Alaska every year.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.080
 It's very long, it's roughly a thousand miles through Alaska.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.280
 And yeah, the dogs have to wear shoes, and so by the rules of the game,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.960
 they actually have to bring eight extra shoes on the sled with them.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.160
 So at any one time, there have to be eight pairs of dog shoes on the sled.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.520
 I was going to say on a pair of dog shoes is that four shoes are two shoes.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.400
 I didn't know how to word this, but it's...

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.800
 So it's a pair is for the front pair, and then you have a second pair for the back pair,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.320
 the way I see it, but it basically...

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.160
 Do dogs have different foot sizes on the front sets to the back sets?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.000
 They actually, they can do, they can do, yeah, sometimes they do, yeah.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.720
 So if you're buying, if you're buying your dog shoes,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.160
 then number one you're insane. But number two, you have to get both sides measured.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.920
 What's the biggest difference between the back...

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.360
 Like there's some dogs with tiny, tiny front paws and a massive back paws.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.160
 That would be good. Like a penny-farthing, but in dog form.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 Like a kangaroo on all fours, yeah.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760
 Yeah. Yeah. I believe not.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.800
 And the facts get in the way, but otherwise pleasing bit of whimsy.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.200
 Byte, so I didn't actually look that much into the size range of the dog shoes.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.320
 I will say that the moshes, the guys...

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.000
 We're calling the moshes or moshes.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.480
 Moshes. So moshes.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.440
 Yeah.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.120
 So these are the due to riding the sled?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.840
 This is guys riding the sled or the woman who's riding the sled.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.680
 They usually make the dog shoes themselves, so I guess they can tailor into each dog's foot size.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.960
 And like I say, in the rules, per dog you have to have eight extra shoes on board the sled.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.280
 And so yeah, they usually bring over a thousand pairs of shoes, like 13, 14, 100 shoes.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.720
 And then the dogs have to drag the weights of those shoes, as well, don't they?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.760
 I guess. Yeah, they do kind of change them like that, though.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.960
 So you know, in Formula One, you have pit stops where you're going to get filled out with petrol.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.840
 But that's what happens. You have your pit stops on the sled race.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.440
 Where you go and you have to change your dog shoes.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.040
 That's amazing. They bring the guys at the side.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200
 They're bringing 16 trees for the dog to piss again.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:27.200
 Some drivers, moshes, rather, they bring 3,000 little booties for the kids.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.680
 Because you've got 16 dogs pulling each sled, I think that's right, so that's 64 feet.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.520
 What happens? Do they lose their shoe on the run or do they wear through?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.880
 Why do they need to change so much?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.080
 It gets worn through.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.240
 So the reason they have shoes, it's not because of the colder.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.400
 Anything dogs feet are very good at managing the cold, so it's totally covered in ice and snow.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.200
 But the reason they need it is for the kind of lumps and bumps and the grit and the sharp bits of ice

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.640
 that might get stuck in their paws.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.320
 And so that wears away at the shoes and just, you know, they're running pretty hardcore.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.760
 That's cool. That's fun.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.720
 I read a really cool thing about the, because this is a big event that happens annually.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.840
 And it brings people from all over the planet to come and compete.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.640
 And in 2010, the event saw its first ever Jamaican team entering it.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.240
 Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.120
 Yeah, he's, yeah, he's called The Mushroom Mon.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.800
 That's what he calls himself.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.080
 And he, yeah, he's been competing for years.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.040
 That's a nickname, isn't it?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.640
 Yeah, no, it's his. He calls himself.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.880
 That's his nickname, yeah. That's cool.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.360
 Yeah.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.400
 It's just, because I thought there was one guy called Newton Marshall.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.280
 That's him. That's him.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.960
 So, you know, the amazing thing about Newton Marshall is such a cool story.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.920
 So basically, in 2014, there was another sledar called Scott Janssen.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.520
 And he came off his sled and he was really, really badly injured, but he was off the track.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.440
 And he didn't know if anyone was going to find him.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.920
 And Newton Marshall came by on his sled and he noticed that this sled had been overturned

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.680
 and that someone was really badly injured.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.800
 Like, he'd been seriously concast, he'd broken his ankle.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.240
 And so he went and he saved him.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.640
 This guy called Newton Marshall went and he raised the alarm

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.320
 and he sort of made him a little bed in the snow.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.480
 And they waited for him to be saved.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.680
 And he was rescued, he was fine.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.040
 So that was what Newton Marshall did.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.360
 But the bizarre thing about this is that two years earlier in the same race,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.360
 Scott Janssen's dog had collapsed.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.200
 And he'd had to revive him with mouth to snout resuscitation.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.920
 So he'd been as good as dead for five minutes.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.680
 And Scott Janssen is a funeral home director.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.640
 So he said, I know what dead looks like.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.440
 That dog was dead, but he gave him mouth to snout.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.080
 And the bizarre thing about this is that the dog was called Marshall.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.840
 So he saved a Marshall.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.280
 What are you suggesting?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.120
 I genuinely don't know.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.480
 I think what I'm clearly missing is the dog Marshall has been reincarnated

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.040
 in the person Marshall who's then come to save him as a thank you for saving the dog.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
 So it could subsequently die from this.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.760
 I know.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.560
 And Newton, the human will be, you know, one year old.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.240
 He wouldn't be in, I think.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.000
 We got to know all the answers.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.160
 Also, I find it a bit weird that just because he works at a funeral home this guy,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.800
 that he should be good at mouth to mouth resuscitation.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.360
 And people brought him and he's like, we can still save him.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.760
 Give me five minutes.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.840
 I wouldn't trust that guy.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.520
 My favorite, my favorite musher is a guy called John Souter.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.720
 And he thought, you know what, all these guys are doing it wrong with these huskies.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.920
 I'm going to do it with poodles.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.680
 And so he got some poodles to carry his sled or to pull his sled along.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.920
 He got them, he brought them up with huskies.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.920
 So they kind of learned what to do with the huskies.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.560
 But unfortunately, they all got frozen feet.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.520
 Because the huskies have got special padding, haven't they?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.280
 And now it's banned and you have to have only certain types of dog that you're allowed.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.440
 There used to be that you could have any dog you wanted.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.400
 But truly, there weren't many winners from the Chihuahua team.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:57.760
 Do you know what the idea for what it's based on?

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.160
 It's based on an event which happened in 1925 called The Great Race of Mercy.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.760
 And this was a real crisis.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.200
 So there was a town in Nome which had an epidemic of death area and it was beginning.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.840
 And it was, you know, people were starting to die.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.960
 A few people had already died.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.600
 And the nearest anti-toxin was a thousand miles away.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.720
 In 1925, there were only three planes in the whole of Alaska

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.040
 and they were elderly, unreliable biplanes.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.240
 So they couldn't be guaranteed to get there.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.280
 So they went with dogs.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.800
 And there were hero dogs and hero musherers who got the anti-toxin a thousand miles to the town of Nome.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.320
 And the guy who approved this, the governor of Alaska who approved this.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.520
 His name was Scott Bone.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.560
 So there's a coincidence.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.480
 I'm not saying he was a reincarnated dog.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.000
 And afterwards, the lead dog, Balto.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.800
 He became a celebrity.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.120
 He was as famous as Rinton Tin or Lassie or all these other celebrity dogs of the 1920s.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.440
 And the mayor of Los Angeles awarded Balto a bone-shaped key to the city.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.880
 Oh, please.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.280
 I've got a couple of favourites, favourites, races.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.320
 So this is two people, a guy called Dallas and a guy called Mitch,

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.760
 their father and son.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.520
 And they seem to have this ongoing rivalry.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.360
 So in 2012, Dallas Ceevy became the youngest winner.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.280
 He was 25 years old and he won it.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.720
 In 2013, his father became the oldest ever winner.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.240
 This went on.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.880
 So Dallas kept on winning it year after year.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.480
 In 2016, he broke the record for the fastest time it's ever been done.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.800
 So he did it in eight days and 11 hours.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.040
 And in 2017, the following year, his dad broke the record again in eight days and three hours.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:44.000
 And actually, that year, the son Dallas's dogs turned out to be doped.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.040
 Now, they were weirdly, they were doped with a tramadol,

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.160
 which everyone agreed would not be of any benefit at all.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.080
 Surely they'd get a nice night's sleep at the end of the day.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.600
 But yeah, I should say his father was not a suspect

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.200
 for doping his son's dogs or anything.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.000
 But this year, he decided he didn't want to do it, right?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.520
 Because they said that, basically, he doped his dogs.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.800
 He said, I definitely didn't do it.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.840
 Someone else must have done it.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.120
 And he wasn't happy about it.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.240
 And now he's kind of pulled out.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.440
 Oh, is that why he didn't do it?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.400
 I believe so, yeah.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.560
 And it was done so much lower this year.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.840
 It was like nine days, something.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.560
 It was rubbish.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.560
 Yeah, what would they do?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.960
 But actually, I should just say, a lot of people don't like the dog sledding,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:23.440
 don't they?

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.880
 They think it's kind of cruel.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880
 Because a lot of the dogs get sick.

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.920
 Some of them die.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.560
 We all die.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.480
 Well, how did you like to pull a sled?

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.440
 Well, the old guy.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.560
 He might as well just pull a fucking sled.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.800
 I'm just saying, life is hard.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.640
 It's a lot harder if you're pulling a sled.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.760
 That's a good point, sorry, yeah.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.400
 Well, the other thing is, there's lots of things that can happen there.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.200
 I mean, they do die.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.840
 One of the worst things they get is scrotal and penile frostbite.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.160
 Wow.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.040
 OK.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.520
 Yeah?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.640
 There's a frostbite.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.080
 No, I'd like to announce, I'm pulling out of the next day as a general.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.360
 And then I thought I would check to see if humans can get frostbite.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.560
 On the penises.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.160
 Because I just didn't trust you.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.040
 I just didn't trust you.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.920
 That's why you went to Iceland.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.200
 The zoo's all gone off.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.880
 Not why mom shops there.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.160
 Well, apparently, according to the internet,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.040
 the classic account of humans getting frostbite on their genitals

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.560
 is from the New England Journal of Medicine in 1977.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.240
 And there's a doctor called Melvin Hirschkowitz.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.440
 And he went running in very cold weather.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.600
 And he got that.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.760
 And it's notable.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.240
 The paper is notable because, once he writes about what happened,

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.560
 and at one stage, his wife comes home and finds him standing

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.320
 legs apart in the bedroom, nude below the waist,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.800
 holding the tip of his penis in his right hand,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.600
 and turning the pages of the New England Journal of Medicine.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.280
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.280
 I was just looking up weird dog competitions.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.240
 And there's a magazine called Veterinary Practice News.

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.520
 And it has an annual x-ray competition awarded

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.480
 to dogs who eat in the weirdest things.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.040
 So recently, one of the winners was Lola, a seven-kilototus,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.080
 who'd eaten a turtle pendant.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.120
 But--

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.920
 I think it took.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.960
 Is our dogs, are they?

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.120
 No, sorry, it was just pett, just pett.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.880
 Oh, right.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.360
 I mean, we're things, sorry.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.920
 But my favorite one was the Rotweiler.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.680
 I want to see one pulling the sled.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.120
 My favorite one of these winners was the Rotweiler,

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.760
 who had swallowed her own as wristwatch.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.720
 But the alarm was still on, telling her when

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.080
 to take her insulin.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.280
 So she had to listen to the dog to find the one to take her pedals.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:49.840
 All right, it is time for fact number two.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.280
 And that is my fact.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:55.000
 My fact this week is that 3,000 feet up a mountain in France

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.440
 is a block of sandstone commemorating the exact spot

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.760
 where the author Victor Hugo's parents conceived him.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.800
 Yeah, it's--

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.440
 this was revealed that that was the spot where it happened

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.240
 in a letter written by his dad, who bragged about it a lot.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.880
 It was at the top of this mountain, called Mount Denon,

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.880
 in France, and he made it to the top.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.080
 And it was years later, this wasn't done in his lifetime,

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.440
 but years later, a museum curator thought,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.680
 I've got to commemorate this and brought a sandstone.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.560
 And it's there to this day.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.840
 It was kind of a prank, wasn't it?

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.720
 By the guy from the museum in the '60s, was it?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.840
 I think it was like a practical joke in the 1960s.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.640
 But did you know that Victor Hugo denied

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.720
 that that was where it happened?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.560
 Because he was kind of ashamed of this mountain,

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.280
 big amount, and that wasn't super famous,

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.320
 not everyone knew about it.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.240
 So whenever he retold the story of when he was conceived,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.440
 as we all do, he made lots of little changes.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.800
 So there'd been a Celtic temple on Mount Denon,

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.920
 and he changed that to a Roman temple of love.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.880
 And he changed the mountain range to the Alps,

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.160
 because everyone's heard of the Alps.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.640
 And he made it Montblanc, because that's 3,000 feet taller.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.640
 And so his version, he was a storyteller.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.640
 That was what he did.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.600
 Yeah, you run at the risk of frostbite to the scrotum.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.600
 If you try to conceive of that altitude.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.320
 He did-- he told a lot of stories, obviously.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.840
 Namely little.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.840
 He knew his room.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.040
 Yeah, fine, fine.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.200
 He claimed that he and his wife, Adele,

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.880
 had sex nine times on their wedding night.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.080
 And the telegraph wrote that, apparently,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.720
 she lost her taste for intercourse after that first night.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.640
 And I'm not surprised.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.480
 Well, he was a sex addict, wasn't he?

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.480
 Yes.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.720
 He was constantly going to brothels.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.920
 He almost had a sort of, like, breakfast

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.160
 sex and then lunchtime sex and dinner sex.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.120
 There was almost a menu on a day-to-day basis with Victor Hugo,

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.800
 to the point that he was so popular amongst the brothels of Paris

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.240
 that when he died, the brothels of Paris

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.520
 closed down for the day so that everyone working there

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.200
 could come to the funeral procession to pay tribute.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.360
 I read one account, and I'm not sure this can be true.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.400
 But the prostitutes of Paris draped their vaginas

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.680
 in black, crepe paper.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:24.680
 That's according to a guy called Edmund Gonca,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.360
 who was there at the time of the world.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.840
 How did he know?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.440
 He can't have tested them all.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.920
 But what happened was, when he died,

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.160
 everyone thought he was going to die.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.400
 And then he kind of stuck around for a few weeks.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.960
 And so people came to Paris, expecting for him to die,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.640
 and they were going to celebrate his life.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.440
 But it went so long.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.280
 More and more and more people came.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.760
 And in the end, there were a crowd of 2 million people

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.640
 at this funeral, which was more than the normal population

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.400
 of Paris.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400
 Wow.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.480
 It was rammed.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.400
 And everyone-- because he was like a famous sex addict

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.000
 or whatever, and he was a partier, everyone just got drunk.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.240
 Everyone had sex.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.800
 There was this story that always happens

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.440
 that people say that nine months later,

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.600
 there were loads of babies born.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.280
 So people were saying that during the funeral,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.680
 everyone was just having sex everywhere.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.480
 There was a parade at his funeral,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.920
 and it took six hours for it to get to the end.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.920
 And there were delegations of different professions there.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.480
 So there were veterans, civil servants, writers, animal lovers,

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.160
 a schoolchildren, suffrageers.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.200
 Sorry, can we give it back?

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.640
 What-- his-- was animal lover a formal profession?

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640
 No.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:39.720
 Who's paying for that?

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:46.800
 But apparently, the suffrageers got really annoyed,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.360
 because they were behind the gymnasts in the department stores.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.320
 They said, we deserve better than this.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:57.160
 Wow, but it was just after his 79th birthday.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.400
 So he had an 80th birthday party on his 79th birthday

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.280
 as he was entering his 80th year.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.760
 And for that one, half a million people just walked past his house

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.880
 as he sat outside waving at them.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.200
 And then the next day, because that was his apartment in Paris,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.640
 they changed the street name from where he was living.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:17.720
 So it got changed to become avenue Victor Hugo.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.160
 So his remaining days, he lived on the street

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.440
 named after him, and he would say that he would--

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.400
 he wanted all the future mail that came to him

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.920
 to be addressed to Mr. Victor in his avenue, Paris.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.680
 And that would make it to him.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.840
 He said he wanted a pauper's burial, a pauper's funeral,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.800
 and he obviously had the complete opposite.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.000
 But I'm not totally convinced he wants it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.880
 There's one biography of him, which kind of seems

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.600
 to suggest that he was obviously famous for being

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.120
 a proponent of helping out the poor.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.080
 And then Mr. Arbor has all about the awful conditions

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.080
 people lived in.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.480
 But he really liked people to know it.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.760
 So for instance, apparently, he liked people

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.600
 to ask him why he was wearing his coat inside out.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.120
 Because then he'd say to them, I just wear it inside out

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.280
 rather than buying a new one.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.440
 And then I can give that money to the poor.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.320
 And he really-- he really liked to invite this kind of worker.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.920
 I know, right?

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.480
 Apparently, according to this person,

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.200
 he actually left in his will what the biographer

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.480
 describes as an "exeguous summer," a very small amount

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.000
 in his will to the poor, because he knew how rumours work.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.080
 And he knew that that would become an enormous amount

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.240
 within a short amount of time.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:27.540
 Sorry.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.720
 He was so famous when he was living in Guernsey,

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.080
 that admirers would save the pebbles

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.920
 that he walked upon when he was walking across the beach.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.760
 Wow.

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.600
 So they would be like, he's still on that one.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.280
 I'll take that.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.040
 Wow.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:40.720
 Yeah.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.560
 Apparently.

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.320
 I mean, it doesn't sound very true, does it?

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.120
 Is it from-- did he tell us that?

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.640
 Or--

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.320
 It's hard to tell.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.680
 He was kind of-- he was paid in a very unusual way,

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.680
 for the lamez, because he said, I think,

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.880
 to his publisher-- his publisher said, how much do you want?

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.440
 And he made him a quite a high offer.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.560
 And he said, no, that's not enough.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.280
 And he said, I think he said, I'd like to be paid more than anyone else

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.640
 has ever been paid to write a book.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.960
 I'll give some to the poor.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.880
 But the publisher didn't have the money to pay.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.800
 It was, I think, equivalent of about 3 million pounds,

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.120
 which is a huge amount of money.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.760
 And the publisher didn't have that money.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.480
 So he had to borrow all of that from a bank.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:19.600
 So it was kind of a private finance initiative novel, basically.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.320
 And then the publisher just borrowed in the assumption

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.080
 that it would pay off.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:22.800
 And it did.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.800
 Yeah, it was huge, wasn't it?

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.880
 When it was published, people turned up with wheelbarrows

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.120
 to buy copies of it.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:27.640
 What?

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.120
 How big was it?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:28.880
 It is a big book.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.600
 And wheelbarrows at the time were very small.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
 Yeah.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.240
 But what happened is you would go in.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.600
 If you were a worker, and you could get some time off,

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.720
 and you could afford to get the book,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.680
 and you could queue up and get there in time with your wheelbarrow,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.800
 then you could sell it to your friends.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.200
 And you could make a massive profit on it.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.760
 It was like a ticket town to kind of think, yeah, wow.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.080
 He wasn't quite arrogant, though, wasn't he?

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.400
 That was it.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.520
 He wanted to be paid all the money in the world.

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.920
 And he used to-- he was a party animal.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.320
 So he apparently used to have 30 guests

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.040
 surrounded in every single night, right up until he was 80,

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.080
 when he died.

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.840
 But he then did at these big dinner parties.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.280
 He used to spend the whole time talking about how great he was.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.400
 He would say, there is only one classical writer

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.480
 in this country.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.400
 One, do you hear me?

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.720
 I am the only one.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.560
 I know the French language better than anyone else alive.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.520
 And then he was better.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.840
 Sorry, I just asked if you wanted red or white one.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.120
 And then he'd catalog all like Bullsack and Racine

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.120
 and all the other great writers

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.880
 and explain why they were not as good as he was.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.000
 There was one time when he wouldn't talk about himself

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.840
 in these parties.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.760
 And that was when he did his party trick,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.720
 which was putting a whole orange into his mouth,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.320
 and then thrusting as many pieces of sugar as possible

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.520
 into his cheeks, and then scrunching it all up,

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.800
 swallowing two liquor glasses of kish,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.960
 and then opening his mouth and saying, I've just eaten it all.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.880
 So now this is tricky.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.960
 Could it eat an orange and a lotus sugar really quickly?

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:58.800
 Oh, awesome.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.760
 And people still talk about his novel, or something.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.760
 We're going to have to move on very shortly.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.840
 The guy who wrote the lyrics for the musical of Les Mis,

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:09.360
 he was a guy called James Fenton.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360
 He wrote the first lyrics, lots of people.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.640
 I had it how to get out of the lyrics.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.320
 But when he was given the book and told,

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.600
 hey, why don't you have a look at the lyrics

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.160
 for this turning this novel into lyrics.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.480
 He was on a three-month trip looking for headhunters in Borneo.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.080
 And it was a really heavy book.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.680
 And he said that he spent three months in a canoe,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.280
 reading Les Mis, and every time he finished a chapter,

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.520
 he threw it to the crocodile,

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.040
 so he could save a bit of weight in the canoe.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.200
 That's very cool.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.280
 Did you know he trended on Twitter in 2014

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.520
 for a kind of related reason?

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.960
 So he trended on Twitter and not in a good way.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.640
 It turned out, the BBC reported this,

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.880
 that he was suddenly Victor Hugo was receiving

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.640
 all these death threats on Twitter.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.880
 And he was being called, lots of stuff.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.160
 He was called the son of a prostitute.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.440
 His daughter was called a big bitch.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:58.480
 And it turned out what happened was one of his poems

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.080
 had been set in a French baccalaureate exam.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.520
 And they were so annoyed about it.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.640
 Because it's so factual that all the students

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.480
 got online afterwards.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.880
 They got him trending.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880
 Isn't that--

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.760
 I think you know you've made it when you're getting death threats

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.000
 on Twitter 200 years.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.040
 OK, it's time to move on to fact number three.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.600
 And that is James.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:25.120
 OK, my fact this week is in the event of a zombie apocalypse,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.800
 only one country will survive.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.320
 And that country is North Korea.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.120
 Really?

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.200
 Yeah.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.560
 So this is a study by some mathematicians in Brazil.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.880
 And they've kind of done a model of what's going to happen.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.720
 And it's going to be like a straight fight between human and zombie.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.560
 And the zombie's always going to win.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.520
 But if you get a human with a gun, like in the army,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.920
 then the human might win.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.520
 And they've worked out that what you're going to need

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.360
 is 47 soldiers per 1,000 capital in order to survive.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.400
 And there's only one country with that many people.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.240
 And that is North Korea.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.880
 And they have also the advantage

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.840
 of being completely separate from everyone else.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.320
 So it's going to be difficult for the zombies to get in.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.160
 The borders are very guarded and stuff like that.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.560
 So if the zombies come, that's where it's the best place to go.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.240
 Oh, right.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.160
 In all of the circumstances, I don't love that.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:21.120
 I was reading, my assumption is, if you were killed by a zombie,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:24.800
 it would be through your brains being eaten and you being attacked.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.920
 According to Max Brooks, Max Brooks is an author who

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.400
 wrote the zombie survival guide.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.720
 He wrote the movie World War Z, the book

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.920
 or other World War Z, which was made into the Brad Pitt movie.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.760
 So he studied in a very serious way

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.160
 what he thought would be the way that you would be most likely

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.880
 to die in a zombie apocalypse.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.480
 And his main reason for anyone's death

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.440
 is that you would die from explosive diarrhea.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.040
 And it's because water would become so scarce

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.080
 that you would be forced to drink from puddles.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.960
 Puddles are very dangerous to get water from.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.600
 You can see why they don't make most of the zombie films

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:01.640
 about the whole explosive diarrhea puddle issue.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640
 Yeah.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.600
 I wouldn't want to.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.200
 I did look up, because there are so many zombie films.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.560
 And they're quite cheap to make, obviously,

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.760
 because all you need is some willing extras with a load of makeup on.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.720
 And a load of them are quite low quality.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.480
 But I went through a list of all the zombie films I could find online.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:19.120
 I just wanted to share a few of the titles, because they're great.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.320
 So there are classic things like boy, eat, girl, free, clever.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.840
 There's erotic nights of the living dead.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.880
 There's flights of the living dead, which is a plane-based zombie film.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.880
 My favorite one is--

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.840
 I like the explosive diarrhea one.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.480
 The shites of the living dead.

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:44.360
 I've got a third one.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.440
 It's not as good as that.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:50.920
 It's called "Poltery Guysed Night of the Chicken Dead."

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:57.280
 A tiny little nugget about the World War Z movie, by the way,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.720
 that was made, which is just a cool bit of trivia, which

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.800
 is that one of the actors in the movie was Peter Capaldi.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.960
 And Peter Capaldi was cast as a World Health Organization Doctor.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.640
 So he was a whew, Doctor.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.880
 And what it was is that the filmmakers had

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.600
 inside knowledge that he was going to be announced as the Doctor.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.120
 This was before Doctor Who.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.240
 And so it's a subtle, like Easter Egg here.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.280
 Oh, and none of us guessed based on that.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.200
 We should have known these stories in the face.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.840
 People at scientists and people at universities

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.400
 are always writing analyses of what happens in a zombie apocalypse.

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.960
 It happens really in a lot of places.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.400
 And I think it's kind of a way of engaging people

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.880
 when making something sound fun.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.640
 When actually, it's a paper about statistical projections.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.400
 That could be fun, Ella.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.480
 Which, for a lot of people, is fun.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.040
 But one example of this was the University of Ottawa

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.520
 a few years ago, published a paper with an equation in it,

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.120
 explaining how fast we'd have to deal with the zombie apocalypse.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.480
 So the paper's called, when zombies attack,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.240
 mathematical modeling of an outbreak of zombie infection.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.800
 And one of the papers authors, the professor in charge,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.120
 was called Robert J. Smith, question mark.

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:16.320
 And it turns out that the guy here at this paper

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.640
 has put a question mark on the end of his name.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:19.560
 And I looked him up.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.200
 And if you go to his academic page on the website at the university,

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.120
 he says, yeah, that's not a typo.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.440
 I really do have a question mark on the end of my name.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.160
 Do you have any idea what it's like to live with such an incredibly

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.280
 common name that you'll never ever show up on Google?

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.040
 I had to do something.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.120
 How do you think he pronounced his it?

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.520
 Did his Robert Smith?

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:43.880
 Or Smith?

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.560
 Definitely.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.520
 Oh, he might just say question mark at the end, maybe.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.120
 Yeah.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.160
 But he then also says, I did go to his page.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.120
 I saw this as well.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.680
 He then follows up by saying, how do you stick out on Google?

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.320
 He then goes, actually, you still don't stick out on Google

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.000
 when you put it on your mark.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.280
 So it hasn't really worked.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.320
 I like the other one who he wanted to stick out

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.920
 against, who is Robert Smith.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:11.120
 I've got a bit of good news in the zombie world to come.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:11.720
 Oh, good.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.920
 We're going to win.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.760
 It's going to be fine.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.000
 It's going to be absolutely fine.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.040
 We're going to win within about a week, guys.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.080
 OK, there's someone booth.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.320
 There's like a bit of a weird zombie wall.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.120
 How many of the priorities, mate?

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.960
 So there's an article by a scientist

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.120
 called David Misagewski.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.720
 And he said that nature would destroy zombies

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.320
 before they could destroy us.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.440
 So obviously, all animals will be packing away at them.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:34.960
 They're dead.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.600
 They're not very fast with the reactions.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.440
 But the main thing is microorganisms

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.040
 would go to town on them.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.520
 Bacteria, fungi, molds, insects, flesh-eating beetles.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.200
 I think it's a bit cocky for you to say,

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.280
 we're going to win in that situation.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.200
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:52.600
 Allies in the microorganism world will join us

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:57.960
 in a coalition of the live.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.320
 That's a really good point.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.360
 That's such good logic.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.760
 They can decompose a rabbit right down to the bones in a week.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.640
 So they'll go to town on these things.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.360
 Misagewski, he did say that in his kind of world,

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.640
 animals can't get the same disease that humans were getting.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.560
 Do you know what I mean?

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.680
 So the animals can't become zombies in his kind of idea.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.880
 If the animals can become zombies as well,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.400
 then it's a whole different ballgame.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.280
 If you're getting attacked by zombie microwarkers,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.720
 that is not a great movie either.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.720
 I must admit, but there's someone else

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.160
 who's published advice on how to escape zombies.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.840
 How to survive a zombie attack is the CDC,

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.440
 the Center for Disease Control in America.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:39.760
 And this was obviously kind of a PR thing

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.920
 to try and get people actually onto their website.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.280
 So they learned how to survive genuine crises.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.240
 But it's quite funny, because if you do go to the site now,

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.480
 they've got a zombie preparedness page,

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.760
 a zombie preparedness blog.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.000
 They've got a zombie preparedness booklet for educators

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.920
 that they will send out.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.520
 But they don't really conceal their true purpose very well.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:01.640
 So the tips they give are things like,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.640
 stock up on water, food, and other supplies

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.040
 to get you through the first couple of days

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.560
 before you can locate a zombie-free refugee camp.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.280
 Brackets or, in the case of a natural disaster,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.480
 it will buy you some time to get to an evacuation shelter

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.480
 or until utility lines are restored, close brackets.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.680
 It's always like, you know, first aid supplies,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.680
 in case that horrible zombie bites you.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.080
 Also, we'll come in handy in a tornado or a hurricane.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.080
 LAUGHTER

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.480
 And one other thing that might help us if the zombies attack

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.480
 to win is the reverse zombie tick.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:35.480
 Cool.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.320
 OK, this is an animal, a little tick.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.480
 And if it bites you, it makes you allergic to meat.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.200
 And so the idea is what we might do

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.840
 is kind of work out what makes that happen.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:47.720
 And then we can inject it into the zombies,

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.040
 make them allergic to eating us, and then we're saved.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.240
 But just because the zombies got hives,

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.040
 doesn't mean that you're not then a zombie.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040
 Yeah.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040
 Wait.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.040
 LAUGHTER

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.040
 How?

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.440
 Do you guys know that zombies make an appearance

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.280
 in Amazon's terms and services conditions?

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.280
 You know that when you go and you sign that massive 26,000 words?

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.280
 Yeah, we all read it.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.280
 But then you, oh, then this won't be a surprise.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.520
 Someone did read the whole thing, and they discovered

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.880
 that there's a passage in it, which reads, however,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880
 so that it just comes into this.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.040
 However, this restriction will not apply

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:29.400
 in the event of the occurrence of a widespread viral infection

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.320
 transmitted via bites or contact with bubbly fluids

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.840
 that cause human corpses to reanimate

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.480
 and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain,

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:40.600
 or nerve tissue, and is likely to result

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.560
 in the fall of organized civilization.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.120
 That's in Amazon's actual terms.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120
 That's very funny.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.320
 And conditions, yeah.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.800
 It feels like they're testing us to check we're reading them.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800
 Exactly.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.440
 And as the news of the last two months has told us,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.320
 nobody has read any of them.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.200
 Oh, we need to move on shortly.

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:04.400
 There is just on animal zombie sort of parasites

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400
 and the way they spread.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.600
 There is a flight called Apocephalus Borealis,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.440
 and it lays eggs inside bumblebees.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.240
 And the amazing thing is that the infected bee

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.160
 then stops working, and it starts acting like a moth.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.160
 It starts being flying around lights and this kind of thing,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:21.560
 while the other parasite is preparing to burst out, basically.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.520
 But that means that there are zom bees.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.600
 Oh!

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.920
 Yeah, that's good.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.600
 [APPLAUSE]

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.960
 Very cool.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.240
 It's a very forgiving audience tonight.

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.200
 OK, it is time for our final fact to the show.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.760
 And that is Andy.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.640
 My fact is that the 1930s actor, George Arles,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.680
 once booked himself into the left luggage

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.520
 office at Charring Cross as a parcel

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.760
 in order to escape people who wanted his autograph.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.120
 What a guy I'd never had of this guy before.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.800
 But he was very famous at the time.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:00.480
 And he wrote in his memoir that he was being chased

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.360
 by people who were desperate for his autograph.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.280
 And so he said, with presence of mind

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.800
 worthy of a great general, I thought

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.360
 that left luggage office.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.280
 It was just behind me, close to the platform.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.440
 I turned to the man in charge and demanded the right to book

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.080
 myself in as a parcel.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.360
 I paid my two pints, and the man took me over the counter.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.680
 And I was saved.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.160
 Well, he took him over the counter.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.160
 It's amazing what you could get for two pennies in those days.

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.080
 He was-- I hadn't heard of him either.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.280
 And he was very famous in his time.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.160
 He was the first British actor to ever win an Academy

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.880
 award for a leading actor.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.720
 Yes, he won it as well for playing Benjamin Disraeli,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.080
 the British Prime Minister.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:48.920
 And he then won it again for years later for playing Benjamin

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.480
 Disraeli.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.920
 He played the same role and got given it twice.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.880
 He was the first person to do that reprising a role

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.360
 and getting it a second time.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.080
 And was that-- one was silent, wasn't it?

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.720
 And then the other one was a talky thing.

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.640
 Yeah, that's right.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.360
 And he also, Victor Hugoly, was very

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.560
 egotistical as well.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.840
 He had to do a court appearance once.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.120
 He was called to a just a court hearing

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.360
 and get to give a testament.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:17.280
 And he called himself the world's greatest living actor.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:21.000
 And to explain his statement, he said, you see, I'm on oath.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.360
 So he was a real kind of dick.

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.200
 I really like Victor Hugoly.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:30.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.920
 There was one other instance of his egotism

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.160
 that I read about was in a film called "The Man Who

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.520
 Played God," which was about a concert pianist who then

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.840
 fell on hard times.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.440
 But he stuck to the script totally,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.960
 except there was one bit of the script where the line was--

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.680
 someone came up to the pianist after the show

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.080
 and congratulated him on the performance.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.200
 And the line was, so glad you liked it.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:56.200
 And he changed it to, so glad you liked me.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.320
 Someone's just gone through the script and the film

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.400
 and gone, oh, he changed that, didn't he?

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.880
 Ah, man.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.000
 And so on autograph hunting, autograph collectors.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:06.520
 I didn't know this.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.440
 There is a magazine called "Autograph Collector,"

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.760
 which is all about collecting autographs, how to do it,

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.320
 how to get different people, and various tactics

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.400
 and things like that.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.480
 And they do a lot on the history of autograph collecting

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.560
 too, because some people sell them.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.320
 Obviously, some people collect loads and loads of them

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.480
 at the same time.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:21.680
 Yeah.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.600
 And they described one incident in 1934

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.880
 when the Australian cricket team came to England.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.120
 And in those days, they had to get the ship to England

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.000
 to play the ashes and so on.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.880
 And the junior batsman, Arthur Chippenfield,

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.160
 had to spend almost the entire journey on the steamship

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.400
 forging on bats and on cheese a paper,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.080
 the signatures of the rest of the team,

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.760
 who couldn't be asked to sign this paper.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.480
 Luckily, that was the last time the Australian team did anything

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.400
 fraudulent.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:51.520
 [APPLAUSE]

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:58.400
 And we will be touring Australia in May.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.240
 They weren't available, but some of them now come available.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.760
 It's really odd.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.880
 Wow.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.960
 And there was autograph hunter, quite a famous one,

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.840
 in his little area.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.320
 He was called Tommy Skullian.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.640
 He was an Irish grocery driver.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.880
 And his family are in tonight.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.440
 He devoted his whole lives to getting autographs.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:26.160
 He had more than 40,000 in total.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.240
 I had Picasso.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.240
 He had Franco.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.480
 He had Charles Manson.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.640
 He had the great wins.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.120
 Oh, so he wasn't discriminating.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.720
 In the whole Good V Evil metric.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.440
 I'll be honest, there's not much good in this list.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.840
 But he left a will, in the end, he died quite recently.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.920
 He left a will, and he bequeathed his collection

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.680
 to the Village Museum.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:53.320
 Unfortunately, in his hometown, there was no Village Museum.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.080
 So they auctioned it instead.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.280
 They have these people have been around so much longer

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.920
 than I imagined autograph hunters.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.120
 So they were particularly prevalent

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.920
 in the late 19th century, early 20th century.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.920
 And they were thought of as a total scourge.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.840
 So if you look back and old newspapers

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.040
 from the early 1900s, they're written

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.200
 about in such an awful way.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.480
 There was an article in New York Times in 1901

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.400
 that said autograph hunters excel in ways that are dark

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.800
 and tricks that are vain.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.520
 Mark Twain hated them.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:28.160
 Mark Twain had a letter pre-printed that explained his refusal

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.920
 when people wrote to him for an autograph.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.920
 And the letter explained that if he answered all these requests,

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.880
 he wouldn't have time to get anything else done.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:36.640
 And also, the asking for an autograph

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.680
 is asking for example of his writing.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.840
 And he's a writer.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.280
 So you're asking for example of his own work.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.200
 And he said, it wouldn't be fair to ask a doctor

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.880
 for one of his corpses to remember him by, would it?

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.840
 What a stupid analogy.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.520
 The corpse is another work that doctors produce.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.800
 Well, some very bad doctors.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:00.240
 Some of them doctors, yeah.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.200
 I just made this.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.600
 So you're free to try the mouth, the mouth,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.480
 the mouth, the mouth, the mouth, and we'll love it.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.440
 Two more things about your statement.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.440
 Yes, yes, you are.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.040
 Firstly, sometimes artists can help people with their art.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.240
 There was a-- I read that Mozart used to when he

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240
 was walking the streets.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.200
 If he came across someone who was homeless,

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.040
 asking him for money, there's one instance

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.240
 that's recorded where he didn't have anything on him.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.760
 But he was so quick at writing music that he got a paper

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.600
 and pen composed a new piece, gave it to the person,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.600
 and said, there's a music publisher that will give you money

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.120
 for this, so take this there.

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.920
 That's point number one.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.160
 Point number two is that--

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.520
 That's amazing, Mozart.

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.560
 Yeah, Mozart.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.560
 Yes, yes, someone shouted out, "Jubian."

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.040
 But no, the other thing is that--

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.840
 so you said that Mark Twain said this, sent them this letter

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.520
 saying, I'm not going to sign you a signature.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.520
 Steve Martin, the comedian, actor, he does the same thing,

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.480
 but in a positive way.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.520
 So he doesn't do signatures, either.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:37:57.360
 What he does is if you meet Steve Martin,

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.680
 he gives you a card, a business card that's pre-signed,

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.200
 and on it is written the words, this certifies

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.240
 that you have had a personal encounter with me,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.440
 and that you found me warm, polite, intelligent, and funny.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.800
 That's great.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.400
 And that's what he gives everyone who meets him.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.120
 Last year, there was a collection of Beatles autographs,

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.760
 which sold for £2,000, even though three of them were fake.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.520
 OK?

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.800
 And the reason they sold for £2,000 is

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.200
 that they were all done by John Lennon.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:31.200
 Oh, cool.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.360
 Because in the early days, sometimes they

00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.600
 went all there or only one of those who would just fake it.

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:35.600
 Yeah, that's cool.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.200
 So he was doing a prank at the time, because he may blame--

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:40.040
 Well, he kind of got them almost all right.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.400
 He got George and Ringo bang on, but he

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.120
 didn't really bother with Paul.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.120
 Even in the early days, the signs were there of the car.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.280
 I went on to eBay to look for the most expensive autographs

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.560
 at the moment.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.560
 The most expensive one, when I checked, which was a day ago,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.000
 was £351,493.85.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.280
 And it was, looks like you're going to guess, Andy.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.120
 Is this live or dead?

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.640
 Dead.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.440
 Male or female?

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.040
 Male.

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:08.880
 Thank you.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:09.800
 Him or the eighth?

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.640
 No.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.960
 Oh, god, god, god, god.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.440
 Oh, god, god.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.920
 You've tried the two biggies.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.520
 How do you get your guitar list?

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.920
 You're just not going to guess.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.520
 Oh, OK.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.360
 Who is it?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:23.440
 Actually, I think he's dead.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.760
 Hugh Heffner.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:25.760
 Yes, yes, yes.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.760
 He died last year.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.400
 £3,150,000.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.960
 So he's--

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.800
 He's a Hugh Heffner.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.640
 I know, I know.

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:34.200
 It's a number one edition of Playboy, with his signature on.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.800
 But that is £351,000.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.960
 Bob Dylan signed handwritten lyrics to Leica Rolling Stone,

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.360
 only £140,597.54.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.720
 It's still a lot of money, guys.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.880
 Don't be too outraged.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:50.760
 It's a lot of people are going, oh, I'm sure, lose change.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:54.200
 But a fifth, a fifth, the price of the Hugh Heffner one,

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.320
 for £70,000, you can get the Apollo 11 space-flow

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.600
 US flag signed by all three astronauts on the Apollo 11.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.360
 All right, that actually we could share between us all of us.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.320
 We've been in a tenor each.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.360
 We can do it.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.360
 And then we'll have to have an incredibly complicated

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.840
 time share.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.760
 And the lowest prices, £75,000,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.840
 an EastEnders signed photo of Simon Williams,

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.240
 who plays Hugo in EastEnders.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:26.600
 He's actually got an exclamation mark up to it.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.640
 Actually, I've never heard of him.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.480
 We ages ago, when our vinyl came out,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.360
 we went to a record shop and did a signing at a record shop,

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.360
 and we did a few signatures on ones that they hand-sold

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.080
 that they were going to keep online in their store.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.480
 So we checked if they were still in stock online, they were.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:52.840
 The unsigned vinyl was £19.99.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.160
 The signed vinyl was £20.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.600
 We are worth between us one penny.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600
 Wow.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.600
 [APPLAUSE]

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.840
 I will be signing that to the show tonight.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.440
 Just on the astronauts, Apollo 11 thing,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.280
 one of the things that was a contingency for the families

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.320
 of the Apollo 11 space mission was that Neil Armstrong,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.200
 Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins signed a lot of signatures

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.040
 to give to their family so that if they didn't make it back,

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.040
 the families could sell the signatures

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:30.400
 to make money to keep the family going OK.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.360
 They signed hundreds of signatures going,

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.920
 if we don't make it back, sell these.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.400
 And this will help my family continue.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.480
 Yeah.

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.200
 Stephen King.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.040
 That's very sad.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.320
 It's not sad.

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.320
 They were OK.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:49.240
 Oh, that's spoiling me.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:52.240
 He's only one type for 30 years.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.040
 He's only on Apollo 10.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.440
 The next one's really good.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:03.800
 It is one of the few where the sequels get better and better.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.560
 We're going to have to wrap up shortly.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.440
 There's one amazing story about autographs

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.280
 that Stephen King tells was watching him give a talk on stage

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.320
 about this thing that happened when he was 26 years old.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.000
 And he'd never been recognized and asked

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.440
 for an autograph before.

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.080
 It was in his early days, and he was in a restaurant.

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.200
 And he was really sick.

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.000
 He was really ill.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.600
 He had some kind of horrible stomach bug.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.640
 And so he had to be really close to the bathrooms at all times.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:30.000
 And at one point, he had to rush to the bathrooms.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.160
 And he went in.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.840
 And I don't know what kind of weird restaurant this was,

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.320
 but there were no doors on the bathroom on the toilet stalls.

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.400
 So he just had to have his stomach complaint

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.320
 and full view of the rest of the bathroom.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.160
 And so he went in, and he sort of explosively

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.320
 shat all into this toilet.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.600
 Zombie, zombie.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.760
 He'll tell a sign.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.600
 And he did this, and he's feeling terrible.

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.640
 He was saying he was on this toilet door opening.

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:57.080
 Things can't get any worse.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.680
 And there was a toilet attendant in there

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.600
 who he said was about 180 years old.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:04.160
 And while he was in the middle of this awful experience,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.000
 the toilet attendant came up to him

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.160
 with a pallopaper and a pen and said,

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.120
 "On you, Stephen King?"

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.120
 "Come have your autograph please, mate."

00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.880
 So Stephen King gave his first requested autograph

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.920
 on the Lou while having diaries.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:22.200
 [APPLAUSE]

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.360
 Very cool.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.160
 Thank you.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.800
 OK, that is it.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.640

 Where's one at?

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.320
 The fact is, the fact is that Adolf Hitler's brother, Alwa,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.440
 used to work at the Shellborne Hotel in Dublin,

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.520
 where he was known, where he was known, as Paddy Hitler.

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.880
