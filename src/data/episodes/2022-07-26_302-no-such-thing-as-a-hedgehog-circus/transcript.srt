1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,220
 Hi everyone, James here.

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,380
 Now, before we start this week's show,

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,420
 Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,940
 I hope you've had a great Christmas.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,780
 When I edit every single week,

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,620
 there's sometimes bits that are just

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,680
 don't quite fit in with the rest of the show.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,920
 But maybe they're just really interesting.

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,380
 Maybe they're really funny and they don't fit in.

11
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,380
 Maybe it's just one incredible joke about hedgehogs

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,420
 that was just so good.

13
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,820
 I thought it would detract from the entire rest of the show

14
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,100
 if I left it in and so I took it out.

15
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,700
 I take all those bits, I snuffle them away

16
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,260
 like a hedgehog does with nuts or whatever it is

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,340
 that hedgehog's eat.

18
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,820
 And then at the end of the year,

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,060
 I put them all together for the best off show.

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,420
 And this one is a real bumper special.

21
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,780
 It's over an hour.

22
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,300
 I really hope you enjoy it.

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,060
 It's us just messing around

24
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,740
 and we'll see you in the new year

25
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,660
 with one of our normal shows.

26
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,060
 But in the meantime, enjoy this one and happy new year.

27
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,660
 (dance music)

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:14,740
 Hello and welcome to another episode

29
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,780
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast.

30
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,980
 - Can't be what I do.

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,340
 (laughing)

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,420
 - I don't know if I'm doing it too.

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,260
 Is that okay?

34
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,100
 - I just try to put you up.

35
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,940
 - Oh, okay, cool.

36
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,180
 - That's because I think you're like,

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,060
 it's the volume thing.

38
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,620
 So I'm like, oh shit, shall I just start again?

39
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,820
 - No, no, it's just being a dick.

40
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,940
 - Cool, all right.

41
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,260
 - What?

42
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,380
 - Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins,

43
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,060
 as in the first Siamese twins to be written about

44
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,180
 in the West, they were really interesting.

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,340
 So they had a system where they were both married

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,580
 and they would spend three nights each with each wife.

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:48,020
 And their great, great granddaughter

48
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,340
 was the first, was the youngest ever recipient

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,980
 of a Pulitzer Prize for music.

50
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,300
 - But yeah, how weird is that?

51
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,300
 2013, and yeah.

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,140
 - Do you know her name?

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,060
 - Yeah, she's called Caroline Shaw.

54
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,900
 Do you know her?

55
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,740
 - Never heard of it.

56
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,660
 - Oh, okay.

57
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,380
 She's done work with Kanye West.

58
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,220
 - How's she?

59
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,060
 - Do you know him?

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,900
 - Never heard of him.

61
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,660
 (laughing)

62
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,220
 But the thing that toured Chang and Eng apart

63
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,700
 is that Chang developed a drinking problem,

64
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,820
 quite late in life.

65
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,660
 - Suddenly.

66
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,660
 - Suddenly.

67
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,420
 - Suddenly, hang on a few developer drinking problem.

68
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,460
 Surely your Siamese twin also developed

69
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,660
 a drinking problem.

70
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,020
 - They were only, they were joined at the chest.

71
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,660
 So I think they had different livers.

72
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,500
 - Okay.

73
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,460
 - But it's not quite annoying

74
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,580
 if you're constantly attached to a drunk.

75
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
 (laughing)

76
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,420
 - Yeah, to be about it.

77
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,180
 - Oh, I've been touring for a while, yeah.

78
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,180
 (laughing)

79
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,100
 - There's one thing that Sonny Day is good for.

80
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,620
 Well, actually, there's loads of stuff.

81
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,180
 (laughing)

82
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,140
 Okay, well, nice swim, a sunbathe,

83
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,380
 but mostly asking someone out.

84
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,140
 So it's good to ask someone out on a date,

85
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,860
 and this is a French study, obviously,

86
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,500
 and this French study found one attractive man,

87
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,060
 and they sent him round to ask out strangers.

88
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,820
 - How did they find one of those in France?

89
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,740
 (laughing)

90
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,660
 - They had to recruit one from Scotland.

91
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,340
 (laughing)

92
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,180
 Sorry, Scotland.

93
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,540
 - We're looking forward to have a date next week.

94
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,300
 (laughing)

95
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,380
 - I don't mean that.

96
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,820
 - So yeah, they recruited this attractive French man,

97
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,260
 and made him ask out lots of strangers on the street,

98
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,820
 and they found a huge difference.

99
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,540
 So when it was Sonny, 22.4% gave him a positive response,

100
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,820
 and when it was cloudy, so not rainy, just cloudy,

101
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,660
 then 13.9% did.

102
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,940
 - That is quite a big difference.

103
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,140
 - But they did warn that it's not necessarily

104
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,260
 that we feel more prone to say yes on sunny days,

105
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,460
 it might be that your flirting skills improve in the sunshine.

106
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,380
 - It could be also that he was very bad her die,

107
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,300
 and when it rains, it kind of washes down his face.

108
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,980
 And everyone's like, "No, I'm not gonna come out with you,

109
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,060
 "you just got ink all over your face."

110
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,220
 - It's not raining.

111
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,260
 - Maybe when it's cloudy.

112
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,100
 - It's cloudy.

113
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,100
 - We don't know about this guy,

114
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,140
 'cause maybe when it's cloudy,

115
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,300
 he insists on wearing his Donald Duck shaped raincoat.

116
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,540
 (laughing)

117
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,940
 - That's his one with his white coat.

118
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,300
 - Donald Duck actually is a very sexy character.

119
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,860
 (laughing)

120
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,740
 - Are you sure he's the right guy for this study?

121
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,940
 (laughing)

122
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,780
 I don't see him making a difference.

123
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,340
 - Trance is off, he's ready to go.

124
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,540
 (laughing)

125
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,980
 - In France, there's been robots that have been designed

126
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,460
 to help out with any kind of fights

127
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,020
 that might happen between, let's say, football teams

128
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,780
 who happen to be watching the match in the same area.

129
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,180
 So in this case, there was a match going on

130
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,100
 between Russia and England.

131
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,820
 And there was a robot put in place called Alentom,

132
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,820
 or a Lantom, and the robot's job was to basically stop the fight,

133
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,620
 but not only that, they can see by using data

134
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,380
 whether or not it thinks a fight is about to break out.

135
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,580
 So it can alert the police if it thinks

136
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,900
 that something is gonna go wrong.

137
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,260
 Unfortunately, before it could do any of that stuff

138
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,020
 at this match, someone beat it with a baseball bat.

139
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,460
 (laughing)

140
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,860
 Yeah, and they couldn't revive it.

141
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,100
 So that was Alentom's career.

142
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,060
 - Is that because Alentom has had a rough time?

143
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,740
 Is that the same instant that there's a video of on YouTube,

144
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,020
 which is where people are in Russia and in Moscow, in fact.

145
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,500
 And there's a home video of people who are driving

146
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,900
 in their car, nor people got a video.

147
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,620
 And they see someone drive out in front of them

148
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,220
 in a side car, with a side car.

149
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,740
 So on a bike with a side car, and in the side car is a robot.

150
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,100
 So there's some chuckling in the car that we're in,

151
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,820
 as the viewer, 'cause they're like, "What the fuck is that robot doing?"

152
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,620
 And then they see that robot get cut up by another car,

153
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,820
 and then both disappear around a corner,

154
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,900
 and then you as the viewer, so these guys in the car

155
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,500
 with their home video, follow it around that corner.

156
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,100
 And at that point, the bike with the side car has disappeared,

157
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,420
 and Alentom, slash Alentom, we'll never know, he's dead now.

158
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,340
 Spoiler, it's just standing by the side of the road,

159
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,460
 and the guy who's caught him up gets out of his car,

160
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,220
 pulls the baseball bat from his passenger seat,

161
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,620
 goes up to him and knocks his head off.

162
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,980
 - Oh, I've not seen the footage, yeah.

163
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,340
 - So is this, like, like, yeah.

164
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,180
 - It could be, it wasn't a football match.

165
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,940
 - No, I should quickly say, this was in Moscow,

166
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,140
 I said it was in France, this was in Moscow,

167
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,780
 and it was during the 2016 matches of the World Cup.

168
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,260
 But what happened to Alentom is they set up the first ever

169
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,860
 robot symmetry to bury him in.

170
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
 Yeah, it was seen as like, "Don't do this to robots."

171
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,900
 - Have you seen it?

172
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,300
 - No, I've not seen anything apparently.

173
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
 (laughing)

174
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,420
 - If this robot's symmetry, I look at these pages.

175
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,460
 - I said, "I click on it, I don't just close my eyes

176
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,900
 "and hope for the best."

177
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,740
 Right, this symmetry.

178
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,100
 (laughing)

179
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,580
 No, this symmetry is a piece of shit.

180
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,900
 If it's made to give robots a proper burial,

181
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,620
 it says it was spied by the murder of Alentom.

182
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,540
 And it's called a symmetry.

183
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,740
 If you look it up, it's a cardboard box

184
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,900
 full of parts of robot.

185
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
 It's in the lobby area of some kind of random conference building.

186
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,620
 And she said, the person who said it, I've said,

187
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,700
 "It's great, the symmetry's been really popular,

188
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,500
 "we're already getting lots of requests from people

189
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,260
 "to bring in their own dead tech,

190
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,740
 "like a red toy car and some batteries."

191
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,260
 - Wow.

192
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,500
 - It's a plastic bag.

193
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,540
 - If you're a hedgehog who's running a circus,

194
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,260
 don't say roll up, roll up.

195
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,300
 (laughing)

196
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,820
 - No one's gonna come, we're just gonna stop that.

197
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,060
 - Really boring circus.

198
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:06,900
 - Yeah.

199
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,660
 - There was another Elizabeth Taylor,

200
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,340
 as well as the famous one who Kingsley Amos said

201
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,260
 was one of the best English novelists

202
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,060
 born in this century, in the 20th century.

203
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,700
 And she was, the problem with her obviously,

204
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,020
 she had the same name as this extremely famous Elizabeth Taylor.

205
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,500
 And when her book Mrs. Lippincote came out in 1945,

206
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,540
 it was almost the same time as National Velvet came out

207
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,020
 for Elizabeth Taylor, the actress.

208
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,300
 And then they interviewed her towards the end of her life.

209
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,780
 And she said, I've had a rather uneventful life, thank God.

210
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,580
 But sometimes the more eventful world intrudes into my life,

211
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,860
 I get fan letters to the other Elizabeth Taylor.

212
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,100
 Men write to me and ask for a picture of me in my bikini.

213
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,220
 My husband thinks they should send one to shake them,

214
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,260
 (laughing)

215
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,820
 but I have not got a bikini.

216
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,580
 (laughing)

217
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,020
 - So actually it's like insulting from your husband

218
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,260
 saying how you could really repel these people,

219
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,820
 is actually send that photo love.

220
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,620
 - I've got a fact about people who are interested

221
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
 in Nazi memorabilia.

222
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,540
 - So there is one guy who, he does just seem to be an obsessive collector,

223
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,020
 but the Guardian profiled him a few years ago.

224
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,540
 He's called Kevin Weakroft.

225
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,420
 And he grew up a multi-millionaire.

226
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,620
 He's the editor of a huge fortune.

227
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,300
 And he has the world's largest collection of Nazi memorabilia.

228
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,340
 He sleeps in Hitler's old bed,

229
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,820
 which he says he has changed the mattress.

230
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,380
 (laughing)

231
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,180
 - But he used a Lisa mattress.

232
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,620
 - No, no, no.

233
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,700
 - But he has the last time they asked us.

234
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,300
 (laughing)

235
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,220
 - He owns 88 tanks,

236
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,620
 which is more than the Danish and Belgian armies combined.

237
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,980
 - Wow. - Yeah.

238
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,380
 - Jesus, so they're quaking in their boots.

239
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,980
 The idea he might invade?

240
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,260
 - Yeah, I mean it's more the historical pieces, obviously,

241
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,460
 and they wouldn't be much good today

242
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,660
 for invading anywhere.

243
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
 - Okay.

244
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,580
 It is weird, isn't it, collecting Nazi memorabilia?

245
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,860
 You've got to ask some questions, I think.

246
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,580
 - They did ask him a lot of questions.

247
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,380
 (laughing)

248
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,060
 - Well, they're doing the right thing.

249
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
 (laughing)

250
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
 - But they concluded he was just,

251
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,820
 you know, he was a collector rather than a Nazi, you know?

252
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,340
 - If you ask some questions and people answer them,

253
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
 that's absolutely fine.

254
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
 I'm just saying you've got to ask the questions.

255
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,100
 - There are lots of things he could collect though.

256
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,940
 Why did he choose that?

257
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,060
 Did they ask that question?

258
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,820
 - I can't remember what his answer was,

259
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,180
 but I'm sure it was a good one.

260
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,020
 (laughing)

261
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,740
 - I'm sorry, really like the nonsense.

262
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,940
 - And wish they were back.

263
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,540
 (laughing)

264
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,340
 (laughing)

265
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,540
 - I was reading that, so I was looking into

266
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,380
 just general shrimp, like eating shrimp particularly,

267
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,540
 'cause they're eating it on the space station.

268
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,060
 Did you know that there are shrimp recipes available

269
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,820
 from the rapper Kulio?

270
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
 (laughing)

271
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,660
 I did not know that.

272
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,980
 - Yeah.

273
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,220
 He released a cookbook a few years back,

274
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,420
 called How to Become a Kitchen Pimp.

275
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,420
 And it's got, I mean, there's great chapters.

276
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,740
 Appetizers for that ass, Saladied in Bitches,

277
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,980
 Vegetarians, Question Mark, okay, whatever.

278
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,820
 That's it.

279
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,500
 (laughing)

280
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,180
 And then he has a whole chapter for shrimps,

281
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,860
 which is called It's Hard Out Here for a Shrimp,

282
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,860
 which is, some will know, is a famous song,

283
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,780
 It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.

284
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,900
 Yeah, so, and there's videos of people trying out

285
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,940
 his recipes and he doesn't come across great

286
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,900
 with his choices of what to do.

287
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,020
 But yeah, but if anyone needs a Kulio Shrimp recipe,

288
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
 yeah, it's there.

289
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,060
 (laughing)

290
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,420
 - It's what a lot of people here came for to buy that thing.

291
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,660
 (laughing)

292
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,420
 - So Hedgehogs, there's a Hedgehog Olympic Games,

293
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,940
 which is from, I found this out of a book

294
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,500
 called A Prickly Affair, which is by a guy

295
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,020
 who's really into Hedgehogs.

296
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,900
 But he was talking, I think they're in America somewhere

297
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,500
 and he was saying one of the competitors

298
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,620
 is a guy called Zug Standing Bear,

299
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,860
 who was one of Gerald Ford's bodyguards.

300
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,380
 And he's now a champion,

301
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,580
 and he now has a champion hog called Buttercup,

302
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,540
 which he can piece at the Olympic Games.

303
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,300
 And he reported of another one,

304
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,500
 who's a woman called Dawn Robelle,

305
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,780
 who says that she communicates telepathically

306
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,860
 with her Hedgehogs.

307
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,340
 - This has got to be a cheat too, isn't it?

308
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
 - Yeah.

309
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,020
 - You can't do that.

310
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,060
 - Is it in the human Olympic rules

311
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,420
 that you can't communicate telepathically?

312
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,340
 - No, telepathically, yes, yeah.

313
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,500
 Because what would you say as well?

314
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,020
 Try the traveling really far, you know?

315
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,300
 - Yeah, faster, you're saying faster.

316
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,140
 - You can't cheat in the Olympics.

317
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,060
 Well, actually, we have learned over the years,

318
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
 definitely not.

319
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,740
 (laughing)

320
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,860
 You can't cheat by whispering in someone's ear

321
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,860
 with the Olympics.

322
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,340
 But she does say that her Hedgehogs

323
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,340
 call themselves star children.

324
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,500
 - They call themselves that.

325
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
 - Yeah, they refer to themselves.

326
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,940
 - Oh, I see, telepathically, yeah, yeah.

327
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,900
 Sorry, what are the events at the Hedgehog Olympic Games?

328
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,100
 - I think sort of racing and chopping and jumping.

329
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,500
 I actually don't, so I didn't read in this article,

330
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,860
 he didn't detail what the events were.

331
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,700
 - Okay.

332
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,540
 - Why the Hedgehog races?

333
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,580
 Because they run quite fast.

334
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,420
 - Yeah, yeah.

335
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,300
 - Surprisingly, yeah, not as fast as humans.

336
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,860
 - No, you could beat a Hedgehog, yeah.

337
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,660
 - That's why the inter-human and Hedgehog Olympics

338
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,500
 have never taken up.

339
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,260
 - But actually, what people don't know is

340
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,780
 that Hedgehogs are allowed to take part

341
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,540
 in the human Olympics, but they just never qualified.

342
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,380
 - That is slow.

343
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,220
 - Yeah, yeah.

344
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,220
 - You never reached a qualified type.

345
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,500
 (laughing)

346
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,500
 - I found just a couple of animal smells.

347
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,940
 So male silkworm moths, they can sense a single molecule

348
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,340
 of female sex hormone from a mile away.

349
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,820
 - I'd never understand what they mean.

350
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,660
 - I know, I don't know.

351
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,020
 I'll say that because presumably you need the molecule

352
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,780
 to get into your nose before you sense it.

353
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,380
 And so how can it be a mile away?

354
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,420
 I've just never understood that.

355
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,700
 It's the same with sharks and blood.

356
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,820
 - Yeah, just don't get it.

357
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,660
 - Yeah, I know.

358
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,500
 That's the thing.

359
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,060
 All the things I read about animals smelling it,

360
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,700
 like, albatross can smell fish from the air.

361
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
 - That makes a lot of sense.

362
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,260
 Because that's the scent molecules that are the problem.

363
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,100
 So the scent molecules are coming off the fish.

364
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,940
 That's fine.

365
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,780
 Then it goes through the air

366
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,140
 and then up to the albatrosses knows.

367
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,060
 But if you're smelling a molecule,

368
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,940
 that's the thing that causes you to smell, if it's a mile away.

369
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,340
 - I think it's a distance, though,

370
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,620
 with the albatrosses, what is amazing scientists,

371
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,460
 because the molecules break up with whatever direction,

372
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,620
 the wind is blowing in.

373
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,460
 - It is incredible.

374
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,940
 But at least we understand how it's possible.

375
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,540
 - I guess it must be that the molecule is entering

376
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,780
 that was it a moth, did you say?

377
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,620
 - Yeah.

378
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,980
 - It must be that they can,

379
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,220
 when a molecule released by a female,

380
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,380
 a mile away gets in their nose,

381
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,380
 they can tell the direction has come from

382
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,060
 or it retains its potency or they can still detect it,

383
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,300
 even though it's traveled a mile.

384
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,140
 - Yeah.

385
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,220
 - It must be something like that.

386
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,100
 - You can't smell a molecule from them.

387
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,380
 A mile away from the molecule.

388
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,700
 - But that's the thing, it's like when you're in the sea

389
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,260
 and you cut your finger, right?

390
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,460
 And there's a tiny little blood goes in the sea,

391
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:35,060
 then supposedly, Jaws is able to tell it's there

392
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,460
 from like 10 miles away, right?

393
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,500
 That's the whole point of it.

394
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,340
 - Yeah.

395
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,700
 - But Sholly has to wait for the blood to get to him.

396
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,820
 - Which will take ages, right?

397
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,980
 If it's traveling through water.

398
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,860
 - Well, current, though, current's happened.

399
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,700
 - Yeah.

400
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
 (laughing)

401
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,100
 - It's like me looking at that wall

402
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,420
 on the other side of the room and saying,

403
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,300
 "I can feel that from here."

404
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,900
 And it just doesn't, in order to feel it,

405
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,740
 it has to come to you.

406
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,260
 - You don't necessarily have to go to it.

407
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,100
 - Exactly.

408
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
 We have to meet.

409
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,860
 (laughing)

410
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,740
 - I mean, Anna, that was a stunningly vivid example

411
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,940
 of that wall on the other side of the room.

412
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,780
 (laughing)

413
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,980
 Where do you get these ideas from?

414
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,820
 - I don't know.

415
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,460
 - I'm a creative kind of guy.

416
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,100
 (laughing)

417
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,020
 - Did you know the ISS is battery powered?

418
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,860
 - I didn't know that.

419
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,700
 - Is it AA or triple A?

420
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
 (laughing)

421
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,980
 - There are actually no A's at all.

422
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,620
 They are the size of fridges, the batteries on the ISS,

423
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,500
 but sometimes they have to change the batteries.

424
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,340
 - How do you do that?

425
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,980
 - So you take these fridges out,

426
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,540
 you rub them a few times, and then you put them back in again.

427
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,140
 - So there are 48 batteries,

428
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,500
 and it's for when the stations are in shadow,

429
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,460
 'cause there are big solar cells for when it's in sunlight.

430
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,540
 But these are nickel hydrogen batteries,

431
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,580
 and they are slowly being swapped over

432
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,460
 for new kinds of batteries, which are run on lithium.

433
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,860
 So they all have to be changed.

434
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,180
 And you get two astronauts out there

435
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,220
 who have to take a fridge out of position,

436
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,780
 carry it back to the right place,

437
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,780
 and then put the new one in, which is--

438
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,820
 - Yeah, it really is.

439
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,060
 And they have to strap them to a pallet.

440
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,020
 They weigh about 200 kilos, but obviously in space,

441
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,740
 you don't feel that.

442
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,100
 However, that is stressful.

443
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,500
 And also, if you slightly dent the back of it,

444
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,660
 the connection bit, it won't fit in,

445
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,220
 and then you're absolutely stuffed,

446
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,660
 and they're trained, obviously, and taught about it,

447
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,620
 but a lot of them change the batteries

448
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,380
 without having practiced it.

449
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,260
 - Yeah, practice that kind of thing.

450
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,100
 - Yeah.

451
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,300
 - Gone work in MFI for a week and a half,

452
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
 maybe in French is around.

453
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
 I remember reading earlier this year

454
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
 that there are massive batteries

455
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,220
 all around the British countryside,

456
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,060
 which we use whenever our electricity goes off.

457
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,500
 Do you remember there was a massive power cut?

458
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,420
 Two things got hit at the same time,

459
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,860
 and loads of people went off.

460
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,620
 Apparently, what happens then is these batteries kicking,

461
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,140
 and they're just kind of hanging around.

462
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,700
 There's like about 50 of them, absolutely massive batteries.

463
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,500
 That's so cool.

464
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,340
 - Isn't it cool?

465
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,700
 - I didn't really read any more about them,

466
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,940
 so I don't know how to tell you anything.

467
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,580
 - It's the way you're painting it.

468
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,380
 I'm now sort of imagining a real walking,

469
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,140
 finding a giant gyro cell,

470
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,860
 and a funny battery just standing up in a field.

471
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,380
 - That's what I imagine it is.

472
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,580
 Let's assume it's that.

473
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,860
 - I was, this is not a fact.

474
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,340
 It was just a thought I had today,

475
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,980
 which is what happens to rain when it rains on a cloud?

476
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:13,820
 - Oh.

477
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,220
 - So you get higher clouds and lower clouds.

478
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,740
 Does it get collected by the lower cloud,

479
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,860
 like a sponge, or does it go through the clouds?

480
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,060
 Like it darts through and just passes through the...

481
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,740
 - Some of it might become the cloud,

482
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,260
 or some of it might go down through the cloud.

483
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,900
 - It's such a good question.

484
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 - It's a good question.

485
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,740
 - Clouds are not like sponges, I should say.

486
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,940
 - No, but I guess 'cause it's water,

487
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,500
 I just didn't know if it just sort of collected

488
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,260
 like a, like a sky puddle, basically.

489
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,060
 - It probably depends, yeah.

490
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,220
 - It probably depends how big the droplets are.

491
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,860
 - Clouds are very small droplets.

492
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,860
 By the time it's big enough to fall as a raindrop,

493
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,020
 that's really big, isn't it?

494
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,860
 - It's gotten quite heavy.

495
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,180
 So actually, yeah, that's right.

496
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,340
 So it will be too big.

497
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,500
 If it's big enough to be falling,

498
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,860
 it'll be too big to be staying as a cloud.

499
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,940
 - And it also, yeah.

500
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,300
 And it would never rain on a cloud.

501
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,260
 Anyway, would it, would any of us snow on a cloud?

502
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,100
 - No, it isn't.

503
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,260
 - Basically, rain on it.

504
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,900
 - Does it all rain start out with snow?

505
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,740
 - Yep.

506
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,580
 - No.

507
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,180
 - It's always, if it's raining outside,

508
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,660
 it's all snow, which happens to have melted on the way down.

509
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,500
 - You're kidding.

510
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,340
 - It's always snowing.

511
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,180
 - Look at it that way.

512
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,020
 - Yeah, that's very cool, didn't know that.

513
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,860
 - Yeah.

514
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,540
 - Just one more actual effect of climate change,

515
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,300
 as it's happening, is that some clouds may go extinct.

516
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,140
 - What?

517
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,620
 - Yeah, this is how big the effect we're having.

518
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,220
 So, Stratocumulus cloud decks,

519
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:27,620
 they're the very low clouds which reflect

520
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,860
 a lot of solar radiation back into space.

521
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,300
 And if there are, if levels of carbon dioxide

522
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,180
 go up much more, this might suppress

523
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,660
 the actual formation of these clouds.

524
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,140
 So you won't get them anymore.

525
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,300
 - Oh no.

526
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,580
 - We can no longer make hilarious animal shapes

527
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,180
 in our imaginations out of clouds in the sky.

528
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,660
 - Oh, we all still have clouds.

529
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,180
 It's just this one particular.

530
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,220
 It's not gonna be a sunny day after a single day.

531
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,540
 - But what if this one particular cloud

532
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,620
 is the only one that ever made those shapes?

533
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,620
 - Oh, absolutely, right.

534
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,460
 - Wow.

535
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,700
 - It could be the animal shape cloud.

536
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,020
 - Anna Toshinsky, really bringing home

537
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,820
 the eco crisis that we're in at the moment.

538
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,660
 - Yeah.

539
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,620
 You're welcome extinction rebellion.

540
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,220
 Say it loud and say it cloud.

541
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,060
 That's all right.

542
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,940
 (laughing)

543
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,940
 - I went on to the website CNN's most secretive jobs.

544
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,140
 And they had the usual things like spies

545
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,580
 and restaurant reviewers.

546
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,700
 Another one is a ward show auditor.

547
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
 - Oh.

548
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,380
 - Apparently you have to be very secretive with that.

549
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,220
 - What's that?

550
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,060
 - It's for results.

551
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,300
 So you don't tell, you know, you don't screw up

552
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,780
 and give, well, I'll land the right food.

553
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,380
 (laughing)

554
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,220
 Envelope.

555
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,740
 So what you need is a bachelor's degree

556
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,900
 in an accounting or related field

557
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,060
 and experience in accounting or auditing.

558
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,060
 That's all it says you need.

559
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,420
 And I've got both those things.

560
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,940
 - Need us to hold us.

561
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,780
 - Yeah.

562
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,620
 - Oh.

563
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,460
 (laughing)

564
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,900
 Apart from that, you're doing so well.

565
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,220
 - Damn it.

566
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,140
 - That's awesome.

567
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,540
 Hey, how about a made up language?

568
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,380
 - Yes.

569
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
 - It's called dothraki.

570
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,060
 - Oh yeah.

571
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,900
 - Yeah.

572
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,180
 - So all languages are made up.

573
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,380
 (laughing)

574
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,860
 Oh, here he goes again.

575
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,700
 (laughing)

576
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,860
 - Oh, conspiracy theorists.

577
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
 (laughing)

578
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,860
 - No, it's on point.

579
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,940
 (laughing)

580
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,980
 - That's very enough.

581
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,940
 - Sorry, okay, a recently made up language.

582
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,420
 - Made up language, yeah.

583
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,020
 So obviously so many people have heard it being spoken

584
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,780
 'cause it became the trans, you know, being big this year.

585
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,980
 So 10 to millions of people have been hearing it.

586
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,460
 It's more than Welsh, Irish, Gaelic, and Scotscale combined.

587
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,020
 But I did not know the language is full of little Easter eggs.

588
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,420
 So normally people speak it, actually speak it.

589
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,100
 One of them is the inventor, David Peterson,

590
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,140
 who's really, he sort of makes languages for Hollywood

591
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,580
 as his job.

592
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,420
 - Oh wow.

593
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,740
 - And obviously there are not many jobs in the world,

594
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,100
 but there are not many jobs in that industry

595
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,260
 because it's such a rare thing to be commissioned

596
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,340
 to make a full language.

597
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,900
 So he has a little fun with it.

598
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,140
 So the Dothraki word for eagle is culvert

599
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,140
 and that is based on Stephen Colbert.

600
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,220
 For reasons I didn't get to the bottom of, yeah.

601
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,780
 And there was, based on his wife,

602
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,180
 not Colbert's wife, David Peterson, the inventor.

603
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,660
 - The word for periatracting.

604
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,660
 (laughing)

605
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,700
 - So David Peterson's wife is called Erin.

606
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,420
 So in Dothraki, Erin means kind,

607
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,940
 or Erin act means kind one.

608
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,780
 - Cool.

609
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,780
 - Lucky it's not fucking bitter.

610
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,900
 (laughing)

611
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,140
 - Yes, he's really venting through these languages.

612
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,700
 - I think I read and I, so, I hope this is right,

613
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,300
 but I believe as well that he's a Monty Python fan.

614
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,420
 And so there's points when there's armies coming towards

615
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,020
 some like a scene in Game of Thrones

616
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,140
 where they're yelling at people coming towards them.

617
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,100
 He takes the words that were used in Monty Python

618
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,860
 and the Holy Grail when they're yelling,

619
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,660
 "You are French, Cal, you're whatever,

620
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,300
 "whatever those words I comment what they are."

621
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
 But yeah, it's Monty Python dialogue

622
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,060
 translated into Dothraki used, yeah.

623
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,020
 - So I've got a fact about modern trains,

624
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,980
 which is about the queen who, as we know, has the royal train.

625
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,900
 So when she's traveling on the royal train

626
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,380
 and when she's been traveling overnight,

627
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,460
 there's a special instruction that gets given out.

628
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,980
 And that is that the queen has a bath at 7.30 in the morning.

629
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,300
 So if the train is going then, the driver is ordered

630
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,180
 to, the driver is ordered to avoid any bumpy bits of track

631
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,620
 so that her bath doesn't slosh around too much.

632
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,620
 - Okay.

633
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,660
 - Bumpy tracks, first of all, do we have bumpy tracks?

634
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,660
 Or are they all full?

635
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,660
 - You get bumpy bits, don't you?

636
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,900
 - Yeah, it's trap corners.

637
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,900
 - And certainly, you don't get corners.

638
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,380
 - Well, like you do, not corner like round bits.

639
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,660
 - But secondly, how do you avoid the bumpy bits?

640
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,700
 You can't swerve in a train.

641
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,780
 - You can get lifted off onto a boat.

642
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,780
 - Then you gauge, then it comes back down there.

643
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,940
 - Yeah, I think the queen's freedom of movement

644
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,380
 is just severely limited as to where she can go.

645
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,060
 - She can only go to the flat bits.

646
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,260
 - She can only get to the flat bits.

647
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,140
 - The queen's going all directions.

648
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,260
 - It's a good point, yeah.

649
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,060
 - That's weird knowing when the queen has a bath.

650
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,500
 I think you'd be freaked out as the train driver.

651
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,220
 Every morning at 7.30 you'd think,

652
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,820
 "Oh, she's passing now."

653
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,100
 - Don't make any mistakes.

654
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,060
 - She's naked, and he adds for me.

655
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,500
 It's a weird thought.

656
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
 - It's a big train.

657
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,260
 - I don't think it's only 10 metres long.

658
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,100
 - She's like in the cab, in the tub.

659
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,100
 (laughing)

660
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,940
 - He puts the bath next to the driver's seat.

661
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,780
 - More coal.

662
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,780
 (laughing)

663
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,420
 - It's much bigger than the vehicle van.

664
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,020
 - One more thing about Luroll,

665
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,100
 which is more just a rant than in fact,

666
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,420
 coloured Luroll,

667
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,660
 disappeared off the face of the earth, right?

668
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,500
 - Uh-huh.

669
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,940
 - So, I think you can still buy it, can you?

670
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,780
 - You can still buy it.

671
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,980
 In 2004, it was 30% of Luroll that was sold.

672
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,820
 - Wow.

673
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,940
 - Now it's under 10%.

674
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,100
 And this, I was reading an article in the telegraph

675
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,140
 about why this has happened,

676
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,580
 about how angry people are about it,

677
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,140
 'cause people used to buy their Luroll

678
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,060
 to match their decor, right?

679
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,260
 And now, they did, that was a thing.

680
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,100
 There was someone who wrote into the telegraph saying,

681
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,300
 "Why is it impossible now to buy blue lavatory rolls?

682
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,340
 "Unless we find some soon,

683
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,540
 "I'll be forced to redecorate my bathroom."

684
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,940
 (laughing)

685
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,460
 - There was another one,

686
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,620
 corresponded in bletchingly,

687
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,620
 who described a priest friend

688
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,700
 who used to change the hue of his Lurolls

689
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,780
 to match the liturgical seasons.

690
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,500
 (laughing)

691
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,140
 - Green for Trinity, purple for Lent and Advent,

692
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,060
 and pink for Saint Stays.

693
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,940
 - Well, there's a lot of Saint Stays, isn't there?

694
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,540
 - Yeah, he was doing a lot of Luroll changing.

695
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,740
 - That is amazing.

696
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,900
 I suppose the other thing is,

697
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,140
 like you don't really get colored sinks

698
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,540
 and stuff like that, do you?

699
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,780
 Like in the '70s and stuff,

700
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,580
 you get avocado, sink, stuff.

701
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,340
 If that was the first time I knew the word avocado,

702
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,620
 'cause I didn't have avocados when I was growing up,

703
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,380
 you didn't really get them in the '70s and '80s.

704
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,220
 - Yeah.

705
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,660
 - But we used the word to describe the color

706
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,140
 of people's toilets.

707
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,380
 - Yes.

708
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,620
 - So when people started eating them.

709
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,860
 - I was so confused.

710
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,020
 (laughing)

711
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,420
 - You break your teeth.

712
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,660
 - I have one more drink

713
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,460
 that William of Orange drank.

714
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,980
 So I'm talking to William of Orange,

715
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,860
 who was married to Mary.

716
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,700
 So he was a King of England, there's a few other ones,

717
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,460
 but this is that one.

718
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,460
 He drank Benedictine Posit,

719
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,500
 which was a mixture of warm milk,

720
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,020
 eggs, cream, and ale,

721
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,020
 with nutmeg and custard on top.

722
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,980
 (laughing)

723
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,620
 And he drank this on his wedding day,

724
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,460
 'cause it was what?

725
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,460
 Everyone who was rich and posh used to drink

726
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,740
 on their wedding day.

727
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,860
 And the priest would come along, he would bless them,

728
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,820
 and then they would give them this benediction Posit,

729
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,700
 and people wouldn't leave until they drank it.

730
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,980
 Charles II waited until the bride and bridegroom

731
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,740
 had finished off their bowl of Posit

732
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,020
 and then drew the bed curtains himself

733
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,340
 on the day of their wedding.

734
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,180
 - Oh really?

735
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,940
 - So I read that he stayed in the room,

736
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,700
 shouting encouragement during the,

737
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,660
 there are lots of stories saying he was shouting

738
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,780
 during the consummation,

739
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,420
 but we've asked the team before that consummation

740
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,060
 doesn't mean they're actually having sex.

741
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,020
 I mean, the bride was only 15 at the time,

742
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,420
 but yeah, that's the story.

743
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,980
 - So Charles, we think Charles might have been there,

744
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,980
 'cause if he'd drawn the curtain,

745
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,820
 he could still have stayed on the outside shouting encouragement,

746
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,980
 couldn't he? - Yeah.

747
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,260
 - That's true.

748
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,100
 - You know when you were younger and just...

749
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,980
 - That's not what the story could have been.

750
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:47,820
 - Here we go.

751
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,660
 - You know when you're 15,

752
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,260
 I read a kid going good. (laughing)

753
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:52,260
 - Someone draws the curtain,

754
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,980
 but they still give you instructions.

755
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,780
 You know when you go to the Lou when you are kidding,

756
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,380
 you're just learning to go to the Lou on your own,

757
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,380
 and your mum stands on the other side of the door

758
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,180
 and she's like, you know, have you wiped your bottom?

759
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:03,500
 Maybe, so it was sort of like that,

760
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,980
 you pulled the curtain, but you're still outside saying,

761
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,260
 you know, put it there. - Put it there.

762
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:15,260
 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's the nostril. (laughing)

763
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,940
 - Splendid difference. (laughing)

764
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,580
 - There's another old Scottish one, which is,

765
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,500
 if you're fishing and you catch a boot,

766
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,460
 that can go either way for you.

767
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,340
 If it's a left boot, that's bad luck.

768
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,420
 You're in serious trouble.

769
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,580
 Fish are not gonna come to you.

770
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,500
 If you get a right boot, you're in much luck,

771
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,820
 and you have to nail it to your mass to say,

772
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,860
 "Look at my right boot, come fish."

773
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,860
 And that's, in both instances, you're in a cartoon.

774
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,460
 (laughing)

775
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,540
 - And in neither instance have you caught a fish,

776
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,980
 which presumably is the aim.

777
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,540
 (laughing)

778
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:54,020
 - Yes, but your boot business back home is going,

779
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,780
 you've caught a soul.

780
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,780
 (cheering)

781
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,860
 - Yeah.

782
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,620
 - I was quickly just on "Rudeness."

783
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,380
 I was reading Danny Wallace's book about "Rudeness,"

784
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,900
 which is called "Fuck you very much."

785
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,100
 The surprising truth about why people are so rude.

786
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,980
 And he did some of his own research,

787
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,300
 and he asked what people had done,

788
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,900
 'cause like I was saying, if people are rude to you,

789
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,780
 you automatically are rude back to them.

790
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,180
 It's the weird kind of contagion thing.

791
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,220
 He was asking people what they had done

792
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,260
 when someone had been rude to them.

793
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,540
 And answers included, "I rubbed fries on the windshield.

794
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,740
 I turned all their possessions upside down.

795
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,700
 I let a dog lick a sausage.

796
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,620
 I was serving them, (laughing)

797
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,700
 and I slept with their partner."

798
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,980
 (laughing)

799
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,820
 That's rude.

800
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,340
 - And was that all the same person?

801
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,420
 - Just kind of a very bad day.

802
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,380
 (laughing)

803
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,100
 - I was looking at flaws, some flaws.

804
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,700
 So the world's flattest flaw is owned by NASA.

805
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
 It's in Huntsville, Alabama,

806
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,900
 and it's made of this kind of resin.

807
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,260
 And it's a bit like, do you know these hockey tables?

808
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,100
 - Yeah.

809
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,620
 - So there's a cushion of air on it,

810
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,180
 and whatever what they do is they kind of get like a sofa on it,

811
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,460
 or anything, they'll can do it with anything,

812
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,220
 but the funnest one is a sofa.

813
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,100
 And they have little air coming out of the sofa,

814
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,620
 and then they push it along this extremely flat floor,

815
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,740
 and it just kind of glides along.

816
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,580
 - Ooh.

817
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
 - It's really, really awesome.

818
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,740
 And the way that, and what it's for is to see

819
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,260
 what it's like in space.

820
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,540
 So, (laughing)

821
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,140
 because it's like, there's no friction,

822
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,220
 so things just keep moving.

823
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,340
 And if you push them in one direction,

824
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,860
 they just keep moving.

825
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,980
 And I think we might have said before

826
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,900
 that NASA around there also has the world's biggest door,

827
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,180
 and they also have the world's most perfect balls,

828
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,980
 which is a pair of mathematically perfect spherical balls.

829
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,140
 If they are one point, they're really, really small.

830
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,740
 They're just 3.81 centimeters across.

831
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,300
 And if you scale them up to the size of the earth,

832
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,780
 then the highest hill on there will be 1.5 meters high.

833
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,780
 - Wow.

834
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,140
 - That's how perfect these balls are.

835
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,940
 And is that because they're such perfect spheres in space,

836
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,740
 they're imitating the sun?

837
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,260
 - Or just, they're using them for possible, future,

838
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,620
 joy or scopic motors.

839
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,140
 - They don't know what they're for, do they?

840
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
 (laughing)

841
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,580
 - Someone thought of the phrase

842
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,340
 the most perfect balls in the world,

843
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,020
 and they thought, better make those.

844
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,620
 (laughing)

845
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,060
 - You know the saying, beer before wine, you'll feel fine.

846
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,660
 - Oh, I thought it was.

847
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,740
 - Wine before beer feeling queer.

848
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,380
 - I always get mixed up.

849
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,740
 - Well, it turns out that neither of them works.

850
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:33,020
 And this is thanks to scientists who got 90 students drunk

851
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,780
 and found that none of them felt fine.

852
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,380
 (laughing)

853
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,020
 - No matter what, he was struck off.

854
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:38,860
 (laughing)

855
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,780
 - No matter what, he, combination.

856
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,220
 He got 90 volunteers, and they have.

857
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
 - I bet he did.

858
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
 (laughing)

859
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,020
 - They're only 70 people in his class.

860
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,260
 (laughing)

861
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,620
 - They all had two and a half points,

862
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,460
 there was a first group,

863
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,300
 we had two and a half points of logger

864
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,140
 and then four big glasses of white wine.

865
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,500
 And then the second group had the same drinks in reverse.

866
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,540
 So you've got beer, then wine, and wine, then beer.

867
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,820
 And then there was another group who had only beer or wine

868
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,220
 up to the same level.

869
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
 And they all felt terrible the next day.

870
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,820
 One and tell of them through up.

871
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:07,660
 And they--

872
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:08,540
 - A bunch of lightweights.

873
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:09,380
 (laughing)

874
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,540
 - I knew you guys would say that.

875
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,700
 (laughing)

876
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,580
 - Can I just say, while we're on trains,

877
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,500
 this is so outproposing, nothing.

878
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,500
 But when I was in Japan, I noticed that the train drivers,

879
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,580
 they always point and shout stuff at themselves

880
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,180
 while they're driving the train, wherever they go.

881
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
 So if you're near the front, you'll always see this

882
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,100
 'cause you can see the driver.

883
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,340
 And just every like three or four minutes,

884
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,500
 they'll just point at something

885
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,220
 that doesn't appear to be anything at all.

886
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,980
 And they'll just yell something that I don't understand, right?

887
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,820
 - Another yelling to the passengers or to--

888
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,180
 - No, they're yelling to themselves.

889
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,060
 And I read this today of what they were doing

890
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,300
 'cause I looked it up.

891
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,180
 They have a thing where every certain amount of time

892
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,260
 they point at like just a thing around the tracks.

893
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,460
 Doesn't matter what it is.

894
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,860
 And they shout where they are and what they're doing.

895
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,900
 And the reason they do it is so they can concentrate

896
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,860
 the whole way because if you're not doing that all the time,

897
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,100
 you're just kind of my daydream or something like that.

898
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,460
 But if every five minutes or so,

899
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,100
 you have to point and shout something.

900
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,020
 You're never gonna kind of not think about that.

901
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
 - That's wonderful.

902
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,180
 - Isn't that great? - That's great, yeah.

903
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,260
 - I think it's stupid.

904
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,300
 Does anyone have a read the story of Cry Wolf?

905
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,180
 What happens when there's actually, you know,

906
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,100
 a huge bomb in the middle of the track?

907
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,900
 And they're pointing and shouting,

908
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,140
 there's a bomb, everyone get off the train,

909
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,020
 everyone get off the train.

910
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,660
 And everyone's like, oh, it's just the standard

911
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,500
 five-minute-ly shouting fest, he does.

912
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,860
 Maybe he's shouting something, maybe he doesn't always shout

913
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,060
 bomb on the track.

914
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,100
 (laughing)

915
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,100
 Maybe he's normally shouting, I am concentrating now.

916
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,700
 But what I was thinking is, if you're driving

917
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,900
 on the motorway, then every time you go past a junction,

918
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,060
 if you were to point at it and shout the names of the places

919
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,500
 that junction goes to, then it would help you concentrate

920
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,060
 and you get less sleep at the wheel, I think,

921
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,220
 is a really good tip.

922
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
 - Okay, okay.

923
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,060
 - Also, your geography of the UK would probably improve.

924
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,820
 He's keep noticing all these irrelevant places.

925
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
 - Yeah, that's true.

926
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,340
 - Have you guys had a hook swinging?

927
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,180
 - No. - No.

928
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,140
 - This is another Indian ritual practiced in the 1890s,

929
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
 not very much in the 20th century,

930
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,500
 but basically, in order to make it rain, if there's a drought,

931
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
 farmers would find a willing volunteer

932
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,220
 and then they would sew large hooks into his back

933
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,260
 and they would lift him 50 feet into the air.

934
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,260
 - Sorry. - What?

935
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,220
 - You would be lifted up into the air on massive hooks.

936
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,780
 It's very, very, very painful.

937
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,140
 - To make it rain. - To make it rain.

938
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,540
 And it causes you lasting damage, obviously.

939
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,380
 It's extremely painful.

940
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,620
 However, you were allowed to keep the hooks afterwards.

941
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,460
 - By us.

942
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,500
 - But only for three months.

943
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,340
 - What?

944
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,700
 - You were allowed-- - Why would you keep them?

945
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,580
 - Well, you were allowed to keep the hooks

946
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,260
 and the cord and the knife for three months afterwards

947
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,940
 and beg with them and show people, look,

948
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,180
 I went through this for the community

949
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,140
 to show your bravery, but only for three months.

950
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,420
 - So when you said you had to find a willing volunteer,

951
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,100
 that actually does feel like the hardest part of it.

952
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,940
 - Where were they?

953
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,420
 Where were they finding these enthusiastic people?

954
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,580
 - It's a good point.

955
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,020
 Also, I would probably just trust that that was the guy

956
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,900
 who was held 50 feet in the air with hooks,

957
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,580
 even if he didn't have the amount of his back.

958
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,660
 I imagine he's a local celebrity.

959
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,980
 I imagine no one's like, oh, did that happen?

960
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,780
 Oh, okay, and I didn't read about that.

961
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:11,700
 - Actually, a lot of people thought that chess wasn't,

962
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,500
 well, a lot of people who thought that chess wasn't

963
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
 a particularly intellectual game,

964
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,260
 compared to something like West, for instance.

965
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,820
 And that was because the argument was

966
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,460
 that chess has a finite number of moves.

967
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
 There's only a certain number of moves you can make.

968
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,540
 It's quite a high number, but it's finite.

969
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,900
 And in West, you're playing with your wits

970
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,980
 and stuff like that.

971
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,940
 And it was kind of like, if you're doing something

972
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,940
 which is really regimented,

973
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,380
 maybe that doesn't help the creative part of your brain.

974
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,740
 That's what they used to say.

975
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,940
 Like, for instance, there was an argument

976
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,100
 in Scientific American in 1859

977
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,340
 that Napoleon the Great loved playing chess,

978
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,940
 but he was often beaten by a rough grocer in St. Helena.

979
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,780
 - What went rough in what way?

980
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,020
 - They didn't specify.

981
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,220
 (laughing)

982
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,540
 - It wasn't an asterisk.

983
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,700
 - It didn't shave much.

984
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,540
 - Right, okay.

985
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540
 - I don't really know what rough meant in those days.

986
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,140
 It says, now the Shakespeare Milton Newton

987
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,860
 or any of the great ones of Earth,

988
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,900
 acquired proficiency in chess playing,

989
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,900
 it seems to help people with an intuitive faculty

990
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,380
 for making the right moves.

991
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,220
 But at the same time,

992
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,300
 these people have often possess very ordinary faculties

993
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,940
 for other purposes.

994
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,460
 So they thought it was only a very specific kind of person

995
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,340
 who'd be good at chess and...

996
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,580
 - They wouldn't necessarily be good at other stuff.

997
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,220
 - Whereas Whist players.

998
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,060
 - Oh, yeah.

999
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,100
 - All of those people you mentioned were keen Whist times.

1000
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
 (laughing)

1001
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,500
 - I mean, if that's what they thought of chess,

1002
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,260
 imagine their response to angry birds.

1003
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,980
 (laughing)

1004
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,500
 - Well, you do know pop culture.

1005
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,580
 (laughing)

1006
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,060
 - No, pop culture.

1007
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,900
 I've read about it.

1008
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,620
 - There was another old rule that used to be in place,

1009
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,860
 which is that you could use a baseball bat

1010
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,740
 which had a flat side to it like a cricket bat.

1011
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,900
 - Oh, yeah.

1012
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,980
 - It was just to help with accuracy, I think.

1013
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,700
 But yeah, that was kicked out.

1014
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,260
 So that was between 1885 and 1893.

1015
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,660
 - I think that was for power, wasn't it?

1016
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,500
 - Wasn't it?

1017
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
 - Like you can get a bigger hit on it

1018
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,780
 if you've got that big flat surface area

1019
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,100
 and they ditched it straight away, I can't remember why.

1020
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,940
 - Yeah, I can't.

1021
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,020
 - Maybe it just made the game too easy.

1022
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,500
 - I think it was that.

1023
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,940
 - 'Cause in cricket, for instance,

1024
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,980
 full toss is a very easy ball to hit.

1025
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,820
 - Yeah.

1026
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,320
 - Yeah.

1027
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,020
 - Why then in cricket do they have the other side of the bat

1028
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,660
 in a triangle formation?

1029
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,420
 - Well, good question.

1030
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,460
 And I don't know the answer, but I would guess

1031
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,420
 that it's so that your sweet spot

1032
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,980
 is a thicker part of the bat.

1033
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,380
 So you want your edge to be very small

1034
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,860
 because you don't want to edge the ball

1035
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,260
 so they can catch it, but you do need it to be thick

1036
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,860
 so that if it hits it right in the middle,

1037
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,700
 it goes miles.

1038
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,180
 So you want it to be thick in the middle

1039
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,020
 and thin on the outside.

1040
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,220
 I don't know, for sure.

1041
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,740
 - I think it's because if you flip around the bat

1042
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,900
 the last minute, then you get a mental angle

1043
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,540
 on your bat, and that's exactly what they used to use,

1044
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,420
 but they've never used it, so that's right.

1045
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,380
 - I don't know why they don't use it anymore.

1046
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,100
 - Just this is just a brand in fact,

1047
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,940
 nothing to do what we're saying,

1048
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,020
 but just hedges.

1049
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,900
 We were doing a live gig the other day

1050
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,660
 and someone told us in the audience

1051
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,060
 that if you go to Liverpool,

1052
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,300
 there's a hedge of all the Beatles there

1053
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,500
 sitting outside the station,

1054
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,300
 but Ringo is really hated there.

1055
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,220
 So people keep trimming his head off,

1056
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,540
 and they have to weigh ages for Ringo's head to regrow

1057
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,020
 and that's someone immediately choss up again.

1058
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
 - So sad.

1059
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,300
 - On mud, so there's the disorder

1060
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,860
 where you eat soil or dirt, it's called peaker, I think,

1061
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,100
 where some people eat mud,

1062
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,180
 but in southern parts of the US,

1063
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,460
 eating mud is a traditional thing

1064
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,860
 that some people really enjoy,

1065
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,340
 and I didn't know this still happened,

1066
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,020
 but it does, so it's in southern states

1067
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,980
 like kind of Mississippi and Georgia,

1068
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,500
 real deep south-state,

1069
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,100
 and people eat kind of clay,

1070
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,300
 and it's a very specific thing called like white mud

1071
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,740
 or white clay in its clay-rich dirt,

1072
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,900
 and they love it,

1073
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,300
 and it's part of the diet,

1074
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,940
 it's often poorer families,

1075
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,020
 it's black and white families,

1076
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
 and there are various theories about where it came from,

1077
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,540
 but I was reading an article in the New York Times

1078
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,980
 from 1984 saying this is so tragic,

1079
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,300
 the tradition of mud eating will disappear

1080
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,900
 in the next generation,

1081
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,860
 and then an article from a couple of years ago,

1082
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,660
 it hasn't disappeared, guys.

1083
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,260
 It's still there.

1084
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,380
 - It's because it's like higher minerals and stuff.

1085
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,580
 - We don't really know.

1086
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,300
 I think it's, maybe it's just a traditional thing,

1087
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,700
 but they like the taste.

1088
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,860
 - Are there recipes?

1089
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,020
 - There are some recipes.

1090
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,700
 Well, sort of recipes,

1091
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,220
 if you count the fact that, for instance,

1092
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,060
 people who like it will keep it in jars

1093
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,620
 and sprinkle it with salt and vinegar.

1094
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,460
 - That's a recipe.

1095
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,300
 - Okay, yeah.

1096
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,140
 - That's a recipe.

1097
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,700
 - Well, I thought you said they like the taste of it,

1098
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,540
 why are they putting salt and vinegar on it?

1099
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,060
 - James, I like the taste of chips,

1100
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,380
 but that doesn't mean I don't enhance it.

1101
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,220
 - You're so right.

1102
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,980
 (all laughing)

1103
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:41,780
 Sometimes they substitute it for baking soda or for starch,

1104
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,340
 because they can't get to the right kind of soil,

1105
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,500
 the right kind of mud,

1106
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,140
 but apparently it's not quite the same.

1107
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,660
 And there was an interview with someone called Mrs. Glass,

1108
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,780
 who said she's been off the dirt for a full year,

1109
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:55,500
 even though she still gets really strong cravings,

1110
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,340
 but she's been off the dirt

1111
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,700
 'cause her husband said it makes her mouth taste like mud.

1112
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,300
 (all laughing)

1113
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,580
 Which does make sense.

1114
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,180
 - It is one of those pregnancy cravings

1115
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,020
 that you hear about.

1116
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,580
 - It is, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,780
 My mum had that.

1118
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,620
 - Could she?

1119
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,860
 - Yeah, mud and coal, I think, yeah.

1120
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,380
 - She didn't eat coal.

1121
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,620
 People, women do.

1122
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,980
 - But she just had the craving.

1123
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,060
 - But it was usually would be charcoal.

1124
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,820
 Like husband, you'd get bits of charcoal

1125
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,660
 and you could chew on it.

1126
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,540
 - Ah, but not a large lump of coal.

1127
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,340
 - No, you wouldn't go down to mine.

1128
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,940
 (all laughing)

1129
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,180
 - No, my daughter got home from work every day

1130
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:29,020
 and she was a black face full of the coal basket.

1131
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:29,860
 - That would be so good.

1132
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,740
 - Hopefully, if you're having cravings for, you know,

1133
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,260
 gurgons, you don't eat a billion, the gurgons.

1134
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,740
 You just need a small amount to get your cravings started.

1135
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
 - Yeah, it's true.

1136
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,020
 It's just this funny idea of like replacing miners

1137
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,820
 with pregnant women who, they know where the coal is

1138
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,460
 'cause they have the desperate cravings

1139
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,220
 and they're just chewing through the rock face.

1140
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,060
 - Yeah.

1141
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
 - Yeah, and none comes back up.

1142
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,060
 (all laughing)

1143
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,380
 - Just on big shoes.

1144
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,220
 - Yeah.

1145
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,060
 - On shoes.

1146
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,020
 Used to be a big thing and they're called crack-offs.

1147
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:00,420
 So crack-offs were shoes that were really popular

1148
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,980
 from about the 13th century to the 15th, 16th centuries

1149
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,220
 and they're called that after the assume place

1150
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,660
 of origin crack-off in Poland.

1151
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,300
 And they were also called Poulin,

1152
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,940
 which is Polish shoes, Polishings.

1153
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,780
 And they, so it was just fashionable

1154
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,620
 to have these incredibly long shoes

1155
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,460
 and they were gone for sort of eight, nine inches.

1156
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,620
 And then eventually there were various edicts passed

1157
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,620
 that said you had to limit your toe length to two inches.

1158
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,020
 It was still quite long.

1159
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,300
 And it was partly because it was seen as showy,

1160
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,540
 like we've talked about the summary laws before

1161
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,060
 and partly because it was quite difficult to pray, apparently,

1162
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,740
 'cause it's quite hard to kneel down

1163
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:37,180
 when you've got a 10-inch toe poking out.

1164
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,140
 - But you can always see if somebody's in a toilet stall.

1165
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,980
 - It's nice.

1166
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,820
 - Yeah.

1167
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,020
 - You can usually tell that just from the engaged side,

1168
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,620
 but it's poking your head under that little gap

1169
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,620
 between the guys.

1170
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,460
 - Sorry.

1171
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,980
 - Also, you know, you might be using to wipe as well

1172
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
 if you do.

1173
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,820
 (all laughing)

1174
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,620
 - Oh, you've got to be flexible for that, too.

1175
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,620
 (all laughing)

1176
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:56,460
 - Long enough.

1177
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,420
 (all laughing)

1178
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,660
 You know, they're using bacteria to solve crimes now.

1179
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,100
 (all laughing)

1180
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,660
 - That's a cup show I want to see.

1181
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,980
 (all laughing)

1182
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,860
 - No, they are using it to solve crimes

1183
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,780
 because we all have this fingerprint,

1184
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,820
 which is our huge cloud of bacteria

1185
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,500
 that we're walking around with and they're all individual.

1186
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,420
 And so, police have started thinking maybe we can take

1187
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,500
 the bacteria that's left in a room that's been burgled

1188
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,180
 and then match it to a database of other people's bacteria.

1189
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,420
 And if there's a match, they did the robbery.

1190
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,220
 But it's quite cool, 'cause it's a very good plan.

1191
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,860
 And they've experimented with it by staging

1192
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,660
 a load of mock burglaries, which just sounded like

1193
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,620
 the funnest science experiment to be part of.

1194
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,740
 So there were 400 study participants,

1195
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,340
 some home owners, and some who had to pretend

1196
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,900
 to burgle their homes.

1197
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,420
 And they had to properly act it out.

1198
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,020
 So they did stuff like they rifled through all their drawers

1199
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,100
 and they carried away their TV.

1200
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,460
 They all had to open the fridge

1201
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,260
 and kind of have a sip of the Coke and the fridge,

1202
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,860
 'cause that's something that burglar's doing apparently,

1203
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
 sometimes.

1204
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
 - A sip of the Coke and the fridge.

1205
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,460
 - Yeah, burglar's always do that, you know?

1206
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,420
 - It's a signature move.

1207
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,020
 - The one thing the burglar's do do a lot

1208
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,540
 is poo in houses, don't they?

1209
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,820
 Sorry to bring it back to poo.

1210
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,460
 - I think they might have asked them to do that as well.

1211
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,100
 Maybe it didn't make it into the study right up, but.

1212
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,420
 - Apparently that does happen because you're so stressed,

1213
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,620
 your body just wants to defecate.

1214
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,340
 - If someone's left a poo in a house,

1215
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,300
 you probably don't need to swab for the microbiology.

1216
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:17,700
 (laughing)

1217
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,540
 - But so do all of them.

1218
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,140
 - We're looking for a corn cob who can make a dick robbery.

1219
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,220
 (laughing)

1220
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,100
 - I've done what you've done.

1221
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,460
 You can ask your question anyway, though.

1222
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,500
 - Well, it's just going out so,

1223
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,780
 if the four of us are in this room,

1224
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,980
 we all have our bacteria, what did you call it,

1225
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,500
 the cloud, the biome, will all be so different,

1226
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,060
 so noticeably different?

1227
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,180
 - Well, the thing is, the more you hang out with people,

1228
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,500
 the more your biome is similar to theirs,

1229
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,500
 'cause you end up sharing bacteria.

1230
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,740
 - Yeah, and the same thing.

1231
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,700
 - There is a thing, yeah, we're basically

1232
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,860
 all the same microbiome, no, probably.

1233
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,980
 Well, I'm not really the same.

1234
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,420
 - But they are still really individual.

1235
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,620
 - Yeah, yeah, okay.

1236
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,780
 - So people develop really differently,

1237
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,620
 and develop it in the first three or four years

1238
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,460
 of your life, I think, specifically the stuff

1239
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,860
 that you're at the bacteria you're going to want.

1240
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,140
 - But the other thing is, you can get a hotel room,

1241
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,940
 and I think it's within something like two or three hours,

1242
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,700
 that room will be indistinguishable

1243
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,380
 from your actual house, from the microbes in there.

1244
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,540
 - Oh, okay, yeah.

1245
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,260
 - And also, 'cause I always take all my furniture

1246
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,140
 to the hotel rooms.

1247
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,220
 (laughing)

1248
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,820
 - I always do a poo with a corn.

1249
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,540
 (laughing)

1250
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,260
 - Just make it feel like home, isn't it?

1251
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,460
 - Oh, good.

1252
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,020
 - That's crazy, though, using that for crime.

1253
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:24,860
 - That is crazy.

1254
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,220
 - That would be really weird if you could see,

1255
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,580
 if you spent all your time, for example,

1256
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,980
 with a dancing partner, like on Strictly,

1257
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,660
 if your microbiome came closer to your dancing partners

1258
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,820
 than it was to your real life partner at home.

1259
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,220
 - I'd like to see that headline in the daily express.

1260
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
 (laughing)

1261
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,300
 - Sean Walsh is microbiome.

1262
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,140
 (laughing)

1263
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,060
 (upbeat music)

1264
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,700
 - We're gonna have to move on to our next fact in a second.

1265
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:51,260
 I got one last thing that I like, which is in 1956,

1266
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,420
 there was an English composer who was quite well known

1267
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,660
 at the time, called Malcolm Arnold,

1268
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,020
 and he actually wrote a overture for vacuums.

1269
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,660
 So, when you saw it, it was vacuums on stage,

1270
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,100
 it was three vacuums, it was one floor polisher,

1271
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,940
 four rifles, bizarrely, and then an actual orchestra,

1272
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:12,140
 and it was a piece that he put on called a grand-grand,

1273
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:16,340
 and it was dedicated to U.S. president Herbert Hoover.

1274
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,220
 So that was quite a nice thing.

1275
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,060
 - Very good.

1276
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,620
 (audience applauding)

1277
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,580
 - Just on the losers, is you were just saying

1278
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,140
 Anna in the campaign.

1279
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,060
 - Okay, Dan, you know, let's do this backstage, all right?

1280
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,340
 (laughing)

1281
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,140
 - Just some other rain-making ceremonies.

1282
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:34,980
 - Oh, yeah.

1283
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,620
 - Because they've always existed in hot countries,

1284
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,820
 I guess, 'cause people need rain,

1285
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:42,100
 and they are quite a big thing in various parts of Africa.

1286
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,380
 So in South Africa, the Lovedu people have a rain queen,

1287
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,540
 and the rain queen is basically their ruler.

1288
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,220
 They always have had traditionally.

1289
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,380
 - Long may she rain?

1290
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,500
 - Long may she rain, indeed.

1291
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,980
 And she, that sort of implies that she's urinating

1292
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,140
 on her people as a replacement for rain,

1293
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,980
 which she doesn't do.

1294
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,060
 - That's spile by little pod, sorry.

1295
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,180
 You've got disgusting images.

1296
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,140
 So this is this woman who isn't allowed to marry herself,

1297
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,500
 but she can have female wives, inverted commons.

1298
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,020
 And so she also has to bear at least one child,

1299
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,300
 at least one daughter, because you inherit it from your mother.

1300
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,940
 So she has to bear one daughter by a royal relative,

1301
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,500
 interesting rule, and then age 60, when she hits 60,

1302
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,700
 it's assumed that her powers of making the rain come,

1303
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,260
 or sometimes stopping the rain.

1304
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,060
 Her powers are perceived to have waned,

1305
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,580
 and she's expected to commit suicide by poison.

1306
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,420
 - Oh.

1307
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,380
 - And so she has to do this.

1308
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,180
 And those is really controversial scandal in 1959,

1309
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:44,020
 when the raining rain queen refused to bloody commit suicide.

1310
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,380
 She was 80, and people kept going,

1311
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,300
 'Come on, you've lost your power, and I'll do the thing.'

1312
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,220
 So your daughter can take over, and she understandably was like,

1313
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,620
 'I don't want to.'

1314
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,340
 And so this sort of ruined the tradition for a while,

1315
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,300
 but it's being brought back.

1316
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,500
 So the next rain queen, when she comes of age,

1317
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,580
 when she turns 18 in a couple of years,

1318
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,260
 is coming back into the form.

1319
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,940
 - Have they fixed the succession procedure?

1320
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,340
 - I think they might have tinkered with it a little bit

1321
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,340
 about the edges.

1322
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,980
 (all laughing)

1323
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,820
 - Yeah, it's more optional these days.

1324
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:16,300
 - Rain dance is quite big in North America as well.

1325
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:20,140
 Historically, they're probably the ones we know of most,

1326
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,980
 or we hear of most.

1327
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,620
 The hoppy snake in Antelope's ceremony is quite a common one.

1328
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,780
 And people wrote about this a whole lot,

1329
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,260
 because it was performed in August,

1330
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,500
 it was to ensure abundant rainfall,

1331
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,700
 but it used live snakes.

1332
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,580
 And they did loads of different ceremonies,

1333
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,180
 all the time for loads of different things,

1334
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,100
 but this was the only one that used live snakes.

1335
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,260
 And so this was the one that became really famous,

1336
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,460
 and that's why the North American rain dance

1337
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,900
 became one of the more famous kind of ceremonies

1338
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,420
 that they all had, and it's because it had snakes in it,

1339
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:52,860
 and these snakes are exciting.

1340
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,860
 - Yeah, that's very cool.

1341
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,820
 - Do we know what they did?

1342
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,500
 - And you would dance around in a circle.

1343
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,900
 Me saying that makes it sad,

1344
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,260
 like I'm just doing a throw away comment of what you did.

1345
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,420
 It was very important, but yeah, basically,

1346
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,420
 it was danced around in a circle with live snakes.

1347
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,100
 - Was the snake in the middle of the circle?

1348
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,180
 Or were you holding a snake?

1349
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,460
 - I think you were handling the snake.

1350
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,180
 If I could tell, no, you were handling the snake, yeah.

1351
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,900
 - Otherwise, the snake might leave the circle,

1352
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:17,740
 get a bit bored.

1353
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,940
 Probably doesn't believe in this city.

1354
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,540
 It might have been ahead of us scientifically.

1355
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,540
 (laughing)

1356
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,460
 - There was a Cypriot rain ritual in ancient times,

1357
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,620
 where you had to do a rain dance,

1358
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,060
 and then after the dance, you had to spit

1359
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,860
 on the back of a turtle.

1360
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,700
 - Okay.

1361
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,420
 - And the book I was reading, it said that henceforth,

1362
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,820
 it became popular as a spit turtle.

1363
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,660
 (laughing)

1364
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,420
 - That's such a rubbish joke.

1365
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,620
 - That's awful.

1366
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,140
 That's like at school, if someone spits on you once,

1367
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,860
 you get known as spits having the answer.

1368
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:47,860
 (laughing)

1369
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,380
 - Was it allowed to keep the saliva on it,

1370
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,180
 so I was three months away from there?

1371
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,860
 (laughing)

1372
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,020
 - It's a museum in Kansas.

1373
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,740
 It's a very small museum, but it pays homage

1374
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,340
 to all the losers of presidential campaigns.

1375
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,220
 So it's got a picture of them, a bit of a biography.

1376
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:06,660
 And it's run by this lady who, when I was reading the article,

1377
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,940
 she was very excited about the last election

1378
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,140
 that you guys had, because she really wanted Hillary Clinton

1379
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,300
 to lose, and I don't know if it's because she didn't

1380
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,580
 want her as president.

1381
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,100
 It was more that she was excited to have the first woman

1382
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,940
 ever in her museum of losers.

1383
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:22,780
 (laughing)

1384
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,740
 I should really be proud of that.

1385
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,180
 Finally, your woman will be in the losing museum.

1386
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,340
 (laughing)

1387
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:30,780
 We have to find the silver linings where we can.

1388
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,220
 (laughing)

1389
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,100
 - Do you know how you can weigh a whale?

1390
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,620
 - No, oh well, I don't always take it.

1391
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:39,060
 (laughing)

1392
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,900
 - Well, no.

1393
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
 (laughing)

1394
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,660
 So it used to be that to weigh a whale,

1395
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,460
 you would have to get one that's been beached

1396
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,900
 or one that's dead, something like that,

1397
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,380
 but it's really hard to weigh them in the wild,

1398
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,620
 but they've got this new system of drones.

1399
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,460
 - Wow.

1400
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,220
 - Which you're able to estimate the weight of whales

1401
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,460
 from the sky.

1402
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,300
 - Cool.

1403
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,140
 - So they no longer have to shove a set of weighing scales

1404
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,820
 underneath the beach whale.

1405
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,020
 - Well, mostly it's just that joke doesn't work anymore.

1406
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,180
 (laughing)

1407
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,380
 - Another joke ruined by the scientists of the world.

1408
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:08,580
 - You busted.

1409
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,180
 - I actually also have a French,

1410
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,500
 this is very tangential though,

1411
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,500
 but it is a French and fast food fact,

1412
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,220
 which is about in 2016, there was a McDonald's in France,

1413
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,540
 which was subject to an armed robbery,

1414
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:23,380
 and two guys burst in with guns.

1415
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,980
 They were armed, it was obviously very terrifying

1416
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,820
 for all the customers and they wanted all the money

1417
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,460
 in the till, which is about 1500 quay, I think.

1418
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,180
 But unfortunately for the two robbers,

1419
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,780
 also dining in the restaurant were 11 off duty members

1420
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,100
 of the French SAS.

1421
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:35,940
 (laughing)

1422
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,780
 - SAS.

1423
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,700
 - Well, the French paramilitary special forces,

1424
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,100
 and they're really, really good.

1425
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,940
 And they kept the cool, they didn't do anything

1426
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,460
 during the holdup, and then when one of the robbers

1427
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,540
 was leaving, he tripped a bit,

1428
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,540
 and immediately they bounced on him,

1429
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,900
 and then they shot the other one in the abdomen.

1430
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,900
 - But still.

1431
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,820
 - Oh, it's what?

1432
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,660
 - Well, they took him to hospital.

1433
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,020
 I don't think he died.

1434
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,980
 I mean, he was, but then sent to prison for armed robbery.

1435
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,820
 - Okay.

1436
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,140
 - So it's a funny story with one quite bad sounding injury

1437
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,140
 at part of it.

1438
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,660
 (laughing)

1439
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,460
 - Why did they wait for him to trip?

1440
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,580
 - Well, if they didn't trip,

1441
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,540
 they didn't immediately want to start firing their guns

1442
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,460
 in the restaurant, because they thought,

1443
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,500
 well, they're customers here, and we want to, you know.

1444
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,100
 - Yes, customers here enjoying their meals,

1445
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,340
 enjoying to blank out the armed robbery.

1446
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,180
 (laughing)

1447
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,100
 I imagine that Ronald McDonald is stood there

1448
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,420
 with his massive clown shoes,

1449
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:24,820
 and he kind of trips that night.

1450
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:26,660
 (laughing)

1451
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,540
 - I don't know what would have happened

1452
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,380
 if the guy hadn't tripped.

1453
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,780
 I'm sure they would have thought of some other way

1454
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,020
 of resolving the situation.

1455
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,740
 - I know, yeah, yeah.

1456
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,180
 I'm sure that's not the strategy

1457
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,460
 of all of the French ass, I ask.

1458
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,220
 Do not make a move till one of them trips.

1459
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,580
 - Do you guys know that chess pieces, the pawns,

1460
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,540
 they used to have jobs?

1461
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:44,540
 - Each of them?

1462
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,380
 - Well, did they work out?

1463
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,780
 - So in the middle ages, monks tried to represent them

1464
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,900
 as citizens, that was the idea.

1465
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,140
 And so you had an agricultural worker, you had a farrier,

1466
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,660
 you had a weaver, the fourth was a businessman,

1467
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,620
 it was a doctor, an inkeeper, a policeman,

1468
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,820
 and the last one was a gambler.

1469
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,660
 - Wow.

1470
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,660
 - A policeman.

1471
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,660
 - Yeah, but policeman.

1472
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,740
 - So that's no longer used.

1473
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,460
 - That would have made blindfold chess a lot harder,

1474
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,300
 wouldn't it?

1475
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,460
 If you had to remember all every individual pawns.

1476
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:10,780
 - Farrier to E4.

1477
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,860
 - Yeah.

1478
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,060
 - Also, you would think they would have

1479
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,900
 pawnbroker and pawnstar.

1480
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,300
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

1481
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,220
 - I was sure it had been invented in the middle ages.

1482
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:19,220
 - What, pawnbrokery?

1483
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,820
 - pawnbrokery had been, I think.

1484
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:25,220
 - Well, the queen didn't use to be a piece, either.

1485
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,140
 So the queen wasn't a piece for about a 600 AD,

1486
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,500
 and then she was really rubbish for ages,

1487
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,100
 'cause, you know, queens were quite, sort of,

1488
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,660
 was quite inferior, you know, a male should be the leader.

1489
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:36,780
 And this only changed in the 15th century

1490
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,780
 when the queen came along, who was actually decent,

1491
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,820
 and people started to say, "Hey, queens can be powerful."

1492
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,780
 And this was queen Isabella of Castile,

1493
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,740
 so it was Isabella and Ferdinand.

1494
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,700
 And basically, their relationship mirrors

1495
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:48,540
 the one of the king and the queen on the board, where she-

1496
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,900
 - You could only walk one step in any direction,

1497
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,380
 and she was legging at everyone.

1498
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:53,460
 (laughing)

1499
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,580
 - He was always running and hiding behind the book

1500
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,500
 of the baker and the candlestick maker or whatever.

1501
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,780
 - Was it, but no, behind the Castile.

1502
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,620
 (gasping)

1503
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,460
 - Castile, yeah. - Castile, yeah.

1504
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,020
 - No, she, so when they got married,

1505
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:07,980
 she forced them into this really humiliating marriage,

1506
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,020
 where she got much more authority than him.

1507
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,140
 She used to ride out to command troops on her own,

1508
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,260
 leaving him behind.

1509
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,420
 She was made queen of a particular country or state,

1510
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:17,220
 and she didn't even bother to tell him about it.

1511
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,420
 But yeah, then they changed the queen and made it more powerful.

1512
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,460
 And one argument to say this is why that happened,

1513
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,340
 is that in Russia, the queen remained impotent

1514
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:27,140
 until the 18th century, when Catherine the Great came in,

1515
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:28,340
 and then she got a lot of power there.

1516
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,860
 - Oh.

1517
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,420
 - Just, this is not to go out really,

1518
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,500
 but I just found out that I found a paper called,

1519
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,060
 Reservoir Dogs and the Implications for Disease Control,

1520
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,220
 'cause obviously Reservoir is the animal

1521
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,420
 that the disease lives in.

1522
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:44,860
 - Oh. - And this is from the early '80s,

1523
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:47,100
 which is before Reservoir Dogs came out.

1524
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,580
 And no one knows where the name Reservoir Dogs came out.

1525
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,420
 - You're kidding.

1526
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:52,980
 - Yeah, so my theory is that Tarantino was reading

1527
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:57,980
 a very obscure medical paper about rabies in Zimbabwe,

1528
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,260
 and that's where he got the name from.

1529
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,940
 - Nobody knows where the film's name comes from.

1530
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,300
 - No, when he was selling it, he claimed that it was a gangster term

1531
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,340
 for a rat, but actually that's not true.

1532
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,660
 And some people think he might have misheard

1533
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,100
 the name of the title of the movie,

1534
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:15,780
 'Aruvoire Les Enfonds', which is a French movie.

1535
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:16,620
 - Yeah, it is.

1536
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,620
 It's not very similar to Reservoir Dogs, is it?

1537
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,460
 - Oh.

1538
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,300
 - Yeah.

1539
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,340
 And also it doesn't sound very much like Reservoir Dogs.

1540
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,180
 - Nope.

1541
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,180
 - I believe you're theory.

1542
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:27,020
 (laughing)

1543
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:30,620
 - I'd just one thing about someone who dealt with syphilis,

1544
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,700
 and this is in the early 18th century,

1545
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,580
 it was a guy called Daniel Turner,

1546
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,980
 and he was the first person ever to use the term syphilis

1547
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,900
 to refer to the illness.

1548
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,340
 So it came from actually an epic poem

1549
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,700
 written about a hundred years earlier

1550
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,620
 about a guy who got it in short.

1551
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,460
 And so he--

1552
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:48,500
 - He was called, the guy in the poem was called syphilis.

1553
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,820
 He was a shepherd.

1554
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,660
 - Yes, exactly.

1555
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,340
 He was a poem about a shepherd called syphilis.

1556
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,900
 And so then this doctor said,

1557
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,060
 "Okay, well, let's call this syphilis."

1558
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,300
 - He was just like a boy named Sue, but worse.

1559
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,900
 (laughing)

1560
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,100
 - Sue's poor sister.

1561
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,740
 And so he also wrote about the use of another new word

1562
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:09,580
 that he'd coined, the condom.

1563
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,140
 So it's about UM, but I think they're the same thing.

1564
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,740
 And he said that's the most effective thing

1565
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,780
 to prevent its transmission.

1566
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,780
 This was 1770.

1567
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:16,620
 - Wow.

1568
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:19,420
 - But I was reading the report he wrote on it.

1569
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,300
 And he said the condom is the best,

1570
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,300
 if not the only, preservative that we have from syphilis.

1571
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,540
 But by reason of its blunting sensation,

1572
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,100
 I have heard people say they've chosen to risk the clap

1573
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,820
 rather than engage, "Kum has to sick cli-piatus."

1574
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,820
 Which--

1575
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,420
 - Well, the one person got that.

1576
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,740
 (laughing)

1577
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,580
 - And we're so sorry that you've got that.

1578
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,940
 (laughing)

1579
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:44,940
 - I actually really wanna know if you did get that.

1580
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,900
 - Did anyone get the Latin for that?

1581
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:47,740
 - No.

1582
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,820
 - Well, I really enjoy the idea of putting really rude stuff

1583
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,220
 in Latin to make it more appropriate.

1584
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,940
 But it means with spears, thus sheathed.

1585
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,980
 - Would you have a sheath for a spear?

1586
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,580
 - To have a sheath for a sword?

1587
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,420
 - Sure.

1588
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,260
 - That's a really good point.

1589
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,100
 - That's a long sheath.

1590
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,340
 Or it's a tiny sheath just for the head of the spear.

1591
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:07,660
 (laughing)

1592
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,140
 But both of them feel impractical in the battle situation.

1593
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,180
 (laughing)

1594
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,460
 I mean, just get my sheath out of there, there, there, there.

1595
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,620
 - He added the thought of it through.

1596
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,060
 You're completely right.

1597
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:21,700
 I was feeling so smug about the Latin translation.

1598
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,540
 Because I heard about James Harrison.

1599
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:28,740
 James Harrison, he's an 81 year old, sorry,

1600
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,220
 this is four years ago now, but he, at the time,

1601
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,340
 he retired from being a donor, a blood donor,

1602
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,820
 81 years old, and he'd been donating blood

1603
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,780
 for every week, virtually every week,

1604
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,060
 for 60 years of his life.

1605
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,420
 And he was known as the man with the golden arm.

1606
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:45,660
 And in Australia, he had a very rare type of blood,

1607
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:48,620
 which they reckoned there was only sort of like 50 people

1608
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,780
 or so that had it.

1609
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,020
 And it was very important because mothers who were pregnant,

1610
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,100
 they would have recess positive blood.

1611
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:58,700
 But if the baby had recess negative blood,

1612
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,460
 which would be inherited from the father,

1613
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,780
 that would go against the baby

1614
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,660
 and it would start killing the baby inside the womb.

1615
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,580
 So they used his blood specifically to save all these babies.

1616
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,900
 And the Australian Red Cross believed that over the years,

1617
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,580
 he saved the lives of 2.4 million Australian babies

1618
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,700
 from the 60 years of giving blood 17% of women

1619
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,300
 are at risk of this in Australia.

1620
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,740
 And every single batch of anti-D, as it's called,

1621
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,100
 is from this guy.

1622
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,940
 - Wow. - Yeah.

1623
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,100
 So he's an absolute hero and he's just retired.

1624
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,500
 - Kind of mean to retire, to be honest.

1625
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,300
 (laughing)

1626
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,620
 - Come on, mate.

1627
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,140
 - Yeah, stick on it.

1628
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,140
 - No, I've done a good long time saving children

1629
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,260
 and now I'm gonna stop.

1630
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,780
 (laughing)

1631
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,020
 - Wow, how easy that, right?

1632
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,700
 - I was reading a tiny bit about dog research.

1633
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,620
 'Cause dogs have been researched on it

1634
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,300
 in historic medicine for so long,

1635
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,340
 'cause they were just a useful thing

1636
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,020
 that was always around, quite tame.

1637
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,340
 And so you know Pavlov of dog fame.

1638
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,340
 - Yeah.

1639
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,220
 - He had some breakthrough dog research,

1640
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,420
 although his most of his breakthroughs weren't

1641
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,180
 what we now think of him as doing.

1642
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,940
 So obviously we think of the Pavlovian dog responses,

1643
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,900
 a behavioral thing.

1644
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,500
 But really, he was interested in dog digestion.

1645
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,540
 I think it's that kind of thing

1646
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,940
 that he got his Nobel Prize for in 1904

1647
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,860
 and not the experiment that people know.

1648
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,500
 But one of the things that he did was he looked at,

1649
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,260
 it was really interesting in dogs livers

1650
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,300
 and how dogs when dogs generated saliva.

1651
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,900
 And he did this thing where he created fistulas

1652
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,980
 in the esophagus of dogs.

1653
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,860
 And so a little hole with a tube attached,

1654
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,980
 which meant that when dogs ate,

1655
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,700
 it would just come straight out again if it's neck

1656
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,500
 and not go into it stomach to find out what would happen

1657
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,140
 if they weren't getting the, you know,

1658
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,260
 if they weren't filling up their stomach as they ate.

1659
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,180
 And so he had all these dogs with food just,

1660
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,380
 how frustrating would that be?

1661
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,220
 Yeah.

1662
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,020
 Eat your food and it's full straight out of you.

1663
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,180
 Just going, yeah.

1664
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:55,140
 That's like a torture in,

1665
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:57,500
 but you'd be given by the gods in the afterlife.

1666
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,260
 It is, isn't it?

1667
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,020
 Yeah.

1668
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:00,300
 Forever hungry.

1669
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,900
 Yeah.

1670
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:01,900
 Yeah.

1671
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,860
 He also used to sell quite a lot of dogs' saliva, I think.

1672
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,900
 What for?

1673
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,060
 He made quite a lot of money out of it.

1674
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,460
 Yeah, he had a dog gastric juice factory.

1675
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,500
 [LAUGHTER]

1676
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,420
 That's just a dog.

1677
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,900
 [LAUGHTER]

1678
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,140
 That does make him sound very evil.

1679
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,820
 I think he wasn't a nice guy anyway.

1680
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,260
 A lot of people say, but this one, particularly,

1681
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:22,580
 he just had these dogs working to produce loads of saliva,

1682
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,020
 but he bottled up and said, oh, that's--

1683
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,300
 What was the purpose of selling it?

1684
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,700
 The idea was that it helped out with things like dyspeptia

1685
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,540
 and stamenolins.

1686
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,460
 Sorry, you would drink it.

1687
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:31,620
 Yeah, yeah, you'd find dogs.

1688
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,460
 Oh, the number really.

1689
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,420
 Before you were saying that you would kiss a dog,

1690
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,500
 I know you're like, no, I said, the number really.

1691
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,100
 Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, it's a word I'm not for the number.

1692
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:43,820
 [LAUGHTER]

1693
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:48,460
 I just have a couple of things about saliva, right?

1694
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,260
 Humans, obviously, when the plague was around,

1695
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:54,980
 so the 1,400s and the 1,500s, that was a massive thing

1696
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,780
 where kissing almost became taboo because they thought

1697
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,940
 that that's what was spreading it, so they stopped.

1698
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,460
 But what I didn't realize was the alternatives to not kissing

1699
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,740
 to make sure you still had great sort of sexual contact

1700
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,260
 with your partner in the face.

1701
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:17,260
 And alternatively, we're licking, sniffing,

1702
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,260
 and nibbling of eyebrows.

1703
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:20,540
 Sorry, wait a minute.

1704
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,460
 So you couldn't kiss because you didn't want to get any bacteria

1705
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,380
 going over, but you could just lick someone's face.

1706
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,500
 I think you'd lick their forehead or their ear

1707
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,580
 or go for just general away from the mouth legs.

1708
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:36,940
 But nibbling of eyebrows was a safe alternative, supposedly,

1709
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,180
 at the time.

1710
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:38,680
 Wow.

1711
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,860
 So would you lick someone on the cheek if you didn't really

1712
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,340
 know them and lick them up the middle of the face

1713
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,700
 if they were your partner?

1714
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,860
 I don't think you're in France.

1715
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,100
 You'd have to lick them on both cheeks.

1716
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,940
 That's so true.

1717
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:53,980
 Can I just tell you about a new story from 2012, which

1718
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,580
 was quite good.

1719
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:58,700
 So this was about a leak in a statue of Jesus.

1720
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,900
 And it was in a Catholic church in Mumbai.

1721
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,900
 And the toe of Jesus started leaking.

1722
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,300
 And so a miracle was immediately declared.

1723
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:10,820
 It was obviously holy water, because this toe was crying.

1724
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,220
 And so lots of people came and visited--

1725
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,180
 That's way more emo.

1726
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:20,220
 Lots of people came and visited this sobbing toe.

1727
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,900
 And the church promoted it as a site of pilgrimage.

1728
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,900
 And it was quite good for tourism

1729
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,140
 in this relatively backwater of Mumbai.

1730
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,780
 And then this guy called Sanal Edamiruku,

1731
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,900
 who is a rationalist, a buzzkill someday,

1732
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,060
 went to investigate.

1733
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,660
 And he found that it was moisture from an overflowing drain

1734
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,900
 that was being fed by a pipe issued from a nearby toilet.

1735
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,140
 And he was investigative of a blasphemy

1736
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,540
 by various police stations, then has fled to Finland

1737
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:51,100
 where he's been in exile for the last seven years.

1738
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,060
 Yeah.

1739
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:57,540
 So when Jesus cries, don't say it's a toilet leaking.

1740
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,100
 Come on, right.

1741
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,700
 It's weird, though, isn't it?

1742
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,020
 If you have water coming from your--

1743
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,740
 if I had water coming from one of my toes,

1744
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,740
 I would say it was probably sweat.

1745
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,980
 Yes, not like holy water or tears, or anything like that.

1746
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,500
 I mean, I've embellished with the tears.

1747
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,300
 It was holy water.

1748
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,220
 It was holy toe water, yeah.

1749
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:14,980
 Holy water.

1750
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,460
 Holy water, very good.

1751
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:19,900
 Can I just do one more quick thing about leaks?

1752
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,780
 So here's a family thing, which isn't really--

1753
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,740
 it's not a legal thing.

1754
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:26,300
 But I read it the other day, and I think it's kind of cool.

1755
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:29,900
 In medieval Scandinavia, they would have civil wars,

1756
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,620
 and families would often put brothers

1757
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:36,220
 on opposite sides of the battles, so to hedge their bets,

1758
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,620
 so that one of them would survive the war.

1759
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,420
 Wow.

1760
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,940
 That's cool, isn't it?

1761
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:41,620
 It's quite clever.

1762
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:42,660
 It's dark.

1763
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,460
 It's dark, but it makes sense.

1764
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:45,220
 It does.

1765
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,420
 So you want to continue your genetic line,

1766
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,180
 and say, exactly, you want to make sure that someone--

1767
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,900
 oh, someone to look after you in old age,

1768
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,260
 or to look after the farmer, whatever,

1769
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,660
 so you would put one brother on each side.

1770
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,260
 But the thing is, with war, it's not like the winning side

1771
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,540
 in a war every single person survived,

1772
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:02,460
 and the losing side everyone died.

1773
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,260
 You could very easily put them on either side

1774
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,180
 and they're both killed, and then you

1775
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,420
 look like an idiot and a twat.

1776
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,900
 What would happen?

1777
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,380
 But what would often happen afterwards

1778
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,580
 is the losing group would be punished.

1779
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,540
 Yeah, OK.

1780
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,140
 But if you put two on the same side,

1781
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,180
 it gives that side a tiny extra advantage.

1782
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,220
 It does, but then if the neighbors have got three kids,

1783
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,540
 and they put them on the other side--

1784
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,540
 Oh, yeah.

1785
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:22,980
 It's always a problem, isn't it?

1786
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,300
 The answer is not to have a war.

1787
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,620
 Or any kids?

1788
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:26,620
 Yeah.

1789
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,740
 So there are enclave countries as well, aren't there,

1790
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,900
 which are countries wholly inside other countries.

1791
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:34,700
 Oh, yeah.

1792
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,820
 So Lesotho in South Africa--

1793
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,260
 literally, inside Africa, actually, is one of them.

1794
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,860
 And one of them is San Marino.

1795
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,100
 It's a tiny country inside Italy.

1796
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,420
 So Italy has two smaller entities

1797
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,580
 within it, the Vatican and San Marino.

1798
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:52,220
 And this is kind of off the beaten track a bit.

1799
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,980
 But in 1999, San Marino was really worried about its male

1800
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,140
 citizens being ensnared by sexy foreign women.

1801
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,460
 And it banned them.

1802
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,220
 Banned all women.

1803
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,140
 It legally legislated.

1804
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,700
 It banned any female domestic servants younger than 50.

1805
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,900
 So--

1806
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,380
 When was this used to you say?

1807
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:12,100
 1999.

1808
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:13,260
 Come on.

1809
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,300
 I'm serious.

1810
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,060
 Do you like joking?

1811
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:15,540
 No, no.

1812
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,820
 Because there was this sort of panic in San Marino

1813
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:23,220
 about foreign women coming as carers and domestic servants

1814
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,900
 and marrying the elderly men they were looking after.

1815
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:27,700
 And maybe not with their best interest at heart.

1816
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,620
 Maybe there was some financial motive or something.

1817
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,220
 So it literally just banned any female domestic servants

1818
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,580
 under the age of 50.

1819
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,500
 Assuming that if once you get to the age of 50,

1820
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,540
 you're probably fine.

1821
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,900
 1999.

1822
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,100
 I know.

1823
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,020
 I don't know if there's ever been repealed as well, actually.

1824
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,820
 Well, anyone might have found out if there's anyone

1825
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,340
 under the age of 50 who vans is a trip to San Marino.

1826
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:48,340
 And then prison.

1827
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,620
 Yeah.

1828
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:54,780
 I found someone who was the arch enemy of gravity.

1829
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,740
 So he was a man called Roger Babson.

1830
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,660
 And he was an American businessman.

1831
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,980
 He was a Newton fanatic.

1832
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:04,180
 He made a lot of his money using Newton's principles

1833
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:06,180
 in business for every action.

1834
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,060
 There's an equal and opposite reaction.

1835
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,300
 And he had a satellite.

1836
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,220
 He lost a couple of close relatives to drowning.

1837
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:15,660
 And he, instead of blaming the water conditions,

1838
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,100
 he decided gravity was the culprit.

1839
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,140
 Because it pulled them down.

1840
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:24,860
 So he described old man gravity as our enemy number one.

1841
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,380
 He wrote this essay.

1842
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,260
 He said broken hips and other broken bones,

1843
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,060
 as well as numerous circulatory intestinal

1844
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,420
 and other internal troubles, are directly due to the people's

1845
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:38,180
 inability to counteract gravity at a critical moment.

1846
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,820
 And he founded a gravity research foundation

1847
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:43,940
 to basically destroy gravity, if he could.

1848
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:45,060
 And how is that going?

1849
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
 It's ongoing.

1850
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,780
 It's-- they now have slightly pivoted away from that.

1851
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:53,380
 And they just sort of research it.

1852
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,580
 I did read about that guy.

1853
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,860
 He's pretty amazing.

1854
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,660
 He believed that there was a metal alloy

1855
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,300
 which had anti-gravity properties.

1856
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,700
 And if they would be able to find it,

1857
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,260
 they'd be able to-- he said they'd

1858
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,940
 be able to co-terror planes in it

1859
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:08,420
 to make impossible for them to crash.

1860
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:12,620
 But he didn't say how they'd be able to land.

1861
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,380
 But he actually-- this institute that he put a load of money

1862
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,700
 and it was both him and Captain Bird's Eye.

1863
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:21,540
 He put the money in-- I don't know if you have that in America,

1864
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,660
 actually, Captain Bird's Eye.

1865
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,100
 But he's like a frozen food guy.

1866
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,260
 But he was real.

1867
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,700
 And he made a load of money from--

1868
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,020
 Wait a second.

1869
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:31,740
 But that feels to me like the bigger headline.

1870
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,900
 It's the Captain Bird's Eye.

1871
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:33,780
 Well, not here.

1872
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,940
 But just so you guys know, anyone who's now listening

1873
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:38,020
 to this podcast back in England has just gone,

1874
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:40,460
 what the fuck?

1875
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:43,020
 Do you guys not have Captain Bird's Eye?

1876
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,180
 Guys, you don't know what you're missing.

1877
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:46,460
 He's great, fun. He sells you fish fingers.

1878
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,380
 And he sort of powers around on boats with children.

1879
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,380
 They got Captain Crunch.

1880
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,180
 They got Captain Crunch.

1881
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,260
 Captain Crunch is different.

1882
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,500
 So you can see, there's no qualification for this.

1883
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,020
 There is probably a secret club where Captain Crunch and Captain

1884
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,260
 Bird's Eye hang out together.

1885
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,060
 Yeah, bitching about gravity.

1886
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:05,580
 So he was an anti-gravity?

1887
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,220
 Yeah, he was.

1888
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:08,180
 And when he first put the money into this,

1889
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,060
 him and Captain Bird's Eye, they

1890
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,300
 paid for three people to sit in the US Payton's office,

1891
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,140
 just looking for any patents that were anti-gravity inventions.

1892
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,260
 And then as soon as one came in, they would go and find

1893
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:21,820
 that person and go, have you found it?

1894
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:22,820
 Have you found it?

1895
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:25,340
 And they never did.

1896
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,180
 Oh, there's a grant that his company

1897
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,540
 give to lots of universities.

1898
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,780
 And one of the rules of receiving the grant

1899
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:34,660
 is that they have to get this monument where he has words

1900
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,940
 about his personal.

1901
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,180
 But it's quite coded.

1902
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:39,980
 But it sort of says, I don't think gravity is a thing.

1903
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,100
 Or conquer it.

1904
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:44,500
 So they have that sort of planted at these universities.

1905
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,100
 But a few of the universities from what I've read,

1906
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,500
 the students like to push it over.

1907
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:52,180
 I tried to find a site called--

1908
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:54,380
 I tried to find if there was a YouTuber,

1909
01:04:54,380 --> 01:04:57,620
 like with an A at the end of their website for Tuber People.

1910
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:57,860
 Oh, yeah.

1911
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,020
 There isn't, sadly.

1912
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,860
 Well, there's a niche.

1913
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:00,380
 There's a niche.

1914
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:03,700
 And then I tried to find you Tuber, like for potatoes.

1915
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,700
 Oh, yeah.

1916
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:05,220
 Is that--

1917
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,460
 No, well, there might be.

1918
01:05:06,460 --> 01:05:07,980
 But to be honest, it's so hard to search

1919
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:12,420
 a YouTuber with an E.R. with potatoes in mind.

1920
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:12,900
 And I--

1921
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,900
 You have to put minus quite a lot of things.

1922
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,580
 You have to put minus, PewDiePie, minus.

1923
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:17,340
 Exactly.

1924
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:18,380
 Zawella and all of this.

1925
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:21,220
 I did find a guy who made a self-driving potato two years ago.

1926
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:23,540
 Did you hear about this?

1927
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,780
 There's hardly no.

1928
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,900
 Yeah, of course I saw that.

1929
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,780
 I'll YouTuber.

1930
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:33,180
 I've been looking at the chess records.

1931
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:36,100
 Sorry, not chess records, the record company.

1932
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:39,100
 The Wikipedia-- you know, chess was a record label.

1933
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,020
 Was it?

1934
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:40,820
 Yeah, we did.

1935
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:41,540
 Hang on.

1936
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:42,380
 No.

1937
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,780
 It was a music record label.

1938
01:05:43,780 --> 01:05:45,260
 I think it was a record label called chess.

1939
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,620
 That was an extremely esoteric joke, I think.

1940
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:48,580
 Yeah.

1941
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:50,380
 It was-- you meant to unconfuse us.

1942
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,460
 And you've actually confused us a lot more.

1943
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,100
 What I mean to say was, I've been looking at the Wikipedia

1944
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,100
 page for the records in competitive chess.

1945
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:58,500
 It was a musical called chess.

1946
01:05:58,500 --> 01:05:59,020
 Yes.

1947
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,100
 I think there was a record label called--

1948
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:00,860
 Of sure there was.

1949
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,900
 It didn't make sense.

1950
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:03,980
 There were so many record labels, aren't there?

1951
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:05,020
 Anyway.

1952
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,020
 These chess records.

1953
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,980
 I was eating an apple, and I don't mean the record label.

1954
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:10,940
 [LAUGHTER]

1955
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,220
 There's a company called Love Honey

1956
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:14,260
 that makes sex ties and stuff like that.

1957
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,620
 And they recently revealed the weirdest search terms

1958
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,860
 they've ever had.

1959
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,580
 That included pepperami loop.

1960
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:23,580
 A few others.

1961
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:29,620
 Pies for women to get horny pickled onion condoms.

1962
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:30,700
 Wow.

1963
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:31,900
 No?

1964
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:32,900
 No.

1965
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,860
 Probably not this time.

1966
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:37,340
 [LAUGHTER]

1967
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,620
 Pope Gregory issued a special decree saying

1968
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,900
 that Satan was half cat.

1969
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:42,900
 Wow.

1970
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,060
 So not all popes have been fans of cats.

1971
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:44,380
 Yeah.

1972
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:44,900
 Wow.

1973
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,580
 Because there was Pope Paul II, and he

1974
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,460
 was a 15th century Pope, who had his cat treated

1975
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:51,540
 by his own personal doctor.

1976
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:56,540
 And then Pope Paul VI had his cat dressed up in mini cardinals

1977
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:59,580
 robes, apparently, although I've never seen a drawing.

1978
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,740
 I don't know if we have evidence of these tiny cat cardinal

1979
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,220
 robes.

1980
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:05,460
 But it's called the Vatican, not the Catechon.

1981
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:06,300
 Yeah.

1982
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:06,980
 Oh, now come on.

1983
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:07,660
 That was good.

1984
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:14,860
 I was reading about, so Spartacus,

1985
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,540
 the movie Spartacus, starring Kurt Douglas.

1986
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,740
 So Kurt Douglas has Michael Douglas as a son.

1987
01:07:19,740 --> 01:07:21,900
 But then he also has Eric Douglas.

1988
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,220
 And Eric Douglas is a lesser known--

1989
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,420
 he hadn't really heard of him, right?

1990
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,740
 So he was in the industry as well.

1991
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,580
 And there's a very famous story of him

1992
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,980
 going to London to do stand-up comedy.

1993
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:33,540
 And he did it in a London club.

1994
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,060
 And he started telling jokes.

1995
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,420
 And he was getting nothing from anyone.

1996
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,660
 And he got really angry on stage for the fact

1997
01:07:39,660 --> 01:07:40,860
 that he was getting nothing.

1998
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:42,900
 So he suddenly turned on the crowd.

1999
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:44,100
 And he was furious with them.

2000
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:46,940
 And he was saying to them, do you know who I am?

2001
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,020
 I'm Kurt Douglas's son.

2002
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:51,620
 And someone in the audience stood up and went, no, I'm

2003
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:52,740
 Kurt Douglas's son.

2004
01:07:52,740 --> 01:08:00,580
 That's fantastic.

2005
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,460
 I was looking at very, very loud things.

2006
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,780
 We mentioned Cracator a while ago.

2007
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,700
 We said it was the loudest noise ever.

2008
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:09,780
 I looked into it a bit more how loud it is.

2009
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:12,180
 So that was the volcano that went off in the--

2010
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,340
 Yes, in 1816, I think.

2011
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,260
 Was that Tambora?

2012
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,180
 Oh, it was 1883.

2013
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:18,980
 Yeah, yeah, 1883 happened.

2014
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,980
 But the Cracator was the equivalent of hearing a noise

2015
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:25,220
 in New York that happened in Ireland.

2016
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:29,100
 And it would take four hours to get to you.

2017
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,900
 So there was a ship 40 miles away from Cracator

2018
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:33,300
 when it went off.

2019
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,740
 40 miles away, the ship was blasted so much

2020
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:38,060
 that half the crew's eardrums were shattered.

2021
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,580
 And the captain had no idea what was going on.

2022
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,140
 He wrote in his diary, "I am convinced the day of judgment has

2023
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:45,060
 come, just because this noise was so loud."

2024
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,740
 Imagine, I mean, the wire with all to write, update your journal.

2025
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:50,500
 What the day of judgment?

2026
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,540
 [LAUGHTER]

2027
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,340
 You've got, like, 10 minutes left to live.

2028
01:08:55,340 --> 01:08:56,740
 Max, what are you going to do?

2029
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:57,940
 Well, I better report this.

2030
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,900
 [LAUGHTER]

2031
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,380
 It used to be a thing where the vacuum cleaner

2032
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,460
 was only in one place in your home.

2033
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:07,780
 And you would attach huge tubes to it.

2034
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,060
 So the vacuum cleaner had its own spot in the house.

2035
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:14,220
 I mean, it stays in one place in my home, certainly.

2036
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,940
 So you didn't move it around.

2037
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:16,660
 You didn't move it around.

2038
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,740
 You just have a great long tube to the bit

2039
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:21,140
 you needed to suck that or cleaned.

2040
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,100
 But then, the Hubert Cecil Booth, who

2041
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:26,260
 was a huge figure in the vacuum cleaner invention process,

2042
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,500
 he created a giant vacuum cleaner for cinemas, which

2043
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,700
 was hidden basically inside the walls of the cinema.

2044
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,660
 So it's in the building.

2045
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:38,300
 And there are pipes going through the walls

2046
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,740
 to all sorts of different, like, power points, vacuum

2047
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:42,540
 sockets in the cinema.

2048
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,540
 And when you want to clean, you find the vacuum

2049
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,740
 point in the floor, and you open that up,

2050
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:49,900
 and it's just constantly sucking away at that point.

2051
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:52,180
 And you just attach the hose to that and get hovering.

2052
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,420
 So were there ever accidents where it was opened at the wrong

2053
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,660
 moment, and a whole audience got stuck into it?

2054
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:57,260
 Thousands.

2055
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,540
 That's why they stopped it, too many deaths.

2056
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:00,940
 Yeah.

2057
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:01,740
 Can see that.

2058
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:04,860
 You know, hedgehogs can get balloon syndrome.

2059
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,060
 Why have you said that, like, it's something where you all know?

2060
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,940
 Oh, well, I've seen one with it.

2061
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,940
 It's amazing.

2062
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,180
 I've heard of it.

2063
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,020
 It's just as many as referring to balloon syndrome

2064
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:14,300
 as, like, they get flew.

2065
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:15,660
 You know, they can get balloon syndrome.

2066
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,980
 I think we all know that.

2067
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:19,260
 So, sorry, balloon syndrome is a condition

2068
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:21,900
 that hedgehogs can get there.

2069
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,500
 And basically, it's because they have lots of space

2070
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,300
 under their skin.

2071
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,460
 And this is to allow them to roll up.

2072
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:30,260
 It helps them roll up.

2073
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,980
 But if air gets trapped under their skin

2074
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,220
 and it keeps getting in, they can just blow up and up and up

2075
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:34,980
 and up.

2076
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:37,580
 And then they can be the size of a beach ball.

2077
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,940
 And then the best thing to do is genuinely

2078
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,620
 to pop a needle into it and drain the air.

2079
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,140
 You're kidding.

2080
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:44,740
 Can you take one of their own needles?

2081
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,580
 I don't know.

2082
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,020
 Probably, yeah.

2083
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,140
 God, that's the ultimate irony, isn't it?

2084
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,740
 It's like being a balloon made of needles.

2085
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,180
 Yeah.

2086
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,980
 Oh, so sad, but if they learn to cooperate,

2087
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,220
 then they'd be able to puncture each other's balloon syndrome.

2088
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:59,780
 So, that's the lesson we've learned, right?

2089
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,540
 If they join forces, they plug a needle out of each other.

2090
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:03,060
 Yeah.

2091
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:03,860
 That's a good point.

2092
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,620
 You know, they've got drawstrings around them.

2093
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,700
 What hedgehogs?

2094
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:07,540
 No, they don't.

2095
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,820
 They have to get money passes.

2096
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,540
 Oh, sorry, I'm thinking of money passes again.

2097
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:12,820
 No, they have this muscle called an orbicularis.

2098
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,220
 And it's a ridge of muscle, which goes all the way around.

2099
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:17,020
 It's like a skirt, basically.

2100
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,780
 And it's what allows them to roll up.

2101
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,660
 So, they just tighten the orbicularis

2102
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,660
 and the drawstring just closes.

2103
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:24,140
 And they can still look out for hours.

2104
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:28,060
 But, but when they run, they hitch up their skirt, basically.

2105
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:29,820
 And they have these weird long legs.

2106
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,220
 So, if you look up footage of a hedgehog running,

2107
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,220
 it's got much longer legs than you're used to.

2108
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:36,420
 They still have lifted up their skirt or rubbed it.

2109
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,020
 No way.

2110
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:37,620
 It's bizarre.

2111
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,020
 Guys, heard of the game campaign for North Africa?

2112
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,860
 Yes.

2113
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:42,540
 That's incredible.

2114
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:43,340
 I don't know if we--

2115
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,620
 I don't think we've spoken about it before.

2116
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:49,860
 Campaign for North Africa, the desert war, 1940 to 1943,

2117
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,860
 it takes, roughly, they've worked out 50 days

2118
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:55,180
 without breaks to complete the game.

2119
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:57,700
 And you need 10 players.

2120
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,500
 It comes with 1,600 cardboard tokens.

2121
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:01,580
 Yeah, wow.

2122
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,540
 And it's so detailed.

2123
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,300
 It's the map that you play on.

2124
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:06,900
 It stretches out 10 feet.

2125
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:08,220
 Yeah, that's how big it is.

2126
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,620
 Big table, basically.

2127
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:10,140
 Yeah.

2128
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:13,380
 So, it's mostly sums the game, the campaign for North Africa.

2129
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:16,020
 It's made by a guy called Richard Berg, who, you know,

2130
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,180
 just wanted to develop the most complicated and realistic

2131
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:20,180
 game.

2132
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:22,420
 But if it's 10 feet long and it's the campaign for North Africa,

2133
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:23,940
 is that not just old desert?

2134
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,940
 Yeah.

2135
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:25,940
 Yeah.

2136
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:26,940
 It's not a great game.

2137
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:29,300
 So, what are you saying?

2138
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,780
 I just think you can make it smaller.

2139
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,780
 Yeah.

2140
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,220
 Oh, you mean cut out the desert?

2141
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:35,220
 Yeah, cut out the desert.

2142
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,220
 What if you cut out the desert?

2143
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,380
 You haven't got a game, have you?

2144
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:41,700
 But so, for example, there is a thing in the game

2145
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,020
 which you have to do.

2146
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,220
 You just get a sheet of paper and it's mostly sums.

2147
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,820
 So, every game turn, 3% of your fuel evaporates.

2148
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,740
 Unless you're the British before a certain date,

2149
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,020
 because they use rather inefficient means of storing

2150
01:12:54,020 --> 01:12:56,180
 their fuel, they use drums instead of Jerry cans.

2151
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,700
 So, if you're British before a certain date,

2152
01:12:57,700 --> 01:12:59,620
 7% evaporates every turn.

2153
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:00,620
 Amazing.

2154
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,300
 If you're Italian, you have to distribute an extra water

2155
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,540
 ration to your troops so that they can boil their pasta.

2156
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:11,100
 Otherwise, otherwise, there is a greater risk

2157
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:13,380
 that they all become disorganized and desert.

2158
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:17,220
 Like, it's incredible.

2159
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,420
 They worked out that if you played this game as a hobby,

2160
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:23,580
 so the game, which is the desert war in 1940 and in 1943,

2161
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,540
 if it was done as a hobby, you could make it last

2162
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,220
 longer than the war itself for playing it.

2163
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,900
 And it was more traumatic.

2164
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:32,020
 Shall we finish?

2165
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,020
 Sure.

2166
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:37,140
 You know how you were saying about how you would give

2167
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:40,380
 Lam's blood to someone to make them more Lam-like?

2168
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:41,220
 Yes, yeah.

2169
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:43,860
 Another thing they kind of thought was a good idea was,

2170
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,220
 if you had fallen out with your husband or wife,

2171
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:51,580
 your discard might be settled by giving each other your blood.

2172
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,740
 So, I might swap blood with my wife,

2173
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:56,180
 and then it would kind of bring her to my point of view

2174
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,220
 all the other way around.

2175
01:13:57,220 --> 01:13:58,220
 Wow.

2176
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,820
 And would you maybe sneakily inject the other person

2177
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,820
 with your wife?

2178
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:06,020
 I think you'll find out right now, I'll make sure.

2179
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,820
 Wow, I do believe you're right, that's weird.

2180
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:12,220
 No, it would be like, if you've had problems in your marriage

2181
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,340
 for a long period of time, then it might kind of solve things.

2182
01:14:16,340 --> 01:14:17,020
 What are you saying?

2183
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,140
 It's a last resort.

2184
01:14:18,140 --> 01:14:20,100
 It's a last resort before getting divorced.

2185
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,300
 This is one thing you'd try.

2186
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,580
 And did you have to swap?

2187
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,020
 When you say swap, do you mean I can just give you

2188
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:25,460
 a little cup of blood and you can give me one?

2189
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:26,580
 Or do you have to put it properly in?

2190
01:14:26,580 --> 01:14:28,660
 It was a proper transfusion.

2191
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:31,380
 Well, I did the blood brothers thing with my best friend

2192
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:33,100
 when I was younger, which is basically

2193
01:14:33,100 --> 01:14:34,340
 had many transfusions, isn't it?

2194
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:34,860
 It is.

2195
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,300
 It is a very, very small transfusion.

2196
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,740
 What's quite small, yeah?

2197
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:41,540
 And the idea behind this of the blood

2198
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:44,140
 giving you whatever it came from, that

2199
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,820
 began with Samuel Peep's, who at the raw society was telling

2200
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:54,580
 about a guy who only lived on women's milk as in breast milk.

2201
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,740
 And apparently, he used to be angry and fretful.

2202
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:01,460
 But by taking this women's milk, he became a good-natured patient

2203
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,140
 and found himself so well.

2204
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:05,380
 And they thought he'd somehow got the characteristics

2205
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:06,380
 of a woman.

2206
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:09,100
 Like a drinking breast milk.

2207
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:12,140
 But if that was the case, then every baby would--

2208
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,940
 Right.

2209
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:14,420
 You're right.

2210
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,340
 Well, you don't see many babies with moustaches, do you?

2211
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,580
 It's a very good point.

2212
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,420
 Like all men have.

2213
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:20,140
 Like all men have.

2214
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,620
 Like all men have.

2215
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:23,380
 Just one more thing.

2216
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,820
 There was a guy who called Petra de Tabano in the 13th century.

2217
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:28,940
 And he said that he who drinks menstrual blood,

2218
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,300
 or that of a leper, will be seen to be distracted

2219
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:33,460
 and lunatic, evil-minded and forgetful.

2220
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,060
 And his cure is to drink of Daisy's powder

2221
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:38,460
 and mix with water of honey and to bathe in tepid water

2222
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:39,660
 and to copulate with girls.

2223
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:41,700
 [LAUGHTER]

2224
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:46,380
 Sound like you was building up to an excuse.

2225
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,380
 It was a weirdest day off ever.

2226
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,780
 But menstrual blood was thought to be quite a negative thing.

2227
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,140
 Quite a lot, wasn't it?

2228
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,660
 Although, Pliny, I thought a lot of fun stuff,

2229
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,900
 but thought that one of the things you could do

2230
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,740
 was collect the menstrual blood of someone.

2231
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:02,300
 And I don't know how you go about doing that.

2232
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:03,700
 And then you sprinkle it over your crops

2233
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:08,420
 because it kills all the bugs, because everything around.

2234
01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:09,580
 But not the crops.

2235
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,260
 Doesn't kill the crops, crops love it.

2236
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,700
 Bugs hate it.

2237
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:13,460
 Wow.

2238
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:17,060
 And also, in Papua New Guinea, there's--

2239
01:16:17,060 --> 01:16:19,660
 so in an island called Wogeo, which

2240
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:22,140
 is a tiny island off Papua New Guinea,

2241
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,260
 then menstrual blood is thought to be cleansing.

2242
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:28,020
 And it's thought to be kind of a good thing to menstruate.

2243
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:29,460
 And men want to do it.

2244
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,580
 I mean, this is really disgusting, sorry guys.

2245
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:34,020
 But they will sever their willies in order

2246
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:36,540
 to mimic the menstruation of women.

2247
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:38,780
 I heard they just sort of cut them

2248
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:41,100
 a bit without severing with crab claws.

2249
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,620
 Oh, they don't come off.

2250
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:43,300
 Sorry, they--

2251
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:44,700
 I'm sorry, it's just the word sever.

2252
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,220
 You're right.

2253
01:16:45,220 --> 01:16:46,740
 It's just the word sever.

2254
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,180
 When someone says his head's been severed,

2255
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,300
 you don't think, oh, we all need a plaster for that.

2256
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,500
 Sorry, you are right.

2257
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,940
 They didn't chop them all the way off.

2258
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,460
 Because you can only do that once, really.

2259
01:16:55,460 --> 01:16:57,780
 You need a very willing and patient crab, too, don't you?

2260
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,620
 Yeah.

2261
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:00,420
 Do you think what you think was attached?

2262
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,460
 Well, yeah, I imagine so.

2263
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:02,460
 Yeah, OK.

2264
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:04,100
 It's cool if you cut off the crab's claw

2265
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,100
 to cut your own penis.

2266
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,420
 I know, but you can at least control the claw at that point, I think.

2267
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:11,620
 Maybe the crab wants to emulate menstruation, as well.

2268
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:14,340
 So it's actually quite grateful.

2269
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,700
 Probably not.

2270
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,380
 OK.

2271
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:19,140
 OK, we'll get something out of that.

2272
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:19,900
 So you're right.

2273
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,020
 He did kind of move his face a lot, didn't he,

2274
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:22,540
 correct?

2275
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:25,140
 That was one of his main things that he did when acting.

2276
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:29,180
 There was a guy in 1756 who said that his realistic style

2277
01:17:29,180 --> 01:17:30,340
 went too far.

2278
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:33,100
 His overfundness for extravagant attitudes

2279
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:36,660
 frequently affected starts convulsive twitchings,

2280
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:39,500
 jerks of the body, sprawling of the fingers,

2281
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,740
 and slapping of the breast, were no good.

2282
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:46,380
 And he was a really good friends with Hogarth, the artist.

2283
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:49,380
 And so he was probably the most painted man in England

2284
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,180
 at the time, because Hogarth used to paint him all the time.

2285
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:53,900
 But Hogarth used to complain because he

2286
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:56,380
 moved his face so much all the time.

2287
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,620
 They couldn't paint him properly.

2288
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,700
 Oh, really?

2289
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:01,340
 There's one portrait of him, which is in the British Museum,

2290
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,100
 I think, it's called a mechanical portrait.

2291
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:08,180
 And it's a picture of him being painted by Hogarth.

2292
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,500
 But in the space where his face is,

2293
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,980
 there's one of those spinning wheels behind the picture.

2294
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,540
 And you can have 30 different facial expressions

2295
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,460
 as you wheel around.

2296
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:18,740
 He is very interesting.

2297
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,260
 He ran Drury Lane, which was one of the theaters that he had

2298
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:23,340
 for 30 years.

2299
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,140
 And no plays that were new plays at the time have survived.

2300
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,540
 It's a very odd thing, because there are a lot of plays

2301
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:30,860
 in that time.

2302
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:34,260
 And he was someone who he was doing a lot of the scheduling.

2303
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,620
 And despite his absolute love for Shakespeare,

2304
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,940
 he also had to do things that he absolutely

2305
01:18:38,940 --> 01:18:40,420
 detested pantomime.

2306
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:41,660
 He absolutely detested.

2307
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,380
 He hated clowns.

2308
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,300
 But--

2309
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,620
 Oh, no, he didn't, yeah.

2310
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,380
 He didn't?

2311
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:48,780
 Nice.

2312
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:49,900
 Oh, no, he didn't.

2313
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,260
 [LAUGHTER]

2314
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:57,500
 Oh, my goodness.

2315
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,100
 Get everybody-- he's behind you.

2316
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:02,100
 [LAUGHTER]

2317
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,580
 This is what we have to deal with.

2318
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,500
 [APPLAUSE]

2319
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,580
 God, that's just the proper insight

2320
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:12,100
 into how bad I feel about facts all the time, I just say.

2321
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,340
 Oh, he didn't-- random guy?

2322
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:15,700
 OK, you're right.

2323
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,180
 Must have checked my facts, you're definitely right.

2324
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:23,780
 Yeah, so he made the start of an evening

2325
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:25,780
 be the thing that would be the clown.

2326
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,780
 And he-- so like the pantomime clown stuff would be--

2327
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:32,780
 That's what we do, too, Dan.

2328
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,780
 [LAUGHTER]

2329
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:35,780
 Yeah.

2330
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:39,460
 Slav Doug, OK.

2331
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:43,780
 So what I was saying is, I will get to the--

2332
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:44,580
 You will.

2333
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:48,300
 So what's probably a wrong fact?

2334
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:50,780
 But so before a play started an evening,

2335
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:52,140
 they would have an appetizer, which

2336
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,980
 would be a hard-lequin style clown, a gremaldi,

2337
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,340
 who would come on and do a bit.

2338
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,420
 He absolutely hated that.

2339
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,940
 He, at one time, he was at a puppet show,

2340
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:03,540
 and he had to leave because he thought the applause

2341
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,740
 for Mr. Punch was so repulsive.

2342
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:07,500
 He was like, I've got to get out of here.

2343
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:09,980
 But he had to keep it in because people loved it,

2344
01:20:09,980 --> 01:20:12,460
 particularly King George III loved it.

2345
01:20:12,460 --> 01:20:13,980
 He'd never laughed so hard apparently

2346
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:18,060
 than when he was seeing a clown swallow a whole carrot on stage.

2347
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,340
 And that was the reason for keeping it.

2348
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,860
 Everyone in this audience is thinking,

2349
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:25,740
 God, I wish that was what was on tonight.

2350
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,300
 Are you apparently swallowed a lot of carrots?

2351
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:28,460
 It wasn't just the one as well.

2352
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:29,540
 Amazing.

2353
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:30,700
 But--

2354
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,900
 [LAUGHTER]

2355
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:33,420
 That's it.

2356
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,300
 We've all been there.

2357
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:36,540
 [LAUGHTER]

2358
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,340
 We--

2359
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,340
 [LAUGHTER]

2360
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:39,340
 OK.

2361
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:40,660
 [INAUDIBLE]

2362
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:41,900
 Before you find your prints, you

2363
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,220
 have to swallow a lot of carrots.

2364
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:46,140
 [LAUGHTER]

2365
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,980
 [APPLAUSE]

2366
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:52,460
 What are you uploading?

2367
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:53,900
 [LAUGHTER]

2368
