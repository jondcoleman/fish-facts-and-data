00:00:02,00:00:05,"Hi everyone, James here."
00:00:05,00:00:07,"Now, before we start this week's show,"
00:00:07,00:00:08,Merry Christmas.
00:00:08,00:00:09,I hope you've had a great Christmas.
00:00:09,00:00:11,"When I edit every single week,"
00:00:11,00:00:13,there's sometimes bits that are just
00:00:13,00:00:15,don't quite fit in with the rest of the show.
00:00:15,00:00:17,But maybe they're just really interesting.
00:00:17,00:00:20,Maybe they're really funny and they don't fit in.
00:00:20,00:00:24,Maybe it's just one incredible joke about hedgehogs
00:00:24,00:00:25,that was just so good.
00:00:25,00:00:27,I thought it would detract from the entire rest of the show
00:00:27,00:00:30,if I left it in and so I took it out.
00:00:30,00:00:32,"I take all those bits, I snuffle them away"
00:00:32,00:00:36,like a hedgehog does with nuts or whatever it is
00:00:36,00:00:37,that hedgehog's eat.
00:00:37,00:00:38,"And then at the end of the year,"
00:00:38,00:00:41,I put them all together for the best off show.
00:00:41,00:00:43,And this one is a real bumper special.
00:00:43,00:00:44,It's over an hour.
00:00:44,00:00:46,I really hope you enjoy it.
00:00:46,00:00:48,It's us just messing around
00:00:48,00:00:49,and we'll see you in the new year
00:00:49,00:00:51,with one of our normal shows.
00:00:51,00:00:55,"But in the meantime, enjoy this one and happy new year."
00:00:55,00:00:57,(dance music)
00:00:57,00:01:14,Hello and welcome to another episode
00:01:14,00:01:17,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast."
00:01:17,00:01:18,- Can't be what I do.
00:01:18,00:01:20,(laughing)
00:01:20,00:01:21,- I don't know if I'm doing it too.
00:01:21,00:01:22,Is that okay?
00:01:22,00:01:23,- I just try to put you up.
00:01:23,00:01:23,"- Oh, okay, cool."
00:01:23,00:01:25,"- That's because I think you're like,"
00:01:25,00:01:26,it's the volume thing.
00:01:26,00:01:27,"So I'm like, oh shit, shall I just start again?"
00:01:27,00:01:28,"- No, no, it's just being a dick."
00:01:28,00:01:29,"- Cool, all right."
00:01:29,00:01:31,- What?
00:01:31,00:01:34,"- Chang and Eng, the original Siamese twins,"
00:01:34,00:01:37,as in the first Siamese twins to be written about
00:01:37,00:01:39,"in the West, they were really interesting."
00:01:39,00:01:41,So they had a system where they were both married
00:01:41,00:01:44,and they would spend three nights each with each wife.
00:01:44,00:01:48,"And their great, great granddaughter"
00:01:48,00:01:50,"was the first, was the youngest ever recipient"
00:01:50,00:01:51,of a Pulitzer Prize for music.
00:01:51,00:01:54,"- But yeah, how weird is that?"
00:01:54,00:01:57,"2013, and yeah."
00:01:57,00:01:58,- Do you know her name?
00:01:58,00:02:00,"- Yeah, she's called Caroline Shaw."
00:02:00,00:02:00,Do you know her?
00:02:00,00:02:01,- Never heard of it.
00:02:01,00:02:02,"- Oh, okay."
00:02:02,00:02:04,She's done work with Kanye West.
00:02:04,00:02:05,- How's she?
00:02:05,00:02:06,- Do you know him?
00:02:06,00:02:06,- Never heard of him.
00:02:06,00:02:08,(laughing)
00:02:08,00:02:10,But the thing that toured Chang and Eng apart
00:02:10,00:02:11,"is that Chang developed a drinking problem,"
00:02:11,00:02:12,quite late in life.
00:02:12,00:02:13,- Suddenly.
00:02:13,00:02:14,- Suddenly.
00:02:14,00:02:16,"- Suddenly, hang on a few developer drinking problem."
00:02:16,00:02:18,Surely your Siamese twin also developed
00:02:18,00:02:19,a drinking problem.
00:02:19,00:02:21,"- They were only, they were joined at the chest."
00:02:21,00:02:22,So I think they had different livers.
00:02:22,00:02:23,- Okay.
00:02:23,00:02:24,- But it's not quite annoying
00:02:24,00:02:26,if you're constantly attached to a drunk.
00:02:26,00:02:27,(laughing)
00:02:27,00:02:28,"- Yeah, to be about it."
00:02:28,00:02:30,"- Oh, I've been touring for a while, yeah."
00:02:30,00:02:33,(laughing)
00:02:33,00:02:36,- There's one thing that Sonny Day is good for.
00:02:36,00:02:37,"Well, actually, there's loads of stuff."
00:02:37,00:02:39,(laughing)
00:02:39,00:02:41,"Okay, well, nice swim, a sunbathe,"
00:02:41,00:02:43,but mostly asking someone out.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"So it's good to ask someone out on a date,"
00:02:45,00:02:47,"and this is a French study, obviously,"
00:02:47,00:02:50,"and this French study found one attractive man,"
00:02:50,00:02:53,and they sent him round to ask out strangers.
00:02:53,00:02:54,- How did they find one of those in France?
00:02:54,00:02:55,(laughing)
00:02:55,00:02:57,- They had to recruit one from Scotland.
00:02:57,00:02:59,(laughing)
00:02:59,00:03:00,"Sorry, Scotland."
00:03:00,00:03:01,- We're looking forward to have a date next week.
00:03:01,00:03:04,(laughing)
00:03:04,00:03:05,- I don't mean that.
00:03:05,00:03:08,"- So yeah, they recruited this attractive French man,"
00:03:08,00:03:11,"and made him ask out lots of strangers on the street,"
00:03:11,00:03:12,and they found a huge difference.
00:03:12,00:03:17,"So when it was Sonny, 22.4% gave him a positive response,"
00:03:17,00:03:19,"and when it was cloudy, so not rainy, just cloudy,"
00:03:19,00:03:21,then 13.9% did.
00:03:21,00:03:22,- That is quite a big difference.
00:03:22,00:03:25,- But they did warn that it's not necessarily
00:03:25,00:03:28,"that we feel more prone to say yes on sunny days,"
00:03:28,00:03:31,it might be that your flirting skills improve in the sunshine.
00:03:31,00:03:34,"- It could be also that he was very bad her die,"
00:03:34,00:03:37,"and when it rains, it kind of washes down his face."
00:03:37,00:03:38,"And everyone's like, ""No, I'm not gonna come out with you,"
00:03:38,00:03:41,"""you just got ink all over your face."""
00:03:41,00:03:42,- It's not raining.
00:03:42,00:03:43,- Maybe when it's cloudy.
00:03:43,00:03:44,- It's cloudy.
00:03:44,00:03:45,"- We don't know about this guy,"
00:03:45,00:03:46,"'cause maybe when it's cloudy,"
00:03:46,00:03:49,he insists on wearing his Donald Duck shaped raincoat.
00:03:49,00:03:51,(laughing)
00:03:51,00:03:54,- That's his one with his white coat.
00:03:54,00:03:59,- Donald Duck actually is a very sexy character.
00:03:59,00:04:00,(laughing)
00:04:00,00:04:02,- Are you sure he's the right guy for this study?
00:04:02,00:04:03,(laughing)
00:04:03,00:04:05,I don't see him making a difference.
00:04:05,00:04:07,"- Trance is off, he's ready to go."
00:04:07,00:04:09,(laughing)
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- In France, there's been robots that have been designed"
00:04:12,00:04:15,to help out with any kind of fights
00:04:15,00:04:18,"that might happen between, let's say, football teams"
00:04:18,00:04:20,who happen to be watching the match in the same area.
00:04:20,00:04:23,"So in this case, there was a match going on"
00:04:23,00:04:25,between Russia and England.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"And there was a robot put in place called Alentom,"
00:04:27,00:04:32,"or a Lantom, and the robot's job was to basically stop the fight,"
00:04:32,00:04:35,"but not only that, they can see by using data"
00:04:35,00:04:38,whether or not it thinks a fight is about to break out.
00:04:38,00:04:40,So it can alert the police if it thinks
00:04:40,00:04:42,that something is gonna go wrong.
00:04:42,00:04:45,"Unfortunately, before it could do any of that stuff"
00:04:45,00:04:48,"at this match, someone beat it with a baseball bat."
00:04:48,00:04:49,(laughing)
00:04:49,00:04:50,"Yeah, and they couldn't revive it."
00:04:50,00:04:53,So that was Alentom's career.
00:04:53,00:04:55,- Is that because Alentom has had a rough time?
00:04:55,00:04:57,"Is that the same instant that there's a video of on YouTube,"
00:04:57,00:05:02,"which is where people are in Russia and in Moscow, in fact."
00:05:02,00:05:03,And there's a home video of people who are driving
00:05:03,00:05:05,"in their car, nor people got a video."
00:05:05,00:05:08,And they see someone drive out in front of them
00:05:08,00:05:10,"in a side car, with a side car."
00:05:10,00:05:12,"So on a bike with a side car, and in the side car is a robot."
00:05:12,00:05:15,"So there's some chuckling in the car that we're in,"
00:05:15,00:05:17,"as the viewer, 'cause they're like, ""What the fuck is that robot doing?"""
00:05:17,00:05:21,"And then they see that robot get cut up by another car,"
00:05:21,00:05:23,"and then both disappear around a corner,"
00:05:23,00:05:26,"and then you as the viewer, so these guys in the car"
00:05:26,00:05:29,"with their home video, follow it around that corner."
00:05:29,00:05:33,"And at that point, the bike with the side car has disappeared,"
00:05:33,00:05:37,"and Alentom, slash Alentom, we'll never know, he's dead now."
00:05:37,00:05:41,"Spoiler, it's just standing by the side of the road,"
00:05:41,00:05:43,"and the guy who's caught him up gets out of his car,"
00:05:43,00:05:45,"pulls the baseball bat from his passenger seat,"
00:05:45,00:05:46,goes up to him and knocks his head off.
00:05:46,00:05:47,"- Oh, I've not seen the footage, yeah."
00:05:47,00:05:49,"- So is this, like, like, yeah."
00:05:49,00:05:51,"- It could be, it wasn't a football match."
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- No, I should quickly say, this was in Moscow,"
00:05:52,00:05:55,"I said it was in France, this was in Moscow,"
00:05:55,00:05:58,and it was during the 2016 matches of the World Cup.
00:05:58,00:06:02,But what happened to Alentom is they set up the first ever
00:06:02,00:06:04,robot symmetry to bury him in.
00:06:04,00:06:06,"Yeah, it was seen as like, ""Don't do this to robots."""
00:06:06,00:06:07,- Have you seen it?
00:06:07,00:06:09,"- No, I've not seen anything apparently."
00:06:09,00:06:10,(laughing)
00:06:10,00:06:13,"- If this robot's symmetry, I look at these pages."
00:06:13,00:06:15,"- I said, ""I click on it, I don't just close my eyes"
00:06:15,00:06:16,"""and hope for the best."""
00:06:16,00:06:18,"Right, this symmetry."
00:06:18,00:06:21,(laughing)
00:06:21,00:06:23,"No, this symmetry is a piece of shit."
00:06:23,00:06:25,"If it's made to give robots a proper burial,"
00:06:25,00:06:28,it says it was spied by the murder of Alentom.
00:06:28,00:06:30,And it's called a symmetry.
00:06:30,00:06:32,"If you look it up, it's a cardboard box"
00:06:32,00:06:34,full of parts of robot.
00:06:34,00:06:38,It's in the lobby area of some kind of random conference building.
00:06:38,00:06:40,"And she said, the person who said it, I've said,"
00:06:40,00:06:42,"""It's great, the symmetry's been really popular,"
00:06:42,00:06:44,"""we're already getting lots of requests from people"
00:06:44,00:06:46,"""to bring in their own dead tech,"
00:06:46,00:06:49,"""like a red toy car and some batteries."""
00:06:49,00:06:51,- Wow.
00:06:51,00:06:52,- It's a plastic bag.
00:06:52,00:06:57,"- If you're a hedgehog who's running a circus,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,"don't say roll up, roll up."
00:06:59,00:07:01,(laughing)
00:07:01,00:07:04,"- No one's gonna come, we're just gonna stop that."
00:07:04,00:07:06,- Really boring circus.
00:07:06,00:07:06,- Yeah.
00:07:06,00:07:08,"- There was another Elizabeth Taylor,"
00:07:08,00:07:11,as well as the famous one who Kingsley Amos said
00:07:11,00:07:13,was one of the best English novelists
00:07:13,00:07:16,"born in this century, in the 20th century."
00:07:16,00:07:18,"And she was, the problem with her obviously,"
00:07:18,00:07:22,she had the same name as this extremely famous Elizabeth Taylor.
00:07:22,00:07:26,"And when her book Mrs. Lippincote came out in 1945,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,it was almost the same time as National Velvet came out
00:07:29,00:07:32,"for Elizabeth Taylor, the actress."
00:07:32,00:07:34,And then they interviewed her towards the end of her life.
00:07:34,00:07:37,"And she said, I've had a rather uneventful life, thank God."
00:07:37,00:07:41,"But sometimes the more eventful world intrudes into my life,"
00:07:41,00:07:44,I get fan letters to the other Elizabeth Taylor.
00:07:44,00:07:48,Men write to me and ask for a picture of me in my bikini.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"My husband thinks they should send one to shake them,"
00:07:52,00:07:53,(laughing)
00:07:53,00:07:54,but I have not got a bikini.
00:07:54,00:07:56,(laughing)
00:07:56,00:07:58,- So actually it's like insulting from your husband
00:07:58,00:08:00,"saying how you could really repel these people,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,is actually send that photo love.
00:08:02,00:08:05,- I've got a fact about people who are interested
00:08:05,00:08:06,in Nazi memorabilia.
00:08:06,00:08:11,"- So there is one guy who, he does just seem to be an obsessive collector,"
00:08:11,00:08:13,but the Guardian profiled him a few years ago.
00:08:13,00:08:14,He's called Kevin Weakroft.
00:08:14,00:08:16,And he grew up a multi-millionaire.
00:08:16,00:08:17,He's the editor of a huge fortune.
00:08:17,00:08:21,And he has the world's largest collection of Nazi memorabilia.
00:08:21,00:08:23,"He sleeps in Hitler's old bed,"
00:08:23,00:08:25,which he says he has changed the mattress.
00:08:25,00:08:27,(laughing)
00:08:27,00:08:29,- But he used a Lisa mattress.
00:08:29,00:08:30,"- No, no, no."
00:08:30,00:08:32,- But he has the last time they asked us.
00:08:32,00:08:35,(laughing)
00:08:36,00:08:39,"- He owns 88 tanks,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,which is more than the Danish and Belgian armies combined.
00:08:42,00:08:43,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:08:43,00:08:46,"- Jesus, so they're quaking in their boots."
00:08:46,00:08:47,The idea he might invade?
00:08:47,00:08:51,"- Yeah, I mean it's more the historical pieces, obviously,"
00:08:51,00:08:52,and they wouldn't be much good today
00:08:52,00:08:53,for invading anywhere.
00:08:53,00:08:54,- Okay.
00:08:54,00:08:56,"It is weird, isn't it, collecting Nazi memorabilia?"
00:08:56,00:08:58,"You've got to ask some questions, I think."
00:08:58,00:09:00,- They did ask him a lot of questions.
00:09:00,00:09:02,(laughing)
00:09:02,00:09:05,"- Well, they're doing the right thing."
00:09:05,00:09:06,(laughing)
00:09:06,00:09:07,"- But they concluded he was just,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,"you know, he was a collector rather than a Nazi, you know?"
00:09:09,00:09:11,"- If you ask some questions and people answer them,"
00:09:11,00:09:12,that's absolutely fine.
00:09:12,00:09:13,I'm just saying you've got to ask the questions.
00:09:13,00:09:15,- There are lots of things he could collect though.
00:09:15,00:09:15,Why did he choose that?
00:09:15,00:09:18,Did they ask that question?
00:09:18,00:09:20,"- I can't remember what his answer was,"
00:09:20,00:09:22,but I'm sure it was a good one.
00:09:22,00:09:23,(laughing)
00:09:23,00:09:25,"- I'm sorry, really like the nonsense."
00:09:25,00:09:26,- And wish they were back.
00:09:26,00:09:29,(laughing)
00:09:29,00:09:31,(laughing)
00:09:31,00:09:33,"- I was reading that, so I was looking into"
00:09:33,00:09:36,"just general shrimp, like eating shrimp particularly,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,'cause they're eating it on the space station.
00:09:38,00:09:41,Did you know that there are shrimp recipes available
00:09:41,00:09:42,from the rapper Kulio?
00:09:42,00:09:44,(laughing)
00:09:44,00:09:46,I did not know that.
00:09:46,00:09:47,- Yeah.
00:09:47,00:09:52,"He released a cookbook a few years back,"
00:09:52,00:09:54,called How to Become a Kitchen Pimp.
00:09:54,00:09:59,"And it's got, I mean, there's great chapters."
00:09:59,00:10:04,"Appetizers for that ass, Saladied in Bitches,"
00:10:04,00:10:08,"Vegetarians, Question Mark, okay, whatever."
00:10:08,00:10:09,That's it.
00:10:09,00:10:11,(laughing)
00:10:11,00:10:13,"And then he has a whole chapter for shrimps,"
00:10:13,00:10:15,"which is called It's Hard Out Here for a Shrimp,"
00:10:15,00:10:17,"which is, some will know, is a famous song,"
00:10:17,00:10:19,It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"Yeah, so, and there's videos of people trying out"
00:10:21,00:10:24,his recipes and he doesn't come across great
00:10:24,00:10:26,with his choices of what to do.
00:10:26,00:10:29,"But yeah, but if anyone needs a Kulio Shrimp recipe,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,"yeah, it's there."
00:10:30,00:10:31,(laughing)
00:10:31,00:10:33,- It's what a lot of people here came for to buy that thing.
00:10:33,00:10:35,(laughing)
00:10:35,00:10:38,"- So Hedgehogs, there's a Hedgehog Olympic Games,"
00:10:38,00:10:39,"which is from, I found this out of a book"
00:10:39,00:10:42,"called A Prickly Affair, which is by a guy"
00:10:42,00:10:44,who's really into Hedgehogs.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"But he was talking, I think they're in America somewhere"
00:10:46,00:10:48,and he was saying one of the competitors
00:10:48,00:10:50,"is a guy called Zug Standing Bear,"
00:10:50,00:10:52,who was one of Gerald Ford's bodyguards.
00:10:52,00:10:55,"And he's now a champion,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"and he now has a champion hog called Buttercup,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,which he can piece at the Olympic Games.
00:10:59,00:11:01,"And he reported of another one,"
00:11:01,00:11:03,"who's a woman called Dawn Robelle,"
00:11:03,00:11:05,who says that she communicates telepathically
00:11:05,00:11:06,with her Hedgehogs.
00:11:06,00:11:08,"- This has got to be a cheat too, isn't it?"
00:11:08,00:11:09,- Yeah.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- You can't do that.
00:11:10,00:11:12,- Is it in the human Olympic rules
00:11:12,00:11:13,that you can't communicate telepathically?
00:11:13,00:11:15,"- No, telepathically, yes, yeah."
00:11:15,00:11:16,Because what would you say as well?
00:11:16,00:11:18,"Try the traveling really far, you know?"
00:11:18,00:11:20,"- Yeah, faster, you're saying faster."
00:11:20,00:11:22,- You can't cheat in the Olympics.
00:11:22,00:11:24,"Well, actually, we have learned over the years,"
00:11:24,00:11:24,definitely not.
00:11:24,00:11:25,(laughing)
00:11:25,00:11:27,You can't cheat by whispering in someone's ear
00:11:27,00:11:28,with the Olympics.
00:11:28,00:11:31,But she does say that her Hedgehogs
00:11:31,00:11:33,call themselves star children.
00:11:33,00:11:34,- They call themselves that.
00:11:34,00:11:35,"- Yeah, they refer to themselves."
00:11:35,00:11:37,"- Oh, I see, telepathically, yeah, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:39,"Sorry, what are the events at the Hedgehog Olympic Games?"
00:11:39,00:11:43,- I think sort of racing and chopping and jumping.
00:11:43,00:11:45,"I actually don't, so I didn't read in this article,"
00:11:45,00:11:47,he didn't detail what the events were.
00:11:47,00:11:48,- Okay.
00:11:48,00:11:49,- Why the Hedgehog races?
00:11:49,00:11:50,Because they run quite fast.
00:11:50,00:11:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:11:51,00:11:53,"- Surprisingly, yeah, not as fast as humans."
00:11:53,00:11:54,"- No, you could beat a Hedgehog, yeah."
00:11:54,00:11:57,- That's why the inter-human and Hedgehog Olympics
00:11:57,00:11:58,have never taken up.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"- But actually, what people don't know is"
00:12:00,00:12:01,that Hedgehogs are allowed to take part
00:12:01,00:12:04,"in the human Olympics, but they just never qualified."
00:12:04,00:12:05,- That is slow.
00:12:05,00:12:06,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:12:06,00:12:07,- You never reached a qualified type.
00:12:07,00:12:09,(laughing)
00:12:09,00:12:14,- I found just a couple of animal smells.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"So male silkworm moths, they can sense a single molecule"
00:12:17,00:12:21,of female sex hormone from a mile away.
00:12:21,00:12:22,- I'd never understand what they mean.
00:12:22,00:12:23,"- I know, I don't know."
00:12:23,00:12:26,I'll say that because presumably you need the molecule
00:12:26,00:12:28,to get into your nose before you sense it.
00:12:28,00:12:30,And so how can it be a mile away?
00:12:30,00:12:31,I've just never understood that.
00:12:31,00:12:33,It's the same with sharks and blood.
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- Yeah, just don't get it."
00:12:34,00:12:35,"- Yeah, I know."
00:12:35,00:12:36,That's the thing.
00:12:36,00:12:38,"All the things I read about animals smelling it,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"like, albatross can smell fish from the air."
00:12:40,00:12:41,- That makes a lot of sense.
00:12:41,00:12:44,Because that's the scent molecules that are the problem.
00:12:44,00:12:46,So the scent molecules are coming off the fish.
00:12:46,00:12:46,That's fine.
00:12:46,00:12:47,Then it goes through the air
00:12:47,00:12:49,and then up to the albatrosses knows.
00:12:49,00:12:51,"But if you're smelling a molecule,"
00:12:51,00:12:53,"that's the thing that causes you to smell, if it's a mile away."
00:12:53,00:12:55,"- I think it's a distance, though,"
00:12:55,00:12:57,"with the albatrosses, what is amazing scientists,"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"because the molecules break up with whatever direction,"
00:13:00,00:13:01,the wind is blowing in.
00:13:01,00:13:02,- It is incredible.
00:13:02,00:13:03,But at least we understand how it's possible.
00:13:03,00:13:06,- I guess it must be that the molecule is entering
00:13:06,00:13:07,"that was it a moth, did you say?"
00:13:07,00:13:08,- Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:09,"- It must be that they can,"
00:13:09,00:13:12,"when a molecule released by a female,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"a mile away gets in their nose,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,they can tell the direction has come from
00:13:16,00:13:19,"or it retains its potency or they can still detect it,"
00:13:19,00:13:20,even though it's traveled a mile.
00:13:20,00:13:21,- Yeah.
00:13:21,00:13:22,- It must be something like that.
00:13:22,00:13:24,- You can't smell a molecule from them.
00:13:24,00:13:25,A mile away from the molecule.
00:13:25,00:13:27,"- But that's the thing, it's like when you're in the sea"
00:13:27,00:13:29,"and you cut your finger, right?"
00:13:29,00:13:31,"And there's a tiny little blood goes in the sea,"
00:13:31,00:13:35,"then supposedly, Jaws is able to tell it's there"
00:13:35,00:13:36,"from like 10 miles away, right?"
00:13:36,00:13:37,That's the whole point of it.
00:13:37,00:13:38,- Yeah.
00:13:38,00:13:40,- But Sholly has to wait for the blood to get to him.
00:13:40,00:13:41,"- Which will take ages, right?"
00:13:41,00:13:42,If it's traveling through water.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"- Well, current, though, current's happened."
00:13:44,00:13:45,- Yeah.
00:13:45,00:13:47,(laughing)
00:13:47,00:13:50,- It's like me looking at that wall
00:13:50,00:13:51,"on the other side of the room and saying,"
00:13:51,00:13:53,"""I can feel that from here."""
00:13:53,00:13:54,"And it just doesn't, in order to feel it,"
00:13:54,00:13:55,it has to come to you.
00:13:55,00:13:57,- You don't necessarily have to go to it.
00:13:57,00:13:58,- Exactly.
00:13:58,00:13:58,We have to meet.
00:13:58,00:13:59,(laughing)
00:13:59,00:14:02,"- I mean, Anna, that was a stunningly vivid example"
00:14:02,00:14:04,of that wall on the other side of the room.
00:14:04,00:14:05,(laughing)
00:14:05,00:14:06,Where do you get these ideas from?
00:14:06,00:14:07,- I don't know.
00:14:07,00:14:09,- I'm a creative kind of guy.
00:14:09,00:14:11,(laughing)
00:14:11,00:14:14,- Did you know the ISS is battery powered?
00:14:14,00:14:14,- I didn't know that.
00:14:14,00:14:16,- Is it AA or triple A?
00:14:16,00:14:17,(laughing)
00:14:17,00:14:19,- There are actually no A's at all.
00:14:19,00:14:22,"They are the size of fridges, the batteries on the ISS,"
00:14:22,00:14:25,but sometimes they have to change the batteries.
00:14:25,00:14:26,- How do you do that?
00:14:26,00:14:27,"- So you take these fridges out,"
00:14:27,00:14:31,"you rub them a few times, and then you put them back in again."
00:14:31,00:14:34,"- So there are 48 batteries,"
00:14:34,00:14:35,"and it's for when the stations are in shadow,"
00:14:35,00:14:37,'cause there are big solar cells for when it's in sunlight.
00:14:37,00:14:39,"But these are nickel hydrogen batteries,"
00:14:39,00:14:41,and they are slowly being swapped over
00:14:41,00:14:44,"for new kinds of batteries, which are run on lithium."
00:14:44,00:14:45,So they all have to be changed.
00:14:45,00:14:48,And you get two astronauts out there
00:14:48,00:14:51,"who have to take a fridge out of position,"
00:14:51,00:14:53,"carry it back to the right place,"
00:14:53,00:14:55,"and then put the new one in, which is--"
00:14:55,00:14:57,"- Yeah, it really is."
00:14:57,00:14:59,And they have to strap them to a pallet.
00:14:59,00:15:01,"They weigh about 200 kilos, but obviously in space,"
00:15:01,00:15:03,you don't feel that.
00:15:03,00:15:05,"However, that is stressful."
00:15:05,00:15:07,"And also, if you slightly dent the back of it,"
00:15:07,00:15:09,"the connection bit, it won't fit in,"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"and then you're absolutely stuffed,"
00:15:11,00:15:14,"and they're trained, obviously, and taught about it,"
00:15:14,00:15:16,but a lot of them change the batteries
00:15:16,00:15:18,without having practiced it.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"- Yeah, practice that kind of thing."
00:15:20,00:15:21,- Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:23,"- Gone work in MFI for a week and a half,"
00:15:23,00:15:25,maybe in French is around.
00:15:25,00:15:27,I remember reading earlier this year
00:15:27,00:15:28,that there are massive batteries
00:15:28,00:15:31,"all around the British countryside,"
00:15:31,00:15:34,which we use whenever our electricity goes off.
00:15:34,00:15:36,Do you remember there was a massive power cut?
00:15:36,00:15:38,"Two things got hit at the same time,"
00:15:38,00:15:39,and loads of people went off.
00:15:39,00:15:42,"Apparently, what happens then is these batteries kicking,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,and they're just kind of hanging around.
00:15:44,00:15:47,"There's like about 50 of them, absolutely massive batteries."
00:15:47,00:15:48,That's so cool.
00:15:48,00:15:49,- Isn't it cool?
00:15:49,00:15:50,"- I didn't really read any more about them,"
00:15:50,00:15:51,so I don't know how to tell you anything.
00:15:51,00:15:53,- It's the way you're painting it.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"I'm now sort of imagining a real walking,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"finding a giant gyro cell,"
00:15:57,00:16:00,and a funny battery just standing up in a field.
00:16:00,00:16:02,- That's what I imagine it is.
00:16:02,00:16:03,Let's assume it's that.
00:16:03,00:16:06,"- I was, this is not a fact."
00:16:06,00:16:08,"It was just a thought I had today,"
00:16:08,00:16:11,which is what happens to rain when it rains on a cloud?
00:16:12,00:16:13,- Oh.
00:16:13,00:16:16,- So you get higher clouds and lower clouds.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"Does it get collected by the lower cloud,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"like a sponge, or does it go through the clouds?"
00:16:19,00:16:25,Like it darts through and just passes through the...
00:16:25,00:16:26,"- Some of it might become the cloud,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,or some of it might go down through the cloud.
00:16:29,00:16:30,- It's such a good question.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- It's a good question.
00:16:31,00:16:33,"- Clouds are not like sponges, I should say."
00:16:33,00:16:34,"- No, but I guess 'cause it's water,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,I just didn't know if it just sort of collected
00:16:36,00:16:38,"like a, like a sky puddle, basically."
00:16:38,00:16:40,"- It probably depends, yeah."
00:16:40,00:16:42,- It probably depends how big the droplets are.
00:16:42,00:16:43,- Clouds are very small droplets.
00:16:43,00:16:45,"By the time it's big enough to fall as a raindrop,"
00:16:45,00:16:47,"that's really big, isn't it?"
00:16:47,00:16:47,- It's gotten quite heavy.
00:16:47,00:16:49,"So actually, yeah, that's right."
00:16:49,00:16:51,So it will be too big.
00:16:51,00:16:52,"If it's big enough to be falling,"
00:16:52,00:16:54,it'll be too big to be staying as a cloud.
00:16:54,00:16:55,"- And it also, yeah."
00:16:55,00:16:57,And it would never rain on a cloud.
00:16:57,00:16:59,"Anyway, would it, would any of us snow on a cloud?"
00:16:59,00:17:00,"- No, it isn't."
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Basically, rain on it."
00:17:01,00:17:02,- Does it all rain start out with snow?
00:17:02,00:17:03,- Yep.
00:17:03,00:17:04,- No.
00:17:04,00:17:06,"- It's always, if it's raining outside,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,"it's all snow, which happens to have melted on the way down."
00:17:08,00:17:09,- You're kidding.
00:17:09,00:17:10,- It's always snowing.
00:17:10,00:17:11,- Look at it that way.
00:17:11,00:17:13,"- Yeah, that's very cool, didn't know that."
00:17:13,00:17:13,- Yeah.
00:17:13,00:17:16,"- Just one more actual effect of climate change,"
00:17:16,00:17:20,"as it's happening, is that some clouds may go extinct."
00:17:20,00:17:21,- What?
00:17:21,00:17:22,"- Yeah, this is how big the effect we're having."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"So, Stratocumulus cloud decks,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,they're the very low clouds which reflect
00:17:27,00:17:29,a lot of solar radiation back into space.
00:17:29,00:17:33,"And if there are, if levels of carbon dioxide"
00:17:33,00:17:35,"go up much more, this might suppress"
00:17:35,00:17:36,the actual formation of these clouds.
00:17:36,00:17:38,So you won't get them anymore.
00:17:38,00:17:39,- Oh no.
00:17:39,00:17:41,- We can no longer make hilarious animal shapes
00:17:41,00:17:43,in our imaginations out of clouds in the sky.
00:17:43,00:17:45,"- Oh, we all still have clouds."
00:17:45,00:17:47,It's just this one particular.
00:17:47,00:17:49,It's not gonna be a sunny day after a single day.
00:17:49,00:17:50,- But what if this one particular cloud
00:17:50,00:17:52,is the only one that ever made those shapes?
00:17:52,00:17:53,"- Oh, absolutely, right."
00:17:53,00:17:54,- Wow.
00:17:54,00:17:55,- It could be the animal shape cloud.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"- Anna Toshinsky, really bringing home"
00:17:57,00:17:59,the eco crisis that we're in at the moment.
00:17:59,00:18:00,- Yeah.
00:18:00,00:18:02,You're welcome extinction rebellion.
00:18:02,00:18:04,Say it loud and say it cloud.
00:18:04,00:18:05,That's all right.
00:18:05,00:18:06,(laughing)
00:18:06,00:18:11,- I went on to the website CNN's most secretive jobs.
00:18:11,00:18:15,And they had the usual things like spies
00:18:15,00:18:16,and restaurant reviewers.
00:18:16,00:18:19,Another one is a ward show auditor.
00:18:19,00:18:20,- Oh.
00:18:20,00:18:22,- Apparently you have to be very secretive with that.
00:18:22,00:18:23,- What's that?
00:18:23,00:18:24,- It's for results.
00:18:24,00:18:26,"So you don't tell, you know, you don't screw up"
00:18:26,00:18:27,"and give, well, I'll land the right food."
00:18:27,00:18:29,(laughing)
00:18:29,00:18:30,Envelope.
00:18:30,00:18:32,So what you need is a bachelor's degree
00:18:32,00:18:34,in an accounting or related field
00:18:34,00:18:38,and experience in accounting or auditing.
00:18:38,00:18:39,That's all it says you need.
00:18:39,00:18:40,And I've got both those things.
00:18:40,00:18:41,- Need us to hold us.
00:18:41,00:18:42,- Yeah.
00:18:42,00:18:43,- Oh.
00:18:43,00:18:44,(laughing)
00:18:44,00:18:45,"Apart from that, you're doing so well."
00:18:45,00:18:47,- Damn it.
00:18:47,00:18:48,- That's awesome.
00:18:48,00:18:49,"Hey, how about a made up language?"
00:18:49,00:18:50,- Yes.
00:18:50,00:18:51,- It's called dothraki.
00:18:51,00:18:52,- Oh yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:52,- Yeah.
00:18:52,00:18:54,- So all languages are made up.
00:18:54,00:18:55,(laughing)
00:18:55,00:18:56,"Oh, here he goes again."
00:18:56,00:18:57,(laughing)
00:18:57,00:18:58,"- Oh, conspiracy theorists."
00:18:58,00:18:59,(laughing)
00:18:59,00:19:00,"- No, it's on point."
00:19:00,00:19:01,(laughing)
00:19:01,00:19:02,- That's very enough.
00:19:02,00:19:05,"- Sorry, okay, a recently made up language."
00:19:05,00:19:07,"- Made up language, yeah."
00:19:07,00:19:10,So obviously so many people have heard it being spoken
00:19:10,00:19:12,"'cause it became the trans, you know, being big this year."
00:19:12,00:19:14,So 10 to millions of people have been hearing it.
00:19:14,00:19:18,"It's more than Welsh, Irish, Gaelic, and Scotscale combined."
00:19:18,00:19:22,But I did not know the language is full of little Easter eggs.
00:19:22,00:19:25,"So normally people speak it, actually speak it."
00:19:25,00:19:27,"One of them is the inventor, David Peterson,"
00:19:27,00:19:30,"who's really, he sort of makes languages for Hollywood"
00:19:30,00:19:31,as his job.
00:19:31,00:19:32,- Oh wow.
00:19:32,00:19:34,"- And obviously there are not many jobs in the world,"
00:19:34,00:19:36,but there are not many jobs in that industry
00:19:36,00:19:38,because it's such a rare thing to be commissioned
00:19:38,00:19:40,to make a full language.
00:19:40,00:19:41,So he has a little fun with it.
00:19:41,00:19:45,So the Dothraki word for eagle is culvert
00:19:45,00:19:48,and that is based on Stephen Colbert.
00:19:48,00:19:50,"For reasons I didn't get to the bottom of, yeah."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"And there was, based on his wife,"
00:19:52,00:19:57,"not Colbert's wife, David Peterson, the inventor."
00:19:57,00:19:58,- The word for periatracting.
00:19:58,00:20:00,(laughing)
00:20:02,00:20:04,- So David Peterson's wife is called Erin.
00:20:04,00:20:07,"So in Dothraki, Erin means kind,"
00:20:07,00:20:08,or Erin act means kind one.
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Cool.
00:20:09,00:20:10,- Lucky it's not fucking bitter.
00:20:10,00:20:12,(laughing)
00:20:12,00:20:16,"- Yes, he's really venting through these languages."
00:20:16,00:20:20,"- I think I read and I, so, I hope this is right,"
00:20:20,00:20:23,but I believe as well that he's a Monty Python fan.
00:20:23,00:20:26,And so there's points when there's armies coming towards
00:20:26,00:20:29,some like a scene in Game of Thrones
00:20:29,00:20:32,where they're yelling at people coming towards them.
00:20:32,00:20:35,He takes the words that were used in Monty Python
00:20:35,00:20:36,"and the Holy Grail when they're yelling,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,"""You are French, Cal, you're whatever,"
00:20:38,00:20:40,"""whatever those words I comment what they are."""
00:20:40,00:20:42,"But yeah, it's Monty Python dialogue"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"translated into Dothraki used, yeah."
00:20:46,00:20:49,"- So I've got a fact about modern trains,"
00:20:49,00:20:52,"which is about the queen who, as we know, has the royal train."
00:20:52,00:20:55,So when she's traveling on the royal train
00:20:55,00:20:58,"and when she's been traveling overnight,"
00:20:58,00:21:00,there's a special instruction that gets given out.
00:21:00,00:21:03,And that is that the queen has a bath at 7.30 in the morning.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"So if the train is going then, the driver is ordered"
00:21:06,00:21:10,"to, the driver is ordered to avoid any bumpy bits of track"
00:21:10,00:21:12,so that her bath doesn't slosh around too much.
00:21:12,00:21:13,- Okay.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"- Bumpy tracks, first of all, do we have bumpy tracks?"
00:21:16,00:21:17,Or are they all full?
00:21:17,00:21:18,"- You get bumpy bits, don't you?"
00:21:18,00:21:19,"- Yeah, it's trap corners."
00:21:19,00:21:22,"- And certainly, you don't get corners."
00:21:22,00:21:25,"- Well, like you do, not corner like round bits."
00:21:25,00:21:27,"- But secondly, how do you avoid the bumpy bits?"
00:21:27,00:21:28,You can't swerve in a train.
00:21:28,00:21:30,- You can get lifted off onto a boat.
00:21:30,00:21:32,"- Then you gauge, then it comes back down there."
00:21:32,00:21:33,"- Yeah, I think the queen's freedom of movement"
00:21:33,00:21:36,is just severely limited as to where she can go.
00:21:36,00:21:38,- She can only go to the flat bits.
00:21:38,00:21:39,- She can only get to the flat bits.
00:21:39,00:21:41,- The queen's going all directions.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- It's a good point, yeah."
00:21:42,00:21:44,- That's weird knowing when the queen has a bath.
00:21:44,00:21:46,I think you'd be freaked out as the train driver.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"Every morning at 7.30 you'd think,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,"""Oh, she's passing now."""
00:21:50,00:21:52,- Don't make any mistakes.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"- She's naked, and he adds for me."
00:21:54,00:21:56,It's a weird thought.
00:21:56,00:21:57,- It's a big train.
00:21:57,00:21:59,- I don't think it's only 10 metres long.
00:21:59,00:22:01,"- She's like in the cab, in the tub."
00:22:01,00:22:02,(laughing)
00:22:02,00:22:03,- He puts the bath next to the driver's seat.
00:22:03,00:22:04,- More coal.
00:22:04,00:22:05,(laughing)
00:22:05,00:22:07,- It's much bigger than the vehicle van.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"- One more thing about Luroll,"
00:22:09,00:22:11,"which is more just a rant than in fact,"
00:22:11,00:22:12,"coloured Luroll,"
00:22:12,00:22:14,"disappeared off the face of the earth, right?"
00:22:14,00:22:15,- Uh-huh.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"- So, I think you can still buy it, can you?"
00:22:16,00:22:17,- You can still buy it.
00:22:17,00:22:20,"In 2004, it was 30% of Luroll that was sold."
00:22:20,00:22:21,- Wow.
00:22:21,00:22:22,- Now it's under 10%.
00:22:22,00:22:25,"And this, I was reading an article in the telegraph"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"about why this has happened,"
00:22:26,00:22:27,"about how angry people are about it,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,'cause people used to buy their Luroll
00:22:29,00:22:31,"to match their decor, right?"
00:22:31,00:22:34,"And now, they did, that was a thing."
00:22:34,00:22:36,"There was someone who wrote into the telegraph saying,"
00:22:36,00:22:39,"""Why is it impossible now to buy blue lavatory rolls?"
00:22:39,00:22:40,"""Unless we find some soon,"
00:22:40,00:22:42,"""I'll be forced to redecorate my bathroom."""
00:22:42,00:22:44,(laughing)
00:22:44,00:22:46,"- There was another one,"
00:22:46,00:22:48,"corresponded in bletchingly,"
00:22:48,00:22:50,who described a priest friend
00:22:50,00:22:52,who used to change the hue of his Lurolls
00:22:52,00:22:54,to match the liturgical seasons.
00:22:54,00:22:56,(laughing)
00:22:56,00:22:59,"- Green for Trinity, purple for Lent and Advent,"
00:22:59,00:23:01,and pink for Saint Stays.
00:23:01,00:23:02,"- Well, there's a lot of Saint Stays, isn't there?"
00:23:02,00:23:04,"- Yeah, he was doing a lot of Luroll changing."
00:23:04,00:23:05,- That is amazing.
00:23:05,00:23:06,"I suppose the other thing is,"
00:23:06,00:23:10,like you don't really get colored sinks
00:23:10,00:23:11,"and stuff like that, do you?"
00:23:11,00:23:12,"Like in the '70s and stuff,"
00:23:12,00:23:16,"you get avocado, sink, stuff."
00:23:16,00:23:19,"If that was the first time I knew the word avocado,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,"'cause I didn't have avocados when I was growing up,"
00:23:21,00:23:23,you didn't really get them in the '70s and '80s.
00:23:23,00:23:24,- Yeah.
00:23:24,00:23:26,- But we used the word to describe the color
00:23:26,00:23:28,of people's toilets.
00:23:28,00:23:29,- Yes.
00:23:29,00:23:30,- So when people started eating them.
00:23:30,00:23:31,- I was so confused.
00:23:31,00:23:33,(laughing)
00:23:33,00:23:34,- You break your teeth.
00:23:34,00:23:35,- I have one more drink
00:23:35,00:23:37,that William of Orange drank.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"So I'm talking to William of Orange,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,who was married to Mary.
00:23:42,00:23:44,"So he was a King of England, there's a few other ones,"
00:23:44,00:23:46,but this is that one.
00:23:46,00:23:49,"He drank Benedictine Posit,"
00:23:49,00:23:51,"which was a mixture of warm milk,"
00:23:51,00:23:54,"eggs, cream, and ale,"
00:23:54,00:23:56,with nutmeg and custard on top.
00:23:56,00:23:56,(laughing)
00:23:56,00:23:58,"And he drank this on his wedding day,"
00:23:58,00:23:59,'cause it was what?
00:23:59,00:24:01,Everyone who was rich and posh used to drink
00:24:01,00:24:02,on their wedding day.
00:24:02,00:24:05,"And the priest would come along, he would bless them,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,"and then they would give them this benediction Posit,"
00:24:08,00:24:11,and people wouldn't leave until they drank it.
00:24:11,00:24:13,Charles II waited until the bride and bridegroom
00:24:13,00:24:15,had finished off their bowl of Posit
00:24:15,00:24:18,and then drew the bed curtains himself
00:24:18,00:24:19,on the day of their wedding.
00:24:19,00:24:20,- Oh really?
00:24:20,00:24:21,"- So I read that he stayed in the room,"
00:24:21,00:24:24,"shouting encouragement during the,"
00:24:24,00:24:26,there are lots of stories saying he was shouting
00:24:26,00:24:27,"during the consummation,"
00:24:27,00:24:29,but we've asked the team before that consummation
00:24:29,00:24:31,doesn't mean they're actually having sex.
00:24:31,00:24:34,"I mean, the bride was only 15 at the time,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"but yeah, that's the story."
00:24:36,00:24:37,"- So Charles, we think Charles might have been there,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,"'cause if he'd drawn the curtain,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,"he could still have stayed on the outside shouting encouragement,"
00:24:40,00:24:41,couldn't he? - Yeah.
00:24:41,00:24:43,- That's true.
00:24:43,00:24:45,- You know when you were younger and just...
00:24:45,00:24:46,- That's not what the story could have been.
00:24:46,00:24:47,- Here we go.
00:24:47,00:24:48,"- You know when you're 15,"
00:24:48,00:24:51,I read a kid going good. (laughing)
00:24:51,00:24:52,"- Someone draws the curtain,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,but they still give you instructions.
00:24:53,00:24:55,"You know when you go to the Lou when you are kidding,"
00:24:55,00:24:57,"you're just learning to go to the Lou on your own,"
00:24:57,00:24:59,and your mum stands on the other side of the door
00:24:59,00:25:02,"and she's like, you know, have you wiped your bottom?"
00:25:02,00:25:03,"Maybe, so it was sort of like that,"
00:25:03,00:25:05,"you pulled the curtain, but you're still outside saying,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"you know, put it there. - Put it there."
00:25:08,00:25:15,"- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's the nostril. (laughing)"
00:25:15,00:25:20,- Splendid difference. (laughing)
00:25:20,00:25:22,"- There's another old Scottish one, which is,"
00:25:22,00:25:25,"if you're fishing and you catch a boot,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,that can go either way for you.
00:25:27,00:25:30,"If it's a left boot, that's bad luck."
00:25:30,00:25:31,You're in serious trouble.
00:25:31,00:25:32,Fish are not gonna come to you.
00:25:32,00:25:35,"If you get a right boot, you're in much luck,"
00:25:35,00:25:37,"and you have to nail it to your mass to say,"
00:25:37,00:25:39,"""Look at my right boot, come fish."""
00:25:39,00:25:43,"And that's, in both instances, you're in a cartoon."
00:25:43,00:25:46,(laughing)
00:25:46,00:25:48,"- And in neither instance have you caught a fish,"
00:25:48,00:25:49,which presumably is the aim.
00:25:49,00:25:51,(laughing)
00:25:51,00:25:54,"- Yes, but your boot business back home is going,"
00:25:54,00:25:55,you've caught a soul.
00:25:55,00:25:57,(cheering)
00:25:57,00:25:59,- Yeah.
00:25:59,00:26:04,"- I was quickly just on ""Rudeness."""
00:26:04,00:26:07,"I was reading Danny Wallace's book about ""Rudeness,"""
00:26:07,00:26:09,"which is called ""Fuck you very much."""
00:26:09,00:26:12,The surprising truth about why people are so rude.
00:26:12,00:26:13,"And he did some of his own research,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,"and he asked what people had done,"
00:26:15,00:26:17,"'cause like I was saying, if people are rude to you,"
00:26:17,00:26:19,you automatically are rude back to them.
00:26:19,00:26:22,It's the weird kind of contagion thing.
00:26:22,00:26:24,He was asking people what they had done
00:26:24,00:26:26,when someone had been rude to them.
00:26:26,00:26:30,"And answers included, ""I rubbed fries on the windshield."
00:26:30,00:26:33,I turned all their possessions upside down.
00:26:33,00:26:35,I let a dog lick a sausage.
00:26:35,00:26:38,"I was serving them, (laughing)"
00:26:38,00:26:40,"and I slept with their partner."""
00:26:40,00:26:42,(laughing)
00:26:42,00:26:43,That's rude.
00:26:43,00:26:45,- And was that all the same person?
00:26:45,00:26:48,- Just kind of a very bad day.
00:26:48,00:26:50,(laughing)
00:26:50,00:26:52,"- I was looking at flaws, some flaws."
00:26:52,00:26:56,So the world's flattest flaw is owned by NASA.
00:26:56,00:26:58,"It's in Huntsville, Alabama,"
00:26:58,00:27:00,and it's made of this kind of resin.
00:27:00,00:27:04,"And it's a bit like, do you know these hockey tables?"
00:27:04,00:27:05,- Yeah.
00:27:05,00:27:06,"- So there's a cushion of air on it,"
00:27:06,00:27:10,"and whatever what they do is they kind of get like a sofa on it,"
00:27:10,00:27:11,"or anything, they'll can do it with anything,"
00:27:11,00:27:13,but the funnest one is a sofa.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"And they have little air coming out of the sofa,"
00:27:15,00:27:17,"and then they push it along this extremely flat floor,"
00:27:17,00:27:19,and it just kind of glides along.
00:27:19,00:27:20,- Ooh.
00:27:20,00:27:21,"- It's really, really awesome."
00:27:21,00:27:23,"And the way that, and what it's for is to see"
00:27:23,00:27:25,what it's like in space.
00:27:25,00:27:27,"So, (laughing)"
00:27:27,00:27:29,"because it's like, there's no friction,"
00:27:29,00:27:30,so things just keep moving.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"And if you push them in one direction,"
00:27:31,00:27:32,they just keep moving.
00:27:32,00:27:33,And I think we might have said before
00:27:33,00:27:36,"that NASA around there also has the world's biggest door,"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"and they also have the world's most perfect balls,"
00:27:40,00:27:45,which is a pair of mathematically perfect spherical balls.
00:27:45,00:27:49,"If they are one point, they're really, really small."
00:27:49,00:27:51,They're just 3.81 centimeters across.
00:27:51,00:27:54,"And if you scale them up to the size of the earth,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,then the highest hill on there will be 1.5 meters high.
00:27:57,00:27:58,- Wow.
00:27:58,00:28:00,- That's how perfect these balls are.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"And is that because they're such perfect spheres in space,"
00:28:03,00:28:05,they're imitating the sun?
00:28:05,00:28:09,"- Or just, they're using them for possible, future,"
00:28:09,00:28:10,joy or scopic motors.
00:28:10,00:28:12,"- They don't know what they're for, do they?"
00:28:12,00:28:13,(laughing)
00:28:13,00:28:14,- Someone thought of the phrase
00:28:14,00:28:16,"the most perfect balls in the world,"
00:28:16,00:28:18,"and they thought, better make those."
00:28:18,00:28:19,(laughing)
00:28:19,00:28:23,"- You know the saying, beer before wine, you'll feel fine."
00:28:23,00:28:24,"- Oh, I thought it was."
00:28:24,00:28:26,- Wine before beer feeling queer.
00:28:26,00:28:28,- I always get mixed up.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"- Well, it turns out that neither of them works."
00:28:30,00:28:33,And this is thanks to scientists who got 90 students drunk
00:28:33,00:28:34,and found that none of them felt fine.
00:28:34,00:28:36,(laughing)
00:28:36,00:28:38,"- No matter what, he was struck off."
00:28:38,00:28:38,(laughing)
00:28:38,00:28:41,"- No matter what, he, combination."
00:28:41,00:28:44,"He got 90 volunteers, and they have."
00:28:44,00:28:45,- I bet he did.
00:28:45,00:28:46,(laughing)
00:28:46,00:28:48,- They're only 70 people in his class.
00:28:48,00:28:49,(laughing)
00:28:49,00:28:50,"- They all had two and a half points,"
00:28:50,00:28:51,"there was a first group,"
00:28:51,00:28:52,we had two and a half points of logger
00:28:52,00:28:54,and then four big glasses of white wine.
00:28:54,00:28:56,And then the second group had the same drinks in reverse.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"So you've got beer, then wine, and wine, then beer."
00:28:58,00:29:01,And then there was another group who had only beer or wine
00:29:01,00:29:03,up to the same level.
00:29:03,00:29:05,And they all felt terrible the next day.
00:29:05,00:29:06,One and tell of them through up.
00:29:06,00:29:07,And they--
00:29:07,00:29:08,- A bunch of lightweights.
00:29:08,00:29:09,(laughing)
00:29:09,00:29:10,- I knew you guys would say that.
00:29:10,00:29:12,(laughing)
00:29:12,00:29:14,"- Can I just say, while we're on trains,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"this is so outproposing, nothing."
00:29:16,00:29:20,"But when I was in Japan, I noticed that the train drivers,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,they always point and shout stuff at themselves
00:29:23,00:29:26,"while they're driving the train, wherever they go."
00:29:26,00:29:27,"So if you're near the front, you'll always see this"
00:29:27,00:29:29,'cause you can see the driver.
00:29:29,00:29:31,"And just every like three or four minutes,"
00:29:31,00:29:32,they'll just point at something
00:29:32,00:29:34,that doesn't appear to be anything at all.
00:29:34,00:29:36,"And they'll just yell something that I don't understand, right?"
00:29:36,00:29:38,- Another yelling to the passengers or to--
00:29:38,00:29:40,"- No, they're yelling to themselves."
00:29:40,00:29:42,And I read this today of what they were doing
00:29:42,00:29:43,'cause I looked it up.
00:29:43,00:29:46,They have a thing where every certain amount of time
00:29:46,00:29:50,they point at like just a thing around the tracks.
00:29:50,00:29:51,Doesn't matter what it is.
00:29:51,00:29:53,And they shout where they are and what they're doing.
00:29:53,00:29:55,And the reason they do it is so they can concentrate
00:29:55,00:29:58,"the whole way because if you're not doing that all the time,"
00:29:58,00:30:01,you're just kind of my daydream or something like that.
00:30:01,00:30:02,"But if every five minutes or so,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,you have to point and shout something.
00:30:04,00:30:06,You're never gonna kind of not think about that.
00:30:06,00:30:07,- That's wonderful.
00:30:07,00:30:08,"- Isn't that great? - That's great, yeah."
00:30:08,00:30:09,- I think it's stupid.
00:30:09,00:30:11,Does anyone have a read the story of Cry Wolf?
00:30:11,00:30:13,"What happens when there's actually, you know,"
00:30:13,00:30:15,a huge bomb in the middle of the track?
00:30:15,00:30:16,"And they're pointing and shouting,"
00:30:16,00:30:19,"there's a bomb, everyone get off the train,"
00:30:19,00:30:20,everyone get off the train.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"And everyone's like, oh, it's just the standard"
00:30:21,00:30:24,"five-minute-ly shouting fest, he does."
00:30:24,00:30:26,"Maybe he's shouting something, maybe he doesn't always shout"
00:30:26,00:30:28,bomb on the track.
00:30:28,00:30:29,(laughing)
00:30:29,00:30:32,"Maybe he's normally shouting, I am concentrating now."
00:30:32,00:30:33,"But what I was thinking is, if you're driving"
00:30:33,00:30:37,"on the motorway, then every time you go past a junction,"
00:30:37,00:30:41,if you were to point at it and shout the names of the places
00:30:41,00:30:43,"that junction goes to, then it would help you concentrate"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"and you get less sleep at the wheel, I think,"
00:30:45,00:30:46,is a really good tip.
00:30:46,00:30:47,"- Okay, okay."
00:30:47,00:30:50,"- Also, your geography of the UK would probably improve."
00:30:50,00:30:52,He's keep noticing all these irrelevant places.
00:30:52,00:30:53,"- Yeah, that's true."
00:30:53,00:30:55,- Have you guys had a hook swinging?
00:30:55,00:30:56,- No. - No.
00:30:56,00:30:59,"- This is another Indian ritual practiced in the 1890s,"
00:30:59,00:31:01,"not very much in the 20th century,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,"but basically, in order to make it rain, if there's a drought,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,farmers would find a willing volunteer
00:31:06,00:31:09,and then they would sew large hooks into his back
00:31:09,00:31:11,and they would lift him 50 feet into the air.
00:31:11,00:31:12,- Sorry. - What?
00:31:12,00:31:15,- You would be lifted up into the air on massive hooks.
00:31:15,00:31:16,"It's very, very, very painful."
00:31:16,00:31:18,- To make it rain. - To make it rain.
00:31:18,00:31:20,"And it causes you lasting damage, obviously."
00:31:20,00:31:21,It's extremely painful.
00:31:21,00:31:24,"However, you were allowed to keep the hooks afterwards."
00:31:24,00:31:25,- By us.
00:31:25,00:31:26,- But only for three months.
00:31:26,00:31:27,- What?
00:31:27,00:31:31,- You were allowed-- - Why would you keep them?
00:31:31,00:31:33,"- Well, you were allowed to keep the hooks"
00:31:33,00:31:36,and the cord and the knife for three months afterwards
00:31:36,00:31:38,"and beg with them and show people, look,"
00:31:38,00:31:42,I went through this for the community
00:31:42,00:31:44,"to show your bravery, but only for three months."
00:31:44,00:31:46,"- So when you said you had to find a willing volunteer,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,that actually does feel like the hardest part of it.
00:31:49,00:31:49,- Where were they?
00:31:49,00:31:52,Where were they finding these enthusiastic people?
00:31:52,00:31:53,- It's a good point.
00:31:53,00:31:56,"Also, I would probably just trust that that was the guy"
00:31:56,00:31:57,"who was held 50 feet in the air with hooks,"
00:31:57,00:31:59,even if he didn't have the amount of his back.
00:31:59,00:32:01,I imagine he's a local celebrity.
00:32:01,00:32:03,"I imagine no one's like, oh, did that happen?"
00:32:03,00:32:05,"Oh, okay, and I didn't read about that."
00:32:05,00:32:11,"- Actually, a lot of people thought that chess wasn't,"
00:32:11,00:32:13,"well, a lot of people who thought that chess wasn't"
00:32:13,00:32:15,"a particularly intellectual game,"
00:32:15,00:32:18,"compared to something like West, for instance."
00:32:18,00:32:20,And that was because the argument was
00:32:20,00:32:23,that chess has a finite number of moves.
00:32:23,00:32:25,There's only a certain number of moves you can make.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"It's quite a high number, but it's finite."
00:32:27,00:32:29,"And in West, you're playing with your wits"
00:32:29,00:32:30,and stuff like that.
00:32:30,00:32:32,"And it was kind of like, if you're doing something"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"which is really regimented,"
00:32:35,00:32:38,maybe that doesn't help the creative part of your brain.
00:32:38,00:32:39,That's what they used to say.
00:32:39,00:32:41,"Like, for instance, there was an argument"
00:32:41,00:32:44,in Scientific American in 1859
00:32:44,00:32:46,"that Napoleon the Great loved playing chess,"
00:32:46,00:32:50,but he was often beaten by a rough grocer in St. Helena.
00:32:50,00:32:52,- What went rough in what way?
00:32:52,00:32:54,- They didn't specify.
00:32:54,00:32:56,(laughing)
00:32:56,00:32:57,- It wasn't an asterisk.
00:32:57,00:32:58,- It didn't shave much.
00:32:58,00:32:59,"- Right, okay."
00:32:59,00:33:01,- I don't really know what rough meant in those days.
00:33:01,00:33:04,"It says, now the Shakespeare Milton Newton"
00:33:04,00:33:05,"or any of the great ones of Earth,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"acquired proficiency in chess playing,"
00:33:07,00:33:11,it seems to help people with an intuitive faculty
00:33:11,00:33:13,for making the right moves.
00:33:13,00:33:14,"But at the same time,"
00:33:14,00:33:17,these people have often possess very ordinary faculties
00:33:17,00:33:18,for other purposes.
00:33:18,00:33:21,So they thought it was only a very specific kind of person
00:33:21,00:33:23,who'd be good at chess and...
00:33:23,00:33:24,- They wouldn't necessarily be good at other stuff.
00:33:24,00:33:26,- Whereas Whist players.
00:33:26,00:33:27,"- Oh, yeah."
00:33:27,00:33:29,- All of those people you mentioned were keen Whist times.
00:33:29,00:33:30,(laughing)
00:33:30,00:33:31,"- I mean, if that's what they thought of chess,"
00:33:31,00:33:33,imagine their response to angry birds.
00:33:33,00:33:34,(laughing)
00:33:34,00:33:36,"- Well, you do know pop culture."
00:33:36,00:33:37,(laughing)
00:33:37,00:33:39,"- No, pop culture."
00:33:39,00:33:39,I've read about it.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"- There was another old rule that used to be in place,"
00:33:42,00:33:44,which is that you could use a baseball bat
00:33:44,00:33:48,which had a flat side to it like a cricket bat.
00:33:48,00:33:49,"- Oh, yeah."
00:33:49,00:33:52,"- It was just to help with accuracy, I think."
00:33:52,00:33:54,"But yeah, that was kicked out."
00:33:54,00:33:57,So that was between 1885 and 1893.
00:33:57,00:33:58,"- I think that was for power, wasn't it?"
00:33:58,00:33:59,- Wasn't it?
00:33:59,00:34:01,- Like you can get a bigger hit on it
00:34:01,00:34:03,if you've got that big flat surface area
00:34:03,00:34:06,"and they ditched it straight away, I can't remember why."
00:34:06,00:34:06,"- Yeah, I can't."
00:34:06,00:34:08,- Maybe it just made the game too easy.
00:34:08,00:34:09,- I think it was that.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"- 'Cause in cricket, for instance,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,full toss is a very easy ball to hit.
00:34:12,00:34:13,- Yeah.
00:34:13,00:34:15,- Yeah.
00:34:15,00:34:19,- Why then in cricket do they have the other side of the bat
00:34:19,00:34:21,in a triangle formation?
00:34:21,00:34:23,"- Well, good question."
00:34:23,00:34:25,"And I don't know the answer, but I would guess"
00:34:25,00:34:27,that it's so that your sweet spot
00:34:27,00:34:29,is a thicker part of the bat.
00:34:29,00:34:32,So you want your edge to be very small
00:34:32,00:34:33,because you don't want to edge the ball
00:34:33,00:34:36,"so they can catch it, but you do need it to be thick"
00:34:36,00:34:37,"so that if it hits it right in the middle,"
00:34:37,00:34:38,it goes miles.
00:34:38,00:34:40,So you want it to be thick in the middle
00:34:40,00:34:41,and thin on the outside.
00:34:41,00:34:42,"I don't know, for sure."
00:34:42,00:34:44,- I think it's because if you flip around the bat
00:34:44,00:34:46,"the last minute, then you get a mental angle"
00:34:46,00:34:50,"on your bat, and that's exactly what they used to use,"
00:34:50,00:34:52,"but they've never used it, so that's right."
00:34:52,00:34:54,- I don't know why they don't use it anymore.
00:34:54,00:34:56,"- Just this is just a brand in fact,"
00:34:56,00:34:56,"nothing to do what we're saying,"
00:34:56,00:34:58,but just hedges.
00:34:58,00:34:59,We were doing a live gig the other day
00:34:59,00:35:01,and someone told us in the audience
00:35:01,00:35:03,"that if you go to Liverpool,"
00:35:03,00:35:05,there's a hedge of all the Beatles there
00:35:05,00:35:07,"sitting outside the station,"
00:35:07,00:35:09,but Ringo is really hated there.
00:35:09,00:35:11,"So people keep trimming his head off,"
00:35:11,00:35:14,and they have to weigh ages for Ringo's head to regrow
00:35:14,00:35:18,and that's someone immediately choss up again.
00:35:18,00:35:19,- So sad.
00:35:19,00:35:22,"- On mud, so there's the disorder"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"where you eat soil or dirt, it's called peaker, I think,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,"where some people eat mud,"
00:35:26,00:35:29,"but in southern parts of the US,"
00:35:29,00:35:31,eating mud is a traditional thing
00:35:31,00:35:32,"that some people really enjoy,"
00:35:32,00:35:34,"and I didn't know this still happened,"
00:35:34,00:35:36,"but it does, so it's in southern states"
00:35:36,00:35:37,"like kind of Mississippi and Georgia,"
00:35:37,00:35:39,"real deep south-state,"
00:35:39,00:35:41,"and people eat kind of clay,"
00:35:41,00:35:43,and it's a very specific thing called like white mud
00:35:43,00:35:46,"or white clay in its clay-rich dirt,"
00:35:46,00:35:47,"and they love it,"
00:35:47,00:35:49,"and it's part of the diet,"
00:35:49,00:35:50,"it's often poorer families,"
00:35:50,00:35:53,"it's black and white families,"
00:35:53,00:35:55,"and there are various theories about where it came from,"
00:35:55,00:35:56,but I was reading an article in the New York Times
00:35:56,00:35:58,"from 1984 saying this is so tragic,"
00:35:58,00:36:01,the tradition of mud eating will disappear
00:36:01,00:36:02,"in the next generation,"
00:36:02,00:36:04,"and then an article from a couple of years ago,"
00:36:04,00:36:06,"it hasn't disappeared, guys."
00:36:06,00:36:08,It's still there.
00:36:08,00:36:10,- It's because it's like higher minerals and stuff.
00:36:10,00:36:11,- We don't really know.
00:36:11,00:36:14,"I think it's, maybe it's just a traditional thing,"
00:36:14,00:36:15,but they like the taste.
00:36:15,00:36:16,- Are there recipes?
00:36:16,00:36:18,- There are some recipes.
00:36:18,00:36:19,"Well, sort of recipes,"
00:36:19,00:36:21,"if you count the fact that, for instance,"
00:36:21,00:36:23,people who like it will keep it in jars
00:36:23,00:36:24,and sprinkle it with salt and vinegar.
00:36:24,00:36:25,- That's a recipe.
00:36:25,00:36:26,"- Okay, yeah."
00:36:26,00:36:27,- That's a recipe.
00:36:27,00:36:28,"- Well, I thought you said they like the taste of it,"
00:36:28,00:36:30,why are they putting salt and vinegar on it?
00:36:30,00:36:32,"- James, I like the taste of chips,"
00:36:32,00:36:34,but that doesn't mean I don't enhance it.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- You're so right.
00:36:35,00:36:36,(all laughing)
00:36:36,00:36:41,"Sometimes they substitute it for baking soda or for starch,"
00:36:41,00:36:44,"because they can't get to the right kind of soil,"
00:36:44,00:36:45,"the right kind of mud,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,but apparently it's not quite the same.
00:36:47,00:36:49,"And there was an interview with someone called Mrs. Glass,"
00:36:49,00:36:52,"who said she's been off the dirt for a full year,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,"even though she still gets really strong cravings,"
00:36:55,00:36:56,but she's been off the dirt
00:36:56,00:36:58,'cause her husband said it makes her mouth taste like mud.
00:36:58,00:37:00,(all laughing)
00:37:00,00:37:01,Which does make sense.
00:37:01,00:37:03,- It is one of those pregnancy cravings
00:37:03,00:37:04,that you hear about.
00:37:04,00:37:05,"- It is, yeah, yeah."
00:37:05,00:37:06,My mum had that.
00:37:06,00:37:07,- Could she?
00:37:07,00:37:08,"- Yeah, mud and coal, I think, yeah."
00:37:08,00:37:10,- She didn't eat coal.
00:37:10,00:37:11,"People, women do."
00:37:11,00:37:12,- But she just had the craving.
00:37:12,00:37:15,- But it was usually would be charcoal.
00:37:15,00:37:16,"Like husband, you'd get bits of charcoal"
00:37:16,00:37:17,and you could chew on it.
00:37:17,00:37:20,"- Ah, but not a large lump of coal."
00:37:20,00:37:22,"- No, you wouldn't go down to mine."
00:37:22,00:37:23,(all laughing)
00:37:23,00:37:25,"- No, my daughter got home from work every day"
00:37:25,00:37:29,and she was a black face full of the coal basket.
00:37:29,00:37:29,- That would be so good.
00:37:29,00:37:32,"- Hopefully, if you're having cravings for, you know,"
00:37:32,00:37:35,"gurgons, you don't eat a billion, the gurgons."
00:37:35,00:37:37,You just need a small amount to get your cravings started.
00:37:37,00:37:38,"- Yeah, it's true."
00:37:38,00:37:41,It's just this funny idea of like replacing miners
00:37:41,00:37:43,"with pregnant women who, they know where the coal is"
00:37:43,00:37:45,'cause they have the desperate cravings
00:37:45,00:37:47,and they're just chewing through the rock face.
00:37:47,00:37:48,- Yeah.
00:37:48,00:37:49,"- Yeah, and none comes back up."
00:37:49,00:37:51,(all laughing)
00:37:51,00:37:52,- Just on big shoes.
00:37:52,00:37:53,- Yeah.
00:37:53,00:37:54,- On shoes.
00:37:54,00:37:57,Used to be a big thing and they're called crack-offs.
00:37:57,00:38:00,So crack-offs were shoes that were really popular
00:38:00,00:38:03,"from about the 13th century to the 15th, 16th centuries"
00:38:03,00:38:06,and they're called that after the assume place
00:38:06,00:38:07,of origin crack-off in Poland.
00:38:07,00:38:09,"And they were also called Poulin,"
00:38:09,00:38:11,"which is Polish shoes, Polishings."
00:38:11,00:38:13,"And they, so it was just fashionable"
00:38:13,00:38:15,to have these incredibly long shoes
00:38:15,00:38:18,"and they were gone for sort of eight, nine inches."
00:38:18,00:38:20,And then eventually there were various edicts passed
00:38:20,00:38:23,that said you had to limit your toe length to two inches.
00:38:23,00:38:25,It was still quite long.
00:38:25,00:38:27,"And it was partly because it was seen as showy,"
00:38:27,00:38:29,like we've talked about the summary laws before
00:38:29,00:38:33,"and partly because it was quite difficult to pray, apparently,"
00:38:33,00:38:34,'cause it's quite hard to kneel down
00:38:34,00:38:37,when you've got a 10-inch toe poking out.
00:38:37,00:38:40,- But you can always see if somebody's in a toilet stall.
00:38:40,00:38:40,- It's nice.
00:38:40,00:38:41,- Yeah.
00:38:41,00:38:44,"- You can usually tell that just from the engaged side,"
00:38:44,00:38:47,but it's poking your head under that little gap
00:38:47,00:38:48,between the guys.
00:38:48,00:38:49,- Sorry.
00:38:49,00:38:50,"- Also, you know, you might be using to wipe as well"
00:38:50,00:38:51,if you do.
00:38:51,00:38:52,(all laughing)
00:38:52,00:38:54,"- Oh, you've got to be flexible for that, too."
00:38:54,00:38:55,(all laughing)
00:38:55,00:38:56,- Long enough.
00:38:56,00:38:58,(all laughing)
00:38:58,00:39:00,"You know, they're using bacteria to solve crimes now."
00:39:00,00:39:02,(all laughing)
00:39:02,00:39:03,- That's a cup show I want to see.
00:39:03,00:39:04,(all laughing)
00:39:04,00:39:06,"- No, they are using it to solve crimes"
00:39:06,00:39:08,"because we all have this fingerprint,"
00:39:08,00:39:10,which is our huge cloud of bacteria
00:39:10,00:39:13,that we're walking around with and they're all individual.
00:39:13,00:39:17,"And so, police have started thinking maybe we can take"
00:39:17,00:39:19,the bacteria that's left in a room that's been burgled
00:39:19,00:39:22,and then match it to a database of other people's bacteria.
00:39:22,00:39:24,"And if there's a match, they did the robbery."
00:39:24,00:39:27,"But it's quite cool, 'cause it's a very good plan."
00:39:27,00:39:29,And they've experimented with it by staging
00:39:29,00:39:32,"a load of mock burglaries, which just sounded like"
00:39:32,00:39:34,the funnest science experiment to be part of.
00:39:34,00:39:36,"So there were 400 study participants,"
00:39:36,00:39:39,"some home owners, and some who had to pretend"
00:39:39,00:39:40,to burgle their homes.
00:39:40,00:39:42,And they had to properly act it out.
00:39:42,00:39:45,So they did stuff like they rifled through all their drawers
00:39:45,00:39:47,and they carried away their TV.
00:39:47,00:39:49,They all had to open the fridge
00:39:49,00:39:51,"and kind of have a sip of the Coke and the fridge,"
00:39:51,00:39:52,"'cause that's something that burglar's doing apparently,"
00:39:52,00:39:53,sometimes.
00:39:53,00:39:54,- A sip of the Coke and the fridge.
00:39:54,00:39:56,"- Yeah, burglar's always do that, you know?"
00:39:56,00:39:58,- It's a signature move.
00:39:58,00:40:00,- The one thing the burglar's do do a lot
00:40:00,00:40:01,"is poo in houses, don't they?"
00:40:01,00:40:02,Sorry to bring it back to poo.
00:40:02,00:40:04,- I think they might have asked them to do that as well.
00:40:04,00:40:07,"Maybe it didn't make it into the study right up, but."
00:40:07,00:40:09,"- Apparently that does happen because you're so stressed,"
00:40:09,00:40:11,your body just wants to defecate.
00:40:11,00:40:13,"- If someone's left a poo in a house,"
00:40:13,00:40:15,you probably don't need to swab for the microbiology.
00:40:15,00:40:17,(laughing)
00:40:17,00:40:18,- But so do all of them.
00:40:18,00:40:21,- We're looking for a corn cob who can make a dick robbery.
00:40:21,00:40:23,(laughing)
00:40:25,00:40:27,- I've done what you've done.
00:40:27,00:40:28,"You can ask your question anyway, though."
00:40:28,00:40:29,"- Well, it's just going out so,"
00:40:29,00:40:30,"if the four of us are in this room,"
00:40:30,00:40:33,"we all have our bacteria, what did you call it,"
00:40:33,00:40:37,"the cloud, the biome, will all be so different,"
00:40:37,00:40:39,so noticeably different?
00:40:39,00:40:41,"- Well, the thing is, the more you hang out with people,"
00:40:41,00:40:43,"the more your biome is similar to theirs,"
00:40:43,00:40:45,'cause you end up sharing bacteria.
00:40:45,00:40:46,"- Yeah, and the same thing."
00:40:46,00:40:48,"- There is a thing, yeah, we're basically"
00:40:48,00:40:50,"all the same microbiome, no, probably."
00:40:50,00:40:51,"Well, I'm not really the same."
00:40:51,00:40:53,- But they are still really individual.
00:40:53,00:40:54,"- Yeah, yeah, okay."
00:40:54,00:40:55,"- So people develop really differently,"
00:40:55,00:40:57,and develop it in the first three or four years
00:40:57,00:40:59,"of your life, I think, specifically the stuff"
00:40:59,00:41:00,that you're at the bacteria you're going to want.
00:41:00,00:41:03,"- But the other thing is, you can get a hotel room,"
00:41:03,00:41:05,"and I think it's within something like two or three hours,"
00:41:05,00:41:07,that room will be indistinguishable
00:41:07,00:41:10,"from your actual house, from the microbes in there."
00:41:10,00:41:11,"- Oh, okay, yeah."
00:41:11,00:41:13,"- And also, 'cause I always take all my furniture"
00:41:13,00:41:14,to the hotel rooms.
00:41:14,00:41:16,(laughing)
00:41:16,00:41:17,- I always do a poo with a corn.
00:41:17,00:41:19,(laughing)
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- Just make it feel like home, isn't it?"
00:41:21,00:41:22,"- Oh, good."
00:41:22,00:41:24,"- That's crazy, though, using that for crime."
00:41:24,00:41:24,- That is crazy.
00:41:24,00:41:27,"- That would be really weird if you could see,"
00:41:27,00:41:28,"if you spent all your time, for example,"
00:41:28,00:41:30,"with a dancing partner, like on Strictly,"
00:41:30,00:41:33,if your microbiome came closer to your dancing partners
00:41:33,00:41:35,than it was to your real life partner at home.
00:41:35,00:41:38,- I'd like to see that headline in the daily express.
00:41:38,00:41:39,(laughing)
00:41:39,00:41:41,- Sean Walsh is microbiome.
00:41:41,00:41:43,(laughing)
00:41:43,00:41:45,(upbeat music)
00:41:45,00:41:47,- We're gonna have to move on to our next fact in a second.
00:41:47,00:41:51,"I got one last thing that I like, which is in 1956,"
00:41:51,00:41:53,there was an English composer who was quite well known
00:41:53,00:41:55,"at the time, called Malcolm Arnold,"
00:41:55,00:42:00,and he actually wrote a overture for vacuums.
00:42:00,00:42:02,"So, when you saw it, it was vacuums on stage,"
00:42:02,00:42:05,"it was three vacuums, it was one floor polisher,"
00:42:05,00:42:08,"four rifles, bizarrely, and then an actual orchestra,"
00:42:08,00:42:12,"and it was a piece that he put on called a grand-grand,"
00:42:12,00:42:16,and it was dedicated to U.S. president Herbert Hoover.
00:42:16,00:42:19,So that was quite a nice thing.
00:42:19,00:42:20,- Very good.
00:42:20,00:42:23,(audience applauding)
00:42:23,00:42:25,"- Just on the losers, is you were just saying"
00:42:25,00:42:28,Anna in the campaign.
00:42:28,00:42:31,"- Okay, Dan, you know, let's do this backstage, all right?"
00:42:31,00:42:32,(laughing)
00:42:32,00:42:34,- Just some other rain-making ceremonies.
00:42:34,00:42:34,"- Oh, yeah."
00:42:34,00:42:37,"- Because they've always existed in hot countries,"
00:42:37,00:42:38,"I guess, 'cause people need rain,"
00:42:38,00:42:42,and they are quite a big thing in various parts of Africa.
00:42:42,00:42:46,"So in South Africa, the Lovedu people have a rain queen,"
00:42:46,00:42:48,and the rain queen is basically their ruler.
00:42:48,00:42:50,They always have had traditionally.
00:42:50,00:42:51,- Long may she rain?
00:42:51,00:42:54,"- Long may she rain, indeed."
00:42:54,00:42:56,"And she, that sort of implies that she's urinating"
00:42:56,00:42:59,"on her people as a replacement for rain,"
00:42:59,00:42:59,which she doesn't do.
00:42:59,00:43:02,"- That's spile by little pod, sorry."
00:43:02,00:43:04,You've got disgusting images.
00:43:04,00:43:08,"So this is this woman who isn't allowed to marry herself,"
00:43:08,00:43:11,"but she can have female wives, inverted commons."
00:43:11,00:43:15,"And so she also has to bear at least one child,"
00:43:15,00:43:18,"at least one daughter, because you inherit it from your mother."
00:43:18,00:43:20,"So she has to bear one daughter by a royal relative,"
00:43:20,00:43:24,"interesting rule, and then age 60, when she hits 60,"
00:43:24,00:43:26,"it's assumed that her powers of making the rain come,"
00:43:26,00:43:28,or sometimes stopping the rain.
00:43:28,00:43:30,"Her powers are perceived to have waned,"
00:43:30,00:43:32,and she's expected to commit suicide by poison.
00:43:32,00:43:33,- Oh.
00:43:33,00:43:35,- And so she has to do this.
00:43:35,00:43:39,"And those is really controversial scandal in 1959,"
00:43:39,00:43:44,when the raining rain queen refused to bloody commit suicide.
00:43:44,00:43:46,"She was 80, and people kept going,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,"'Come on, you've lost your power, and I'll do the thing.'"
00:43:48,00:43:51,"So your daughter can take over, and she understandably was like,"
00:43:51,00:43:52,'I don't want to.'
00:43:52,00:43:55,"And so this sort of ruined the tradition for a while,"
00:43:55,00:43:56,but it's being brought back.
00:43:56,00:43:58,"So the next rain queen, when she comes of age,"
00:43:58,00:44:00,"when she turns 18 in a couple of years,"
00:44:00,00:44:02,is coming back into the form.
00:44:02,00:44:05,- Have they fixed the succession procedure?
00:44:05,00:44:07,- I think they might have tinkered with it a little bit
00:44:07,00:44:08,about the edges.
00:44:08,00:44:09,(all laughing)
00:44:09,00:44:12,"- Yeah, it's more optional these days."
00:44:12,00:44:16,- Rain dance is quite big in North America as well.
00:44:16,00:44:20,"Historically, they're probably the ones we know of most,"
00:44:20,00:44:21,or we hear of most.
00:44:21,00:44:26,The hoppy snake in Antelope's ceremony is quite a common one.
00:44:26,00:44:29,"And people wrote about this a whole lot,"
00:44:29,00:44:32,"because it was performed in August,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,"it was to ensure abundant rainfall,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,but it used live snakes.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"And they did loads of different ceremonies,"
00:44:38,00:44:40,"all the time for loads of different things,"
00:44:40,00:44:42,but this was the only one that used live snakes.
00:44:42,00:44:44,"And so this was the one that became really famous,"
00:44:44,00:44:46,and that's why the North American rain dance
00:44:46,00:44:48,became one of the more famous kind of ceremonies
00:44:48,00:44:51,"that they all had, and it's because it had snakes in it,"
00:44:51,00:44:52,and these snakes are exciting.
00:44:52,00:44:53,"- Yeah, that's very cool."
00:44:53,00:44:55,- Do we know what they did?
00:44:55,00:44:58,- And you would dance around in a circle.
00:44:58,00:45:01,"Me saying that makes it sad,"
00:45:01,00:45:04,like I'm just doing a throw away comment of what you did.
00:45:04,00:45:06,"It was very important, but yeah, basically,"
00:45:06,00:45:08,it was danced around in a circle with live snakes.
00:45:08,00:45:10,- Was the snake in the middle of the circle?
00:45:10,00:45:11,Or were you holding a snake?
00:45:11,00:45:12,- I think you were handling the snake.
00:45:12,00:45:15,"If I could tell, no, you were handling the snake, yeah."
00:45:15,00:45:16,"- Otherwise, the snake might leave the circle,"
00:45:16,00:45:17,get a bit bored.
00:45:17,00:45:19,Probably doesn't believe in this city.
00:45:19,00:45:22,It might have been ahead of us scientifically.
00:45:22,00:45:24,(laughing)
00:45:24,00:45:29,"- There was a Cypriot rain ritual in ancient times,"
00:45:29,00:45:30,"where you had to do a rain dance,"
00:45:30,00:45:32,"and then after the dance, you had to spit"
00:45:32,00:45:33,on the back of a turtle.
00:45:33,00:45:34,- Okay.
00:45:34,00:45:36,"- And the book I was reading, it said that henceforth,"
00:45:36,00:45:38,it became popular as a spit turtle.
00:45:38,00:45:39,(laughing)
00:45:39,00:45:41,- That's such a rubbish joke.
00:45:41,00:45:42,- That's awful.
00:45:42,00:45:45,"That's like at school, if someone spits on you once,"
00:45:45,00:45:46,you get known as spits having the answer.
00:45:46,00:45:47,(laughing)
00:45:47,00:45:49,"- Was it allowed to keep the saliva on it,"
00:45:49,00:45:51,so I was three months away from there?
00:45:51,00:45:52,(laughing)
00:45:52,00:45:54,- It's a museum in Kansas.
00:45:54,00:45:56,"It's a very small museum, but it pays homage"
00:45:56,00:45:59,to all the losers of presidential campaigns.
00:45:59,00:46:02,"So it's got a picture of them, a bit of a biography."
00:46:02,00:46:06,"And it's run by this lady who, when I was reading the article,"
00:46:06,00:46:08,she was very excited about the last election
00:46:08,00:46:12,"that you guys had, because she really wanted Hillary Clinton"
00:46:12,00:46:15,"to lose, and I don't know if it's because she didn't"
00:46:15,00:46:16,want her as president.
00:46:16,00:46:19,It was more that she was excited to have the first woman
00:46:19,00:46:21,ever in her museum of losers.
00:46:21,00:46:22,(laughing)
00:46:22,00:46:23,I should really be proud of that.
00:46:23,00:46:27,"Finally, your woman will be in the losing museum."
00:46:27,00:46:28,(laughing)
00:46:28,00:46:30,We have to find the silver linings where we can.
00:46:30,00:46:32,(laughing)
00:46:32,00:46:35,- Do you know how you can weigh a whale?
00:46:35,00:46:37,"- No, oh well, I don't always take it."
00:46:37,00:46:39,(laughing)
00:46:39,00:46:39,"- Well, no."
00:46:39,00:46:40,(laughing)
00:46:40,00:46:42,"So it used to be that to weigh a whale,"
00:46:42,00:46:45,you would have to get one that's been beached
00:46:45,00:46:46,"or one that's dead, something like that,"
00:46:46,00:46:49,"but it's really hard to weigh them in the wild,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,but they've got this new system of drones.
00:46:51,00:46:52,- Wow.
00:46:52,00:46:54,- Which you're able to estimate the weight of whales
00:46:54,00:46:55,from the sky.
00:46:55,00:46:56,- Cool.
00:46:56,00:46:58,- So they no longer have to shove a set of weighing scales
00:46:58,00:46:59,underneath the beach whale.
00:46:59,00:47:03,"- Well, mostly it's just that joke doesn't work anymore."
00:47:03,00:47:04,(laughing)
00:47:04,00:47:07,- Another joke ruined by the scientists of the world.
00:47:07,00:47:08,- You busted.
00:47:08,00:47:11,"- I actually also have a French,"
00:47:11,00:47:12,"this is very tangential though,"
00:47:12,00:47:14,"but it is a French and fast food fact,"
00:47:14,00:47:18,"which is about in 2016, there was a McDonald's in France,"
00:47:18,00:47:20,"which was subject to an armed robbery,"
00:47:20,00:47:23,and two guys burst in with guns.
00:47:23,00:47:24,"They were armed, it was obviously very terrifying"
00:47:24,00:47:26,for all the customers and they wanted all the money
00:47:26,00:47:29,"in the till, which is about 1500 quay, I think."
00:47:29,00:47:31,"But unfortunately for the two robbers,"
00:47:31,00:47:33,also dining in the restaurant were 11 off duty members
00:47:33,00:47:35,of the French SAS.
00:47:35,00:47:35,(laughing)
00:47:35,00:47:36,- SAS.
00:47:36,00:47:38,"- Well, the French paramilitary special forces,"
00:47:38,00:47:40,"and they're really, really good."
00:47:40,00:47:41,"And they kept the cool, they didn't do anything"
00:47:41,00:47:44,"during the holdup, and then when one of the robbers"
00:47:44,00:47:45,"was leaving, he tripped a bit,"
00:47:45,00:47:47,"and immediately they bounced on him,"
00:47:47,00:47:49,and then they shot the other one in the abdomen.
00:47:49,00:47:50,- But still.
00:47:50,00:47:51,"- Oh, it's what?"
00:47:51,00:47:52,"- Well, they took him to hospital."
00:47:52,00:47:54,I don't think he died.
00:47:54,00:47:56,"I mean, he was, but then sent to prison for armed robbery."
00:47:56,00:47:57,- Okay.
00:47:57,00:48:01,- So it's a funny story with one quite bad sounding injury
00:48:01,00:48:02,at part of it.
00:48:02,00:48:04,(laughing)
00:48:05,00:48:07,- Why did they wait for him to trip?
00:48:07,00:48:08,"- Well, if they didn't trip,"
00:48:08,00:48:11,they didn't immediately want to start firing their guns
00:48:11,00:48:13,"in the restaurant, because they thought,"
00:48:13,00:48:15,"well, they're customers here, and we want to, you know."
00:48:15,00:48:17,"- Yes, customers here enjoying their meals,"
00:48:17,00:48:19,enjoying to blank out the armed robbery.
00:48:19,00:48:20,(laughing)
00:48:20,00:48:22,I imagine that Ronald McDonald is stood there
00:48:22,00:48:23,"with his massive clown shoes,"
00:48:23,00:48:24,and he kind of trips that night.
00:48:24,00:48:26,(laughing)
00:48:26,00:48:27,- I don't know what would have happened
00:48:27,00:48:28,if the guy hadn't tripped.
00:48:28,00:48:29,I'm sure they would have thought of some other way
00:48:29,00:48:31,of resolving the situation.
00:48:31,00:48:32,"- I know, yeah, yeah."
00:48:32,00:48:34,I'm sure that's not the strategy
00:48:34,00:48:36,"of all of the French ass, I ask."
00:48:36,00:48:39,Do not make a move till one of them trips.
00:48:39,00:48:41,"- Do you guys know that chess pieces, the pawns,"
00:48:41,00:48:43,they used to have jobs?
00:48:43,00:48:44,- Each of them?
00:48:44,00:48:45,"- Well, did they work out?"
00:48:45,00:48:47,"- So in the middle ages, monks tried to represent them"
00:48:47,00:48:49,"as citizens, that was the idea."
00:48:49,00:48:54,"And so you had an agricultural worker, you had a farrier,"
00:48:54,00:48:56,"you had a weaver, the fourth was a businessman,"
00:48:56,00:48:59,"it was a doctor, an inkeeper, a policeman,"
00:48:59,00:49:00,and the last one was a gambler.
00:49:00,00:49:01,- Wow.
00:49:01,00:49:02,- A policeman.
00:49:02,00:49:03,"- Yeah, but policeman."
00:49:03,00:49:04,- So that's no longer used.
00:49:04,00:49:06,"- That would have made blindfold chess a lot harder,"
00:49:06,00:49:07,wouldn't it?
00:49:07,00:49:09,If you had to remember all every individual pawns.
00:49:09,00:49:10,- Farrier to E4.
00:49:10,00:49:11,- Yeah.
00:49:11,00:49:13,"- Also, you would think they would have"
00:49:13,00:49:14,pawnbroker and pawnstar.
00:49:14,00:49:16,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:49:16,00:49:18,- I was sure it had been invented in the middle ages.
00:49:18,00:49:19,"- What, pawnbrokery?"
00:49:19,00:49:20,"- pawnbrokery had been, I think."
00:49:20,00:49:25,"- Well, the queen didn't use to be a piece, either."
00:49:25,00:49:28,"So the queen wasn't a piece for about a 600 AD,"
00:49:28,00:49:30,"and then she was really rubbish for ages,"
00:49:30,00:49:32,"'cause, you know, queens were quite, sort of,"
00:49:32,00:49:34,"was quite inferior, you know, a male should be the leader."
00:49:34,00:49:36,And this only changed in the 15th century
00:49:36,00:49:38,"when the queen came along, who was actually decent,"
00:49:38,00:49:40,"and people started to say, ""Hey, queens can be powerful."""
00:49:40,00:49:42,"And this was queen Isabella of Castile,"
00:49:42,00:49:44,so it was Isabella and Ferdinand.
00:49:44,00:49:46,"And basically, their relationship mirrors"
00:49:46,00:49:48,"the one of the king and the queen on the board, where she-"
00:49:48,00:49:50,"- You could only walk one step in any direction,"
00:49:50,00:49:52,and she was legging at everyone.
00:49:52,00:49:53,(laughing)
00:49:53,00:49:55,- He was always running and hiding behind the book
00:49:55,00:49:57,of the baker and the candlestick maker or whatever.
00:49:57,00:49:59,"- Was it, but no, behind the Castile."
00:49:59,00:50:01,(gasping)
00:50:01,00:50:04,"- Castile, yeah. - Castile, yeah."
00:50:04,00:50:06,"- No, she, so when they got married,"
00:50:06,00:50:07,"she forced them into this really humiliating marriage,"
00:50:07,00:50:10,where she got much more authority than him.
00:50:10,00:50:12,"She used to ride out to command troops on her own,"
00:50:12,00:50:13,leaving him behind.
00:50:13,00:50:15,"She was made queen of a particular country or state,"
00:50:15,00:50:17,and she didn't even bother to tell him about it.
00:50:17,00:50:19,"But yeah, then they changed the queen and made it more powerful."
00:50:19,00:50:21,"And one argument to say this is why that happened,"
00:50:21,00:50:24,"is that in Russia, the queen remained impotent"
00:50:24,00:50:27,"until the 18th century, when Catherine the Great came in,"
00:50:27,00:50:28,and then she got a lot of power there.
00:50:28,00:50:29,- Oh.
00:50:29,00:50:31,"- Just, this is not to go out really,"
00:50:31,00:50:34,"but I just found out that I found a paper called,"
00:50:34,00:50:38,"Reservoir Dogs and the Implications for Disease Control,"
00:50:38,00:50:40,'cause obviously Reservoir is the animal
00:50:40,00:50:42,that the disease lives in.
00:50:42,00:50:44,"- Oh. - And this is from the early '80s,"
00:50:44,00:50:47,which is before Reservoir Dogs came out.
00:50:47,00:50:49,And no one knows where the name Reservoir Dogs came out.
00:50:49,00:50:50,- You're kidding.
00:50:50,00:50:52,"- Yeah, so my theory is that Tarantino was reading"
00:50:52,00:50:57,"a very obscure medical paper about rabies in Zimbabwe,"
00:50:58,00:50:59,and that's where he got the name from.
00:50:59,00:51:00,- Nobody knows where the film's name comes from.
00:51:00,00:51:04,"- No, when he was selling it, he claimed that it was a gangster term"
00:51:04,00:51:08,"for a rat, but actually that's not true."
00:51:08,00:51:10,And some people think he might have misheard
00:51:10,00:51:12,"the name of the title of the movie,"
00:51:12,00:51:15,"'Aruvoire Les Enfonds', which is a French movie."
00:51:15,00:51:16,"- Yeah, it is."
00:51:16,00:51:18,"It's not very similar to Reservoir Dogs, is it?"
00:51:18,00:51:19,- Oh.
00:51:19,00:51:20,- Yeah.
00:51:20,00:51:22,And also it doesn't sound very much like Reservoir Dogs.
00:51:22,00:51:23,- Nope.
00:51:23,00:51:24,- I believe you're theory.
00:51:24,00:51:27,(laughing)
00:51:27,00:51:30,"- I'd just one thing about someone who dealt with syphilis,"
00:51:30,00:51:32,"and this is in the early 18th century,"
00:51:32,00:51:34,"it was a guy called Daniel Turner,"
00:51:34,00:51:37,and he was the first person ever to use the term syphilis
00:51:37,00:51:38,to refer to the illness.
00:51:38,00:51:41,So it came from actually an epic poem
00:51:41,00:51:42,written about a hundred years earlier
00:51:42,00:51:45,about a guy who got it in short.
00:51:45,00:51:46,And so he--
00:51:46,00:51:48,"- He was called, the guy in the poem was called syphilis."
00:51:48,00:51:49,He was a shepherd.
00:51:49,00:51:50,"- Yes, exactly."
00:51:50,00:51:52,He was a poem about a shepherd called syphilis.
00:51:52,00:51:53,"And so then this doctor said,"
00:51:53,00:51:56,"""Okay, well, let's call this syphilis."""
00:51:56,00:51:58,"- He was just like a boy named Sue, but worse."
00:51:58,00:52:00,(laughing)
00:52:00,00:52:02,- Sue's poor sister.
00:52:02,00:52:06,And so he also wrote about the use of another new word
00:52:06,00:52:09,"that he'd coined, the condom."
00:52:09,00:52:12,"So it's about UM, but I think they're the same thing."
00:52:12,00:52:13,And he said that's the most effective thing
00:52:13,00:52:14,to prevent its transmission.
00:52:14,00:52:15,This was 1770.
00:52:15,00:52:16,- Wow.
00:52:16,00:52:19,- But I was reading the report he wrote on it.
00:52:19,00:52:21,"And he said the condom is the best,"
00:52:21,00:52:24,"if not the only, preservative that we have from syphilis."
00:52:24,00:52:26,"But by reason of its blunting sensation,"
00:52:26,00:52:29,I have heard people say they've chosen to risk the clap
00:52:29,00:52:33,"rather than engage, ""Kum has to sick cli-piatus."""
00:52:33,00:52:34,Which--
00:52:34,00:52:36,"- Well, the one person got that."
00:52:36,00:52:37,(laughing)
00:52:37,00:52:39,- And we're so sorry that you've got that.
00:52:39,00:52:41,(laughing)
00:52:41,00:52:44,- I actually really wanna know if you did get that.
00:52:44,00:52:46,- Did anyone get the Latin for that?
00:52:46,00:52:47,- No.
00:52:47,00:52:49,"- Well, I really enjoy the idea of putting really rude stuff"
00:52:49,00:52:52,in Latin to make it more appropriate.
00:52:52,00:52:54,"But it means with spears, thus sheathed."
00:52:54,00:52:58,- Would you have a sheath for a spear?
00:52:58,00:53:00,- To have a sheath for a sword?
00:53:00,00:53:01,- Sure.
00:53:01,00:53:02,- That's a really good point.
00:53:02,00:53:03,- That's a long sheath.
00:53:03,00:53:06,Or it's a tiny sheath just for the head of the spear.
00:53:06,00:53:07,(laughing)
00:53:07,00:53:11,But both of them feel impractical in the battle situation.
00:53:11,00:53:12,(laughing)
00:53:12,00:53:15,"I mean, just get my sheath out of there, there, there, there."
00:53:15,00:53:16,- He added the thought of it through.
00:53:16,00:53:18,You're completely right.
00:53:18,00:53:21,I was feeling so smug about the Latin translation.
00:53:22,00:53:25,Because I heard about James Harrison.
00:53:25,00:53:28,"James Harrison, he's an 81 year old, sorry,"
00:53:28,00:53:31,"this is four years ago now, but he, at the time,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,"he retired from being a donor, a blood donor,"
00:53:33,00:53:35,"81 years old, and he'd been donating blood"
00:53:35,00:53:37,"for every week, virtually every week,"
00:53:37,00:53:40,for 60 years of his life.
00:53:40,00:53:42,And he was known as the man with the golden arm.
00:53:42,00:53:45,"And in Australia, he had a very rare type of blood,"
00:53:45,00:53:48,which they reckoned there was only sort of like 50 people
00:53:48,00:53:49,or so that had it.
00:53:49,00:53:54,"And it was very important because mothers who were pregnant,"
00:53:54,00:53:56,they would have recess positive blood.
00:53:56,00:53:58,"But if the baby had recess negative blood,"
00:53:58,00:54:00,"which would be inherited from the father,"
00:54:00,00:54:01,that would go against the baby
00:54:01,00:54:03,and it would start killing the baby inside the womb.
00:54:03,00:54:08,So they used his blood specifically to save all these babies.
00:54:08,00:54:11,"And the Australian Red Cross believed that over the years,"
00:54:11,00:54:15,he saved the lives of 2.4 million Australian babies
00:54:15,00:54:18,from the 60 years of giving blood 17% of women
00:54:18,00:54:20,are at risk of this in Australia.
00:54:20,00:54:23,"And every single batch of anti-D, as it's called,"
00:54:23,00:54:25,is from this guy.
00:54:25,00:54:25,- Wow. - Yeah.
00:54:25,00:54:29,So he's an absolute hero and he's just retired.
00:54:29,00:54:32,"- Kind of mean to retire, to be honest."
00:54:32,00:54:34,(laughing)
00:54:34,00:54:35,"- Come on, mate."
00:54:35,00:54:37,"- Yeah, stick on it."
00:54:37,00:54:39,"- No, I've done a good long time saving children"
00:54:39,00:54:40,and now I'm gonna stop.
00:54:40,00:54:42,(laughing)
00:54:42,00:54:45,"- Wow, how easy that, right?"
00:54:45,00:54:47,- I was reading a tiny bit about dog research.
00:54:47,00:54:49,'Cause dogs have been researched on it
00:54:49,00:54:51,"in historic medicine for so long,"
00:54:51,00:54:52,'cause they were just a useful thing
00:54:52,00:54:54,"that was always around, quite tame."
00:54:54,00:54:56,And so you know Pavlov of dog fame.
00:54:56,00:54:57,- Yeah.
00:54:57,00:55:00,"- He had some breakthrough dog research,"
00:55:00,00:55:02,although his most of his breakthroughs weren't
00:55:02,00:55:04,what we now think of him as doing.
00:55:04,00:55:06,"So obviously we think of the Pavlovian dog responses,"
00:55:06,00:55:07,a behavioral thing.
00:55:07,00:55:10,"But really, he was interested in dog digestion."
00:55:10,00:55:11,I think it's that kind of thing
00:55:11,00:55:13,that he got his Nobel Prize for in 1904
00:55:13,00:55:15,and not the experiment that people know.
00:55:15,00:55:18,"But one of the things that he did was he looked at,"
00:55:18,00:55:20,it was really interesting in dogs livers
00:55:20,00:55:23,and how dogs when dogs generated saliva.
00:55:23,00:55:27,And he did this thing where he created fistulas
00:55:27,00:55:29,in the esophagus of dogs.
00:55:29,00:55:32,"And so a little hole with a tube attached,"
00:55:32,00:55:34,"which meant that when dogs ate,"
00:55:34,00:55:37,it would just come straight out again if it's neck
00:55:37,00:55:40,and not go into it stomach to find out what would happen
00:55:40,00:55:43,"if they weren't getting the, you know,"
00:55:43,00:55:45,if they weren't filling up their stomach as they ate.
00:55:45,00:55:47,"And so he had all these dogs with food just,"
00:55:47,00:55:48,how frustrating would that be?
00:55:48,00:55:49,Yeah.
00:55:49,00:55:52,Eat your food and it's full straight out of you.
00:55:52,00:55:53,"Just going, yeah."
00:55:53,00:55:55,"That's like a torture in,"
00:55:55,00:55:57,but you'd be given by the gods in the afterlife.
00:55:57,00:55:58,"It is, isn't it?"
00:55:58,00:55:59,Yeah.
00:55:59,00:56:00,Forever hungry.
00:56:00,00:56:00,Yeah.
00:56:00,00:56:01,Yeah.
00:56:01,00:56:04,"He also used to sell quite a lot of dogs' saliva, I think."
00:56:04,00:56:05,What for?
00:56:05,00:56:07,He made quite a lot of money out of it.
00:56:07,00:56:09,"Yeah, he had a dog gastric juice factory."
00:56:09,00:56:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:10,00:56:11,That's just a dog.
00:56:11,00:56:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:13,00:56:16,That does make him sound very evil.
00:56:16,00:56:17,I think he wasn't a nice guy anyway.
00:56:17,00:56:20,"A lot of people say, but this one, particularly,"
00:56:20,00:56:22,"he just had these dogs working to produce loads of saliva,"
00:56:22,00:56:24,"but he bottled up and said, oh, that's--"
00:56:24,00:56:25,What was the purpose of selling it?
00:56:25,00:56:28,The idea was that it helped out with things like dyspeptia
00:56:28,00:56:29,and stamenolins.
00:56:29,00:56:30,"Sorry, you would drink it."
00:56:30,00:56:31,"Yeah, yeah, you'd find dogs."
00:56:31,00:56:33,"Oh, the number really."
00:56:33,00:56:35,"Before you were saying that you would kiss a dog,"
00:56:35,00:56:37,"I know you're like, no, I said, the number really."
00:56:37,00:56:40,"Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, it's a word I'm not for the number."
00:56:40,00:56:43,[LAUGHTER]
00:56:43,00:56:48,"I just have a couple of things about saliva, right?"
00:56:48,00:56:51,"Humans, obviously, when the plague was around,"
00:56:51,00:56:54,"so the 1,400s and the 1,500s, that was a massive thing"
00:56:54,00:56:57,where kissing almost became taboo because they thought
00:56:57,00:57:00,"that that's what was spreading it, so they stopped."
00:57:00,00:57:04,But what I didn't realize was the alternatives to not kissing
00:57:04,00:57:07,to make sure you still had great sort of sexual contact
00:57:07,00:57:10,with your partner in the face.
00:57:10,00:57:17,"And alternatively, we're licking, sniffing,"
00:57:17,00:57:19,and nibbling of eyebrows.
00:57:19,00:57:20,"Sorry, wait a minute."
00:57:20,00:57:23,So you couldn't kiss because you didn't want to get any bacteria
00:57:23,00:57:25,"going over, but you could just lick someone's face."
00:57:25,00:57:27,I think you'd lick their forehead or their ear
00:57:27,00:57:31,or go for just general away from the mouth legs.
00:57:31,00:57:36,"But nibbling of eyebrows was a safe alternative, supposedly,"
00:57:36,00:57:38,at the time.
00:57:38,00:57:38,Wow.
00:57:38,00:57:40,So would you lick someone on the cheek if you didn't really
00:57:40,00:57:43,know them and lick them up the middle of the face
00:57:43,00:57:44,if they were your partner?
00:57:44,00:57:45,I don't think you're in France.
00:57:45,00:57:49,You'd have to lick them on both cheeks.
00:57:49,00:57:49,That's so true.
00:57:49,00:57:53,"Can I just tell you about a new story from 2012, which"
00:57:53,00:57:54,was quite good.
00:57:54,00:57:58,So this was about a leak in a statue of Jesus.
00:57:58,00:58:01,And it was in a Catholic church in Mumbai.
00:58:01,00:58:04,And the toe of Jesus started leaking.
00:58:04,00:58:08,And so a miracle was immediately declared.
00:58:08,00:58:10,"It was obviously holy water, because this toe was crying."
00:58:10,00:58:14,And so lots of people came and visited--
00:58:14,00:58:15,That's way more emo.
00:58:15,00:58:20,Lots of people came and visited this sobbing toe.
00:58:20,00:58:22,And the church promoted it as a site of pilgrimage.
00:58:22,00:58:24,And it was quite good for tourism
00:58:24,00:58:28,in this relatively backwater of Mumbai.
00:58:28,00:58:30,"And then this guy called Sanal Edamiruku,"
00:58:30,00:58:35,"who is a rationalist, a buzzkill someday,"
00:58:35,00:58:37,went to investigate.
00:58:37,00:58:39,And he found that it was moisture from an overflowing drain
00:58:39,00:58:42,that was being fed by a pipe issued from a nearby toilet.
00:58:42,00:58:45,And he was investigative of a blasphemy
00:58:45,00:58:47,"by various police stations, then has fled to Finland"
00:58:47,00:58:51,where he's been in exile for the last seven years.
00:58:51,00:58:52,Yeah.
00:58:52,00:58:57,"So when Jesus cries, don't say it's a toilet leaking."
00:58:57,00:58:58,"Come on, right."
00:58:58,00:58:59,"It's weird, though, isn't it?"
00:58:59,00:59:01,If you have water coming from your--
00:59:01,00:59:02,"if I had water coming from one of my toes,"
00:59:02,00:59:04,I would say it was probably sweat.
00:59:04,00:59:07,"Yes, not like holy water or tears, or anything like that."
00:59:07,00:59:10,"I mean, I've embellished with the tears."
00:59:10,00:59:11,It was holy water.
00:59:11,00:59:14,"It was holy toe water, yeah."
00:59:14,00:59:14,Holy water.
00:59:14,00:59:16,"Holy water, very good."
00:59:16,00:59:19,Can I just do one more quick thing about leaks?
00:59:19,00:59:22,"So here's a family thing, which isn't really--"
00:59:22,00:59:23,it's not a legal thing.
00:59:23,00:59:26,"But I read it the other day, and I think it's kind of cool."
00:59:26,00:59:29,"In medieval Scandinavia, they would have civil wars,"
00:59:29,00:59:32,and families would often put brothers
00:59:32,00:59:36,"on opposite sides of the battles, so to hedge their bets,"
00:59:36,00:59:39,so that one of them would survive the war.
00:59:39,00:59:40,Wow.
00:59:40,00:59:40,"That's cool, isn't it?"
00:59:40,00:59:41,It's quite clever.
00:59:41,00:59:42,It's dark.
00:59:42,00:59:44,"It's dark, but it makes sense."
00:59:44,00:59:45,It does.
00:59:45,00:59:47,"So you want to continue your genetic line,"
00:59:47,00:59:50,"and say, exactly, you want to make sure that someone--"
00:59:50,00:59:51,"oh, someone to look after you in old age,"
00:59:51,00:59:53,"or to look after the farmer, whatever,"
00:59:53,00:59:55,so you would put one brother on each side.
00:59:55,00:59:58,"But the thing is, with war, it's not like the winning side"
00:59:58,01:00:00,"in a war every single person survived,"
01:00:00,01:00:02,and the losing side everyone died.
01:00:02,01:00:04,You could very easily put them on either side
01:00:04,01:00:05,"and they're both killed, and then you"
01:00:05,01:00:06,look like an idiot and a twat.
01:00:06,01:00:07,What would happen?
01:00:07,01:00:09,But what would often happen afterwards
01:00:09,01:00:12,is the losing group would be punished.
01:00:12,01:00:13,"Yeah, OK."
01:00:13,01:00:15,"But if you put two on the same side,"
01:00:15,01:00:17,it gives that side a tiny extra advantage.
01:00:17,01:00:19,"It does, but then if the neighbors have got three kids,"
01:00:19,01:00:20,and they put them on the other side--
01:00:20,01:00:21,"Oh, yeah."
01:00:21,01:00:22,"It's always a problem, isn't it?"
01:00:22,01:00:24,The answer is not to have a war.
01:00:24,01:00:25,Or any kids?
01:00:25,01:00:26,Yeah.
01:00:26,01:00:31,"So there are enclave countries as well, aren't there,"
01:00:31,01:00:33,which are countries wholly inside other countries.
01:00:33,01:00:34,"Oh, yeah."
01:00:34,01:00:37,So Lesotho in South Africa--
01:00:37,01:00:40,"literally, inside Africa, actually, is one of them."
01:00:40,01:00:41,And one of them is San Marino.
01:00:41,01:00:44,It's a tiny country inside Italy.
01:00:44,01:00:46,So Italy has two smaller entities
01:00:46,01:00:48,"within it, the Vatican and San Marino."
01:00:48,01:00:52,And this is kind of off the beaten track a bit.
01:00:52,01:00:55,"But in 1999, San Marino was really worried about its male"
01:00:55,01:00:59,citizens being ensnared by sexy foreign women.
01:00:59,01:01:00,And it banned them.
01:01:00,01:01:01,Banned all women.
01:01:01,01:01:04,It legally legislated.
01:01:04,01:01:08,It banned any female domestic servants younger than 50.
01:01:08,01:01:09,So--
01:01:09,01:01:11,When was this used to you say?
01:01:11,01:01:12,1999.
01:01:12,01:01:13,Come on.
01:01:13,01:01:14,I'm serious.
01:01:14,01:01:15,Do you like joking?
01:01:15,01:01:15,"No, no."
01:01:15,01:01:18,Because there was this sort of panic in San Marino
01:01:18,01:01:23,about foreign women coming as carers and domestic servants
01:01:23,01:01:25,and marrying the elderly men they were looking after.
01:01:25,01:01:27,And maybe not with their best interest at heart.
01:01:27,01:01:29,Maybe there was some financial motive or something.
01:01:29,01:01:33,So it literally just banned any female domestic servants
01:01:33,01:01:34,under the age of 50.
01:01:34,01:01:36,"Assuming that if once you get to the age of 50,"
01:01:36,01:01:37,you're probably fine.
01:01:37,01:01:38,1999.
01:01:38,01:01:40,I know.
01:01:40,01:01:43,"I don't know if there's ever been repealed as well, actually."
01:01:43,01:01:44,"Well, anyone might have found out if there's anyone"
01:01:44,01:01:47,under the age of 50 who vans is a trip to San Marino.
01:01:47,01:01:48,And then prison.
01:01:48,01:01:49,Yeah.
01:01:49,01:01:54,I found someone who was the arch enemy of gravity.
01:01:54,01:01:57,So he was a man called Roger Babson.
01:01:57,01:02:00,And he was an American businessman.
01:02:00,01:02:01,He was a Newton fanatic.
01:02:01,01:02:04,He made a lot of his money using Newton's principles
01:02:04,01:02:06,in business for every action.
01:02:06,01:02:08,There's an equal and opposite reaction.
01:02:08,01:02:10,And he had a satellite.
01:02:10,01:02:13,He lost a couple of close relatives to drowning.
01:02:13,01:02:15,"And he, instead of blaming the water conditions,"
01:02:15,01:02:18,he decided gravity was the culprit.
01:02:18,01:02:20,Because it pulled them down.
01:02:20,01:02:24,So he described old man gravity as our enemy number one.
01:02:24,01:02:26,He wrote this essay.
01:02:26,01:02:28,"He said broken hips and other broken bones,"
01:02:28,01:02:31,as well as numerous circulatory intestinal
01:02:31,01:02:34,"and other internal troubles, are directly due to the people's"
01:02:34,01:02:38,inability to counteract gravity at a critical moment.
01:02:38,01:02:40,And he founded a gravity research foundation
01:02:40,01:02:43,"to basically destroy gravity, if he could."
01:02:43,01:02:45,And how is that going?
01:02:45,01:02:47,It's ongoing.
01:02:47,01:02:50,It's-- they now have slightly pivoted away from that.
01:02:50,01:02:53,And they just sort of research it.
01:02:53,01:02:54,I did read about that guy.
01:02:54,01:02:55,He's pretty amazing.
01:02:55,01:02:58,He believed that there was a metal alloy
01:02:58,01:03:01,which had anti-gravity properties.
01:03:01,01:03:02,"And if they would be able to find it,"
01:03:02,01:03:04,they'd be able to-- he said they'd
01:03:04,01:03:05,be able to co-terror planes in it
01:03:05,01:03:08,to make impossible for them to crash.
01:03:08,01:03:12,But he didn't say how they'd be able to land.
01:03:12,01:03:15,But he actually-- this institute that he put a load of money
01:03:15,01:03:18,and it was both him and Captain Bird's Eye.
01:03:18,01:03:21,"He put the money in-- I don't know if you have that in America,"
01:03:21,01:03:22,"actually, Captain Bird's Eye."
01:03:22,01:03:25,But he's like a frozen food guy.
01:03:25,01:03:26,But he was real.
01:03:26,01:03:27,And he made a load of money from--
01:03:27,01:03:29,Wait a second.
01:03:29,01:03:31,But that feels to me like the bigger headline.
01:03:31,01:03:32,It's the Captain Bird's Eye.
01:03:32,01:03:33,"Well, not here."
01:03:33,01:03:35,"But just so you guys know, anyone who's now listening"
01:03:35,01:03:38,"to this podcast back in England has just gone,"
01:03:38,01:03:40,what the fuck?
01:03:40,01:03:43,Do you guys not have Captain Bird's Eye?
01:03:43,01:03:45,"Guys, you don't know what you're missing."
01:03:45,01:03:46,"He's great, fun. He sells you fish fingers."
01:03:46,01:03:48,And he sort of powers around on boats with children.
01:03:48,01:03:49,They got Captain Crunch.
01:03:49,01:03:50,They got Captain Crunch.
01:03:50,01:03:53,Captain Crunch is different.
01:03:53,01:03:56,"So you can see, there's no qualification for this."
01:03:56,01:03:59,There is probably a secret club where Captain Crunch and Captain
01:03:59,01:04:00,Bird's Eye hang out together.
01:04:00,01:04:04,"Yeah, bitching about gravity."
01:04:04,01:04:05,So he was an anti-gravity?
01:04:05,01:04:06,"Yeah, he was."
01:04:06,01:04:08,"And when he first put the money into this,"
01:04:08,01:04:11,"him and Captain Bird's Eye, they"
01:04:11,01:04:14,"paid for three people to sit in the US Payton's office,"
01:04:14,01:04:18,just looking for any patents that were anti-gravity inventions.
01:04:18,01:04:20,"And then as soon as one came in, they would go and find"
01:04:20,01:04:21,"that person and go, have you found it?"
01:04:21,01:04:22,Have you found it?
01:04:22,01:04:25,And they never did.
01:04:25,01:04:28,"Oh, there's a grant that his company"
01:04:28,01:04:29,give to lots of universities.
01:04:29,01:04:31,And one of the rules of receiving the grant
01:04:31,01:04:34,is that they have to get this monument where he has words
01:04:34,01:04:35,about his personal.
01:04:35,01:04:37,But it's quite coded.
01:04:37,01:04:39,"But it sort of says, I don't think gravity is a thing."
01:04:39,01:04:41,Or conquer it.
01:04:41,01:04:44,So they have that sort of planted at these universities.
01:04:44,01:04:46,"But a few of the universities from what I've read,"
01:04:46,01:04:47,the students like to push it over.
01:04:47,01:04:52,I tried to find a site called--
01:04:52,01:04:54,"I tried to find if there was a YouTuber,"
01:04:54,01:04:57,like with an A at the end of their website for Tuber People.
01:04:57,01:04:57,"Oh, yeah."
01:04:57,01:04:59,"There isn't, sadly."
01:04:59,01:04:59,"Well, there's a niche."
01:04:59,01:05:00,There's a niche.
01:05:00,01:05:03,"And then I tried to find you Tuber, like for potatoes."
01:05:03,01:05:04,"Oh, yeah."
01:05:04,01:05:05,Is that--
01:05:05,01:05:06,"No, well, there might be."
01:05:06,01:05:07,"But to be honest, it's so hard to search"
01:05:07,01:05:12,a YouTuber with an E.R. with potatoes in mind.
01:05:12,01:05:12,And I--
01:05:12,01:05:14,You have to put minus quite a lot of things.
01:05:14,01:05:16,"You have to put minus, PewDiePie, minus."
01:05:16,01:05:17,Exactly.
01:05:17,01:05:18,Zawella and all of this.
01:05:18,01:05:21,I did find a guy who made a self-driving potato two years ago.
01:05:21,01:05:23,Did you hear about this?
01:05:23,01:05:25,There's hardly no.
01:05:25,01:05:26,"Yeah, of course I saw that."
01:05:26,01:05:27,I'll YouTuber.
01:05:27,01:05:33,I've been looking at the chess records.
01:05:33,01:05:36,"Sorry, not chess records, the record company."
01:05:36,01:05:39,"The Wikipedia-- you know, chess was a record label."
01:05:39,01:05:40,Was it?
01:05:40,01:05:40,"Yeah, we did."
01:05:40,01:05:41,Hang on.
01:05:41,01:05:42,No.
01:05:42,01:05:43,It was a music record label.
01:05:43,01:05:45,I think it was a record label called chess.
01:05:45,01:05:47,"That was an extremely esoteric joke, I think."
01:05:47,01:05:48,Yeah.
01:05:48,01:05:50,It was-- you meant to unconfuse us.
01:05:50,01:05:52,And you've actually confused us a lot more.
01:05:52,01:05:54,"What I mean to say was, I've been looking at the Wikipedia"
01:05:54,01:05:56,page for the records in competitive chess.
01:05:56,01:05:58,It was a musical called chess.
01:05:58,01:05:59,Yes.
01:05:59,01:06:00,I think there was a record label called--
01:06:00,01:06:00,Of sure there was.
01:06:00,01:06:01,It didn't make sense.
01:06:01,01:06:03,"There were so many record labels, aren't there?"
01:06:03,01:06:05,Anyway.
01:06:05,01:06:06,These chess records.
01:06:06,01:06:07,"I was eating an apple, and I don't mean the record label."
01:06:07,01:06:10,[LAUGHTER]
01:06:10,01:06:12,There's a company called Love Honey
01:06:12,01:06:14,that makes sex ties and stuff like that.
01:06:14,01:06:16,And they recently revealed the weirdest search terms
01:06:16,01:06:17,they've ever had.
01:06:17,01:06:19,That included pepperami loop.
01:06:19,01:06:23,A few others.
01:06:23,01:06:29,Pies for women to get horny pickled onion condoms.
01:06:29,01:06:30,Wow.
01:06:30,01:06:31,No?
01:06:31,01:06:32,No.
01:06:32,01:06:34,Probably not this time.
01:06:34,01:06:37,[LAUGHTER]
01:06:37,01:06:39,Pope Gregory issued a special decree saying
01:06:39,01:06:41,that Satan was half cat.
01:06:41,01:06:42,Wow.
01:06:42,01:06:44,So not all popes have been fans of cats.
01:06:44,01:06:44,Yeah.
01:06:44,01:06:44,Wow.
01:06:44,01:06:46,"Because there was Pope Paul II, and he"
01:06:46,01:06:49,"was a 15th century Pope, who had his cat treated"
01:06:49,01:06:51,by his own personal doctor.
01:06:51,01:06:56,And then Pope Paul VI had his cat dressed up in mini cardinals
01:06:56,01:06:59,"robes, apparently, although I've never seen a drawing."
01:06:59,01:07:01,I don't know if we have evidence of these tiny cat cardinal
01:07:01,01:07:02,robes.
01:07:02,01:07:05,"But it's called the Vatican, not the Catechon."
01:07:05,01:07:06,Yeah.
01:07:06,01:07:06,"Oh, now come on."
01:07:06,01:07:07,That was good.
01:07:07,01:07:14,"I was reading about, so Spartacus,"
01:07:14,01:07:17,"the movie Spartacus, starring Kurt Douglas."
01:07:17,01:07:19,So Kurt Douglas has Michael Douglas as a son.
01:07:19,01:07:21,But then he also has Eric Douglas.
01:07:21,01:07:24,And Eric Douglas is a lesser known--
01:07:24,01:07:25,"he hadn't really heard of him, right?"
01:07:25,01:07:27,So he was in the industry as well.
01:07:27,01:07:29,And there's a very famous story of him
01:07:29,01:07:31,going to London to do stand-up comedy.
01:07:31,01:07:33,And he did it in a London club.
01:07:33,01:07:35,And he started telling jokes.
01:07:35,01:07:37,And he was getting nothing from anyone.
01:07:37,01:07:39,And he got really angry on stage for the fact
01:07:39,01:07:40,that he was getting nothing.
01:07:40,01:07:42,So he suddenly turned on the crowd.
01:07:42,01:07:44,And he was furious with them.
01:07:44,01:07:46,"And he was saying to them, do you know who I am?"
01:07:46,01:07:49,I'm Kurt Douglas's son.
01:07:49,01:07:51,"And someone in the audience stood up and went, no, I'm"
01:07:51,01:07:52,Kurt Douglas's son.
01:07:52,01:08:00,That's fantastic.
01:08:00,01:08:02,"I was looking at very, very loud things."
01:08:02,01:08:04,We mentioned Cracator a while ago.
01:08:04,01:08:06,We said it was the loudest noise ever.
01:08:06,01:08:09,I looked into it a bit more how loud it is.
01:08:09,01:08:12,So that was the volcano that went off in the--
01:08:12,01:08:15,"Yes, in 1816, I think."
01:08:15,01:08:16,Was that Tambora?
01:08:16,01:08:17,"Oh, it was 1883."
01:08:17,01:08:18,"Yeah, yeah, 1883 happened."
01:08:18,01:08:21,But the Cracator was the equivalent of hearing a noise
01:08:21,01:08:25,in New York that happened in Ireland.
01:08:25,01:08:29,And it would take four hours to get to you.
01:08:29,01:08:31,So there was a ship 40 miles away from Cracator
01:08:31,01:08:33,when it went off.
01:08:33,01:08:35,"40 miles away, the ship was blasted so much"
01:08:35,01:08:38,that half the crew's eardrums were shattered.
01:08:38,01:08:39,And the captain had no idea what was going on.
01:08:39,01:08:42,"He wrote in his diary, ""I am convinced the day of judgment has"
01:08:42,01:08:45,"come, just because this noise was so loud."""
01:08:45,01:08:48,"Imagine, I mean, the wire with all to write, update your journal."
01:08:48,01:08:50,What the day of judgment?
01:08:50,01:08:53,[LAUGHTER]
01:08:53,01:08:55,"You've got, like, 10 minutes left to live."
01:08:55,01:08:56,"Max, what are you going to do?"
01:08:56,01:08:57,"Well, I better report this."
01:08:57,01:09:00,[LAUGHTER]
01:09:00,01:09:03,It used to be a thing where the vacuum cleaner
01:09:03,01:09:05,was only in one place in your home.
01:09:05,01:09:07,And you would attach huge tubes to it.
01:09:07,01:09:10,So the vacuum cleaner had its own spot in the house.
01:09:10,01:09:14,"I mean, it stays in one place in my home, certainly."
01:09:14,01:09:15,So you didn't move it around.
01:09:15,01:09:16,You didn't move it around.
01:09:16,01:09:18,You just have a great long tube to the bit
01:09:18,01:09:21,you needed to suck that or cleaned.
01:09:21,01:09:23,"But then, the Hubert Cecil Booth, who"
01:09:23,01:09:26,"was a huge figure in the vacuum cleaner invention process,"
01:09:26,01:09:29,"he created a giant vacuum cleaner for cinemas, which"
01:09:29,01:09:32,was hidden basically inside the walls of the cinema.
01:09:32,01:09:35,So it's in the building.
01:09:35,01:09:38,And there are pipes going through the walls
01:09:38,01:09:40,"to all sorts of different, like, power points, vacuum"
01:09:40,01:09:42,sockets in the cinema.
01:09:42,01:09:44,"And when you want to clean, you find the vacuum"
01:09:44,01:09:46,"point in the floor, and you open that up,"
01:09:46,01:09:49,and it's just constantly sucking away at that point.
01:09:49,01:09:52,And you just attach the hose to that and get hovering.
01:09:52,01:09:54,So were there ever accidents where it was opened at the wrong
01:09:54,01:09:56,"moment, and a whole audience got stuck into it?"
01:09:56,01:09:57,Thousands.
01:09:57,01:09:59,"That's why they stopped it, too many deaths."
01:09:59,01:10:00,Yeah.
01:10:00,01:10:01,Can see that.
01:10:01,01:10:04,"You know, hedgehogs can get balloon syndrome."
01:10:04,01:10:07,"Why have you said that, like, it's something where you all know?"
01:10:07,01:10:08,"Oh, well, I've seen one with it."
01:10:08,01:10:09,It's amazing.
01:10:09,01:10:11,I've heard of it.
01:10:11,01:10:13,It's just as many as referring to balloon syndrome
01:10:13,01:10:14,"as, like, they get flew."
01:10:14,01:10:15,"You know, they can get balloon syndrome."
01:10:15,01:10:16,I think we all know that.
01:10:16,01:10:19,"So, sorry, balloon syndrome is a condition"
01:10:19,01:10:21,that hedgehogs can get there.
01:10:21,01:10:25,"And basically, it's because they have lots of space"
01:10:25,01:10:27,under their skin.
01:10:27,01:10:29,And this is to allow them to roll up.
01:10:29,01:10:30,It helps them roll up.
01:10:30,01:10:31,But if air gets trapped under their skin
01:10:31,01:10:34,"and it keeps getting in, they can just blow up and up and up"
01:10:34,01:10:34,and up.
01:10:34,01:10:37,And then they can be the size of a beach ball.
01:10:37,01:10:39,And then the best thing to do is genuinely
01:10:39,01:10:42,to pop a needle into it and drain the air.
01:10:42,01:10:43,You're kidding.
01:10:43,01:10:44,Can you take one of their own needles?
01:10:44,01:10:46,I don't know.
01:10:46,01:10:48,"Probably, yeah."
01:10:48,01:10:50,"God, that's the ultimate irony, isn't it?"
01:10:50,01:10:51,It's like being a balloon made of needles.
01:10:51,01:10:53,Yeah.
01:10:53,01:10:55,"Oh, so sad, but if they learn to cooperate,"
01:10:55,01:10:58,then they'd be able to puncture each other's balloon syndrome.
01:10:58,01:10:59,"So, that's the lesson we've learned, right?"
01:10:59,01:11:02,"If they join forces, they plug a needle out of each other."
01:11:02,01:11:03,Yeah.
01:11:03,01:11:03,That's a good point.
01:11:03,01:11:05,"You know, they've got drawstrings around them."
01:11:05,01:11:06,What hedgehogs?
01:11:06,01:11:07,"No, they don't."
01:11:07,01:11:08,They have to get money passes.
01:11:08,01:11:10,"Oh, sorry, I'm thinking of money passes again."
01:11:10,01:11:12,"No, they have this muscle called an orbicularis."
01:11:12,01:11:15,"And it's a ridge of muscle, which goes all the way around."
01:11:15,01:11:17,"It's like a skirt, basically."
01:11:17,01:11:18,And it's what allows them to roll up.
01:11:18,01:11:20,"So, they just tighten the orbicularis"
01:11:20,01:11:22,and the drawstring just closes.
01:11:22,01:11:24,And they can still look out for hours.
01:11:24,01:11:28,"But, but when they run, they hitch up their skirt, basically."
01:11:28,01:11:29,And they have these weird long legs.
01:11:29,01:11:32,"So, if you look up footage of a hedgehog running,"
01:11:32,01:11:34,it's got much longer legs than you're used to.
01:11:34,01:11:36,They still have lifted up their skirt or rubbed it.
01:11:36,01:11:37,No way.
01:11:37,01:11:37,It's bizarre.
01:11:37,01:11:41,"Guys, heard of the game campaign for North Africa?"
01:11:41,01:11:41,Yes.
01:11:41,01:11:42,That's incredible.
01:11:42,01:11:43,I don't know if we--
01:11:43,01:11:44,I don't think we've spoken about it before.
01:11:44,01:11:49,"Campaign for North Africa, the desert war, 1940 to 1943,"
01:11:49,01:11:52,"it takes, roughly, they've worked out 50 days"
01:11:52,01:11:55,without breaks to complete the game.
01:11:55,01:11:57,And you need 10 players.
01:11:57,01:12:00,"It comes with 1,600 cardboard tokens."
01:12:00,01:12:01,"Yeah, wow."
01:12:01,01:12:03,And it's so detailed.
01:12:03,01:12:05,It's the map that you play on.
01:12:05,01:12:06,It stretches out 10 feet.
01:12:06,01:12:08,"Yeah, that's how big it is."
01:12:08,01:12:09,"Big table, basically."
01:12:09,01:12:10,Yeah.
01:12:10,01:12:13,"So, it's mostly sums the game, the campaign for North Africa."
01:12:13,01:12:16,"It's made by a guy called Richard Berg, who, you know,"
01:12:16,01:12:19,just wanted to develop the most complicated and realistic
01:12:19,01:12:20,game.
01:12:20,01:12:22,"But if it's 10 feet long and it's the campaign for North Africa,"
01:12:22,01:12:23,is that not just old desert?
01:12:23,01:12:24,Yeah.
01:12:24,01:12:25,Yeah.
01:12:25,01:12:26,It's not a great game.
01:12:26,01:12:29,"So, what are you saying?"
01:12:29,01:12:31,I just think you can make it smaller.
01:12:31,01:12:32,Yeah.
01:12:32,01:12:34,"Oh, you mean cut out the desert?"
01:12:34,01:12:35,"Yeah, cut out the desert."
01:12:35,01:12:36,What if you cut out the desert?
01:12:36,01:12:38,"You haven't got a game, have you?"
01:12:38,01:12:41,"But so, for example, there is a thing in the game"
01:12:41,01:12:43,which you have to do.
01:12:43,01:12:45,You just get a sheet of paper and it's mostly sums.
01:12:45,01:12:49,"So, every game turn, 3% of your fuel evaporates."
01:12:49,01:12:51,"Unless you're the British before a certain date,"
01:12:51,01:12:54,because they use rather inefficient means of storing
01:12:54,01:12:56,"their fuel, they use drums instead of Jerry cans."
01:12:56,01:12:57,"So, if you're British before a certain date,"
01:12:57,01:12:59,7% evaporates every turn.
01:12:59,01:13:00,Amazing.
01:13:00,01:13:04,"If you're Italian, you have to distribute an extra water"
01:13:04,01:13:07,ration to your troops so that they can boil their pasta.
01:13:07,01:13:11,"Otherwise, otherwise, there is a greater risk"
01:13:11,01:13:13,that they all become disorganized and desert.
01:13:13,01:13:17,"Like, it's incredible."
01:13:17,01:13:20,"They worked out that if you played this game as a hobby,"
01:13:20,01:13:23,"so the game, which is the desert war in 1940 and in 1943,"
01:13:23,01:13:25,"if it was done as a hobby, you could make it last"
01:13:25,01:13:28,longer than the war itself for playing it.
01:13:28,01:13:30,And it was more traumatic.
01:13:30,01:13:32,Shall we finish?
01:13:32,01:13:33,Sure.
01:13:33,01:13:37,You know how you were saying about how you would give
01:13:37,01:13:40,Lam's blood to someone to make them more Lam-like?
01:13:40,01:13:41,"Yes, yeah."
01:13:41,01:13:43,"Another thing they kind of thought was a good idea was,"
01:13:43,01:13:47,"if you had fallen out with your husband or wife,"
01:13:47,01:13:51,your discard might be settled by giving each other your blood.
01:13:51,01:13:53,"So, I might swap blood with my wife,"
01:13:53,01:13:56,and then it would kind of bring her to my point of view
01:13:56,01:13:57,all the other way around.
01:13:57,01:13:58,Wow.
01:13:58,01:14:00,And would you maybe sneakily inject the other person
01:14:00,01:14:02,with your wife?
01:14:02,01:14:06,"I think you'll find out right now, I'll make sure."
01:14:06,01:14:08,"Wow, I do believe you're right, that's weird."
01:14:08,01:14:12,"No, it would be like, if you've had problems in your marriage"
01:14:12,01:14:16,"for a long period of time, then it might kind of solve things."
01:14:16,01:14:17,What are you saying?
01:14:17,01:14:18,It's a last resort.
01:14:18,01:14:20,It's a last resort before getting divorced.
01:14:20,01:14:21,This is one thing you'd try.
01:14:21,01:14:22,And did you have to swap?
01:14:22,01:14:24,"When you say swap, do you mean I can just give you"
01:14:24,01:14:25,a little cup of blood and you can give me one?
01:14:25,01:14:26,Or do you have to put it properly in?
01:14:26,01:14:28,It was a proper transfusion.
01:14:28,01:14:31,"Well, I did the blood brothers thing with my best friend"
01:14:31,01:14:33,"when I was younger, which is basically"
01:14:33,01:14:34,"had many transfusions, isn't it?"
01:14:34,01:14:34,It is.
01:14:34,01:14:36,"It is a very, very small transfusion."
01:14:36,01:14:37,"What's quite small, yeah?"
01:14:37,01:14:41,And the idea behind this of the blood
01:14:41,01:14:44,"giving you whatever it came from, that"
01:14:44,01:14:49,"began with Samuel Peep's, who at the raw society was telling"
01:14:49,01:14:54,about a guy who only lived on women's milk as in breast milk.
01:14:54,01:14:57,"And apparently, he used to be angry and fretful."
01:14:57,01:15:01,"But by taking this women's milk, he became a good-natured patient"
01:15:01,01:15:03,and found himself so well.
01:15:03,01:15:05,And they thought he'd somehow got the characteristics
01:15:05,01:15:06,of a woman.
01:15:06,01:15:09,Like a drinking breast milk.
01:15:09,01:15:12,"But if that was the case, then every baby would--"
01:15:12,01:15:13,Right.
01:15:13,01:15:14,You're right.
01:15:14,01:15:17,"Well, you don't see many babies with moustaches, do you?"
01:15:17,01:15:18,It's a very good point.
01:15:18,01:15:19,Like all men have.
01:15:19,01:15:20,Like all men have.
01:15:20,01:15:22,Like all men have.
01:15:22,01:15:23,Just one more thing.
01:15:23,01:15:26,There was a guy who called Petra de Tabano in the 13th century.
01:15:26,01:15:28,"And he said that he who drinks menstrual blood,"
01:15:28,01:15:31,"or that of a leper, will be seen to be distracted"
01:15:31,01:15:33,"and lunatic, evil-minded and forgetful."
01:15:33,01:15:36,And his cure is to drink of Daisy's powder
01:15:36,01:15:38,and mix with water of honey and to bathe in tepid water
01:15:38,01:15:39,and to copulate with girls.
01:15:39,01:15:41,[LAUGHTER]
01:15:41,01:15:46,Sound like you was building up to an excuse.
01:15:46,01:15:48,It was a weirdest day off ever.
01:15:48,01:15:50,But menstrual blood was thought to be quite a negative thing.
01:15:50,01:15:53,"Quite a lot, wasn't it?"
01:15:53,01:15:56,"Although, Pliny, I thought a lot of fun stuff,"
01:15:56,01:15:58,but thought that one of the things you could do
01:15:58,01:16:00,was collect the menstrual blood of someone.
01:16:00,01:16:02,And I don't know how you go about doing that.
01:16:02,01:16:03,And then you sprinkle it over your crops
01:16:03,01:16:08,"because it kills all the bugs, because everything around."
01:16:08,01:16:09,But not the crops.
01:16:09,01:16:11,"Doesn't kill the crops, crops love it."
01:16:11,01:16:12,Bugs hate it.
01:16:12,01:16:13,Wow.
01:16:13,01:16:17,"And also, in Papua New Guinea, there's--"
01:16:17,01:16:19,"so in an island called Wogeo, which"
01:16:19,01:16:22,"is a tiny island off Papua New Guinea,"
01:16:22,01:16:25,then menstrual blood is thought to be cleansing.
01:16:25,01:16:28,And it's thought to be kind of a good thing to menstruate.
01:16:28,01:16:29,And men want to do it.
01:16:29,01:16:31,"I mean, this is really disgusting, sorry guys."
01:16:31,01:16:34,But they will sever their willies in order
01:16:34,01:16:36,to mimic the menstruation of women.
01:16:36,01:16:38,I heard they just sort of cut them
01:16:38,01:16:41,a bit without severing with crab claws.
01:16:41,01:16:42,"Oh, they don't come off."
01:16:42,01:16:43,"Sorry, they--"
01:16:43,01:16:44,"I'm sorry, it's just the word sever."
01:16:44,01:16:45,You're right.
01:16:45,01:16:46,It's just the word sever.
01:16:46,01:16:48,"When someone says his head's been severed,"
01:16:48,01:16:50,"you don't think, oh, we all need a plaster for that."
01:16:50,01:16:52,"Sorry, you are right."
01:16:52,01:16:53,They didn't chop them all the way off.
01:16:53,01:16:55,"Because you can only do that once, really."
01:16:55,01:16:57,"You need a very willing and patient crab, too, don't you?"
01:16:57,01:16:58,Yeah.
01:16:58,01:17:00,Do you think what you think was attached?
01:17:00,01:17:01,"Well, yeah, I imagine so."
01:17:01,01:17:02,"Yeah, OK."
01:17:02,01:17:04,It's cool if you cut off the crab's claw
01:17:04,01:17:06,to cut your own penis.
01:17:06,01:17:09,"I know, but you can at least control the claw at that point, I think."
01:17:09,01:17:11,"Maybe the crab wants to emulate menstruation, as well."
01:17:11,01:17:14,So it's actually quite grateful.
01:17:14,01:17:16,Probably not.
01:17:16,01:17:17,OK.
01:17:17,01:17:19,"OK, we'll get something out of that."
01:17:19,01:17:19,So you're right.
01:17:19,01:17:22,"He did kind of move his face a lot, didn't he,"
01:17:22,01:17:22,correct?
01:17:22,01:17:25,That was one of his main things that he did when acting.
01:17:25,01:17:29,There was a guy in 1756 who said that his realistic style
01:17:29,01:17:30,went too far.
01:17:30,01:17:33,His overfundness for extravagant attitudes
01:17:33,01:17:36,"frequently affected starts convulsive twitchings,"
01:17:36,01:17:39,"jerks of the body, sprawling of the fingers,"
01:17:39,01:17:42,"and slapping of the breast, were no good."
01:17:42,01:17:46,"And he was a really good friends with Hogarth, the artist."
01:17:46,01:17:49,And so he was probably the most painted man in England
01:17:49,01:17:52,"at the time, because Hogarth used to paint him all the time."
01:17:52,01:17:53,But Hogarth used to complain because he
01:17:53,01:17:56,moved his face so much all the time.
01:17:56,01:17:57,They couldn't paint him properly.
01:17:57,01:17:58,"Oh, really?"
01:17:58,01:18:01,"There's one portrait of him, which is in the British Museum,"
01:18:01,01:18:04,"I think, it's called a mechanical portrait."
01:18:04,01:18:08,And it's a picture of him being painted by Hogarth.
01:18:08,01:18:10,"But in the space where his face is,"
01:18:10,01:18:12,there's one of those spinning wheels behind the picture.
01:18:12,01:18:15,And you can have 30 different facial expressions
01:18:15,01:18:17,as you wheel around.
01:18:17,01:18:18,He is very interesting.
01:18:18,01:18:22,"He ran Drury Lane, which was one of the theaters that he had"
01:18:22,01:18:23,for 30 years.
01:18:23,01:18:27,And no plays that were new plays at the time have survived.
01:18:27,01:18:29,"It's a very odd thing, because there are a lot of plays"
01:18:29,01:18:30,in that time.
01:18:30,01:18:34,And he was someone who he was doing a lot of the scheduling.
01:18:34,01:18:36,"And despite his absolute love for Shakespeare,"
01:18:36,01:18:38,he also had to do things that he absolutely
01:18:38,01:18:40,detested pantomime.
01:18:40,01:18:41,He absolutely detested.
01:18:41,01:18:43,He hated clowns.
01:18:43,01:18:44,But--
01:18:44,01:18:46,"Oh, no, he didn't, yeah."
01:18:46,01:18:47,He didn't?
01:18:47,01:18:48,Nice.
01:18:48,01:18:49,"Oh, no, he didn't."
01:18:49,01:18:52,[LAUGHTER]
01:18:56,01:18:57,"Oh, my goodness."
01:18:57,01:18:59,Get everybody-- he's behind you.
01:18:59,01:19:02,[LAUGHTER]
01:19:02,01:19:03,This is what we have to deal with.
01:19:03,01:19:06,[APPLAUSE]
01:19:06,01:19:08,"God, that's just the proper insight"
01:19:08,01:19:12,"into how bad I feel about facts all the time, I just say."
01:19:12,01:19:13,"Oh, he didn't-- random guy?"
01:19:13,01:19:15,"OK, you're right."
01:19:15,01:19:19,"Must have checked my facts, you're definitely right."
01:19:19,01:19:23,"Yeah, so he made the start of an evening"
01:19:23,01:19:25,be the thing that would be the clown.
01:19:25,01:19:30,And he-- so like the pantomime clown stuff would be--
01:19:30,01:19:32,"That's what we do, too, Dan."
01:19:32,01:19:33,[LAUGHTER]
01:19:33,01:19:35,Yeah.
01:19:35,01:19:39,"Slav Doug, OK."
01:19:39,01:19:43,"So what I was saying is, I will get to the--"
01:19:43,01:19:44,You will.
01:19:44,01:19:48,So what's probably a wrong fact?
01:19:48,01:19:50,"But so before a play started an evening,"
01:19:50,01:19:52,"they would have an appetizer, which"
01:19:52,01:19:54,"would be a hard-lequin style clown, a gremaldi,"
01:19:54,01:19:56,who would come on and do a bit.
01:19:56,01:19:58,He absolutely hated that.
01:19:58,01:20:00,"He, at one time, he was at a puppet show,"
01:20:00,01:20:03,and he had to leave because he thought the applause
01:20:03,01:20:05,for Mr. Punch was so repulsive.
01:20:05,01:20:07,"He was like, I've got to get out of here."
01:20:07,01:20:09,"But he had to keep it in because people loved it,"
01:20:09,01:20:12,particularly King George III loved it.
01:20:12,01:20:13,He'd never laughed so hard apparently
01:20:13,01:20:18,than when he was seeing a clown swallow a whole carrot on stage.
01:20:18,01:20:20,And that was the reason for keeping it.
01:20:20,01:20:21,"Everyone in this audience is thinking,"
01:20:21,01:20:25,"God, I wish that was what was on tonight."
01:20:25,01:20:27,Are you apparently swallowed a lot of carrots?
01:20:27,01:20:28,It wasn't just the one as well.
01:20:28,01:20:29,Amazing.
01:20:29,01:20:30,But--
01:20:30,01:20:32,[LAUGHTER]
01:20:32,01:20:33,That's it.
01:20:33,01:20:34,We've all been there.
01:20:34,01:20:36,[LAUGHTER]
01:20:36,01:20:37,We--
01:20:37,01:20:38,[LAUGHTER]
01:20:38,01:20:39,OK.
01:20:39,01:20:40,[INAUDIBLE]
01:20:40,01:20:41,"Before you find your prints, you"
01:20:41,01:20:43,have to swallow a lot of carrots.
01:20:43,01:20:46,[LAUGHTER]
01:20:46,01:20:50,[APPLAUSE]
01:20:50,01:20:52,What are you uploading?
01:20:52,01:20:53,[LAUGHTER]
