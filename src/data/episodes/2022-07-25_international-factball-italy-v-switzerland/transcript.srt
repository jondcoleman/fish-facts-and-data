00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International Factbowl"

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,800
 brought to you by the QIELS in association with visitingland.com

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,960
 My name's Andy and I'm here with three of the QIELS.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,200
 They are in no particular order, Anna, James and Anne.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,480
 And today's match is a humdinger, it's going to be Italy versus Switzerland.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,000
 So, there's the whistle, interesting facts about Italy. Take it away.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,760
 I love the fact that in Italy they have a word for the Act symbol,

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,280
 which we kind of don't want, it's commonly used, and their word is "Tiocchiola",

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,200
 which means snail, because obviously it looks like a snail.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
 - That is very good. - It's nice.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,040
 And paparazzi, the word paparazzi, you guys know what that means in Italian?

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,080
 - Is it buzzing insect? - Yeah, it's buzzing mosquito.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,840
 - It's from La Dolceviacita, isn't it? - Yeah, it's named after the paparazzi character.

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,040
 - Turumasu means "pick me up". - Yes.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,320
 - Susie, you're right, she lunches, she gets you through there.

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,960
 - If you want to pick me up, yeah.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
 I read that confetti, obviously it's in Italian sounding world,

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
 but it was also invented in Italy, but it was originally candid spices

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
 and Italian families would throw it from their balconies to the crowds below.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,160
 - Oh, that's cool. - That's good, yeah.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:10,240
 A 10% of all food stolen in Italy is parmesan cheese. Wow.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,320
 - It is pretty pricey.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,520
 When McDonald's first opened in Italy,

24
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,200
 they opened in Roman 1986, and everyone was furious.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,320
 And the designer Valentino tried to close it down, because it was too noisy,

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
 and there was an unbearable smell of fried fruit fouling the air.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,840
 - That's great. - What? That doesn't sound like McDonald's, I know.

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,240
 - I read the grand opening of their McDonald's.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,000
 People stood outside handing out pasta.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,760
 - Yes, it is what... - There was a traditional Italian food

31
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,160
 and they said, "This is what you should be eating, none of these burgers."

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,800
 - Even now, they don't want foreign food coming into Italy.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,560
 There was a politician called...

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,120
 I don't know what his first name was, I think, is Mr. Zaya.

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,960
 And he was trying to stop all foreign food from coming in,

36
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,040
 and someone asked him, "Have you ever eaten a cabab?"

37
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,720
 And he said, "No, and I defy anyone to prove the contrary."

38
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 I prefer the dishes of my native Veneto, and I even refuse to eat a pineapple.

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,880
 - Wow. - That is great.

40
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,280
 - Yeah, pineapple pizza. - Pineapple pizza. - Oh, yeah.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,280
 - And the other thing, tomatoes are native to Italy, are they?

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,560
 - Well, pasta isn't a traditional Italian dish at all.

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,480
 It was brought over by the Arabs in the 13th century, wasn't it?

44
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,040
 And they adopted it as their own.

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,200
 But it used to be eaten with honey and sugar.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,200
 Before the 17th, 18th century, pasta wasn't eaten with tomato sauce.

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
 It was dipped in honey and sugar. - Oh, I don't want to try that.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,800
 - Mussolini wanted all Italians to eat rice, not pasta.

49
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,160
 And he had a national day for rice.

50
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,400
 And there was the national rice board, which brought free bags of rice to people.

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,640
 And it really wanted to encourage them, so they could be self-sufficient.

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,280
 - Do they also have a national cheese board? - Very good.

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,200
 My favorite kind of Italian pasta is strasopretti,

54
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,640
 which are these little things which I think they look like corn.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,800
 And the literal translation for strasopretti is priest stranglers.

56
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,960
 - Not cool. - Didn't chew a batter mean slipper?

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,600
 - Yes, it does. - And it was invented really recently, as well.

58
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,080
 - Yeah, 1982. - 1982, yeah.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
 - My favorite Italian food fact is actually also a football fact.

60
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,480
 Maybe it's not allowed. - No, I love it.

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,400
 - We average about one football fact per podcast, so I don't worry about that.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
 - Okay, can I claim this week's?

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
 There was a football match.

64
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
 It was Scotland versus Italy.

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,960
 And the Scotland fans chanted, "We're going to deep fry your pizzas."

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,440
 - Speaking about football chants, there was a match.

67
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,440
 It was nappily against Verona.

68
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
 And the Verona fans were singing, "We hope that Vesuvius goes off."

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,480
 And the nappily fans were singing "Juliette is a whore."

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,000
 - Wow. Wow.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,520
 - Okay, I have a question for you.

72
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,440
 Name something that happened in Italy between the 5th and 14th of October 1542.

73
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,360
 - A new Pope. - No.

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,440
 - Was Leonardo da Vinci died? - Nothing.

75
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,160
 - Did they have a calendar jump and they switched their days?

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 - Exactly, nothing happened.

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,360
 Nothing happened between the 5th and the 14th of October in that year.

78
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,000
 Pope Gregory ordered that those days should not happen

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 so that they can make up for previously inaccurate calendars

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,720
 and get with the program.

81
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,080
 - Do you know where the easiest place to get cocaine in Italy is?

82
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,560
 - Yes, but I cannot tell you on this podcast,

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,200
 because the next time I go, it'll be swamped.

84
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,720
 - No, the easiest place is the air.

85
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,480
 Researchers have tested the air in Rome

86
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 and found that there are traces of cocaine,

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,640
 also cannabis, nicotine and caffeine.

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,440
 - He's walking around with your mouth open, like a bear trying to catch that.

89
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
 - And the cocaine just jumps in.

90
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,480
 - The mafia is still very dominant, isn't it, in Italy?

91
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,880
 I think 80% of small businesses in the capital of Sicily pay a pizza,

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,880
 protection money? - 80%.

93
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,080
 - 80%. It's a lot, isn't it?

94
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,120
 Across the whole of Southern Italy,

95
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,160
 the mafia makes more than 20 billion a year through extortion.

96
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
 - Whoa. - And Coulieroni,

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,280
 Coulieroni, the town in Sicily, has got a petition to change its name

98
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
 because of the negative connotations.

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,320
 - Oh, nice air. - Yeah.

100
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,080
 - Speaking of the mafia, did you hear the terrible thing that they did last year?

101
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,040
 They kidnapped the world's smallest pony.

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,880
 - Oh, not bad. - And not bad in someone's bed?

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
 - That is too far.

104
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
 - They believe that a very small bet.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:02,040
 - It was 63 centimeters tall animal named Charlie,

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,640
 and he was taken from his stall in Citadel Castello.

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,680
 - Did they get him back?

108
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,280
 - I'm not sure, actually. I couldn't find.

109
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
 - If anyone knows what happened to Charlie, you can call this number.

110
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,040
 - Charlie, if you're out there, we're not angry.

111
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,200
 Okay, just come back. - We're just disappointed.

112
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,920
 - Okay, that means that at halftime,

113
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,000
 it's time for our mid-match quiz,

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,680
 brought to you by VisitEngland.com.

115
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,840
 We've got three questions relating in some way or another to England,

116
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
 so who would like to go first?

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,000
 - I have one. - Yeah, Anne.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,080
 - I had a brilliant time a few weeks ago.

119
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,920
 I went to Cadbury World in Birmingham,

120
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,760
 and they had lots of great information,

121
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,960
 and they had a bit about how the Mayans use cocoa beans as currency.

122
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,320
 They didn't have coins,

123
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,640
 so it cost two cocoa beans for a pumpkin,

124
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,000
 but how many for a rabbit?

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,920
 - Okay, Anne's is on a postcard. James?

126
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,240
 - Okay, my question is, in old Cheshire,

127
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,920
 what did they mean when they said "sparrow farts"?

128
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,560
 - Do they mean the farts of sparrows?

129
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,120
 - Maybe you'll have to tune in to find out.

130
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,440
 - I'm gonna be here. - Oh, yeah.

131
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,320
 - Anna?

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,080
 - So during World War II,

133
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,960
 for what did MI6 use human semen?

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,120
 - Oh, I thought it was most of the navy who you see.

135
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,200
 - Very good.

136
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,480
 - Okay, so that's the halftime quiz over,

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,360
 so we will give away the answers at the end,

138
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,520
 and now it's time for the second half of the match,

139
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,120
 which is Switzerland.

140
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,440
 - Every year they have an annual Santa Claus World Championship,

141
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,480
 called Toe World.

142
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,640
 - Is this our Santa Claus? It's selected.

143
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,960
 - Is it? - Yeah, there's gonna be a channel five reality show coming soon.

145
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,840
 - Switzerland is the only country to have enough nuclear shelters

146
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,280
 for its entire population.

147
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,800
 - Wow. - Wow, yeah.

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
 You can't name your child,

149
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,160
 pineapple or banana or fairy tale or whatever it is

150
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,720
 that everyone who's famous these days names their children

151
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,560
 if you're in Switzerland, because you have to choose

152
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,640
 from them and approve a list of baby names.

153
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,920
 - But the country has been neutral since about the mid-14th century.

154
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,440
 They used to be quite an aggressive territorial expansionist power,

155
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,240
 and then they had one really unpleasant battle

156
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,480
 or a few battles in the 14th century.

157
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
 And they said, "Right, actually, we're not doing this anymore."

158
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,320
 And they just formed the boundaries,

159
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,560
 almost completely in modern Switzerland soon after that,

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,480
 and they just have not gone involved since then.

161
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,000
 - They have had the odd little battle in between themselves,

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
 the cantons. - Oh, yeah.

163
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,720
 - There was a battle between Zurich and Zug,

164
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,360
 rather nicely, in 1529.

165
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,560
 War was declared, but before any fighting could take place,

166
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,000
 the two teams or the two groups of soldiers sat down,

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,400
 settled their differences and called off the war,

168
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,800
 and the soldiers from both sides sat on the border

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,960
 and shared a cauldron of milk soup.

170
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,080
 - Wow.

171
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,160
 One thing I really like is that senior soldiers in the Swiss Army,

172
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,320
 they have flowers instead of stars.

173
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,880
 I made you general who would have two stars on his epilets

174
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,960
 in other NATO countries,

175
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,160
 would have two Adelweiss on his epilets in Switzerland.

176
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,000
 - Oh, that's good. - That's awesome.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,760
 Speaking of keeping yourself to yourself,

178
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,640
 I read about a block of flats near Zurich.

179
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 This is for people who claim to suffer

180
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,880
 from hypersensitivity to chemicals

181
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,200
 and electromagnetic radiation,

182
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,160
 and there are apartments there that have been designed specifically,

183
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,360
 so there's no smoking, no perfume, no mobile phones,

184
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,280
 and it's supposed to be for people who find

185
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,960
 that they're allergic to modern life.

186
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,240
 - I might use allergic to modern life,

187
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,000
 as my excuse for not being on Twitter hence.

188
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,240
 - One thing I love about Switzerland

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,080
 is that the racking vac falls where Sherlock Holmes

190
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,680
 fell to his death are in Switzerland.

191
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,920
 So the Sherlock Holmes society go on a pilgrimage

192
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,000
 to the racking vac falls where they reenact the fall,

193
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
 but with dummies, not with real people.

194
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
 And one thing I learned from reading about it

195
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,800
 was that apparently in 1910,

196
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
 Sherlock Holmes books were banned from station booksellers,

197
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
 because they're having a bad effect on the Swiss youth.

198
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,400
 - What? - Apparently jumping off the falls, possibly.

199
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,840
 - They weren't all just smoking pipes

200
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,280
 and wearing those funny hats.

201
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,680
 - And solving crime in a slightly annoying way.

202
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,240
 - Yeah, so Switzerland was where Conan Doyle,

203
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,160
 Arthur Conan Doyle popularised skiing.

204
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,000
 I think he'd discovered it on holiday in Norway,

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
 and then he was in Switzerland, and he looked around

206
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,920
 and thought, "Look, mountains, snow.

207
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,600
 "I know what I'm gonna do here."

208
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,160
 And he found two other people in Switzerland that skied,

209
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
 but they could only ski by night,

210
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,320
 because they were mocked so massively by the Swiss masses,

211
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,840
 for doing such a weird thing.

212
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,680
 But then Conan Doyle was a big popular guy,

213
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,040
 and he started doing it in a court of honor.

214
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,080
 - Yeah, skiing by night doesn't sound particularly safe, does it?

215
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,480
 - No, I guess that's why people mock them.

216
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,880
 - But that's where the very brightly coloured ski wear began.

217
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
 - Yeah.

218
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,520
 - Okay, so one really fun thing.

219
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,240
 This is a lot of my facts are from a book called Swiss Watching,

220
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,000
 I read last year, which is really good.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,480
 So if you're into Switzerland, I recommend you read it.

222
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,400
 In Switzerland, people tend to rent their graves

223
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,120
 for about 20 or 25 years, rather than buying them,

224
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
 and then the spaces used again.

225
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,600
 And all the old headstones are broken up to make gravel.

226
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,280
 But the idea is there's so little space,

227
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,840
 'cause Switzerland is so mountainous, there's almost no flat space,

228
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,840
 and when there's a limited amount of space

229
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,960
 for people to die in, basically.

230
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,920
 - And there's youth in Asia's legal.

231
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,240
 They're dropping like flies, so...

232
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,400
 - They should do like they do in Tibet,

233
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,800
 just put their bodies up at the top of their mountains

234
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
 and let the birds eat them.

235
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,280
 - That's gonna traumatise the skiers.

236
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:03,560
 - Well, Swiss celebrity is a six-legged calf called Lily,

237
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,400
 who I would urge everyone to look up, 'cause she's...

238
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
 - Well, Lily the calf, go.

239
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,400
 - Yes, so we're just two extra legs hanging off her back.

240
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,080
 - And she's a celebrity, you say.

241
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,280
 - Yeah, they don't have a lot going for them.

242
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,920
 - No, well, which program does she...

243
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,240
 - I think she hosts a 10 o'clock news, really, yeah.

244
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,760
 - Either they don't have many celebrities,

245
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,440
 or they've got so many that literally even a six-legged cow

246
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,040
 can achieve fame.

247
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,080
 - All right, I'm a celebrity, get these legs on me.

248
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,920
 - For the animal welfare, it's this brilliant fact

249
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,000
 that you aren't allowed to keep a solitary guinea pig

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,040
 in Switzerland.

251
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,840
 - Oh. - You have to give it a friend.

252
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,120
 If you're a guinea pig, dies.

253
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,040
 You're two. You can rent one.

254
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,480
 If you mate, so you're one.

255
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,520
 - We're coming out to full-time now,

256
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,360
 so any extra facts that you want to get them in?

257
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,800
 Get them in now.

258
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,600
 - In 1474, a rooster in Switzerland

259
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,520
 was prosecuted by law in the city of Basel for laying an egg.

260
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,600
 Because obviously roosters can't lay eggs.

261
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,040
 Now, in modern interpretation, might say,

262
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
 it was actually a chicken that had been passing for a rooster.

263
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,920
 But the animal was sentenced in a solemn judicial proceeding

264
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,600
 and condemned to be burned alive

265
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,240
 for the heinous and unnatural crime of laying an egg.

266
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,800
 The execution took place, according to eyewitness accounts,

267
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,120
 with as great solemnity as it would have been observed

268
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,040
 in consigning a heretic to the flames

269
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,520
 and was witnessed by an immense crowd of townsman and peasants.

270
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
 - It was witnessed by a great number of peasants

271
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,960
 who were cooking vegetables at the same time.

272
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,960
 - Pravee, preparing a white wine sauce.

273
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,640
 - That's the final whistle, so now it's time for the answers

274
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,240
 to our mid-match quiz brought to you by visit england.com

275
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
 and your question was first.

276
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,640
 - So, my question was the Mayans use cocoa beans as currency

277
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
 so they didn't have coins.

278
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,240
 And it took two cocoa beans for a pumpkin.

279
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,000
 How many for a rabbit?

280
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,320
 - It'll be 10 cocoa beans to buy a rabbit.

281
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,960
 - Although legally, in the Mayan culture,

282
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,200
 I think you had to buy two rabbits by law.

283
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,320
 - So that is the 20s.

284
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,760
 - So it's always got a new 20s.

285
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,800
 - Wow, great fact.

286
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,080
 You're in the Capri's world.

287
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
 - Capri world, next long place.

288
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,680
 - James, my question was in old Cheshire,

289
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,880
 what did the word "sparrow farts" mean?

290
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,600
 And it meant very early in the morning.

291
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,880
 - Yeah, you would be up with the sparrow farts.

292
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,680
 - Nice. - Anna?

293
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,800
 - My question was in World War II,

294
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,160
 what did MI6 use human semen for?

295
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,520
 And they used it, well, I guess one of the functions it had

296
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,720
 was to be used as invisible ink for transmitting letters.

297
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,080
 Yes, it is so.

298
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,560
 - God, even Fleming didn't write that up in the James Conberg stiny.

299
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,240
 Bond dipped his quail into the ink well.

300
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,200
 Okay, there are your answers.

301
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,280

306
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,280
 to Anna, Anna, who wins?

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,000
 - I am going to go with Switzerland,

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 because don't want my bankier being shut down.

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
 - Excellent.

310
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
 Okay, that's everything from today.

311
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,240
 We hope you've enjoyed listening.

312
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,760
 If you'd like to get hold of any of us,

313
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,480
 you can do so on Twitter and is on...

314
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
 - I'm Miller_Anne.

315
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,080
 - James is at Headshaped.

316
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
 - I'm at Andrew Hunter M.

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,920
 Anna is still not on Twitter,

318
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,840
 but if you want to...

319
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,280
 - If you want, you can tweet @quikipedia and I'll reply to you there.

320
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,600
 - Okay, we have another match coming up tomorrow,

321
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
 which is James.

322
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,480
 - That will be Nigeria versus Bosnia and Herzegovina.

323
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,960
 - Well, one against two, all right.

324
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,200
 Hope you've enjoyed listening.

325
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,760
 Thanks very much, Antunim, for another one of these tomorrow.
