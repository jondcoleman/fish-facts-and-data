00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680
 Hello and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing as a Fish Presents International Factbowl"

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.800
 brought to you by the QIELS in association with visitingland.com

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.960
 My name's Andy and I'm here with three of the QIELS.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.200
 They are in no particular order, Anna, James and Anne.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.480
 And today's match is a humdinger, it's going to be Italy versus Switzerland.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000
 So, there's the whistle, interesting facts about Italy. Take it away.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.760
 I love the fact that in Italy they have a word for the Act symbol,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.280
 which we kind of don't want, it's commonly used, and their word is "Tiocchiola",

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.200
 which means snail, because obviously it looks like a snail.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.200
 - That is very good. - It's nice.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.040
 And paparazzi, the word paparazzi, you guys know what that means in Italian?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.080
 - Is it buzzing insect? - Yeah, it's buzzing mosquito.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.840
 - It's from La Dolceviacita, isn't it? - Yeah, it's named after the paparazzi character.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.040
 - Turumasu means "pick me up". - Yes.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.320
 - Susie, you're right, she lunches, she gets you through there.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.960
 - If you want to pick me up, yeah.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.840
 I read that confetti, obviously it's in Italian sounding world,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.760
 but it was also invented in Italy, but it was originally candid spices

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.520
 and Italian families would throw it from their balconies to the crowds below.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.160
 - Oh, that's cool. - That's good, yeah.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.240
 A 10% of all food stolen in Italy is parmesan cheese. Wow.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.320
 - It is pretty pricey.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 When McDonald's first opened in Italy,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.200
 they opened in Roman 1986, and everyone was furious.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.320
 And the designer Valentino tried to close it down, because it was too noisy,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 and there was an unbearable smell of fried fruit fouling the air.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.840
 - That's great. - What? That doesn't sound like McDonald's, I know.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.240
 - I read the grand opening of their McDonald's.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.000
 People stood outside handing out pasta.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.760
 - Yes, it is what... - There was a traditional Italian food

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.160
 and they said, "This is what you should be eating, none of these burgers."

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.800
 - Even now, they don't want foreign food coming into Italy.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.560
 There was a politician called...

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.120
 I don't know what his first name was, I think, is Mr. Zaya.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.960
 And he was trying to stop all foreign food from coming in,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.040
 and someone asked him, "Have you ever eaten a cabab?"

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.720
 And he said, "No, and I defy anyone to prove the contrary."

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.720
 I prefer the dishes of my native Veneto, and I even refuse to eat a pineapple.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.880
 - Wow. - That is great.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.280
 - Yeah, pineapple pizza. - Pineapple pizza. - Oh, yeah.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.280
 - And the other thing, tomatoes are native to Italy, are they?

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.560
 - Well, pasta isn't a traditional Italian dish at all.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.480
 It was brought over by the Arabs in the 13th century, wasn't it?

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.040
 And they adopted it as their own.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.200
 But it used to be eaten with honey and sugar.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200
 Before the 17th, 18th century, pasta wasn't eaten with tomato sauce.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.520
 It was dipped in honey and sugar. - Oh, I don't want to try that.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.800
 - Mussolini wanted all Italians to eat rice, not pasta.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160
 And he had a national day for rice.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.400
 And there was the national rice board, which brought free bags of rice to people.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.640
 And it really wanted to encourage them, so they could be self-sufficient.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.280
 - Do they also have a national cheese board? - Very good.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.200
 My favorite kind of Italian pasta is strasopretti,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.640
 which are these little things which I think they look like corn.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.800
 And the literal translation for strasopretti is priest stranglers.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.960
 - Not cool. - Didn't chew a batter mean slipper?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.600
 - Yes, it does. - And it was invented really recently, as well.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.080
 - Yeah, 1982. - 1982, yeah.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.040
 - My favorite Italian food fact is actually also a football fact.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 Maybe it's not allowed. - No, I love it.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.400
 - We average about one football fact per podcast, so I don't worry about that.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400
 - Okay, can I claim this week's?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.240
 There was a football match.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.840
 It was Scotland versus Italy.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.960
 And the Scotland fans chanted, "We're going to deep fry your pizzas."

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.440
 - Speaking about football chants, there was a match.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 It was nappily against Verona.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.720
 And the Verona fans were singing, "We hope that Vesuvius goes off."

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.480
 And the nappily fans were singing "Juliette is a whore."

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.000
 - Wow. Wow.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.520
 - Okay, I have a question for you.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.440
 Name something that happened in Italy between the 5th and 14th of October 1542.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360
 - A new Pope. - No.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.440
 - Was Leonardo da Vinci died? - Nothing.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.160
 - Did they have a calendar jump and they switched their days?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160
 - Exactly, nothing happened.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.360
 Nothing happened between the 5th and the 14th of October in that year.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.000
 Pope Gregory ordered that those days should not happen

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 so that they can make up for previously inaccurate calendars

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.720
 and get with the program.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.080
 - Do you know where the easiest place to get cocaine in Italy is?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.560
 - Yes, but I cannot tell you on this podcast,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.200
 because the next time I go, it'll be swamped.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.720
 - No, the easiest place is the air.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.480
 Researchers have tested the air in Rome

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 and found that there are traces of cocaine,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.640
 also cannabis, nicotine and caffeine.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.440
 - He's walking around with your mouth open, like a bear trying to catch that.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.440
 - And the cocaine just jumps in.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.480
 - The mafia is still very dominant, isn't it, in Italy?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.880
 I think 80% of small businesses in the capital of Sicily pay a pizza,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.880
 protection money? - 80%.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.080
 - 80%. It's a lot, isn't it?

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.120
 Across the whole of Southern Italy,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.160
 the mafia makes more than 20 billion a year through extortion.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.760
 - Whoa. - And Coulieroni,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.280
 Coulieroni, the town in Sicily, has got a petition to change its name

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.800
 because of the negative connotations.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.320
 - Oh, nice air. - Yeah.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.080
 - Speaking of the mafia, did you hear the terrible thing that they did last year?

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.040
 They kidnapped the world's smallest pony.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.880
 - Oh, not bad. - And not bad in someone's bed?

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.080
 - That is too far.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.320
 - They believe that a very small bet.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.040
 - It was 63 centimeters tall animal named Charlie,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.640
 and he was taken from his stall in Citadel Castello.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.680
 - Did they get him back?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.280
 - I'm not sure, actually. I couldn't find.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.680
 - If anyone knows what happened to Charlie, you can call this number.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.040
 - Charlie, if you're out there, we're not angry.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.200
 Okay, just come back. - We're just disappointed.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.920
 - Okay, that means that at halftime,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.000
 it's time for our mid-match quiz,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.680
 brought to you by VisitEngland.com.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.840
 We've got three questions relating in some way or another to England,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.840
 so who would like to go first?

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.000
 - I have one. - Yeah, Anne.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.080
 - I had a brilliant time a few weeks ago.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.920
 I went to Cadbury World in Birmingham,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.760
 and they had lots of great information,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.960
 and they had a bit about how the Mayans use cocoa beans as currency.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.320
 They didn't have coins,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.640
 so it cost two cocoa beans for a pumpkin,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.000
 but how many for a rabbit?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.920
 - Okay, Anne's is on a postcard. James?

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.240
 - Okay, my question is, in old Cheshire,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.920
 what did they mean when they said "sparrow farts"?

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.560
 - Do they mean the farts of sparrows?

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.120
 - Maybe you'll have to tune in to find out.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.440
 - I'm gonna be here. - Oh, yeah.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.320
 - Anna?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.080
 - So during World War II,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.960
 for what did MI6 use human semen?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.120
 - Oh, I thought it was most of the navy who you see.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.200
 - Very good.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.480
 - Okay, so that's the halftime quiz over,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.360
 so we will give away the answers at the end,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.520
 and now it's time for the second half of the match,

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.120
 which is Switzerland.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.440
 - Every year they have an annual Santa Claus World Championship,

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.480
 called Toe World.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.640
 - Is this our Santa Claus? It's selected.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.840
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.960
 - Is it? - Yeah, there's gonna be a channel five reality show coming soon.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.840
 - Switzerland is the only country to have enough nuclear shelters

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.280
 for its entire population.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.800
 - Wow. - Wow, yeah.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.400
 You can't name your child,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.160
 pineapple or banana or fairy tale or whatever it is

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.720
 that everyone who's famous these days names their children

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.560
 if you're in Switzerland, because you have to choose

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.640
 from them and approve a list of baby names.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:00.920
 - But the country has been neutral since about the mid-14th century.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.440
 They used to be quite an aggressive territorial expansionist power,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240
 and then they had one really unpleasant battle

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.480
 or a few battles in the 14th century.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.480
 And they said, "Right, actually, we're not doing this anymore."

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.320
 And they just formed the boundaries,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.560
 almost completely in modern Switzerland soon after that,

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.480
 and they just have not gone involved since then.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.000
 - They have had the odd little battle in between themselves,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.440
 the cantons. - Oh, yeah.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720
 - There was a battle between Zurich and Zug,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.360
 rather nicely, in 1529.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.560
 War was declared, but before any fighting could take place,

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.000
 the two teams or the two groups of soldiers sat down,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.400
 settled their differences and called off the war,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.800
 and the soldiers from both sides sat on the border

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.960
 and shared a cauldron of milk soup.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.080
 - Wow.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.160
 One thing I really like is that senior soldiers in the Swiss Army,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.320
 they have flowers instead of stars.

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.880
 I made you general who would have two stars on his epilets

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.960
 in other NATO countries,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.160
 would have two Adelweiss on his epilets in Switzerland.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.000
 - Oh, that's good. - That's awesome.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.760
 Speaking of keeping yourself to yourself,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.640
 I read about a block of flats near Zurich.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 This is for people who claim to suffer

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.880
 from hypersensitivity to chemicals

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.200
 and electromagnetic radiation,

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.160
 and there are apartments there that have been designed specifically,

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.360
 so there's no smoking, no perfume, no mobile phones,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.280
 and it's supposed to be for people who find

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:17.960
 that they're allergic to modern life.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.240
 - I might use allergic to modern life,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.000
 as my excuse for not being on Twitter hence.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.240
 - One thing I love about Switzerland

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.080
 is that the racking vac falls where Sherlock Holmes

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.680
 fell to his death are in Switzerland.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.920
 So the Sherlock Holmes society go on a pilgrimage

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.000
 to the racking vac falls where they reenact the fall,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.600
 but with dummies, not with real people.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.120
 And one thing I learned from reading about it

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.800
 was that apparently in 1910,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.520
 Sherlock Holmes books were banned from station booksellers,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.520
 because they're having a bad effect on the Swiss youth.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.400
 - What? - Apparently jumping off the falls, possibly.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.840
 - They weren't all just smoking pipes

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.280
 and wearing those funny hats.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.680
 - And solving crime in a slightly annoying way.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.240
 - Yeah, so Switzerland was where Conan Doyle,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.160
 Arthur Conan Doyle popularised skiing.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.000
 I think he'd discovered it on holiday in Norway,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.680
 and then he was in Switzerland, and he looked around

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.920
 and thought, "Look, mountains, snow.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.600
 "I know what I'm gonna do here."

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.160
 And he found two other people in Switzerland that skied,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.360
 but they could only ski by night,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.320
 because they were mocked so massively by the Swiss masses,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.840
 for doing such a weird thing.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.680
 But then Conan Doyle was a big popular guy,

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.040
 and he started doing it in a court of honor.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.080
 - Yeah, skiing by night doesn't sound particularly safe, does it?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.480
 - No, I guess that's why people mock them.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.880
 - But that's where the very brightly coloured ski wear began.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.880
 - Yeah.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.520
 - Okay, so one really fun thing.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.240
 This is a lot of my facts are from a book called Swiss Watching,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.000
 I read last year, which is really good.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.480
 So if you're into Switzerland, I recommend you read it.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.400
 In Switzerland, people tend to rent their graves

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.120
 for about 20 or 25 years, rather than buying them,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.880
 and then the spaces used again.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.600
 And all the old headstones are broken up to make gravel.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.280
 But the idea is there's so little space,

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.840
 'cause Switzerland is so mountainous, there's almost no flat space,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.840
 and when there's a limited amount of space

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.960
 for people to die in, basically.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.920
 - And there's youth in Asia's legal.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.240
 They're dropping like flies, so...

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.400
 - They should do like they do in Tibet,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.800
 just put their bodies up at the top of their mountains

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.920
 and let the birds eat them.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.280
 - That's gonna traumatise the skiers.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:03.560
 - Well, Swiss celebrity is a six-legged calf called Lily,

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.400
 who I would urge everyone to look up, 'cause she's...

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.680
 - Well, Lily the calf, go.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.400
 - Yes, so we're just two extra legs hanging off her back.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.080
 - And she's a celebrity, you say.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.280
 - Yeah, they don't have a lot going for them.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.920
 - No, well, which program does she...

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.240
 - I think she hosts a 10 o'clock news, really, yeah.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.760
 - Either they don't have many celebrities,

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.440
 or they've got so many that literally even a six-legged cow

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.040
 can achieve fame.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.080
 - All right, I'm a celebrity, get these legs on me.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.920
 - For the animal welfare, it's this brilliant fact

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.000
 that you aren't allowed to keep a solitary guinea pig

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.040
 in Switzerland.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.840
 - Oh. - You have to give it a friend.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.120
 If you're a guinea pig, dies.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.040
 You're two. You can rent one.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.480
 If you mate, so you're one.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.520
 - We're coming out to full-time now,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.360
 so any extra facts that you want to get them in?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.800
 Get them in now.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.600
 - In 1474, a rooster in Switzerland

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.520
 was prosecuted by law in the city of Basel for laying an egg.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.600
 Because obviously roosters can't lay eggs.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.040
 Now, in modern interpretation, might say,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.360
 it was actually a chicken that had been passing for a rooster.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.920
 But the animal was sentenced in a solemn judicial proceeding

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.600
 and condemned to be burned alive

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.240
 for the heinous and unnatural crime of laying an egg.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.800
 The execution took place, according to eyewitness accounts,

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.120
 with as great solemnity as it would have been observed

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.040
 in consigning a heretic to the flames

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.520
 and was witnessed by an immense crowd of townsman and peasants.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.520
 - It was witnessed by a great number of peasants

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.960
 who were cooking vegetables at the same time.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.960
 - Pravee, preparing a white wine sauce.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:25.640
 - That's the final whistle, so now it's time for the answers

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.240
 to our mid-match quiz brought to you by visit england.com

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.840
 and your question was first.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.640
 - So, my question was the Mayans use cocoa beans as currency

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.680
 so they didn't have coins.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.240
 And it took two cocoa beans for a pumpkin.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.000
 How many for a rabbit?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.320
 - It'll be 10 cocoa beans to buy a rabbit.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.960
 - Although legally, in the Mayan culture,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.200
 I think you had to buy two rabbits by law.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.320
 - So that is the 20s.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.760
 - So it's always got a new 20s.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.800
 - Wow, great fact.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.080
 You're in the Capri's world.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.160
 - Capri world, next long place.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.680
 - James, my question was in old Cheshire,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.880
 what did the word "sparrow farts" mean?

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.600
 And it meant very early in the morning.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.880
 - Yeah, you would be up with the sparrow farts.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.680
 - Nice. - Anna?

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.800
 - My question was in World War II,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.160
 what did MI6 use human semen for?

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.520
 And they used it, well, I guess one of the functions it had

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:19.720
 was to be used as invisible ink for transmitting letters.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.080
 Yes, it is so.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.560
 - God, even Fleming didn't write that up in the James Conberg stiny.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.240
 Bond dipped his quail into the ink well.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.200
 Okay, there are your answers.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.280

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.280
 to Anna, Anna, who wins?

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.000
 - I am going to go with Switzerland,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
 because don't want my bankier being shut down.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.880
 - Excellent.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.880
 Okay, that's everything from today.

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.240
 We hope you've enjoyed listening.

 you can do so on Twitter and is on...

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.240
 - I'm Miller_Anne.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.080
 - James is at Headshaped.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.000
 - I'm at Andrew Hunter M.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.920
 Anna is still not on Twitter,

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.840
 but if you want to...

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:14.280

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.640
 which is James.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.480
 - That will be Nigeria versus Bosnia and Herzegovina.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.960
 - Well, one against two, all right.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.200
 Hope you've enjoyed listening.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.760
 Thanks very much, Antunim, for another one of these tomorrow.
