 Hello, and welcome to another episode of "No Such Thing"

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming to you live from Boston!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber, and I am sitting here with Anitrasinski, Andrew Huntson Murray, and James Harkin.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days, and in no particular order, here, we go!

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Starting with fact number one, and that is my fact.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And just before you start, fact number one, we actually played a little bit of the stars and stripes, theme tune, theme tune.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 [laughter]

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 As I believe you call it.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 [laughter]

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Okay, the National Anthem.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 [laughter]

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 We actually got a sent effect before the show on this subject by Gadget Gav, who said that if in Boston,

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 but singing or playing the National Anthem, you have to then go on with it all the way to the end on pain of a hundred dollar fine.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 [laughter]

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So, if you wouldn't mind just...

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 [laughter]

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [laughter]

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 As far as I know the lyrics.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Great theme tune though, guys, honestly.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 [laughter]

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number one, and that is my fact, my fact this week, is that the first criminal in Boston to be sent to the stocks,

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 was the man who'd actually built the stocks.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 [laughter]

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And he was found guilty of overcharging for the building of those stocks.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 [laughter]

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 This is a wonderful fact.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 This was back in 1639, and it was a guy called Edward Palmer, and it's exactly as the factors on the tin.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 It's a guy who did the labor and went and went to input.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 He invoiced for £1, 13 shillings and £7, and they thought that was unacceptable.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 So, immediately once it was open, he was the first person charged.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 He got £5 as well, didn't he?

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So he got £3 times more than he charged for them.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Yeah, and so he had to go and be put in the stocks for it was an hour.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 So just a quick humiliation and then a serious amount of money to...

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 At least he hadn't been charged to build, you know, a guillotine or something.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Yes, he must have been grateful for that.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Look, did he make actual stocks or a pillory?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Because there's been a lot of confusion about this for 500 years.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 So they were stocks, I believe they were stocks?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 They were stocks, okay, because pillory was the one where...

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I think you should get taught in primary school, they're what stocks are.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Where you shove your arms through two holes and you shove your head through a hole.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Like when you're taking those comical photos with cardboard cutouts.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And that was actually a pillory, whereas stocks is more like...

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Just had your ankles often like strapped to the ground or something, didn't you?

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Yeah, it was just you put your feet in.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Or you just put your feet in.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Yeah, and the idea is that as well as being a humiliation, the public will see what you look like.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 So they've walked past the God, that's a bad guy.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 But actually small boys would walk past and tickle the feet of people in the stocks.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Oh, really?

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 That's pretty brave, because the people in there are criminals.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That's in your neighbourhood.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Yeah, that's true.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And they're probably out in an hour, so...

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 But the thing is, it's like it was for quite minor things usually, the stock.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 So in England, for instance, it would be for petty thieves, for unruly servants, for hedge terrors.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Don't know what a hedge terrors, yeah.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Gambler's drunkards, ballad singers.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Seemed harsh.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Yeah, and any kind of travelling musicians.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 They were way harsh. I mean, they were minor crimes, but they were police quite heavily.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 So there is a great book called Curious Punishments of Bygone Days,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 which is published in the late 19th century, and it's got all kinds of now hilarious stories of quite a repressive sounding time.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So again, in Boston, there was a man called Captain Campbell, who was a sailor,

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 and he got done for publicly kissing his wife on a Sunday after returning from three years at sea.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 No, thank you.

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Now, in his punishment, I think I've mistyped it.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 I have written punishment was three years in the stock. I think it was three hours.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Imagine if he was in for three years and they came out and they kissed his wife again.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I was like, sorry.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Yeah, because sometimes the things people threw at you in the stocks were even worse than having your feet tickled.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 I'm very confused that you think that was a bad thing to do is tickle the feet of someone passing by.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Because often you've got dead animals thrown at you.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Dead cat was a good one.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 In fact, I think there was a quote from someone at the time who said,

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 "It's someone in the stock, you walk past the marketplace of an evening,

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 and someone in the stock, you think brilliant, and a dead cat is a treat if you can spot one of them,

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 and a live cat, and even greater treat."

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 But that book is incredible, actually.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So there are a few other good tales of bygone punishments in this book written in 1886.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 And another one is about a, it tells a man in Moscow, actually, in the 17th century,

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 who'd published a pamphlet about people's liberties that the people should be free.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 And so he'd gotten a lot of job of saying that.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 And so he was sentenced to three days of being tied to a scaffold and forced to literally eat his words.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 So they got his pamphlet, it's actually very clever.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 They got his pamphlet and they tore it up and they fed it to him.

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 And there was an eyewitness account that said they'd serve him one page at a time.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And when it got to a stage where it looked like he might actually be incredibly ill,

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 they'd wait until the next day, and then keep serving it up.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So they didn't cook it at all?

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 It's actually a misconception you can get food poisoning from rural pamphlet.

101
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But thank goodness Russia is now a paragon of liberty.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 Also in Boston, we were talking about Boston stuff.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 In 1679, there was a Frenchman who was suspected of setting a fire in Boston.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And he was ordered to go to the pillory and have both his ears cut off for suspected arson.

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 That's amazing. But there's quite a lot of history isn't there in Boston,

106
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 especially compared to the rest of America.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Because Dan and I were walking through Cambridge yesterday.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 Dan appointed to a quite new-looking building and he said, "You know what?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 I can't believe that building was built in 1588."

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 And I said, "No, Dan, that is a street number at that house."

111
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 I really, I was suspicious. I was like, "This brickwork looks good."

112
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 Yeah, the next one was built in 1592.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Whipping? Whipping was a thing.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Just to drag us back to the topic at hand.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 There was one. Obviously, whipping was absolutely huge.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 Major League punishment. Very big back then.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So in one case of whipping, the man carrying it out was a church official called the Church Beedle.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 And he wasn't doing a very good job of it.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 He was so light-handed that the sheriff, who was watching the whipping, the punishment take place,

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 grabbed the whip from him, whipped the offenders.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 But not before he had whipped the beetle himself for being bad at whipping.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 That was an offense at the time.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Well, I actually read about that story as well.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 So what had happened was the beetle was almost pretending to whip him.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 And he had like some red ink in his hand.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 And he kind of went like that and then he would smear the red ink.

127
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 So he looked like he'd been whipped on the back when he hadn't really.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I think the guy might have paid him some money to do that.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And then like you say, the constable then started whipping the beetle.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 But then a lady came and started beating up the constable.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Wow.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Four people attacking each other in an awful violent conge.

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 It's weird, isn't it?

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 I was looking into the police boards here.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So this fact was 1639.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 And it was in 1630, the sort of foundations of the first ever American police force came about.

137
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 So it was a night watch and so on.

138
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 And it was only in the 1800s, 1833 that it sort of became officially Boston police.

139
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 But am I right saying police badges have 1630 written on them?

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 We have no idea in this audience.

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 Very Laura Biden audience.

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Very Laura Biden audience.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 No one wants to admit to anything.

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 No, but so yeah, so they had that.

145
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 And what happens really fun fact about them in 1903, the Boston police force got the first ever police car of anywhere in America.

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 But no one knew how to drive it.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 So they had to hire a chauffeur.

148
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 We would take them to all the crime spots.

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 The whole transport system with the Boston police.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 A couple years ago, they added to their fleet a ice cream truck.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 It's a part of, there's a ice cream truck which is run by the police.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 What for?

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 They think it's sort of if they go around, you know, maybe if the criminal doesn't want to come out, because they're around.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 Oh, sure.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 They're not luring criminals out with Mr. Whippies.

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 That doesn't make any sense.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 Because you just have a queue of small child, small child, small child, massive criminal.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And then presumably it's someone in a policeman's hat and badge, cackhandedly trying to scoop some ice cream.

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Yeah.

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Holy cow, scoop.

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Please.

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 Oh, wait.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I don't need your pity plan.

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 We're going to have to move on fairly soon to our next fact.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Just a thing about putting people in the stock specifically in Boston and in New England.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 They just got way more into it than the English have been so they brought it over from England when they came.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And then, because they were puritan and everything, they added a whole bunch of other crimes, basically.

168
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 So in Britain and in England, then usually you went in the stock to be stole something.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 But in Boston, it really did tend to be that if you blaspheme, then you always got it.

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Again, if you publicly kissed your wife, then you got it.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 If you're an adultery, you got it. And we used to have that in Britain, you'd have a big A branded on you.

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 So sometimes you'd be in the stocks and if you've been found guilty of adultery, then you'd have a big A that was branded on you.

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 And you'd have to wear it on your shirt and you'd have to wear that A for, say, a year.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And then everyone knows you're an adulterer.

175
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 Which I don't know if that's a punishment for a certain type of person.

176
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 That's what Alvin the Chipman cat on is.

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 He was a terrible husband. He was a terrible terrible husband.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 They don't bring that storyline into it much, but we know.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 Anyway, the Americans added all the other letters.

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 So they went through the alphabet, so you've got a B if you were blasphemous.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 You've got a D for drunkenness, not allowed to be drunk, ever. You've gone I for incest.

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Very bad, not into that. And they sort of did.

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Wow. They completed the alphabet with all the various different crimes.

184
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 They must have struggled a bit with X and Z.

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 They had to get rid of you.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Zebra theft.

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 It is time for fact number two and that is Andy.

188
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Fact is that five of the main types of French baguette are called flute, ficelle, veanise,

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 somenteen, and bastard.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 So...

191
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I know the way you said that half of the French act.

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 This was from a great article in the Financial Times about the best baguette in Paris competition,

193
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 which is called Le Grand Prix de la Baguette.

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 And these are some of the types they have and it's an amazing competition.

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 It's held at the National Syndicate de Boulanger.

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And there are so many entries for the competition every year.

197
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 They get hundreds of entries.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Over a thousand members of the public apply to judge because you get a kind of citizen judge on the panel.

199
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 And the winner, it's mostly a prestige thing. So you get 4,000 euros, you get a small-ish cash prize.

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 But you also win the right to provide the president's baguette for a year.

201
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Oh wow, yeah.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 It's very prestigious.

203
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I don't think that's quite a lot of pressure on the president.

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 I feel like Macron every day, because it's every day, isn't it?

205
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 You make your forget at the morning and it gets immediately, you know, a police god of takes it to the...

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 With the chauffeur, yeah.

207
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Takes it to the palace and poor Emmanuel is probably going another fucking baguette.

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 But do you think every morning you have to make the show?

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Oh my goodness, you're best forget yet.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 I'm not sure they're that good either, because I was reading that as I know, fast me.

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 I was reading that as part of this Grand Prix.

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 The first of whom you have to jump through is it has to be the correct length.

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 And I think it's correct length and weight.

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 And there are 200 entrants and a hundred of them fail at the length and weight section.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 It does feel like there's a communication problem with the rules.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Well, they have to be exactly between 55 centimetres and 70 centimetres, right?

217
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Yeah, which is quite a large margin of error.

218
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 And the weight has to be between 250 grams and 300 grams.

219
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 And the impossible precision is this.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 But like traditional French forgets, like in the 19th century, they were like eight metres long, were they?

221
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 Like eight.

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 No, eight feet long.

223
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Eight feet long.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 But you get them, like they were bigger than humans are.

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 Wow.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Definitely.

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Bigger than French humans, certainly.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 In fairness to the French, there's not many nationalities where everyone's tall of the eight fucks.

229
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 I didn't know that we got in the French for being short.

230
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 I think you're thinking Napoleon, aren't you?

231
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Yeah, yeah.

232
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And we said before that Napoleon was above average height for a French when he was taller than Nelson.

233
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It didn't work on a number of levels to do.

234
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Well, speaking of Napoleon, actually, there is a theory, which I should just say at the very top is not true.

235
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 But he was nine feet tall.

236
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 There is a theory that the Begett was invented by Napoleon's bakers, and they're invented so that soldiers could put them down their legs while marching.

237
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And then whenever they got to wherever they were marching to, then they could pull them out and eat them.

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 All right.

239
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 I have to say you've had an unnecessarily sexual dimension to this theory.

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 It's hung like a Begett.

241
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I've got a bit of a yeast infection down there.

242
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Well, hey, this is a cool thing.

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 So in France, Begett is not just used to refer to sticks of bread, but, for example, like chopsticks are Begett.

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 She knows.

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 She knows?

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Sure.

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 She knows.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 No, but my favorite one is that a wand is Begett Magique.

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And so in the Harry Potter books, he's always pulling out his Begett Magique.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 Which, it does sound a bit Napoleonic, doesn't it?

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 There's an expression in French to lead by the Begett.

252
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And that is because a Begett is also a baton.

253
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 So it's like walking with a marching band you lead with your Begett.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 It can be a ramrod.

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It can be a type of diamond cut.

256
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 What's funny about ramrod buster?

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 It's an old war of independence joke.

258
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 There's something down to the word to a huge number of meanings, given it's only been around for a century.

259
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Well, it's just a much smaller language than the English language.

260
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 It genuinely is smaller.

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 There are fewer words.

262
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And this is not just another Napoleon.

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 I believe short.

264
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 The words are short.

265
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And the word precedes the bread.

266
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Yes.

267
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 In fact, it comes from the Latin word "baculum," which meant staff.

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 And the baculum, as some of you know, is a penis bone in, you know,

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 warruses and chimpanzees.

270
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And lots of animals have penis bones.

271
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 I love the way that you said, and the baculum is,

272
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and then a few people in the audience went, "Penas, hello."

273
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Like, is your catchphrase, I said, isn't it?

274
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 It's like a really weird pantomime.

275
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I understand you don't have pantomimes here.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I've read it and made sense.

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Yes, you do.

278
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Oh.

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 It's stunning.

280
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 There's another theory about where it came from.

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 It came from where the word came from, which is that it was invented just over a hundred years ago

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 when the Paris Metro was being dug, the Paris Underground System, because apparently workers were carrying big loaves of bread to work.

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 And they needed to bring knives with them to cut it, and they used to keep getting into constant knife battles.

284
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 And so, apparently the builders were tasked with finding a baker who could give them some bread that didn't require a knife.

285
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 And I don't know what kind of bathroom you can get into with a little button.

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 This bread knife could be quite dodgy, if you get it on the serrated edge.

287
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Definitely.

288
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 But that's not a Frenchman, they look enormous those knives.

289
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Yeah, it is weird.

290
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 They were not named in print until 1920.

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 So, there were sort of long breads before.

292
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But there is a load of bread legislation in France at the moment.

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So, in 1993, even as recently as that, they passed a bread decree because they were worried about deterioration of quality of bread.

294
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And so, now, you can get two very different kinds of loaf.

295
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 I think very different.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 They are both stick French breads.

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 But one of them is a baguette tradition of Francees, which is of the very significant national historical one.

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And you have to make that on the premises.

299
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You can only use about three ingredients. You know, it's really precise. You can't put extra additives or toppings or anything.

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And the alternative is just a baguette.

301
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Did you explain why they're called bastards?

302
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 I didn't actually.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 So, they're mostly named after their shapes.

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 So, the flute is thin. The ficelle is very thin.

305
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 The bastard is fat.

306
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 So...

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 I think the idea is that it's kind of halfway between a long, thick one and a short, stubby one.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 And so, it's like two things cobbled together so it's like a bastard in that way.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 And is that where we get you, that bastard?

310
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 I don't think it is.

311
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 To be investigated?

312
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 To shame, that's not Harry Potter books.

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Harry pull that as bastard.

314
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 There's some more bread legislation in France, which is very weird.

315
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And it changed recently, actually.

316
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So, there was this widespread panic in 2015, four years ago, because they dropped a law that existed since 1790,

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 which is basically when the government ruled that everyone across France had to have access to baguettes at all times of the year every day.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Every day and night.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 And so, it required half of Paris's bakeries to take holiday in August and the other half to take holiday in July to ensure that suddenly there wasn't a bit of a death of bakers and people couldn't get their bread in the morning.

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 And that has remained until 2015.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 So, bakers are in this position where, you know, if 50% were already on holiday on the second of July, they're not allowed to take holiday for a month.

322
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 And they were finally told that these laws were relaxed and they were finally told, OK, you can go on holiday when you like, on the condition that you have to put up in your window,

323
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I think you have to put up a sign saying where the nearest baker is still there selling baguette.

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 There was panic.

325
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 Did anything happen? Did they all run out of bread in the morning?

326
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 All of France starved to death.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Can you guys guess, just give me a guess of the longest, the length of the longest baguette ever made.

328
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I would have said probably around 10 feet.

329
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 10 feet, OK. Any advance?

330
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 200 metres.

331
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Wow, this is going to be impressive now, Andy.

332
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Well, his knock stands completely ruined it.

333
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 It was an amazingly long bread until Dan said 200 metres.

334
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 It was a pathetic 122 metres long, which is literally half of what Dan said.

335
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 No, don't clap a bread that long. That's rubbish.

336
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Ah, you're absolutely a saboteur.

337
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 I had all sorts of extra stuff about this weird bread.

338
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I know what you're all thinking. How do you make a bread that's 122 metres long?

339
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 Do you get one that's 200 metres long and cut it half?

340
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 Anyway, we do not.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 No, absolutely baguette. I will not have that.

342
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You know after you've finished talking about this, I'm going to tell you it's wrong anyway.

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Oh, wow.

344
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 OK, well, can I please tell you first?

345
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Because, oh my god, it was in 2015, it was at the Milan World Expo, there were 60 bakers involved,

346
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 and how did they make it 120 metres long?

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 They made a portable oven which slid all the way along.

348
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 That is impressive.

349
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 And then they cut it into and they spread Nutella all the way along it,

350
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 because Nutella was sponsoring this attempt.

351
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 That's true, they did do that, but that's not the longest baguette ever.

352
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 The record was broken this year, I'm afraid.

353
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Yeah, how long?

354
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 Was it five million miles?

355
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 It wasn't actually.

356
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 It was 133 metres, and it was done to raise money for the Italian Red Cross,

357
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 so you've just ridiculed by a ridiculous guess.

358
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 Sorry, I'm very sorry.

359
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 OK, it is time for fact number three, and that is Chisinski.

360
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 My fight this week is that Whitney Houston's record label once sent a cease and desist letter to Saddam Hussein.

361
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Asking him to please stop using the song, I will always love you as part of his political campaign.

362
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And yes, it's risky to kick off the Saddam Hussein fact in the American tour,

363
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 but it was a song that he used.

364
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 This was in 2002 and he was running for president against nobody.

365
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 It was sort of leaked in the Western media that he'd been using as a political campaign song,

366
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 this Arabic version, which is basically a novel version, exactly sort of verbatim,

367
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 and exactly the same nuances and sounds as Whitney Houston's song.

368
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 I will always love you, and so her record company, Arista Records, got in touch and said,

369
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 "Please stop doing that."

370
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 And surprising enough, I don't think he took a blind bit of notice.

371
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 But yeah, how weird is that?

372
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 He did very well in that election.

373
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 He got genuinely 100% of the vote.

374
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Because normally I was reading an article about how dictators like to pitch it.

375
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Are you modest? Do you just get 90? Do you go all in and you get 100 or do say around 95?

376
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Actually, in the course of this, I found out the most impressive result of all time in any election,

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and that was in 1927 in Liberia, in the country at the time,

378
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 there were 15,000 registered voters, the winner, Charles King, won 243,000 votes.

379
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Turnout was 1,680%, and he was given a Guinness World Record for fraud.

380
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 And so that song got, of course, made famous by Whitney Houston, but actually,

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Dolly Parson, originally. And she made an absolute fortune on the song from when Whitney Houston released it.

382
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 But then they asked her about this thing with Saddam Hussein, and she said,

383
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "I was surprised as anyone, but it's too serious an issue to comment on."

384
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 Not for us, guys.

385
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Saddam Hussein was asshole, I think we can all agree.

386
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 But in 1980, he was given the keys to the City of Detroit.

387
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 This was when he was still, you know, very much in the good books of the USA,

388
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 and he had made a big donation to a Detroit church.

389
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 And I read an article about it which said that he still had them, you know, even to the end.

390
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 But other key holders, they weren't on him right at the end.

391
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I mean, he's not trying to get into his bunker going fucking Detroit.

392
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 No. But other people who are key holders to the City of Detroit include Santa Claus,

393
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Stevie Wonder, and Elmo.

394
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 What a group photo.

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 We should, at some point I think we should move away from Saddam Hussein.

396
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 So just something about campaign songs.

397
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 America does a very good line in cool campaign songs for your presidential campaigns.

398
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 It's almost the highlight of your presidential campaigns.

399
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 But I like Bob Dole, so do you know what Bob Dole chose in 1996 when he ran against Clinton?

400
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 So he used the song Soulman, as in written by Isaac Hayes, David Porter in the 60s,

401
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 a big kind of civil rights anthem, Isaac Hayes.

402
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 So it was the voice of Chef in South Park as well.

403
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 So it's a big civil rights African American anthem, and he used it, but he changed the lyrics to Doleman.

404
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Incredible. Not only did it perform by Sam and Dave, like a duo, sang it, and Sam actually re-recorded it.

405
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 How ignominious is that with the lyrics Doleman?

406
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 So he changed the lyrics, he sang it a bit, then the writers got in touch and said, "We really don't endorse you at all.

407
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 You're nothing to do with the song, please go away."

408
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 Man, also it didn't work at all anyway, because it sounded either like a Doleman or Soulman.

409
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 But he sang it.

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 They do like the puns, don't they? In the campaign slogans, there's been loads of good ones.

411
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Oh, well, good.

412
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 So you were seized as Grant, said Grant was another term.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 Thomas E. Jewey, when he was up against Roosevelt, said, "Jewey or don't we?"

414
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 Did he win?

415
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 No, Thomas said, "Yeah, he famously was a president of America."

416
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 No, of course he didn't win.

417
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 There was Alfred Landon, who was up against FDR, and he said, "Let's make it a London slide."

418
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Very good.

419
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 It's funny, because all these people were on the losing side, weren't they?

420
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Okay, here's someone who's under winning side, Franklin Pierce.

421
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 He said, "We poked you in '44. We shall pierce you in '52."

422
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Wow.

423
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And then...

424
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Everybody was another time, wasn't it?

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And then, four years later, James Buchanan came in, and he said, "We poked him in '44.

426
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 We pierced him in '52, and we'll buck him in '56."

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Amazing.

428
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 There was another one.

429
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 It's Stephen Douglas, another famous US president, not.

430
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 So he ran against Lincoln, and he had a song written, or he wrote a song,

431
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 which I don't know what the tune was, but it was about kind of how...

432
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 People were always going on about how Lincoln was this kind of saint.

433
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 It was like, "Tell us how great he is, how he seeks his closet every night to kneel and pray.

434
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 Any lie you tell will swallow, swallow any kind of mixture.

435
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 But don't we beg and pray you, don't for God's sake show his picture?

436
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Because he was so ugly."

437
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 Oh, really?

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I know, right?

439
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 And now, we think of him as quite a noble looking character, but apparently back in the day.

440
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 Make it hot.

441
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 He was eight feet tall.

442
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 Only with the hat done.

443
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 You don't know what happened when you take the hat off, it might have been a really tall phone.

444
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Yeah, he could fit an entire Frenchman under that hat, because of the thing.

445
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 The George W. Bush, he relied on Tom Petty's single "I Won't Back Down" during his 2000 campaign.

446
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 He then got a cease and desist letter from Tom Petty and immediately back down.

447
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 Amazing.

448
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 I could say there's a good sort of argument that you should not get into politics,

449
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 because when you do, you just find out that all your heroes hate you.

450
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 Well, it's really, so this is the thing.

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 So there are all these stories about musicians complaining, but basically,

452
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 if you're playing at a venue which has a public music license,

453
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 you can play their songs, basically.

454
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 So, I mean, this happens lots and lots.

455
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 And we should say it.

456
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 So people who have asked Donald Trump to stop using their song

457
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 or declined his, you know, to, said, "Please, please, don't play that."

458
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 Have included Neil Young, R.E.M., Twisted Sister, Adele, Elton John,

459
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 The Rolling Stones, Queen, George Dead, George Harrison's estate,

460
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Dead Pavarotti's estate, Steven Tyler Verosmith, Dead Prince's estate,

461
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Farrell, Rihanna, Guns and Roses, and Neil Young again.

462
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I'm interested that Neil Young is the one who they went back to twice.

463
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Do you think he was the one they thought, "Okay, who was sort of the, like, the least against us?"

464
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 We're going to have to move on to our final factor, shortly.

465
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 Oh, on political songs.

466
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 So when America first became independent, they kind of took God Save the Queen,

467
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 God Save the King, and they just added their own lyrics.

468
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So they had God Save Great Washington, God Save the 13 States, God Save America,

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 but it was all to the same tune as God Save the King,

470
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 until they stuck on their fiend tune that they have now.

471
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

472
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Okay, my fact this week is that in 1898, a Boston magazine

473
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 described the game of Croquet as a source of slumbering depravity

474
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 and veritable Frankenstein monster of recreation.

475
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 And we've got a lot of depraved people in tonight.

476
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 So basically, when like Croquet was quite an elitist sport in the UK,

477
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 and then it came over to America and everyone started playing it,

478
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 it became like a game that everyone loved to play, like the whole country played it,

479
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 and it was really thought to be quite depraved.

480
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And there are a few reasons for this.

481
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 One reason was people were like gambling on it a little bit,

482
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 but another reason is because men and women played together,

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 and often when women would play the shots.

484
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Boston, are you still that pirated?

485
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 We're all going immediately into the stocks after tonight's show.

486
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 So women were deliberately shot in the dresses to play more comfortably.

487
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 As they played a shot, I know.

488
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 As they played a shot, they might lift a skirt and show a bit of ankle.

489
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 This article, it is amazing.

490
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 It's so further, you sort of think, "My god, is this person serious?"

491
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It's really... So the article that I read it in, sorry.

492
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 It's in J-Star, and it's by a historian called John Stern Gas,

493
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 and it's called Cheating Gender Rolls in the 19th century Croquet Crates.

494
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Oh, nice. And also the other thing was Croquet.

495
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 It is a devious game, because you get the... No, it is.

496
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 There's a lot of mucking around you can do with your opponent's piece.

497
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 It's like, basically, chess, but you can move the other guy's bishop.

498
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 It's mean.

499
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 It's so nothing like chess.

500
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 It is unbelievably like chess.

501
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 It is unbelievably like chess.

502
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 I will go to the wall for this.

503
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 There is a lot of tactical play.

504
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 I read somewhere saying it's a bit like chess, and I thought, what an idiot.

505
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 That's my point.

506
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 Are you reading my blog? I'm very glad.

507
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Have you ever played chess with Andy, where he comes to the mallet and just slushes a dog?

508
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 It does provoke... It's so frustrating if you're losing at Croquet,

509
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 because your opponent just uses your ball to get their ball all the way around the course.

510
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 And this article that you're quoting, the 1898 one,

511
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 and it said, it is not long before every honorable feeling,

512
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 every dictate of morality has become obliterated.

513
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 In place of our refined and upright people,

514
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 our two pairs of gruesome moral monstrosities,

515
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 the poison of Croquet eats deeper and deeper into their souls.

516
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 I know. It's really good stuff.

517
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Like, so Milton Bradley, who made these croquet sets,

518
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 they had the rules, and one of the first rules in capital letters

519
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 was keep your temper.

520
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin called it the destroyer of lifelong friendships

521
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 and a ruiner of happy homes.

522
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 The international heraldribune reported that a woman testified during a separation hearing

523
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 that her husband refused to speak to her for days after she questioned

524
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 whether his ball had really gone through the hoop.

525
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 Okay, first of all, why an earth did that get to court in the first place?

526
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 I read that. It was like the judge said that he was going to court

527
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 because the husband didn't speak to them.

528
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 It feels like there were underlying issues in that relationship.

529
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 No, but my friend, back in England,

530
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 she broke up with her boyfriend over at Game of Croquet.

531
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 Really? Really?

532
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 And I was part of that game, and I have to say,

533
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 I was the one who went, that guy's got to go,

534
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 because he was horrific in this game.

535
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 He did exactly what Andy was saying.

536
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 He was playing chess.

537
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 I forgot.

538
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 That doesn't mean anything.

539
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Unless he was literally holding a chess board and playing chess,

540
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 while we're playing Croquet.

541
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 But you think several moves ahead?

542
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Fairly.

543
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 I only think the most controversial thing about it.

544
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Croquet was kind of a feminist moment,

545
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 and the reason it was so controversial largely was because it was the first game ever

546
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 that women had played, and it majoratively.

547
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 So every Croquet set had on the front of it a picture of a woman playing Croquet.

548
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And this was crazy.

549
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Between 1860 and 1890, women weren't allowed to believe the house

550
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 if they rode a bike there in trouble.

551
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 And they were all playing Croquet.

552
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 And not only that, but it turns out they were all heinous cheats.

553
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 And so this really pissed people off.

554
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 So there was this big theme that women were terrible cheaters in all games.

555
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 And there was, I think, added to the official rules of Croquet

556
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 when they were codified, was this manual that said,

557
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 "Don't cheat. We are aware the young ladies are fond of cheating,

558
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 because it is such fun, and they think the men like it."

559
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 Well, there are very good ways you can cheat if you're a lady playing Croquet.

560
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 So because ladies at the time were very long and often hooped skirts,

561
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 which come out quite far.

562
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 So it's the work of a moment to just walk over to your ball,

563
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 and just stand on top of it.

564
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 No one can see, because the skirts on the ground all the way around,

565
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 kick it over a bit, into position,

566
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 and then suddenly you're lined up for the next shot.

567
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
 That's very cool.

568
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 It was on the Olympics for it.

569
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 At one point, wasn't it?

570
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 Was that sorry?

571
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 It was on the Olympics for it for one year.

572
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 Yeah, in 1900?

573
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 1900.

574
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 It was France.

575
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 In France.

576
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Yeah.

577
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 What?

578
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 They could barely move the balls.

579
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 It was like the burrowers.

580
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 Yeah.

581
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 But the French didn't really well in it, didn't they?

582
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 No, well, it was a bit of a sad and who say moment.

583
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 They were the only people who took part, and they won all the medals.

584
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 Sorry.

585
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 The next Olympics, the 1904 Olympics, Croquet was kicked out,

586
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 but then the American version of Croquet, which is called Roke,

587
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 was then done at the 1904 Olympics,

588
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 and it was purely Americans who played it,

589
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 and won all the medals there as well.

590
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 And yeah, well done, you guys.

591
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 Yeah.

592
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 But this is my favorite fact about what we found for this fact,

593
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 is that Roke, so Roke, is the American version,

594
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 the way they got the name Roke was invented by a guy called Samuel Crosby,

595
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 who was from New York, and this was in 1899,

596
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 and he came to it by removing the C from the front of the word,

597
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 and the T at the end of the word.

598
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 And that's it.

599
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 Wow.

600
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 Is it that?

601
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 If you read Roke websites, that's like the legendary story of...

602
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
 Yes, it's R2UE.

603
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
 Well, you know the reason why it was dropped from the 1900 Olympics.

604
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 It's because one person turned up to watch it.

605
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Yes.

606
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 There was one spectator, and there were seven players.

607
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 Yeah.

608
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 It was an English guy who was living in Nice,

609
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
 and he came all the way over from Nice to Paris to watch the first matches.

610
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 He didn't even watch the final.

611
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 And the reason that the French won it,

612
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 and the French were the only people who took part,

613
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 is because there was a group of croquet players who lived in Paris,

614
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
 and they didn't want any foreigners playing at all.

615
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 And so they made it, so all the games took place over like three or four months,

616
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 and so no one could afford to stay in Paris for that whole time.

617
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 And so there's only people who lived there who could play it.

618
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
 Yeah.

619
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
 Sneaky.

620
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 So you'd encourage us cheating.

621
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 Actually, sorry.

622
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 Can I just say that Olympics?

623
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 And so there weren't that many spectators,

624
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
 as any of the spots, really.

625
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 Apart from in the discus, there was quite a few,

626
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 because it was in the blood of the lion, so a lot of locals were there.

627
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 But the 1896 discus champion, who came to 1900 Olympics,

628
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
 he managed to dispatch his discus into the crowd on all three throws.

629
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
 Oh.

630
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
 Whoa.

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 Is that extra points or a bonus prize?

632
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Do you guys know who invented croquet?

633
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
 No.

634
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 No.

635
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
 It was a guy, well, his name's quite controversial, which is why I raised it.

636
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 But it was a guy called Walter Thomas Jones Whitmore, he was an English guy.

637
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
 And I've actually, he invented it in Charlton House, which I've been to in England.

638
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 It's a lovely place.

639
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
 I play croquet on the lawn.

640
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
 It's just that kind of life, at least.

641
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 But he was called, so he was called Walter Thomas Jones Whitmore.

642
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
 But he was born Walter Thomas Whitmore Jones.

643
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 The reason he changed his name, which he did in 1867, was because his best friend was called Willie Dickens.

644
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 And they used to go to walks together down Regent Street, and he got really sick of Willie Dickens making a joke.

645
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Every time they passed the drapery, Dickens and Jones, Regent Street.

646
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 And he's like, "Oh, it's you and me, mate."

647
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 He's like, "It's you and me, Dickens and Jones."

648
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 So that fuck it.

649
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 I'm going to drop the surname Jones.

650
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 Wow.

651
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
 Wow.

652
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 That's amazing.

653
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 That's petty.

654
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 Yeah.

655
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 It's very petty.

656
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,000
 We should talk a bit about modern croquet, because croquet is really exciting today.

657
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 Because they guys, it is.

658
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 It is.

659
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
 Thank you.

660
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And he's actually an official commentator at the UK.

661
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 It's an amazing commentary.

662
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
 Ooh, what a great chess move he's just made there.

663
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 There's a new game in town, and it's called golf croquet.

664
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 And it's got much less of the chess, actually.

665
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 It's much more, it's speed and speed game, basically.

666
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 Oh, a gammon.

667
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

668
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 It's...

669
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 The American champion is called Ben Rothman.

670
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 One of the, actually, Egypt is one of the best countries in the world at golf croquet.

671
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
 They clean up.

672
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 They went all the way towards men's and women's.

673
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 They're really, really good at it.

674
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 Anyway, the American champion, Ben Rothman, was profiled by the San Francisco Chronicle.

675
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
 And the entire interview read is basically one long sick burn on him.

676
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 So it starts it off.

677
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 Ben Rothman is the champion of the world, and practically no one knows it.

678
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
 And they do a series of box-pops over the course of the interview with people who are saying,

679
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 "Yeah, I've never heard of him."

680
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,000
 A few feet away from where he is practicing his game.

681
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
 So in the article ends, at Lake Merit, the parade of passes by,

682
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,000
 who had no idea they were in the presence of greatness, continued,

683
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
 "Croquet doesn't do anything for me," said Alex Pineda,

684
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 who was walking by the croquet ground with his dog Dominic, for who Croquet did nothing either.

685
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
 It just ends with the line, "I think it's cool that he's world champion.

686
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 Thanks for telling me.

687
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 I still don't care about Croquet."

688
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
 Okay, that is it.

689
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 That is all of our facts.

690
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
 Thank you so much for listening, Boston.

691
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 You've been amazing.

692
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 Good Bye!

693
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 [Applause]

694
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
 [Applause]

695
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
 [Applause]

696
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,580
 (upbeat music)
