1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 It's your turn now!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 You don't want it!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 I don't want it!

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 You don't want it!

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 You don't want it!

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 You don't want it!

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 You don't want it!

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Oh!

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 And welcome to another episode

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 a weekly podcast this week

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 coming to you live

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 from up the Cree comedy club

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 in Greenwich London.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 My name is Dan Shriver.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm joined by the three regular elves

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 please welcome to the stage

18
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Andy Murray,

19
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:48,880
 Marie Anichezinski and James Harkin. And once again we have gathered around the microphones

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,000
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 we go starting with me. My fact this week is that in winter we should all wear our socks

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:14,440
 outside our shoes. Right. And this is science that says we should do this.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,220
 Oh, Mr. Science. Yeah, this is a really interesting thing. It was a thing that they did in New

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,900
 Zealand. What they did was in New Zealand, they were saying, "Okay, people keep slipping

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,940
 over. How do we fix this?" And someone has worked out. If you wear your socks outside

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,780
 of your shoes, it gives you incredible grip, which means you will never slip on ice.

27
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,340
 So in winter time in London where we're recording this or if you're overseas and you get

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,260
 winter and you get all the icy floor, take your socks off or get a second pair and put

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:50,860
 them outside your shoes, treat yourself. But yeah, so it's a really interesting study.

30
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,300
 I read the study. I think it one or it's been reported by the Ig Nobel people. It might

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,820
 have won an Ig Nobel Prize and I read the report and they said, "Although participants

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,660
 in the intervention group were told they could keep their socks, many who appeared to

33
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:14,220
 have image issues, opted to return them, including one young man who probably fell on leaving

34
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:24,980
 the assessment area." Amazing. Have any of you guys seen the video posted by Alan Anderson

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:32,220
 online and it's him. He's a father of a girl who goes to school and he goes to pick up his

36
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,060
 child from school and he spends six full minutes filming people slipping over. Does anyone see

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:46,780
 that? They all like children. Yeah, they're all children. He's just certain. It's extraordinary.

38
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,460
 The regularity with which they slip over. There's this corner of pavement and every single

39
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,260
 child that walks around it falls flat on their ass or their face or their head, whatever.

40
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,780
 I see it was here out there before he set up the camera, pouring cold water on the pavement.

41
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,780
 You don't want to waste a morning shooting as well. It also shows his good fathering skills

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,260
 because it went about three minutes into the video when he's filmed about 55 children falling

43
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,540
 over. His daughter leaves school and turns up at the car and he's like, "I'm not going

44
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,100
 to go yet, watch this, honestly." There's another three minutes of him and his nine-year-old

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,100
 daughter going, "Yeah, that is hilarious." So good, he should watch it.

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:30,640
 The thing about the socks going over your shoes, it doesn't work apparently if the

47
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,080
 socks are wet. Obviously, if you're walking on slow or ice, they will be soon. So just speaking

48
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,600
 of kids, it's interesting that I think it is a New Zealand thing that they have recognized

49
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,680
 as just a local thing that people do. They know to wear socks outside their shoes because

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,560
 in 1989, two researchers extracted gossip from a group of young 7 to 11-year-olds. That

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:07,440
 was really sinister, would you? Now that I read it again, it's just a single needle. So these

52
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,200
 were corrected rereading my sentence. It wasn't in New Zealand, it was American school

53
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,240
 children. Oh, well, that's all right. And they asked each child to discuss the reputations

54
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,480
 of each of their classmates and this is what they said. Some of them were warning signs

55
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,960
 of weirdness, apparently. It said, "Eats like a pig." That's one thing they would say.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:37,760
 Bang's head on desk sounds like a car. Figuity acts like a monster, wears socks over shoes.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:47,260
 Ah, sensible. They should have said that after that. Brackets sensible. Sounds like a car.

58
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:59,020
 Is that all one guy? Well, when everyone's slipping, he's going, "Bracket." Do you know

59
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,420
 that they wear over socks in pro-cycling sometimes? Really? Yeah, wearing socks over your shoes

60
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,260
 is a thing in cycling. Yeah. Well, in the spring, when they're racing, it gets really

61
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,140
 kind of grotty and muddy and whatever and they have these really lightweight shoes and

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,220
 the idea is you put your socks over it and it won't damage the shoes. That's good, isn't it?

63
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:36,380
 But the shoes aren't on the ground. You're a much better cyclist than I am. Yeah, no, it

64
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,460
 gets muddy and it kind of splashes up and you know. And there was, I saw an FAQ on a cycling

65
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:48,260
 website and the question was, what is the point of wearing socks over your shoes and the answer

66
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:55,140
 was experiencing the thrill of having non-cyclists within a earshot, impersonately observing

67
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,620
 that you have forgotten your shoes or that you have put them and your socks on in the wrong

68
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,620
 order? That does sound worth it. There is something you can do if you're not into the socks

69
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,660
 over shoes. Look, the Canadian researchers have discovered recently which they've developed

70
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,300
 a new material where you implant glass fibers into shoes and they're selling these shoes

71
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,980
 where these little chance of glass act as these tiny spikes. That sounds very, very safe.

72
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:30,260
 I think that, I mean, it's not just a kid at home jabbing, broken, wine bottle up into his

73
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:40,420
 own trainers. We've all been there. No, but I like this. So it was casually reported in

74
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:46,580
 new scientists. The researchers who tested this material did it in a floating lab which

75
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,500
 was casually referred. So it's a floating lab is a lab that gets hoisted into the air and

76
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,180
 then tilted at whatever sloping tilt or whatever gradient you want to tilt it to. So that's

77
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,980
 how they test these kind of things is you just hoist this whole laboratory up and then you

78
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,380
 get people to wear these ice shoes, glass shoes. And you told it, I think that's so cool.

79
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,620
 Floting labs. Just genuinely interesting. Here's something that's not that interesting.

80
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:19,700
 Oh, please. I thought I'd look into sock puppets. So I went onto Wikipedia and Wikipedia says

81
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:27,700
 that sock puppet is a puppet made from a sock or similar garment. And I would argue that

82
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,340
 something made from something that's not a sock really isn't a sock puppet. You've got sock

83
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,620
 puppets which are made of socks. You've got cloth puppets which are made of gloves. You've got

84
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:55,220
 finger puppets obviously which are made of fingers. I think they're creepy though. And he approaches

85
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,820
 every normal you can take off those finger puppets. Show me your true hand.

86
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:13,300
 I got told on the way here by Alex Bell who always appears on our podcast. I got told that,

87
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,940
 so I mean, just because we were talking on the way over here about how when you do slip on ice,

88
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,740
 obviously you can you can break your ankle. You can hurt yourself really badly. And he told me that

89
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,060
 during the filming of the movie Troy, the filming was actually delayed because Brad Pitt who was playing

90
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:40,980
 Achilles injured his Achilles here. No. True fact. True fact that I didn't Google, I just believed it.

91
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:53,460
 So I read an article in the Independent from 1993 which opened congratulations to the several

92
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:59,780
 hundred readers who wrote in with creative suggestions for using an odd sock. So this is obviously

93
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:08,020
 a competition they were running. And I said this list which by no means exhaustive will be put

94
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:14,820
 to good use and suggestions for using an odd sock. And they are good suggestions. They include

95
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:26,500
 with suitable holes as a coat or balaclava for a furry animal. That's the best bank ice

96
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:39,300
 frozen if a sock is frozen use it as a boomerang because I guess the heel has that shape. And if it's

97
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:58,340
 unfrozen as a bank for a boomerang, we should move on to a second fact very soon. What else do you

98
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,780
 guys got? The original fact was about snow and ice. Yeah. And just this is just something I found

99
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:09,860
 interesting you can start a fire using ice. Pretty cool. If you carve a piece of ice into a lens and

100
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:17,060
 you focus the sun's rays through it, you can start a fire in a few seconds. Wow. And you need the

101
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,260
 tools to chip away at a chunk of ice but you can do it. It's insane it being done. That sentence could

102
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:30,660
 have read you can turn your child into a car. Well you can do that with most things presumably.

103
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:39,060
 I can't focus the rays of the sun through a child. Well the next experiments have been all in vain.

104
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:50,980
 Should we move on? Yeah let's move on. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Andrew Hunter

105
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,620
 Murray. My fact this week is that ancient Jerusalem's lost property office just involved shouting

106
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:04,580
 about what you had lost in the hope that somebody had found it. Well so wow really? Yeah and so there's

107
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:09,620
 they've just found in the ruins of ancient Jerusalem a particular podium and there are a couple of

108
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,100
 theories about its use. One is that it was a sort of speakers corner and the other is that it was a

109
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,700
 lost property office because there are a couple of ancient Jewish texts which mention a stone of

110
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,580
 claims and that's where you would go if you lost something and the idea is that you would tell an

111
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,700
 announcer and then he would shout out to the crowd and see if anyone had found anything that was like

112
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,780
 that and that was how you were reunited with your lost stuff in ancient Jerusalem. I just think

113
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,220
 that's the best idea ever. Yeah that's how easy. Well you kind of need everyone in the country to be

114
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,620
 stood around the guy at the time. It's not really going to work in London is it? That's the floor.

115
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,740
 It's like it was never been tried in London. We've just found this out as well right? Yeah they've

116
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,500
 just found the podium and so they're trying to work out what it was for so this is one of the theories

117
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,540
 yeah. It's the wailing wall is in isn't it? Is that? I don't think that was originally a lost property.

118
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,260
 I mean are we definitely sure about that? Whaling. It is a bit like town cryers I think. You know

119
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,300
 you would have oh yay oh yay someone's lost so whatever that probably happened in the olden days.

120
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:20,580
 True. In Gossler in Germany they had a town cryer who was employed to remind the local pop place

121
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,340
 not to urinate or defecate into the river the day before the water was drawn for brewing beer

122
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:36,340
 which I think we can all agree is a very useful job. There was a town cry there was a town cryer

123
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,460
 called Keith Jackman of Christchurch and he has been deafened by the sound of his own bell.

124
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:49,780
 He's been he's been doing the oh yay for 25 years. Oh he's gone deaf. That's really sad.

125
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:55,380
 It is isn't it? He should have won those headphones the ear muffs that build as well. Yeah he should have done.

126
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:03,060
 One idiot is the absolute worst kind of tenetus isn't it though it's just like

127
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:10,980
 do you remember the guy I haven't I can't remember his name but when Prince George was born

128
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,860
 was announced by town cryer and everyone's like oh this is fantastically old school this is wonderful

129
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,140
 and it turns out it was just a guy who just decided to arrive and announce it and he is a town cryer

130
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,780
 but in a very different town to where I was being announced and he just walked up it here he

131
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,780
 he announced it and everyone's like oh it's just so nice and the royal family we're going who the

132
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:36,500
 hell is this guy. Do you remember that? I hope he drove down all the way saying I've got to tell them

133
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,700
 how else will they know? And the bells next to him with the car with a little seat bells on it.

134
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,300
 Just you and me this time blender.

135
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:58,100
 The town cryer championships I just think this is so amazing that these kind of things

136
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,220
 have the budget for this. I've been there once. What? Did not place.

137
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,220
 What? Do you know where they were held the last ones? The one I went to was in either

138
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,900
 Lancashire or Yorkshire I can't remember. Cool the last one was in Bermuda so I feel like

139
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,020
 Do you ever get the feeling you chose the wrong year?

140
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:31,700
 I mean who was paying for town cryers good. Anyway this year this is the first time a Brit has won

141
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,460
 the town cryer championships. It's very exciting. Mark Wiley beat off 24 what are those things?

142
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,580
 I know what I like. Oh yeah!

143
00:14:42,580 --> 00:15:01,300
 It's one of the requirements these days. He actually said for the ego reasons we have to correct that.

144
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:15,140
 Sorry so this guy won over and above 24 other contestants. What he won was an awful lot of rum he said

145
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,900
 which I needed for medicinal purposes. He explained which is understandable after the trauma he'd

146
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:38,260
 undergone. Oh god there's anyone got anything else lost and found? Yes. I've got stuff

147
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:48,020
 I've lost and found. Okay. This story is this is from the BBC News website for Barkshire in 2011.

148
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,620
 A mother has praised redding buses for finding and returning her son's sausage casserole.

149
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:05,140
 Her son's sausage casserole I feel. After he left it on a bus.

150
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:22,500
 Oh carry on. Suzanne start sent an email via social media network site Facebook to thank

151
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,340
 staff at the bus company for saving her family's dinner. The sausage casserole which was made by

152
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,100
 her son in his food technology class at school ended up in lost property. The casserole was retrieved

153
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:49,700
 by Mrs. Stout and Eaton having taken an unscheduled route around West Redding which for my money is

154
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,820
 the greatest story ever. That was the guy who did you read TFL published a couple of years ago

155
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,540
 list of the most interesting stuff they've had in their lost property that's been claimed or not

156
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,580
 claimed one of which was one of the most common items to have a lost property is false teeth which is

157
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:12,180
 weird anyway people I don't know relax take them out leave them there anyway a man came back

158
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:18,260
 claimed his false teeth took them away and then returned a few hours later grimacing and saying

159
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:27,780
 how to do these online. You know that I'm Kent police are now saying that they're no longer accepting

160
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:33,060
 lost property items and that you yeah yeah so if you if you bring them a lost property item they say

161
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,660
 take it to Facebook or Twitter and you now have to tweet or Facebook the lost property item yeah

162
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,540
 they no longer do it. Which really messes around with the law on lost property because the

163
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,500
 you meant to take reasonable steps to return it to its owner and if you go to the police and then

164
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,740
 several weeks pass and they haven't reunited it with its owner then you have the best claim on it

165
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,620
 after the owner you are because you found it so I don't know how it works in the age of doing it on

166
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,940
 social media if that's what qualifies as a reasonable effort. Yeah and very quickly there's a thing the

167
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:08,100
 code of Hammurabi is the oldest legal code we have and it has a section on lost property so if

168
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:14,580
 somebody finds something he's lost in the possession of another man right and the person who own has

169
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,620
 it now bought it from a salesman and they've both got witnesses that they bought it honestly and

170
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:26,580
 that they owned it before then since the seller was the thief he should be put to death. But

171
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:32,020
 if the man who was found with the property couldn't produce the seller to make the sale but the

172
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:36,660
 original owner did have witnesses then since the professed purchaser was a thief he should be put

173
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:46,100
 to death. Finally I think you know where this is going. If you could not produce witnesses proving

174
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,580
 that you in fact owned it before it was found in the possession of the other guy since he was a cheat

175
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:57,380
 and stated a false report he shall be put to death. There's no there's no there's no scaling down

176
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:07,300
 in this lost property. We need to move on. Okay it is time for our next fat and that is Chisinski.

177
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,660
 Yes my fact is that the man who discovered why we sweat did so by getting in a

178
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:26,180
 sauna with a dog, a steak and an egg. And then it just came to him. I think you're going to have to

179
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:32,260
 explain Anna. So this is this guy called Charles Blackson who not very much has written about and so

180
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,380
 he was a British physician in the late 18th century and he was invited actually to you know by

181
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,940
 other scientists to get into their sauna and find out why we sweat and he decided when he persuaded

182
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,900
 a whole bunch of friends to come in with him and he subjected himself to ridiculous temperatures.

183
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:58,100
 So in in 1775 he went up to 127 degrees Celsius so way above boiling point. Sitting in the sauna

184
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,060
 was found he was able to sit there. He was in one naked from the waist up and others he had to

185
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,940
 wear clothes because otherwise your skin cinches. Were there any way he was naked from the waist down?

186
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:17,060
 The dog is looking worried. But yeah so there was thought that how could he possibly have survived

187
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:21,220
 this because people didn't know that humans could thermoregulate like we know we can now so how

188
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,500
 could we possibly survive being 127 degrees Celsius. So there was an idea that the moment he must be

189
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,660
 wrong so rather than get like a few thermometers in there to you know controls he invited in his dog

190
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:47,540
 and an egg and some steak and and he found that the egg cooked extremely fast the steak cooked

191
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:58,260
 even almost even faster so that when you got the dog 25 minutes of gas market no the dog's fine

192
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,900
 because animals can thermoregulate but the way when you read his write-up of it it reads a bit like a

193
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,780
 cooking a cookery book because it's mainly supposed to be focused on how well cooked the steak is

194
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:15,540
 sitting in there but you know like 150 degrees C I mean he says we put eggs and beef steak in that

195
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,620
 after 20 minutes the eggs were taken out roasted quite hard and 47 minutes the steak was not only

196
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:29,860
 dressed but almost dry another beef steak was rather overdone in in 33 minutes and then in the evening

197
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,820
 he explained you cook the steak even faster by using bellows to blow the hot air onto it and he

198
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,340
 explained that the greatest part of the steak was pretty well done within 13 minutes so he's either

199
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,380
 telling you how to cook steak well or he's explaining that humans can thermoregulate and in a way that

200
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:54,580
 steak can't so yeah this is how he discovered that by sweating we are able to not boil to death when

201
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,660
 temperatures reach the same way. I guess the story today is most famous for Blackdon's law

202
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,900
 which is the idea that if you put salt in water it takes longer to boil yes that's what he's famous for

203
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,300
 is that do they use that in freezing on the roads is it the same principle? It's kind of the same

204
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,460
 principle yeah if you put salt in the ice it doesn't form as it's similar to that it's similar to when

205
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,460
 people put salt into water to like boil pasta or something they think that the temperature will boil

206
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,180
 lower but actually that's not really true you can put as much salt as you want like a hell of a lot of

207
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,380
 salt into a bowl of pasta and it would change the boiling point by four hundredths of a degree

208
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,460
 so early it'll make much difference but I read the article on him in the dictionary of national

209
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,780
 biography and Dr. Johnson who wrote the dictionary said that he was a delightful fellow

210
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,020
 this guy but there was another guy called Count Rumpford who didn't really like him as much

211
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:56,260
 because Blackdon had fought against him for the hand of Levantier's wife so Antoine Levantier

212
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,100
 who he was a person who there was an idea that people thought that when things burned there was

213
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,020
 an element called flogiston and this was the element that allowed things to burn and then he died and

214
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:15,380
 then his wife married this guy called Count Rumpford and weirdly he is the person who disproved that

215
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,980
 something called caloric which was another element which was what happened when things heated up

216
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:28,420
 happened so she was married to the guy who disproved flogiston which was a fake element for burning

217
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,420
 and then was married to a guy who disproved caloric which was the fake elements for warming things up

218
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:41,940
 wow that is really interesting but not funny she was the niche she had written niche taste

219
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,220
 that really niche isn't it bizarrely I have a fact about Dr. Johnson and Sweat

220
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:54,020
 great so in Dr. Johnson's dictionary the word Swellt as in Swellt are these days but the definition

221
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,820
 for the word Swellt is to puff in sweat if that be the meaning

222
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:07,460
 which I decide I'm the writer of the dictionary so it be the meaning

223
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:15,940
 I was I was so the fact is about why don't people cook effectively when they're in a sauna

224
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,540
 because that's what he was trying to find out well that's I mean that's slightly what he was trying

225
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,220
 to find out it's it's okay it wasn't what he was trying to find out I have missed research

226
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:31,220
 this fact it was more about how steaks do cook and yeah I was like humans how can you how can you

227
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,820
 get this kind of heat and with the dog it was the the tongue that was panting that allowed for it to

228
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,900
 regulate its heat I just I feel like we have to explain why that was confusing maybe to some

229
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,300
 people and to you why when you say why don't people cook you mean why don't people themselves

230
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:49,940
 oh cook when they're in a sauna it's not why don't people enter a sauna to make a fry up so roast in it

231
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:59,460
 that's yeah that's so I googled how hot can a human get and did my photo come up

232
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:12,020
 whether we're a lot of they were a lot of really interesting articles like they look like they were

233
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:18,740
 right they look like they were good answers to the question but I got really distracted because you

234
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:30,500
 know when you google something James make it from the wisdom so when you when you when you google

235
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,940
 something at the very bottom when you scroll down it says related searches you know when you see

236
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,060
 that yeah and then it gives you a new sentence you can say so I googled how hot can a human get

237
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,860
 and the related search that I got was can a human get a dog pregnant

238
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:57,860
 and I really want to do research for tonight and the facts but that is Charles Bladden discovered two

239
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,460
 things in that sauna the answer to the second was no

240
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:10,420
 well that's a thing kid you get a dog pregnant was that someone is that a lot of people typing that

241
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,060
 out of curiosity or are they worried

242
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:24,740
 didn't say it didn't say but it is interesting that all dogs can mate successfully with all other dogs

243
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:33,220
 that is true isn't it yeah yeah I just find that amazing yeah like it's like a tiny chihuahua can

244
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,940
 mate with that a massive yeah great and make a new dog right make it that's the point of it

245
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:50,660
 oh we've got a lot of explaining to do one of the shows over

246
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:08,420
 do you know in Finland there's a sauna elf so we've spoken about this on the podcast before

247
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:15,620
 Finland loves saunas like crazy their parliament has a sauna and a lot of very big moments have

248
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,940
 happened in a sauna when they've been negotiating they'll go let's go to the sauna and they'll

249
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:25,860
 sit it out until they decide but part of their there there's an equivalent of the boogie man

250
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,820
 in Finland which is the sauna elf and he's called sauna tonto and I'm sure in a different accent

251
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:41,380
 and sauna tonto basically if you're naughty in a in a sauna he'll he'll burn it down and kill everyone

252
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:59,380
 um yep so on the front you better watch so not tonto's coming to the town

253
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,940
 and he's burning the sauna down

254
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,460
 yeah that rhyme that's very good

255
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:17,860
 we're gonna have to move on to our final facts okay time for our final facts and that is

256
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:27,620
 james okay my fact this week is that stick insect sex can last for 79 days and the insects are stuck

257
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:37,220
 together the whole time wow that's like sting and his wife right is not he is that tantric

258
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:45,700
 I think I think you've got confused it stings yeah so um stick insects you would think they're

259
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,860
 really boring but actually they have quite well-lengthy sex I wouldn't I would say it's that exciting

260
00:28:51,860 --> 00:29:00,580
 I think yeah I don't suppose um stick insects could probably like have sex that quickly because

261
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:11,700
 they might set each other on fire it's a really good point yeah um but these guys um they're

262
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:19,780
 the genitalia are in contact for 40% of the time of the 79 days so they are kind of you know

263
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:27,060
 at it for one more time I read a theory that the males drag it out so as to stop other males from

264
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:34,580
 mating with the female yes I read that from a entomologist blogger called bug girl which is where

265
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:40,740
 I got this fact from originally but she actually found several reports of stick insect group sex

266
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,140
 in the literature which means that maybe he's not trying to keep it in the in the couple

267
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:53,860
 that's why dogs do it though right so if anyone's had a dog who's made it um dogs can stay attached

268
00:29:53,860 --> 00:30:00,180
 to their bitches for up to 40 45 minutes um standard and it's it's so that another dog

269
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:07,700
 all the other could get away with that sentence these are just zoological terms guys

270
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:13,780
 um but you know that's to stop another dog getting getting too involved yeah um so sometimes other

271
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:19,380
 males do sneak up not in a in that way but just to try and sneak in when the first male breaks off

272
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:24,340
 to feed as sometimes happens um and the intruder will start having sex with the female but then if

273
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,340
 the first male finds out the two of them will have a fight while both holding on to the female

274
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:37,540
 they'll pass at each other with their legs that's so distracting what is going on back there

275
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:48,020
 [laughter]

276
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:58,900
 anyway so this isn't this actually isn't true of all stick insect sex it's true of a lot of them

277
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:07,300
 um but there is a stick insect called um ecstato soma tia ratum um and the females of that species

278
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:13,940
 can reproduce without the need of males so they can like auto reproduce but no one seems to have

279
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:20,180
 told the males so the males find the females really attractive and try to mate with them whenever

280
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:26,740
 possible but the females have involved an anti-afridiziac to keep the males away and when eventually

281
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,980
 they manage to get past the anti-afridiziac and they mount them they can kick them with their

282
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,460
 back legs to get them off because they just want to say no no we don't need you guys we can just

283
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,340
 have sex on our own and then so i think these this is actually very confusing to evolutionary

284
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:46,740
 biologists because usually asexual reproduction evolves because of a lack of males and so you know

285
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,060
 a female race actually reproduce but really you want the male to be there because of diversity of

286
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,100
 genes but yeah these stick insects are saying no we actually way prefer it this way we'll just

287
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:03,380
 create clans of ourselves who are very easy to get along with um yeah they bat them off and it's

288
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,900
 this kind of conundrum like aren't they going to outlast males are these male so i think it's the

289
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:15,780
 spiny leaf stick insects in Australia um will the males die out first or will they evolve to manage

290
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,300
 to i don't know like assault the women enough that they can still because if the male managers

291
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,140
 have sex with the female they produce both male and female offspring because the active fertilized

292
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:31,540
 and if the if it's just the female producing pathogenesis then they only produce clothes

293
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,980
 to themselves who are obviously all females so it's a real um genuine but like utopia versus dystopia

294
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,940
 kind of all female world versus yeah i wouldn't call that dystopian or rather i mean

295
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:50,980
 do you want to hear something cool about sticking sex uh eggs so some of the eggs have the special

296
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,260
 capsule of the sort of fat another good tasty stuff called a capitulum at one end of them

297
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,900
 and ants like eating the capitulum bit so they carry the eggs back to their nest

298
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,020
 and they eat the capitulum bit and then they throw the eggs onto a kind of rubbish heap where they

299
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,260
 remain incubating and they can stay incubating for up to a year and then the baby's uh

300
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,260
 stick insects just hatch and then they walk out of the nest and um i i read that this was compared to

301
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,780
 paying a babysitter to look after your eggs um to look after your offspring but it's not really because

302
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,740
 i think that is the equivalent of leaving your child abandoned but with a tubular attached

303
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,180
 that someone who likes a tubular able say oh i love a tubular owner i just take this on what's this

304
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:45,460
 on the to understand it is the worst parenting in the world i've ever had this it shook off

305
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:51,060
 your own child because the ants do eat some of the eggs i mean yeah yeah they will they will eat

306
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,940
 thinking they're edible so yeah it is saying look this guy might eat you but if he doesn't then

307
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:03,860
 you might be okay uh i'm off i was i was probably when i was researching today i was looking into

308
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:11,220
 pictures of stick insects and something i think that's not said enough is it's really weird day

309
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:16,740
 like they're they look like it's they look like sticks well yeah they look like trees have become

310
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:22,580
 conscious and we're just not acknowledging it it's just they do it just looks like a bit of stick is

311
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:27,540
 gone i'm alive oh my god what is the world going on here and we probably an insect it's just an

312
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:37,060
 insect no it the tree has woken up like if you if you had two stick insects having sex for 79 days

313
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:44,420
 attached to each other how do you know it's not just two sticks yeah exactly what have you been

314
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:49,380
 watering it the whole time and they're just like we're trying to have sex here and you know who's

315
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,180
 this guy every day it is difficult for researchers to find stick insects because they're nocturnal

316
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:01,860
 and they pretend to be sticks and so it is quite hard to study them um and you know the best thing

317
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:10,420
 is a lot of stick insect eggs look like seeds how cool is that yeah extra camouflage nice smart it's

318
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:16,500
 not they are conscious trees that much happens we're all dancing around it because if two mind

319
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:21,620
 blowing for us to accept oh their children look like seeds they're fucking seeds

320
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:31,700
 do you think that all things that are camouflage directly the thing that they're camouflage against

321
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,740
 we're not camouflage look at us there's no camouflage on us and there's a stick walking pass me

322
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,980
 and i think i know that's that makes sense but if you have like an arctic fox which is camouflage

323
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:48,740
 just snow you don't think oh my god snow it's not like it's not like an iceberg walking pass me

324
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:58,980
 being like a high iceberg fox i feel we might have hit a nerve here

325
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:05,380
 um we found a stick insect which is a hundred and twenty six million years old older than a lot of

326
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:23,620
 don't i think that's just a stick do you know more about this

327
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:28,420
 no well the cool thing is about it is that um we know that a lot of them imitate flowering plants

328
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:37,300
 and um we know flowering sticks and we know we know what plant it would have mimicked because we

329
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,340
 if its wings were folded it would have looked like a stripy tongue and there was the worst stripy

330
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:46,340
 tongue looking plants around at the time and we know those in the fossil record and we know this

331
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,740
 and we can kind of imagine what it would look like yeah it's just so cool i think that's really cool

332
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,700
 and there are three thousand species in the genus which includes stick insects and leaf insects

333
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,900
 which is another kind of insect

334
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:09,380
 um there's so this is one extraordinary stick insect uh which was thought to have gone extinct on

335
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,820
 lord howe island which is in south pacific uh thought of gone extinct in 1920 um so it used to

336
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,100
 be known as the tree lobster because it's absolutely enormous it's 12 centimeters long on average

337
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:26,580
 i also heard that it was known as a walking sausage oh yeah i think it also ima take sausages

338
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:33,380
 down to next friday i'm just going to be like yeah i mean i do a lot of stick work but i also dabble

339
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,140
 and sausage stuff i mean i do a lot of stick work but i also dabble and sausage stuff

340
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,660
 i wish that was the first time i'd ever heard you say that i mean

341
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:54,500
 so these stick insects we thought it disappeared these giant insects in 1920 and very recently in

342
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,540
 them within the last 10 years so there were rumors that they were still existed on balls pyramid

343
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,740
 which is a pyramid that jots out of the ocean very near to this uh this south pacific island

344
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,420
 and these four Australians went to investigate these rumors and see if these giant stick insects

345
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,060
 that existed they climbed up this vertical rock face and they found under one bush these

346
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,260
 stick insects have been living for almost a hundred years they found 24 insects under one plant one single

347
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,580
 plant um and we don't know how they got there people think they might have hitchhiked over on birds

348
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:29,060
 which i quite like wow yeah and so now they really want to reintroduce them to laud howe island

349
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,060
 and the reason they went extinct in the first place is because there were loads there was a rat

350
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,500
 infestation that we introduced and now laud howe islanders are being faced with the choice between

351
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,820
 would you like to keep your horrible rat infestation um or would you like us to get rid of that in

352
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:54,180
 exchange for giant horrific looking stick insects the size of your head i'm gonna wrap us up very soon

353
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:02,340
 so uh anyone else got anything i just on duration of uh copulation uh there is a map of the US that's

354
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:08,420
 been compiled because there's an app where you can report how long your sex lasts in america

355
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:14,660
 um and then there's a map of the US which tells you which states have the longest sex um and so

356
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:21,380
 which states are the biggest liars well i don't know if anyone's lying because they they are not long

357
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:37,460
 freshingly honest new mexico wins um copulation last 7.01 minutes on average Alaska loses the average

358
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,220
 copulation is 1.21 minutes yeah but it's cold it's cold

359
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,260
 you want to get back inside don't you
