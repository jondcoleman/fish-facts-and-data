00:00:00,00:00:02,It's your turn now!
00:00:02,00:00:03,You don't want it!
00:00:03,00:00:04,I don't want it!
00:00:04,00:00:05,You don't want it!
00:00:05,00:00:06,You don't want it!
00:00:06,00:00:07,You don't want it!
00:00:07,00:00:08,You don't want it!
00:00:08,00:00:13,Oh!
00:00:13,00:00:15,And welcome to another episode
00:00:15,00:00:17,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast this week
00:00:19,00:00:20,coming to you live
00:00:20,00:00:21,from up the Cree comedy club
00:00:21,00:00:23,in Greenwich London.
00:00:23,00:00:24,My name is Dan Shriver.
00:00:24,00:00:26,I'm joined by the three regular elves
00:00:26,00:00:27,please welcome to the stage
00:00:27,00:00:28,"Andy Murray,"
00:00:28,00:00:48,Marie Anichezinski and James Harkin. And once again we have gathered around the microphones
00:00:48,00:00:53,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order, here"
00:00:53,00:01:01,we go starting with me. My fact this week is that in winter we should all wear our socks
00:01:01,00:01:14,outside our shoes. Right. And this is science that says we should do this.
00:01:14,00:01:18,"Oh, Mr. Science. Yeah, this is a really interesting thing. It was a thing that they did in New"
00:01:18,00:01:22,"Zealand. What they did was in New Zealand, they were saying, ""Okay, people keep slipping"
00:01:22,00:01:26,"over. How do we fix this?"" And someone has worked out. If you wear your socks outside"
00:01:26,00:01:31,"of your shoes, it gives you incredible grip, which means you will never slip on ice."
00:01:31,00:01:35,So in winter time in London where we're recording this or if you're overseas and you get
00:01:35,00:01:41,"winter and you get all the icy floor, take your socks off or get a second pair and put"
00:01:41,00:01:50,"them outside your shoes, treat yourself. But yeah, so it's a really interesting study."
00:01:50,00:01:56,I read the study. I think it one or it's been reported by the Ig Nobel people. It might
00:01:56,00:02:01,"have won an Ig Nobel Prize and I read the report and they said, ""Although participants"
00:02:01,00:02:06,"in the intervention group were told they could keep their socks, many who appeared to"
00:02:06,00:02:14,"have image issues, opted to return them, including one young man who probably fell on leaving"
00:02:14,00:02:24,"the assessment area."" Amazing. Have any of you guys seen the video posted by Alan Anderson"
00:02:24,00:02:32,online and it's him. He's a father of a girl who goes to school and he goes to pick up his
00:02:32,00:02:38,child from school and he spends six full minutes filming people slipping over. Does anyone see
00:02:38,00:02:46,"that? They all like children. Yeah, they're all children. He's just certain. It's extraordinary."
00:02:46,00:02:50,The regularity with which they slip over. There's this corner of pavement and every single
00:02:50,00:02:55,"child that walks around it falls flat on their ass or their face or their head, whatever."
00:02:55,00:03:00,"I see it was here out there before he set up the camera, pouring cold water on the pavement."
00:03:00,00:03:05,You don't want to waste a morning shooting as well. It also shows his good fathering skills
00:03:05,00:03:10,because it went about three minutes into the video when he's filmed about 55 children falling
00:03:10,00:03:14,"over. His daughter leaves school and turns up at the car and he's like, ""I'm not going"
00:03:14,00:03:20,"to go yet, watch this, honestly."" There's another three minutes of him and his nine-year-old"
00:03:20,00:03:26,"daughter going, ""Yeah, that is hilarious."" So good, he should watch it."
00:03:26,00:03:30,"The thing about the socks going over your shoes, it doesn't work apparently if the"
00:03:30,00:03:38,"socks are wet. Obviously, if you're walking on slow or ice, they will be soon. So just speaking"
00:03:38,00:03:42,"of kids, it's interesting that I think it is a New Zealand thing that they have recognized"
00:03:42,00:03:46,as just a local thing that people do. They know to wear socks outside their shoes because
00:03:46,00:03:54,"in 1989, two researchers extracted gossip from a group of young 7 to 11-year-olds. That"
00:03:54,00:04:07,"was really sinister, would you? Now that I read it again, it's just a single needle. So these"
00:04:07,00:04:13,"were corrected rereading my sentence. It wasn't in New Zealand, it was American school"
00:04:13,00:04:19,"children. Oh, well, that's all right. And they asked each child to discuss the reputations"
00:04:19,00:04:24,of each of their classmates and this is what they said. Some of them were warning signs
00:04:24,00:04:27,"of weirdness, apparently. It said, ""Eats like a pig."" That's one thing they would say."
00:04:27,00:04:37,"Bang's head on desk sounds like a car. Figuity acts like a monster, wears socks over shoes."
00:04:37,00:04:47,"Ah, sensible. They should have said that after that. Brackets sensible. Sounds like a car."
00:04:47,00:04:59,"Is that all one guy? Well, when everyone's slipping, he's going, ""Bracket."" Do you know"
00:04:59,00:05:04,"that they wear over socks in pro-cycling sometimes? Really? Yeah, wearing socks over your shoes"
00:05:04,00:05:09,"is a thing in cycling. Yeah. Well, in the spring, when they're racing, it gets really"
00:05:09,00:05:14,kind of grotty and muddy and whatever and they have these really lightweight shoes and
00:05:14,00:05:19,"the idea is you put your socks over it and it won't damage the shoes. That's good, isn't it?"
00:05:19,00:05:36,"But the shoes aren't on the ground. You're a much better cyclist than I am. Yeah, no, it"
00:05:36,00:05:41,"gets muddy and it kind of splashes up and you know. And there was, I saw an FAQ on a cycling"
00:05:41,00:05:48,"website and the question was, what is the point of wearing socks over your shoes and the answer"
00:05:48,00:05:55,"was experiencing the thrill of having non-cyclists within a earshot, impersonately observing"
00:05:55,00:06:01,that you have forgotten your shoes or that you have put them and your socks on in the wrong
00:06:01,00:06:08,order? That does sound worth it. There is something you can do if you're not into the socks
00:06:08,00:06:13,"over shoes. Look, the Canadian researchers have discovered recently which they've developed"
00:06:13,00:06:18,a new material where you implant glass fibers into shoes and they're selling these shoes
00:06:18,00:06:23,"where these little chance of glass act as these tiny spikes. That sounds very, very safe."
00:06:23,00:06:30,"I think that, I mean, it's not just a kid at home jabbing, broken, wine bottle up into his"
00:06:30,00:06:40,"own trainers. We've all been there. No, but I like this. So it was casually reported in"
00:06:40,00:06:46,new scientists. The researchers who tested this material did it in a floating lab which
00:06:46,00:06:50,was casually referred. So it's a floating lab is a lab that gets hoisted into the air and
00:06:50,00:06:55,then tilted at whatever sloping tilt or whatever gradient you want to tilt it to. So that's
00:06:55,00:06:58,how they test these kind of things is you just hoist this whole laboratory up and then you
00:06:58,00:07:05,"get people to wear these ice shoes, glass shoes. And you told it, I think that's so cool."
00:07:05,00:07:11,Floting labs. Just genuinely interesting. Here's something that's not that interesting.
00:07:11,00:07:19,"Oh, please. I thought I'd look into sock puppets. So I went onto Wikipedia and Wikipedia says"
00:07:19,00:07:27,that sock puppet is a puppet made from a sock or similar garment. And I would argue that
00:07:27,00:07:32,something made from something that's not a sock really isn't a sock puppet. You've got sock
00:07:32,00:07:35,puppets which are made of socks. You've got cloth puppets which are made of gloves. You've got
00:07:35,00:07:55,finger puppets obviously which are made of fingers. I think they're creepy though. And he approaches
00:07:55,00:08:00,every normal you can take off those finger puppets. Show me your true hand.
00:08:00,00:08:13,"I got told on the way here by Alex Bell who always appears on our podcast. I got told that,"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"so I mean, just because we were talking on the way over here about how when you do slip on ice,"
00:08:17,00:08:22,obviously you can you can break your ankle. You can hurt yourself really badly. And he told me that
00:08:22,00:08:29,"during the filming of the movie Troy, the filming was actually delayed because Brad Pitt who was playing"
00:08:29,00:08:40,"Achilles injured his Achilles here. No. True fact. True fact that I didn't Google, I just believed it."
00:08:46,00:08:53,So I read an article in the Independent from 1993 which opened congratulations to the several
00:08:53,00:08:59,hundred readers who wrote in with creative suggestions for using an odd sock. So this is obviously
00:08:59,00:09:08,a competition they were running. And I said this list which by no means exhaustive will be put
00:09:08,00:09:14,to good use and suggestions for using an odd sock. And they are good suggestions. They include
00:09:14,00:09:26,with suitable holes as a coat or balaclava for a furry animal. That's the best bank ice
00:09:26,00:09:39,frozen if a sock is frozen use it as a boomerang because I guess the heel has that shape. And if it's
00:09:39,00:09:58,"unfrozen as a bank for a boomerang, we should move on to a second fact very soon. What else do you"
00:09:58,00:10:03,guys got? The original fact was about snow and ice. Yeah. And just this is just something I found
00:10:03,00:10:09,interesting you can start a fire using ice. Pretty cool. If you carve a piece of ice into a lens and
00:10:09,00:10:17,"you focus the sun's rays through it, you can start a fire in a few seconds. Wow. And you need the"
00:10:17,00:10:22,tools to chip away at a chunk of ice but you can do it. It's insane it being done. That sentence could
00:10:22,00:10:30,have read you can turn your child into a car. Well you can do that with most things presumably.
00:10:30,00:10:39,I can't focus the rays of the sun through a child. Well the next experiments have been all in vain.
00:10:39,00:10:50,Should we move on? Yeah let's move on. Okay it is time for fact number two and that is Andrew Hunter
00:10:50,00:10:55,Murray. My fact this week is that ancient Jerusalem's lost property office just involved shouting
00:10:55,00:11:04,about what you had lost in the hope that somebody had found it. Well so wow really? Yeah and so there's
00:11:04,00:11:09,they've just found in the ruins of ancient Jerusalem a particular podium and there are a couple of
00:11:09,00:11:14,theories about its use. One is that it was a sort of speakers corner and the other is that it was a
00:11:14,00:11:19,lost property office because there are a couple of ancient Jewish texts which mention a stone of
00:11:19,00:11:24,claims and that's where you would go if you lost something and the idea is that you would tell an
00:11:24,00:11:29,announcer and then he would shout out to the crowd and see if anyone had found anything that was like
00:11:29,00:11:33,that and that was how you were reunited with your lost stuff in ancient Jerusalem. I just think
00:11:33,00:11:39,that's the best idea ever. Yeah that's how easy. Well you kind of need everyone in the country to be
00:11:39,00:11:43,stood around the guy at the time. It's not really going to work in London is it? That's the floor.
00:11:43,00:11:48,It's like it was never been tried in London. We've just found this out as well right? Yeah they've
00:11:48,00:11:52,just found the podium and so they're trying to work out what it was for so this is one of the theories
00:11:52,00:11:59,yeah. It's the wailing wall is in isn't it? Is that? I don't think that was originally a lost property.
00:11:59,00:12:08,I mean are we definitely sure about that? Whaling. It is a bit like town cryers I think. You know
00:12:08,00:12:13,you would have oh yay oh yay someone's lost so whatever that probably happened in the olden days.
00:12:13,00:12:20,True. In Gossler in Germany they had a town cryer who was employed to remind the local pop place
00:12:20,00:12:26,not to urinate or defecate into the river the day before the water was drawn for brewing beer
00:12:26,00:12:36,which I think we can all agree is a very useful job. There was a town cry there was a town cryer
00:12:36,00:12:41,called Keith Jackman of Christchurch and he has been deafened by the sound of his own bell.
00:12:41,00:12:49,He's been he's been doing the oh yay for 25 years. Oh he's gone deaf. That's really sad.
00:12:49,00:12:55,It is isn't it? He should have won those headphones the ear muffs that build as well. Yeah he should have done.
00:12:55,00:13:03,One idiot is the absolute worst kind of tenetus isn't it though it's just like
00:13:03,00:13:10,do you remember the guy I haven't I can't remember his name but when Prince George was born
00:13:10,00:13:15,was announced by town cryer and everyone's like oh this is fantastically old school this is wonderful
00:13:15,00:13:21,and it turns out it was just a guy who just decided to arrive and announce it and he is a town cryer
00:13:21,00:13:25,but in a very different town to where I was being announced and he just walked up it here he
00:13:25,00:13:29,he announced it and everyone's like oh it's just so nice and the royal family we're going who the
00:13:29,00:13:36,hell is this guy. Do you remember that? I hope he drove down all the way saying I've got to tell them
00:13:36,00:13:43,how else will they know? And the bells next to him with the car with a little seat bells on it.
00:13:45,00:13:47,Just you and me this time blender.
00:13:47,00:13:58,The town cryer championships I just think this is so amazing that these kind of things
00:13:58,00:14:03,have the budget for this. I've been there once. What? Did not place.
00:14:12,00:14:17,What? Do you know where they were held the last ones? The one I went to was in either
00:14:17,00:14:20,Lancashire or Yorkshire I can't remember. Cool the last one was in Bermuda so I feel like
00:14:20,00:14:24,Do you ever get the feeling you chose the wrong year?
00:14:24,00:14:31,I mean who was paying for town cryers good. Anyway this year this is the first time a Brit has won
00:14:31,00:14:37,the town cryer championships. It's very exciting. Mark Wiley beat off 24 what are those things?
00:14:40,00:14:42,I know what I like. Oh yeah!
00:14:42,00:15:01,It's one of the requirements these days. He actually said for the ego reasons we have to correct that.
00:15:03,00:15:15,Sorry so this guy won over and above 24 other contestants. What he won was an awful lot of rum he said
00:15:15,00:15:20,which I needed for medicinal purposes. He explained which is understandable after the trauma he'd
00:15:20,00:15:38,undergone. Oh god there's anyone got anything else lost and found? Yes. I've got stuff
00:15:38,00:15:48,I've lost and found. Okay. This story is this is from the BBC News website for Barkshire in 2011.
00:15:48,00:15:53,A mother has praised redding buses for finding and returning her son's sausage casserole.
00:15:53,00:16:05,Her son's sausage casserole I feel. After he left it on a bus.
00:16:13,00:16:22,Oh carry on. Suzanne start sent an email via social media network site Facebook to thank
00:16:22,00:16:28,staff at the bus company for saving her family's dinner. The sausage casserole which was made by
00:16:28,00:16:34,her son in his food technology class at school ended up in lost property. The casserole was retrieved
00:16:34,00:16:49,by Mrs. Stout and Eaton having taken an unscheduled route around West Redding which for my money is
00:16:49,00:16:56,the greatest story ever. That was the guy who did you read TFL published a couple of years ago
00:16:56,00:17:01,list of the most interesting stuff they've had in their lost property that's been claimed or not
00:17:01,00:17:06,claimed one of which was one of the most common items to have a lost property is false teeth which is
00:17:06,00:17:12,weird anyway people I don't know relax take them out leave them there anyway a man came back
00:17:12,00:17:18,claimed his false teeth took them away and then returned a few hours later grimacing and saying
00:17:18,00:17:27,how to do these online. You know that I'm Kent police are now saying that they're no longer accepting
00:17:28,00:17:33,lost property items and that you yeah yeah so if you if you bring them a lost property item they say
00:17:33,00:17:38,take it to Facebook or Twitter and you now have to tweet or Facebook the lost property item yeah
00:17:38,00:17:41,they no longer do it. Which really messes around with the law on lost property because the
00:17:41,00:17:46,you meant to take reasonable steps to return it to its owner and if you go to the police and then
00:17:46,00:17:50,several weeks pass and they haven't reunited it with its owner then you have the best claim on it
00:17:50,00:17:55,after the owner you are because you found it so I don't know how it works in the age of doing it on
00:17:55,00:18:01,social media if that's what qualifies as a reasonable effort. Yeah and very quickly there's a thing the
00:18:01,00:18:08,code of Hammurabi is the oldest legal code we have and it has a section on lost property so if
00:18:08,00:18:14,somebody finds something he's lost in the possession of another man right and the person who own has
00:18:14,00:18:19,it now bought it from a salesman and they've both got witnesses that they bought it honestly and
00:18:19,00:18:26,that they owned it before then since the seller was the thief he should be put to death. But
00:18:26,00:18:32,if the man who was found with the property couldn't produce the seller to make the sale but the
00:18:32,00:18:36,original owner did have witnesses then since the professed purchaser was a thief he should be put
00:18:36,00:18:46,to death. Finally I think you know where this is going. If you could not produce witnesses proving
00:18:46,00:18:50,that you in fact owned it before it was found in the possession of the other guy since he was a cheat
00:18:50,00:18:57,and stated a false report he shall be put to death. There's no there's no there's no scaling down
00:18:57,00:19:07,in this lost property. We need to move on. Okay it is time for our next fat and that is Chisinski.
00:19:07,00:19:12,Yes my fact is that the man who discovered why we sweat did so by getting in a
00:19:12,00:19:26,"sauna with a dog, a steak and an egg. And then it just came to him. I think you're going to have to"
00:19:26,00:19:32,explain Anna. So this is this guy called Charles Blackson who not very much has written about and so
00:19:32,00:19:39,he was a British physician in the late 18th century and he was invited actually to you know by
00:19:39,00:19:43,other scientists to get into their sauna and find out why we sweat and he decided when he persuaded
00:19:43,00:19:48,a whole bunch of friends to come in with him and he subjected himself to ridiculous temperatures.
00:19:48,00:19:58,So in in 1775 he went up to 127 degrees Celsius so way above boiling point. Sitting in the sauna
00:19:58,00:20:03,was found he was able to sit there. He was in one naked from the waist up and others he had to
00:20:03,00:20:07,wear clothes because otherwise your skin cinches. Were there any way he was naked from the waist down?
00:20:07,00:20:17,The dog is looking worried. But yeah so there was thought that how could he possibly have survived
00:20:17,00:20:21,this because people didn't know that humans could thermoregulate like we know we can now so how
00:20:21,00:20:26,could we possibly survive being 127 degrees Celsius. So there was an idea that the moment he must be
00:20:26,00:20:32,wrong so rather than get like a few thermometers in there to you know controls he invited in his dog
00:20:32,00:20:47,and an egg and some steak and and he found that the egg cooked extremely fast the steak cooked
00:20:47,00:20:58,even almost even faster so that when you got the dog 25 minutes of gas market no the dog's fine
00:20:58,00:21:02,because animals can thermoregulate but the way when you read his write-up of it it reads a bit like a
00:21:02,00:21:07,cooking a cookery book because it's mainly supposed to be focused on how well cooked the steak is
00:21:07,00:21:15,sitting in there but you know like 150 degrees C I mean he says we put eggs and beef steak in that
00:21:15,00:21:21,after 20 minutes the eggs were taken out roasted quite hard and 47 minutes the steak was not only
00:21:21,00:21:29,dressed but almost dry another beef steak was rather overdone in in 33 minutes and then in the evening
00:21:29,00:21:34,he explained you cook the steak even faster by using bellows to blow the hot air onto it and he
00:21:34,00:21:40,explained that the greatest part of the steak was pretty well done within 13 minutes so he's either
00:21:40,00:21:45,telling you how to cook steak well or he's explaining that humans can thermoregulate and in a way that
00:21:45,00:21:54,steak can't so yeah this is how he discovered that by sweating we are able to not boil to death when
00:21:54,00:21:58,temperatures reach the same way. I guess the story today is most famous for Blackdon's law
00:21:58,00:22:04,which is the idea that if you put salt in water it takes longer to boil yes that's what he's famous for
00:22:04,00:22:09,is that do they use that in freezing on the roads is it the same principle? It's kind of the same
00:22:09,00:22:15,principle yeah if you put salt in the ice it doesn't form as it's similar to that it's similar to when
00:22:15,00:22:21,people put salt into water to like boil pasta or something they think that the temperature will boil
00:22:21,00:22:26,lower but actually that's not really true you can put as much salt as you want like a hell of a lot of
00:22:26,00:22:31,salt into a bowl of pasta and it would change the boiling point by four hundredths of a degree
00:22:31,00:22:37,so early it'll make much difference but I read the article on him in the dictionary of national
00:22:37,00:22:43,biography and Dr. Johnson who wrote the dictionary said that he was a delightful fellow
00:22:43,00:22:48,this guy but there was another guy called Count Rumpford who didn't really like him as much
00:22:48,00:22:56,because Blackdon had fought against him for the hand of Levantier's wife so Antoine Levantier
00:22:56,00:23:02,who he was a person who there was an idea that people thought that when things burned there was
00:23:02,00:23:08,an element called flogiston and this was the element that allowed things to burn and then he died and
00:23:08,00:23:15,then his wife married this guy called Count Rumpford and weirdly he is the person who disproved that
00:23:15,00:23:20,something called caloric which was another element which was what happened when things heated up
00:23:20,00:23:28,happened so she was married to the guy who disproved flogiston which was a fake element for burning
00:23:28,00:23:34,and then was married to a guy who disproved caloric which was the fake elements for warming things up
00:23:34,00:23:41,wow that is really interesting but not funny she was the niche she had written niche taste
00:23:41,00:23:47,that really niche isn't it bizarrely I have a fact about Dr. Johnson and Sweat
00:23:47,00:23:54,great so in Dr. Johnson's dictionary the word Swellt as in Swellt are these days but the definition
00:23:54,00:23:58,for the word Swellt is to puff in sweat if that be the meaning
00:23:58,00:24:07,which I decide I'm the writer of the dictionary so it be the meaning
00:24:07,00:24:15,I was I was so the fact is about why don't people cook effectively when they're in a sauna
00:24:15,00:24:19,because that's what he was trying to find out well that's I mean that's slightly what he was trying
00:24:19,00:24:25,to find out it's it's okay it wasn't what he was trying to find out I have missed research
00:24:25,00:24:31,this fact it was more about how steaks do cook and yeah I was like humans how can you how can you
00:24:31,00:24:36,get this kind of heat and with the dog it was the the tongue that was panting that allowed for it to
00:24:36,00:24:40,regulate its heat I just I feel like we have to explain why that was confusing maybe to some
00:24:40,00:24:45,people and to you why when you say why don't people cook you mean why don't people themselves
00:24:45,00:24:49,oh cook when they're in a sauna it's not why don't people enter a sauna to make a fry up so roast in it
00:24:49,00:24:59,that's yeah that's so I googled how hot can a human get and did my photo come up
00:24:59,00:25:12,whether we're a lot of they were a lot of really interesting articles like they look like they were
00:25:12,00:25:18,right they look like they were good answers to the question but I got really distracted because you
00:25:18,00:25:30,know when you google something James make it from the wisdom so when you when you when you google
00:25:30,00:25:35,something at the very bottom when you scroll down it says related searches you know when you see
00:25:35,00:25:41,that yeah and then it gives you a new sentence you can say so I googled how hot can a human get
00:25:41,00:25:45,and the related search that I got was can a human get a dog pregnant
00:25:45,00:25:57,and I really want to do research for tonight and the facts but that is Charles Bladden discovered two
00:25:57,00:26:03,things in that sauna the answer to the second was no
00:26:03,00:26:10,well that's a thing kid you get a dog pregnant was that someone is that a lot of people typing that
00:26:10,00:26:15,out of curiosity or are they worried
00:26:15,00:26:24,didn't say it didn't say but it is interesting that all dogs can mate successfully with all other dogs
00:26:24,00:26:33,that is true isn't it yeah yeah I just find that amazing yeah like it's like a tiny chihuahua can
00:26:33,00:26:39,mate with that a massive yeah great and make a new dog right make it that's the point of it
00:26:39,00:26:50,oh we've got a lot of explaining to do one of the shows over
00:27:01,00:27:08,do you know in Finland there's a sauna elf so we've spoken about this on the podcast before
00:27:08,00:27:15,Finland loves saunas like crazy their parliament has a sauna and a lot of very big moments have
00:27:15,00:27:19,happened in a sauna when they've been negotiating they'll go let's go to the sauna and they'll
00:27:19,00:27:25,sit it out until they decide but part of their there there's an equivalent of the boogie man
00:27:25,00:27:32,in Finland which is the sauna elf and he's called sauna tonto and I'm sure in a different accent
00:27:32,00:27:41,and sauna tonto basically if you're naughty in a in a sauna he'll he'll burn it down and kill everyone
00:27:48,00:27:59,um yep so on the front you better watch so not tonto's coming to the town
00:27:59,00:28:03,and he's burning the sauna down
00:28:03,00:28:09,yeah that rhyme that's very good
00:28:09,00:28:17,we're gonna have to move on to our final facts okay time for our final facts and that is
00:28:17,00:28:27,james okay my fact this week is that stick insect sex can last for 79 days and the insects are stuck
00:28:27,00:28:37,together the whole time wow that's like sting and his wife right is not he is that tantric
00:28:37,00:28:45,I think I think you've got confused it stings yeah so um stick insects you would think they're
00:28:45,00:28:51,really boring but actually they have quite well-lengthy sex I wouldn't I would say it's that exciting
00:28:51,00:29:00,I think yeah I don't suppose um stick insects could probably like have sex that quickly because
00:29:00,00:29:11,they might set each other on fire it's a really good point yeah um but these guys um they're
00:29:11,00:29:19,the genitalia are in contact for 40% of the time of the 79 days so they are kind of you know
00:29:19,00:29:27,at it for one more time I read a theory that the males drag it out so as to stop other males from
00:29:27,00:29:34,mating with the female yes I read that from a entomologist blogger called bug girl which is where
00:29:34,00:29:40,I got this fact from originally but she actually found several reports of stick insect group sex
00:29:40,00:29:47,in the literature which means that maybe he's not trying to keep it in the in the couple
00:29:47,00:29:53,that's why dogs do it though right so if anyone's had a dog who's made it um dogs can stay attached
00:29:53,00:30:00,to their bitches for up to 40 45 minutes um standard and it's it's so that another dog
00:30:00,00:30:07,all the other could get away with that sentence these are just zoological terms guys
00:30:08,00:30:13,um but you know that's to stop another dog getting getting too involved yeah um so sometimes other
00:30:13,00:30:19,males do sneak up not in a in that way but just to try and sneak in when the first male breaks off
00:30:19,00:30:24,to feed as sometimes happens um and the intruder will start having sex with the female but then if
00:30:24,00:30:28,the first male finds out the two of them will have a fight while both holding on to the female
00:30:28,00:30:37,they'll pass at each other with their legs that's so distracting what is going on back there
00:30:38,00:30:48,[laughter]
00:30:48,00:30:58,anyway so this isn't this actually isn't true of all stick insect sex it's true of a lot of them
00:30:58,00:31:07,um but there is a stick insect called um ecstato soma tia ratum um and the females of that species
00:31:08,00:31:13,can reproduce without the need of males so they can like auto reproduce but no one seems to have
00:31:13,00:31:20,told the males so the males find the females really attractive and try to mate with them whenever
00:31:20,00:31:26,possible but the females have involved an anti-afridiziac to keep the males away and when eventually
00:31:26,00:31:30,they manage to get past the anti-afridiziac and they mount them they can kick them with their
00:31:30,00:31:35,back legs to get them off because they just want to say no no we don't need you guys we can just
00:31:35,00:31:40,have sex on our own and then so i think these this is actually very confusing to evolutionary
00:31:40,00:31:46,biologists because usually asexual reproduction evolves because of a lack of males and so you know
00:31:46,00:31:51,a female race actually reproduce but really you want the male to be there because of diversity of
00:31:51,00:31:56,genes but yeah these stick insects are saying no we actually way prefer it this way we'll just
00:31:56,00:32:03,create clans of ourselves who are very easy to get along with um yeah they bat them off and it's
00:32:03,00:32:08,this kind of conundrum like aren't they going to outlast males are these male so i think it's the
00:32:08,00:32:15,spiny leaf stick insects in Australia um will the males die out first or will they evolve to manage
00:32:15,00:32:21,to i don't know like assault the women enough that they can still because if the male managers
00:32:21,00:32:25,have sex with the female they produce both male and female offspring because the active fertilized
00:32:25,00:32:31,and if the if it's just the female producing pathogenesis then they only produce clothes
00:32:31,00:32:36,to themselves who are obviously all females so it's a real um genuine but like utopia versus dystopia
00:32:36,00:32:41,kind of all female world versus yeah i wouldn't call that dystopian or rather i mean
00:32:41,00:32:50,do you want to hear something cool about sticking sex uh eggs so some of the eggs have the special
00:32:50,00:32:56,capsule of the sort of fat another good tasty stuff called a capitulum at one end of them
00:32:56,00:33:00,and ants like eating the capitulum bit so they carry the eggs back to their nest
00:33:00,00:33:06,and they eat the capitulum bit and then they throw the eggs onto a kind of rubbish heap where they
00:33:06,00:33:10,remain incubating and they can stay incubating for up to a year and then the baby's uh
00:33:10,00:33:16,stick insects just hatch and then they walk out of the nest and um i i read that this was compared to
00:33:16,00:33:21,paying a babysitter to look after your eggs um to look after your offspring but it's not really because
00:33:21,00:33:26,i think that is the equivalent of leaving your child abandoned but with a tubular attached
00:33:28,00:33:34,that someone who likes a tubular able say oh i love a tubular owner i just take this on what's this
00:33:34,00:33:45,on the to understand it is the worst parenting in the world i've ever had this it shook off
00:33:45,00:33:51,your own child because the ants do eat some of the eggs i mean yeah yeah they will they will eat
00:33:51,00:33:55,thinking they're edible so yeah it is saying look this guy might eat you but if he doesn't then
00:33:55,00:34:03,you might be okay uh i'm off i was i was probably when i was researching today i was looking into
00:34:03,00:34:11,pictures of stick insects and something i think that's not said enough is it's really weird day
00:34:11,00:34:16,like they're they look like it's they look like sticks well yeah they look like trees have become
00:34:16,00:34:22,conscious and we're just not acknowledging it it's just they do it just looks like a bit of stick is
00:34:22,00:34:27,gone i'm alive oh my god what is the world going on here and we probably an insect it's just an
00:34:27,00:34:37,insect no it the tree has woken up like if you if you had two stick insects having sex for 79 days
00:34:37,00:34:44,attached to each other how do you know it's not just two sticks yeah exactly what have you been
00:34:44,00:34:49,watering it the whole time and they're just like we're trying to have sex here and you know who's
00:34:49,00:34:54,this guy every day it is difficult for researchers to find stick insects because they're nocturnal
00:34:54,00:35:01,and they pretend to be sticks and so it is quite hard to study them um and you know the best thing
00:35:01,00:35:10,is a lot of stick insect eggs look like seeds how cool is that yeah extra camouflage nice smart it's
00:35:10,00:35:16,not they are conscious trees that much happens we're all dancing around it because if two mind
00:35:16,00:35:21,blowing for us to accept oh their children look like seeds they're fucking seeds
00:35:21,00:35:31,do you think that all things that are camouflage directly the thing that they're camouflage against
00:35:31,00:35:36,we're not camouflage look at us there's no camouflage on us and there's a stick walking pass me
00:35:36,00:35:42,and i think i know that's that makes sense but if you have like an arctic fox which is camouflage
00:35:42,00:35:48,just snow you don't think oh my god snow it's not like it's not like an iceberg walking pass me
00:35:48,00:35:58,being like a high iceberg fox i feel we might have hit a nerve here
00:35:58,00:36:05,um we found a stick insect which is a hundred and twenty six million years old older than a lot of
00:36:05,00:36:23,don't i think that's just a stick do you know more about this
00:36:23,00:36:28,no well the cool thing is about it is that um we know that a lot of them imitate flowering plants
00:36:28,00:36:37,and um we know flowering sticks and we know we know what plant it would have mimicked because we
00:36:37,00:36:42,if its wings were folded it would have looked like a stripy tongue and there was the worst stripy
00:36:42,00:36:46,tongue looking plants around at the time and we know those in the fossil record and we know this
00:36:46,00:36:50,and we can kind of imagine what it would look like yeah it's just so cool i think that's really cool
00:36:50,00:36:55,and there are three thousand species in the genus which includes stick insects and leaf insects
00:36:55,00:36:58,which is another kind of insect
00:36:58,00:37:09,um there's so this is one extraordinary stick insect uh which was thought to have gone extinct on
00:37:09,00:37:14,lord howe island which is in south pacific uh thought of gone extinct in 1920 um so it used to
00:37:14,00:37:20,be known as the tree lobster because it's absolutely enormous it's 12 centimeters long on average
00:37:20,00:37:26,i also heard that it was known as a walking sausage oh yeah i think it also ima take sausages
00:37:26,00:37:33,down to next friday i'm just going to be like yeah i mean i do a lot of stick work but i also dabble
00:37:33,00:37:37,and sausage stuff i mean i do a lot of stick work but i also dabble and sausage stuff
00:37:37,00:37:42,i wish that was the first time i'd ever heard you say that i mean
00:37:48,00:37:54,so these stick insects we thought it disappeared these giant insects in 1920 and very recently in
00:37:54,00:37:59,them within the last 10 years so there were rumors that they were still existed on balls pyramid
00:37:59,00:38:04,which is a pyramid that jots out of the ocean very near to this uh this south pacific island
00:38:04,00:38:08,and these four Australians went to investigate these rumors and see if these giant stick insects
00:38:08,00:38:13,that existed they climbed up this vertical rock face and they found under one bush these
00:38:13,00:38:18,stick insects have been living for almost a hundred years they found 24 insects under one plant one single
00:38:18,00:38:22,plant um and we don't know how they got there people think they might have hitchhiked over on birds
00:38:22,00:38:29,which i quite like wow yeah and so now they really want to reintroduce them to laud howe island
00:38:29,00:38:33,and the reason they went extinct in the first place is because there were loads there was a rat
00:38:33,00:38:38,infestation that we introduced and now laud howe islanders are being faced with the choice between
00:38:38,00:38:44,would you like to keep your horrible rat infestation um or would you like us to get rid of that in
00:38:44,00:38:54,exchange for giant horrific looking stick insects the size of your head i'm gonna wrap us up very soon
00:38:54,00:39:02,so uh anyone else got anything i just on duration of uh copulation uh there is a map of the US that's
00:39:02,00:39:08,been compiled because there's an app where you can report how long your sex lasts in america
00:39:08,00:39:14,um and then there's a map of the US which tells you which states have the longest sex um and so
00:39:14,00:39:21,which states are the biggest liars well i don't know if anyone's lying because they they are not long
00:39:21,00:39:37,freshingly honest new mexico wins um copulation last 7.01 minutes on average Alaska loses the average
00:39:37,00:39:41,copulation is 1.21 minutes yeah but it's cold it's cold
00:39:41,00:39:46,you want to get back inside don't you
00:39:46,00:39:56,only alfresco for some
00:39:56,00:40:06,okay that's it that's all of our facts thank you so much for listening at home thank you so
00:40:06,00:40:10,much for being here tonight if you want to get in contact with us about any of the things that
00:40:10,00:40:14,we've said over the course of this podcast we can all be found on twitter i'm on at shriverland
00:40:14,00:40:21,andy at andru hunter m james at x8 chazinski you can email podcastaqi.com
00:40:21,00:40:27,yep and uh we also have a website no such thing as a fish.com we've got all of our previous episodes up
00:40:27,00:40:30,there go to that if you want to hear previous episodes thank you so much for being here guys
00:40:30,00:40:35,that was really fun uh we're gonna be back again next week with another episode we'll see you then
