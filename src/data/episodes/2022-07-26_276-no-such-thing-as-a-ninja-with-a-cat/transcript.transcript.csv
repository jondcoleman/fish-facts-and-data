00:00:25,00:00:35,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:35,00:00:38,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:38,00:00:39,and James Harkin.
00:00:39,00:00:42,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:42,00:00:44,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:44,00:00:47,"And in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:47,00:00:49,"Starting with you, Andy."
00:00:49,00:00:52,My fact is that Sweden's public art body
00:00:52,00:00:54,"has just commissioned an artwork, which"
00:00:54,00:00:57,will hire someone to do nothing at Gothenburg's
00:00:57,00:01:01,course of art and train station for the next 120 years.
00:01:01,00:01:03,[APPLAUSE]
00:01:03,00:01:08,120 years.
00:01:08,00:01:09,120 years.
00:01:09,00:01:10,120 years.
00:01:10,00:01:12,So that can't be the same person for 120 years.
00:01:12,00:01:13,"Well, it might be."
00:01:13,00:01:16,We don't know about medical advances in the next century.
00:01:16,00:01:17,That's true.
00:01:17,00:01:18,So this is a thing.
00:01:18,00:01:19,It's called eternal employment.
00:01:19,00:01:22,And Gothenburg has a new train station called Coursesvarkin.
00:01:22,00:01:24,"And I don't know if you can tell the home,"
00:01:24,00:01:25,but people here are very excited about it.
00:01:25,00:01:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:28,00:01:31,There was a competition to provide a public artwork.
00:01:31,00:01:33,"And there were two artists who won, called Simon Golden"
00:01:33,00:01:34,and Jacob Senneby.
00:01:34,00:01:37,And they have half a million pounds to spend.
00:01:37,00:01:39,And they spent it on hiring an employee
00:01:39,00:01:42,"to do whatever they like, forever."
00:01:42,00:01:45,"As long as you check in and check out of your work each day,"
00:01:45,00:01:49,"you will get 21,600 Kroner a month, which"
00:01:49,00:01:52,is enough to buy five beers here.
00:01:52,00:01:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:01:55,00:01:58,"But then the application-- you can still go for this,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,by the way.
00:01:59,00:02:04,"The application deadline is the 15th of December, 2025."
00:02:04,00:02:04,OK?
00:02:04,00:02:05,Yeah.
00:02:05,00:02:06,And their duties will be taken up.
00:02:06,00:02:10,"Well, the black of duties will be taken up on the 15th of March,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,2026.
00:02:12,00:02:13,OK.
00:02:13,00:02:14,"So if you're bad with deadlines like me,"
00:02:14,00:02:17,you can put that off for another six years.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"And there's a job description online, which is quite poetic."
00:02:21,00:02:23,"It goes, there's a scent."
00:02:23,00:02:24,Do you smell it?
00:02:24,00:02:26,The scent of something.
00:02:26,00:02:27,We smell it.
00:02:27,00:02:28,It's seaweed.
00:02:28,00:02:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:31,00:02:36,You're seaweed.
00:02:36,00:02:37,You want to be seaweed.
00:02:37,00:02:39,You shall be seaweed.
00:02:39,00:02:41,You know that.
00:02:41,00:02:42,Thank you for knowing.
00:02:42,00:02:44,Thank you for seaweed.
00:02:44,00:02:48,"You're standing there, right there, standing like what?"
00:02:48,00:02:50,Like a prawn.
00:02:50,00:02:52,A positive prawn.
00:02:52,00:02:54,A flexible prawn.
00:02:54,00:02:56,An unpretentious prawn.
00:02:56,00:02:58,A goal-oriented prawn.
00:02:58,00:02:59,Thank you.
00:02:59,00:03:02,Thanks.
00:03:02,00:03:03,Wow.
00:03:03,00:03:05,So I think that tells you everything that you
00:03:05,00:03:07,have to do for this shelf.
00:03:07,00:03:09,Any questions?
00:03:09,00:03:12,Does that sound more normal in Swedish?
00:03:12,00:03:15,Google translates on a hell of a job.
00:03:15,00:03:16,So I like that.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"The way it's going to be, as well, is once the station"
00:03:18,00:03:21,"is open, the applicant has been chosen,"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"and he's got, or she has, residency of the job."
00:03:24,00:03:26,There's going to be fluorescent lights that go on
00:03:26,00:03:29,"on the station level, or the platform levels,"
00:03:29,00:03:32,to let all passengers know that the person doing nothing
00:03:32,00:03:36,"is at work, that they're here either doing something,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,or absolutely nothing.
00:03:37,00:03:40,"And you can't tell who they are if they're on the platforms,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,but there's going to be two rooms that they can go to.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"One is a glass room, where you can see what they're doing,"
00:03:46,00:03:50,"and the other is just a closed-off room, which they can just"
00:03:50,00:03:51,"choose to sit in, and you never see."
00:03:51,00:03:53,"But actually, they don't have to stay"
00:03:53,00:03:55,on in the train station at all.
00:03:55,00:03:56,"As long as they clock in and clock out,"
00:03:56,00:03:57,they could bug a rough all day.
00:03:57,00:03:58,"Yeah, that's it."
00:03:58,00:04:00,But there are things you can't do.
00:04:00,00:04:02,So you can't go and get another job.
00:04:02,00:04:05,That is seen as not playing the game.
00:04:05,00:04:08,"But the job does come with a pension, and with holiday."
00:04:08,00:04:11,So you've got a holiday from doing nothing.
00:04:11,00:04:14,It's not actually a brilliant paid job.
00:04:14,00:04:14,It's fine.
00:04:14,00:04:19,But if the salary is really below average--
00:04:19,00:04:23,"And I work it in 120 years, it's going to be worth literally."
00:04:23,00:04:24,"Well, it's going up."
00:04:24,00:04:25,It's going up within 30 years.
00:04:25,00:04:27,By 3% a year.
00:04:27,00:04:31,"And if you die, they will just give the job to something else."
00:04:31,00:04:32,Yeah.
00:04:32,00:04:36,"I think that's how jobs work, generally."
00:04:36,00:04:40,"Every company folds, but everyone dies."
00:04:40,00:04:42,"I guess we need to retire that role, though."
00:04:42,00:04:45,Persons serving at the counter of McDonald's.
00:04:45,00:04:49,It's just going to have to be an empty counter now.
00:04:49,00:04:51,"But we should see what his purpose is, really."
00:04:51,00:04:53,Which they are making a point.
00:04:53,00:04:56,So it's inspired by Thomas Piketty's capital
00:04:56,00:04:57,in the 21st century.
00:04:57,00:05:00,"That very trendy book for anyone claiming to be academic,"
00:05:00,00:05:04,or some just-- so it's about the return on capital
00:05:04,00:05:07,being higher than the average increase in wages.
00:05:07,00:05:11,"So it's basically-- there's this art prize money, which"
00:05:11,00:05:12,"was $7 million, or I think."
00:05:12,00:05:14,And the idea is that they're going to invest that.
00:05:14,00:05:16,And the return on that investment is going
00:05:16,00:05:19,to yield that personal salary for 120 years.
00:05:19,00:05:23,So the idea is money makes more money than humans do.
00:05:23,00:05:25,Which is depressing.
00:05:25,00:05:29,But still fun for that person who's doing the job.
00:05:29,00:05:31,Can I say a very quick thing about?
00:05:31,00:05:35,So this is art meets train station.
00:05:35,00:05:40,And so the most ambitious crossover in the history.
00:05:40,00:05:46,And so I was looking into sort of entertaining art sort
00:05:46,00:05:47,of things that we're going on with train stations.
00:05:47,00:05:50,"And I read this fact, which is in London, in our underground"
00:05:50,00:05:54,"station, we have the very famous iconic Mind the Gap,"
00:05:54,00:05:56,"Mind the Gap, which is set."
00:05:56,00:05:58,"So when that was initially recorded,"
00:05:58,00:06:00,it was recorded by a sound engineer called Peter Lodge.
00:06:00,00:06:03,And he got an actor who was a well-known actor of the time.
00:06:03,00:06:04,And he got into recording.
00:06:04,00:06:07,He recorded Mind the Gap and Stan Clear of the Doors.
00:06:07,00:06:10,"And after it was recorded, and they were sort of getting"
00:06:10,00:06:12,"it ready to send it out, the guy suddenly said,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,I want royalties for every time.
00:06:14,00:06:16,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:16,00:06:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:06:17,00:06:18,"And they went, you can't have that."
00:06:18,00:06:19,That's insane.
00:06:19,00:06:20,"And he said, no, that's my deal."
00:06:20,00:06:22,So they cut him off.
00:06:22,00:06:23,And they were going to re-record it.
00:06:23,00:06:26,"But they listened to the recording of the sound engineer,"
00:06:26,00:06:30,"Peter Lodge, who was testing the microphones going mind the gap."
00:06:30,00:06:31,"And they went, that's good enough."
00:06:31,00:06:33,And he became--
00:06:33,00:06:37,"He was the original voice of the London Underground,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,"the sound engineer, testing the microphones."
00:06:39,00:06:40,That's great.
00:06:40,00:06:40,Yeah.
00:06:40,00:06:44,"Because we have a very, quite a famous thing in London"
00:06:44,00:06:46,about the Mind the Gap announcement.
00:06:46,00:06:48,"Maybe the station announcement at one station,"
00:06:48,00:06:50,"I can't remember which, which is recorded by a guy"
00:06:50,00:06:51,who died a few years ago.
00:06:51,00:06:54,And then they changed the recording
00:06:54,00:06:56,because someone else got it.
00:06:56,00:06:57,They thought they'd jazz up the station.
00:06:57,00:07:00,"And the widow of the guy who died wrote to the station,"
00:07:00,00:07:00,didn't she?
00:07:00,00:07:02,"And said, please, can you change that back?"
00:07:02,00:07:04,That's the only time I hear my husband's voice.
00:07:04,00:07:06,"Yeah, his name was Oswald Lawrence."
00:07:06,00:07:07,It was in Bankman station.
00:07:07,00:07:08,It was on the Northern line.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"And they changed it back so she could always hear his voice,"
00:07:11,00:07:11,saying it.
00:07:11,00:07:13,"Yeah, that's really nice."
00:07:13,00:07:14,Yeah.
00:07:14,00:07:18,"Speaking of London, so there's--"
00:07:18,00:07:22,"Oh, it's kept in practical, too."
00:07:22,00:07:24,You're not even going to like where this goes.
00:07:24,00:07:26,"I'm going to say, so if you live in London,"
00:07:26,00:07:29,there's another job you can get which seems quite cushy.
00:07:29,00:07:33,It is to become a luxury product tester.
00:07:33,00:07:39,"For that, you get a $75,000 salary, which is about $100,000."
00:07:39,00:07:44,And you get to test supercars yachts and private islands.
00:07:44,00:07:45,Wow.
00:07:45,00:07:49,"OK, so this morning I applied for this job."
00:07:49,00:07:52,"Let's see, you look up jobs testing luxury islands."
00:07:52,00:07:56,I found out there is a man whose job is to watch paint drying.
00:07:56,00:07:59,And he's a real person.
00:07:59,00:08:01,He's called Keith Jackson.
00:08:01,00:08:03,And he works for an industrial paint firm.
00:08:03,00:08:06,And a big part of his job is assessing
00:08:06,00:08:09,the drying time of industrial paint.
00:08:09,00:08:10,"And that doesn't sound important, does it?"
00:08:10,00:08:11,But I really can't.
00:08:11,00:08:13,"He must have been watching it the whole time, has he?"
00:08:13,00:08:15,He might have a break.
00:08:15,00:08:16,He'll probably have a break.
00:08:16,00:08:17,"Imagine if he has a break for 15 minutes,"
00:08:17,00:08:20,he comes back and he's already trying.
00:08:20,00:08:23,"That's a bad pay in the office, isn't it?"
00:08:23,00:08:24,Fuck say.
00:08:24,00:08:25,Do you think paint is like a watch pot?
00:08:25,00:08:29,Do you think it boils as soon as your back is turned?
00:08:29,00:08:32,"No, the reason it's important that it happens"
00:08:32,00:08:34,is because sometimes paint things.
00:08:34,00:08:37,And then you need to know how long the paint will take to be dry.
00:08:37,00:08:39,"So, for example, loved and underground,"
00:08:39,00:08:42,they can only be painted stations between three o'clock
00:08:42,00:08:44,and five o'clock in the morning.
00:08:44,00:08:46,And then it has to be dry enough to walk on.
00:08:46,00:08:48,So this is a very high-stake situation.
00:08:48,00:08:49,Wow.
00:08:49,00:08:54,"And the high-stakes and medium, low to medium, the medium."
00:08:54,00:08:58,But he said people do love and find it amusing
00:08:58,00:09:00,when I tell them what I do.
00:09:00,00:09:02,He said it could be described as the most boring job
00:09:02,00:09:05,"in the world, but it is a very important one."
00:09:05,00:09:07,"Watching paint dry sounds quite easy,"
00:09:07,00:09:09,but it can be stressful at times.
00:09:09,00:09:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:09:12,00:09:15,"So also while you're looking at jobs of watching paint dry,"
00:09:15,00:09:19,I was looking at jobs of watching pornography.
00:09:19,00:09:22,And apparently there's a nightclub in Denmark
00:09:22,00:09:25,that's hiring someone to watch 20 hours of pornographic films
00:09:25,00:09:28,"for 2,500 pounds equivalent."
00:09:28,00:09:31,And the reason is they want to select the best parts
00:09:31,00:09:33,"of the soundtrack that they'll make a playlist of,"
00:09:33,00:09:37,that they'll play in the nightclub bathroom.
00:09:37,00:09:40,"Sure, there's the reason."
00:09:40,00:09:43,I've been looking at some kind of jobs
00:09:43,00:09:47,"of sound, some people who are kind of lazy at work."
00:09:47,00:09:49,"So this obviously would suit this job,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,but the train station would suit someone who's quite lazy at work.
00:09:51,00:09:54,There've been some good people who have been in the past.
00:09:54,00:09:58,So there was a civil servant called Carlos Retio.
00:09:58,00:09:59,He was a Spanish civil servant.
00:09:59,00:10:01,He skipped work for a decade.
00:10:01,00:10:04,He used to clock in at 7.30 in the morning.
00:10:04,00:10:05,And then he'd returned to work to clock out
00:10:05,00:10:06,at 4 in the afternoon.
00:10:06,00:10:09,So he's perfect for this station job.
00:10:09,00:10:11,He took home a 50 grand salary.
00:10:11,00:10:14,"And he then, when he was caught, and it was discovered"
00:10:14,00:10:17,that he'd just been skipping work for over 10 years.
00:10:17,00:10:19,He then admitted to it fine.
00:10:19,00:10:22,And then there was an art exhibition put on in the town
00:10:22,00:10:24,that used a council venue.
00:10:24,00:10:27,"And the exhibition was called Love for Valencia,"
00:10:27,00:10:29,the works of a man who never worked.
00:10:29,00:10:31,And it was booked under what turned out to be a fake name.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"And they discovered later it was put on by him,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,"this man who skipped work the whole time,"
00:10:36,00:10:39,as kind of a peon to his own glory
00:10:39,00:10:41,and having skipped work.
00:10:41,00:10:43,"And there were paintings, there were sculptures,"
00:10:43,00:10:47,and there were bronze busts of this man talking about
00:10:47,00:10:49,how he succeeded in not working.
00:10:49,00:10:51,The council discovered that it was him who booked it
00:10:51,00:10:52,and they canceled it.
00:10:52,00:10:54,But he discovered that he got no charges.
00:10:54,00:10:55,He got no big fine.
00:10:55,00:10:57,He was suspended from work.
00:10:57,00:10:59,Not even fired.
00:10:59,00:11:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:00,00:11:03,"Speaking of doing nothing, there is a hotel with a,"
00:11:03,00:11:06,"or the was, the hotel's so success"
00:11:06,00:11:08,but they used to have a suite called the Checkout Suite.
00:11:08,00:11:11,"And if you did nothing and you use no internet,"
00:11:11,00:11:14,then you'd get the suite for free.
00:11:14,00:11:17,"OK, so it worked out how much internet you were using"
00:11:17,00:11:18,and how much work you were doing.
00:11:18,00:11:21,"And if you used the time to just relax and do nothing,"
00:11:21,00:11:22,they gave it you for free.
00:11:22,00:11:26,"This was the Hotel Ballora, which is in Gothenburg,"
00:11:26,00:11:30,"which is the hotel where staying, and at the moment, yes."
00:11:30,00:11:33,So I spoke to the receptionist this afternoon.
00:11:33,00:11:35,"And she said, it ran for three months"
00:11:35,00:11:37,and every single person who went there
00:11:37,00:11:38,managed to get it for free.
00:11:38,00:11:39,Wow.
00:11:39,00:11:41,There must be something that the people of Gothenburg
00:11:41,00:11:44,"are just quite happy sitting around going, you know what?"
00:11:44,00:11:45,I'm just going to fill.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"You know what, if you've got a few sheets of slightly damp paint,"
00:11:48,00:11:49,the time flies by.
00:11:49,00:11:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:11:53,00:11:56,"OK, it is time for fact number two."
00:11:56,00:11:59,And that is Chazinsky.
00:11:59,00:12:03,"Yes, my fact this week is that Ninjas sword sheaths"
00:12:03,00:12:07,"had removable tips so that if they ever had to hide underwater,"
00:12:07,00:12:10,they could use them like a snorkel to breathe.
00:12:10,00:12:11,That's so cool.
00:12:11,00:12:12,It's so great.
00:12:12,00:12:14,"And so they brought the sword with them as well, right?"
00:12:14,00:12:16,"Yeah, yeah, you do bring the sword."
00:12:16,00:12:17,That's the main thing.
00:12:17,00:12:18,But it's basically being an ninja
00:12:18,00:12:20,was all about kind of adapting to your environment.
00:12:20,00:12:25,It was like being a sort of 15-17 century Japanese James Bond.
00:12:25,00:12:26,It really was.
00:12:26,00:12:27,They had all these gadgets.
00:12:27,00:12:29,And one of them was the sword.
00:12:29,00:12:31,"And the scabbard, they would use it like a snorkel,"
00:12:31,00:12:35,because hiding underwater was a major part of being an ninja.
00:12:35,00:12:37,And so what?
00:12:37,00:12:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:12:40,00:12:44,"I find it hard to put this into words, but what?"
00:12:44,00:12:46,"So why would you need to be underwater, as much?"
00:12:46,00:12:50,"So basically, what an ninja was was,"
00:12:50,00:12:53,it was sort of like the flip side of a samurai.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"So samurai in Japan were very well respected,"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"honorable, noble fighters."
00:12:58,00:13:01,"And the ninja was the sneaky, mercenary agent."
00:13:01,00:13:04,"They were very, very looked down upon at the time"
00:13:04,00:13:05,"they were around, which, and they were,"
00:13:05,00:13:09,they had their heyday the 15th or 17th century in Japan.
00:13:09,00:13:10,And their function was basically espionage.
00:13:10,00:13:13,So they were spies and deception and surprise attack
00:13:13,00:13:14,and covert methods.
00:13:14,00:13:17,And they did a lot of hiding and running away.
00:13:17,00:13:18,And one of their main ways of hiding
00:13:18,00:13:20,was using the water.
00:13:20,00:13:22,So certain ninja texts from the time
00:13:22,00:13:25,"advise that in daytime, hide underwater."
00:13:25,00:13:27,So it's not to be seen.
00:13:27,00:13:28,You just spend the whole day underwater.
00:13:28,00:13:29,Really?
00:13:29,00:13:31,And so you need this snorkel-like thing
00:13:31,00:13:32,on the end of your sword.
00:13:32,00:13:35,And so the scabbard end can double as a breathing tube.
00:13:35,00:13:38,"One of the texts that I read, advising ninjas,"
00:13:38,00:13:40,"said that the end of your scabbard,"
00:13:40,00:13:42,"if you had the removable tip taken off,"
00:13:42,00:13:44,could also be a hearing aid or a megaphone.
00:13:44,00:13:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:13:45,00:13:46,Cool.
00:13:46,00:13:47,Wow.
00:13:47,00:13:48,That's fantastic.
00:13:48,00:13:50,I could also be used as a step ladder
00:13:50,00:13:52,for climbing golf offenses.
00:13:52,00:13:52,"Oh, yeah."
00:13:52,00:13:54,"Well, you'd sort of jab it into the wall."
00:13:54,00:13:58,"I think it might be, what I imagine that this might be wrong,"
00:13:58,00:14:00,because this just came out of my imagination.
00:14:00,00:14:02,"But, you know, like with a sword,"
00:14:02,00:14:05,you have that like crossbit that kind of hides your hand.
00:14:05,00:14:08,"But if you turn it upside down, you could just step on it."
00:14:08,00:14:11,"Oh, I thought even if you stabbed it into the wall,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,you could bounce off the sword.
00:14:13,00:14:14,Yes.
00:14:14,00:14:18,And I tell you a cool thing that ninjas could do.
00:14:18,00:14:19,So ninjas had incredible abilities
00:14:19,00:14:20,according to the old texts.
00:14:20,00:14:21,One other thing they could do is they
00:14:21,00:14:26,could tell the time of day by looking at a cat's eye.
00:14:26,00:14:28,So if you asked a ninja what time is it?
00:14:28,00:14:29,And the cat was around.
00:14:29,00:14:31,They could look at the cat.
00:14:31,00:14:33,"And they would study the people of the eye,"
00:14:33,00:14:36,which changes during the day according to the sun.
00:14:36,00:14:38,"And if they can't see the cat, it's nighttime."
00:14:38,00:14:40,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:40,00:14:41,Yeah?
00:14:41,00:14:46,[APPLAUSE]
00:14:46,00:14:48,"What, that didn't happen, did it?"
00:14:48,00:14:52,You would have to have a cat on you at all times.
00:14:52,00:14:56,It's more difficult to carry a cat around to know the time
00:14:56,00:15:00,than it is to just guess the time.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"But it would be a party trick, as you would say."
00:15:03,00:15:07,"Well, then everyone on the party knows you're a ninja, don't they?"
00:15:07,00:15:08,They didn't go to parties.
00:15:08,00:15:11,Their whole raison d'etre was conceiting their identity.
00:15:11,00:15:14,"Oh, it's just cool as a James Bond of--"
00:15:14,00:15:15,That's what James Bond did.
00:15:15,00:15:20,You can't keep a cat on the water.
00:15:20,00:15:22,They hate the water.
00:15:22,00:15:25,They can do that.
00:15:25,00:15:28,"So patronized by these guys sometimes,"
00:15:28,00:15:29,they could read cat's eyes.
00:15:29,00:15:31,And also--
00:15:31,00:15:33,So can we just decancise actually change according to the--
00:15:33,00:15:34,I do.
00:15:34,00:15:37,They do very slightly because of the amount of likes on the letter.
00:15:37,00:15:39,"Yeah, but that's not a reliable indicator of time, is it?"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"Because if you're in a dark room, but it's midday,"
00:15:42,00:15:46,"and you look at the cat and the cat's eyes are massive,"
00:15:46,00:15:48,"you think, oh, great, it's nighttime, I can leave my dark room."
00:15:48,00:15:49,It's nice.
00:15:49,00:15:51,"Midday, you're going to be spotted immediately."
00:15:51,00:15:54,"No, but this is a completely unworkable system."
00:15:54,00:15:55,It's not a system.
00:15:55,00:15:57,[APPLAUSE]
00:15:57,00:16:00,So I'm so angry.
00:16:00,00:16:03,It's like saying they have an ability.
00:16:03,00:16:05,"Oh, they're going to do it 24 hours a day."
00:16:05,00:16:06,It must be a lie.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"It's-- you know, they do it when a cat's around, like that's--"
00:16:09,00:16:11,I can do stuff when a cat's around that I
00:16:11,00:16:14,won't need to do when it's not around.
00:16:14,00:16:18,"We don't need to know about you, probably, though."
00:16:18,00:16:20,This might be a good moment to mention
00:16:20,00:16:23,"that it's very difficult to study ninjas,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,because there's little side evidence
00:16:24,00:16:27,that a lot of rumour about what they could do.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"So there are a few really, really good texts,"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"like the Book of Ninja, which I'm sure"
00:16:31,00:16:33,down is drawing from here.
00:16:33,00:16:35,"But a lot of people are sort of in pain,"
00:16:35,00:16:37,"and they're just going to fly, or that they could read minds,"
00:16:37,00:16:39,or that they could go invisible.
00:16:39,00:16:40,And that was all bullshit.
00:16:40,00:16:41,But they could do a lot.
00:16:41,00:16:44,"But the rock, narrowest at noon, when you see their eyes,"
00:16:44,00:16:45,narrowed right in the air.
00:16:45,00:16:46,Do you know why--
00:16:46,00:16:47,It's 12 p.m.
00:16:47,00:16:49,"One way they could tell the time, which I thought was quite"
00:16:49,00:16:50,"cool, that wasn't one of the books."
00:16:50,00:16:52,"And this was written in like the 1630s, I think,"
00:16:52,00:16:55,"was they said, ""A way to see if time is passing if you're"
00:16:55,00:16:58,hiding at night to ambush is work out which
00:16:58,00:17:01,"nostril you're breathing out of because you're nostrils."""
00:17:01,00:17:03,So you know how you're only ever breathing out
00:17:03,00:17:05,of one nostril at a time.
00:17:05,00:17:06,And this swaps around sporadically.
00:17:06,00:17:09,And the rule was that it swaps around roughly every hour.
00:17:09,00:17:12,"And so if you're aware that you're nostrils have just swaps,"
00:17:12,00:17:15,then a hammer's gone by.
00:17:15,00:17:17,"All right, all right, ninjas."
00:17:17,00:17:18,Synchronize your noses.
00:17:18,00:17:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:17:21,00:17:24,"Can I just say, yeah, there are some people"
00:17:24,00:17:27,who think that ninjas weren't really a thing.
00:17:27,00:17:31,"Like, they didn't exist nearly as much as"
00:17:31,00:17:33,is now believed by popular culture.
00:17:33,00:17:36,"And because there's some little evidence of it,"
00:17:36,00:17:38,"so there was a Japan expert from the University of Leeds,"
00:17:38,00:17:42,who said that ninjas actively didn't exist in the way we--
00:17:42,00:17:43,But that's what ninjas want you to think.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"Oh, yeah."
00:17:44,00:17:47,There's some kind of hiding all this.
00:17:47,00:17:49,They're all just underwater.
00:17:49,00:17:51,So the kind of thing of someone--
00:17:51,00:17:53,"basically, the idea of someone running around in Black"
00:17:53,00:17:56,"pajamas is not coherent as an idea,"
00:17:56,00:17:59,because it will be very obvious.
00:17:59,00:18:05,So it's mostly agricultural land at this time in history.
00:18:05,00:18:07,So you'd be dressed as a farmer if you were an ninja.
00:18:07,00:18:10,If you see a guy running around in Black soaking wet pajamas
00:18:10,00:18:16,"with a cat's algorithm, he's going to sink out."
00:18:16,00:18:19,"I mean, so there is lots of--"
00:18:19,00:18:21,"so he gave an example, actually."
00:18:21,00:18:24,"So the year is 1,600, two of your enemies are fighting a battle."
00:18:24,00:18:27,So you send a couple of guys dressed as farmers to the area
00:18:27,00:18:30,to watch the battle and report back about what's happening.
00:18:30,00:18:31,That's ninja work.
00:18:31,00:18:32,So that's the kind of--
00:18:32,00:18:36,"a lot of it was more, I think, observation than nunchucks"
00:18:36,00:18:36,and thrice.
00:18:36,00:18:39,But it was extremely so efficient.
00:18:39,00:18:41,"So like, it's stories that people tend to think"
00:18:41,00:18:42,are very trustworthy.
00:18:42,00:18:44,"From that period recorded it, there's"
00:18:44,00:18:46,"a guy called Fuji Bayashi, who recorded"
00:18:46,00:18:48,a lot of the ninjas methods.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"And they were bound by a sort of spirituality, which"
00:18:51,00:18:53,was ruled by five elements.
00:18:53,00:18:57,"And these elements were wood, fire, earth, metal, and water."
00:18:57,00:18:59,"And these all represented different ways of fighting,"
00:18:59,00:19:01,"or hiding, or getting away."
00:19:01,00:19:02,And they're really funny.
00:19:02,00:19:05,So he recorded the ways you'd use these different elements.
00:19:05,00:19:08,"So in the water one, it would be, for instance,"
00:19:08,00:19:10,you'd use your sword as the breathing tube.
00:19:10,00:19:13,Or you would have to be trained to throw large quantities
00:19:13,00:19:16,of duckweed on water that you think you might escape
00:19:16,00:19:19,"through later, so that you could then hide among its leaves"
00:19:19,00:19:21,and float with them to safety.
00:19:21,00:19:23,"OK, yeah."
00:19:23,00:19:24,Very clever.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"I found a one that might be an earth method,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,if that's one of the elements.
00:19:28,00:19:32,"So there's apparently a skill called Uzura Gakuri, which"
00:19:32,00:19:35,is curling oneself into a ball to look like a rock.
00:19:35,00:19:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:38,00:19:40,So you believe that one?
00:19:40,00:19:44,"No, I actually don't."
00:19:44,00:19:46,"But then there's someone who comes disguised as some paper,"
00:19:46,00:19:47,and they can just be a fast guy.
00:19:47,00:19:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:19:50,00:19:53,"Yeah, we're just saying that they don't carry animals with them,"
00:19:53,00:19:54,cats with them.
00:19:54,00:19:55,But they did.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"Supposedly, carry crickets with them."
00:19:57,00:19:59,Boxes of crickets.
00:19:59,00:20:01,"And the idea was if they needed to go somewhere,"
00:20:01,00:20:04,"but they were a bit noisy, they could then release the crickets."
00:20:04,00:20:06,"And the crickets would make crickety noises,"
00:20:06,00:20:08,and then they could quickly shuffle over
00:20:08,00:20:09,to where they need to be.
00:20:09,00:20:10,"Ah, that's nice."
00:20:10,00:20:13,"OK, how do they keep the crickets quiet?"
00:20:13,00:20:18,They keep them in a jar or a box.
00:20:18,00:20:21,"This is much more plausible than the cat thing, so far."
00:20:21,00:20:25,So they also used to wear fake children's feet.
00:20:25,00:20:26,What do you think?
00:20:26,00:20:27,The crickets.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, no."
00:20:28,00:20:30,"No, the ninjas."
00:20:30,00:20:34,"So it is said, I need to say, it is said, is rumored,"
00:20:34,00:20:38,"that the ninjas used to wear on the souls of their shoes,"
00:20:38,00:20:41,sort of either children's feet or an elderly woman's foot.
00:20:41,00:20:43,Didn't know what that looks like.
00:20:43,00:20:46,"So the footprints in, let's say, the sand,"
00:20:46,00:20:48,"or their soggy feet coming out of the river,"
00:20:48,00:20:51,"be like, which child must have been swimming in that?"
00:20:51,00:20:52,So they wouldn't be deceiving.
00:20:52,00:20:55,"Well, it's true that American cattle wrestlers"
00:20:55,00:20:58,"used to wear shoes which had cow hooves on the bottom of them,"
00:20:58,00:21:01,so you would think that it was cows that had gone past
00:21:01,00:21:03,or horses rather than yet humans.
00:21:03,00:21:06,"And in Bhutan, it said that yetis can take their feet off"
00:21:06,00:21:08,"and put them on backwards, so it looks like they've"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"gone that way when, in fact, they are on that way."
00:21:10,00:21:14,I was really trying to help.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:21:16,00:21:18,And that is my fact.
00:21:18,00:21:22,My fact this week is that one month before the French Spider
00:21:22,00:21:25,Man successfully climbed the second tallest building
00:21:25,00:21:28,"in the world, he was hospitalised after falling"
00:21:28,00:21:32,from a seven foot tall traffic light.
00:21:32,00:21:35,"Now, this was to promote his climb of the second--"
00:21:35,00:21:38,"what was at the time, actually, the tallest building"
00:21:38,00:21:40,"in the world, which was in Taiwan."
00:21:40,00:21:43,And he was climbing this traffic light.
00:21:43,00:21:44,The photographer was there.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"He slipped, fell, got 40 stitches, was hospitalised,"
00:21:48,00:21:50,and it jeopardised the actual climb itself.
00:21:50,00:21:52,"They thought he might not be able to do it,"
00:21:52,00:21:54,but he did pull through.
00:21:54,00:21:56,And he is an urban climber.
00:21:56,00:21:57,He is.
00:21:57,00:21:59,"Yeah, his name is Alain Roberts."
00:21:59,00:22:02,And he is online.
00:22:02,00:22:03,"I don't know the community that well,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"but when you see online, he sort of regarded"
00:22:05,00:22:07,as the greatest urban climber of our day.
00:22:07,00:22:09,"I mean, he's in his mid-50s now."
00:22:09,00:22:10,I think he's about 56.
00:22:10,00:22:14,And he's still climbing extremely tall buildings.
00:22:14,00:22:15,It's amazing.
00:22:15,00:22:17,Although he's bound for climbing in Britain.
00:22:17,00:22:18,We don't like him.
00:22:18,00:22:19,He was-- I feel kind of bound for him.
00:22:19,00:22:22,"So he climbed the Heron Tower in London,"
00:22:22,00:22:23,great tall skyscraper.
00:22:23,00:22:26,And he was arrested the moment he reached the top.
00:22:26,00:22:28,"I just feel like, so he took him over half an hour."
00:22:28,00:22:31,And he was waiting for him at the top.
00:22:31,00:22:33,"I was like, what else is he going to do?"
00:22:33,00:22:36,"I'm going to climb down the thing, are they?"
00:22:36,00:22:38,He's only wasted half an hour.
00:22:38,00:22:39,I think that's OK.
00:22:39,00:22:39,You're right.
00:22:39,00:22:42,And then he's wasted the 20-week suspended jail sentence
00:22:42,00:22:44,"that he got, and £5,500."
00:22:44,00:22:47,"Well, he also, in 2012, he was spotted inside"
00:22:47,00:22:49,the shard building in London.
00:22:49,00:22:51,And the building's owners subsequently
00:22:51,00:22:52,"obtain the injunction, prevents"
00:22:52,00:22:54,them from ever returning to their building.
00:22:54,00:22:56,"Ah, I thought he'd be saying--"
00:22:56,00:23:00,"I thought he'd be saying he realized, oh, I'm on the wrong side."
00:23:00,00:23:03,"He's lost it up the stairs going, this is easy."
00:23:03,00:23:06,So he's climbed over 150 skyscrapers.
00:23:06,00:23:08,And one thing he says is that the first two meters
00:23:08,00:23:12,"are almost the most important, because after that,"
00:23:12,00:23:13,the police can't grab your feet.
00:23:13,00:23:15,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:15,00:23:16,I'm so late.
00:23:16,00:23:20,"As Anna was saying, the police are often there waiting"
00:23:20,00:23:21,for him when he gets to the top of the building.
00:23:21,00:23:23,And I've read in interviews that the only thing he has on him
00:23:23,00:23:25,"is chalk for his hands, as he's climbing,"
00:23:25,00:23:27,and he wears special shoes.
00:23:27,00:23:29,"But that's not quite true, because I think what he also"
00:23:29,00:23:32,"carries on him is a task, so he knows what time it is."
00:23:32,00:23:33,Yes.
00:23:33,00:23:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:36,00:23:40,"Box of crickets, so no one can hear him coming."
00:23:40,00:23:42,His climbing shoes are actually the shape of an old woman's
00:23:42,00:23:43,feet.
00:23:43,00:23:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:45,00:23:47,Come on.
00:23:47,00:23:49,"Well, it looks like the old woman climbed"
00:23:49,00:23:52,the south face of the building.
00:23:52,00:23:54,"So no, what he actually does carry with him"
00:23:54,00:23:57,is his passport and his lawyer's number.
00:23:57,00:24:00,And he just hands that to the police as soon as he gets there.
00:24:00,00:24:02,But it's quite-- it's probably a common thing.
00:24:02,00:24:03,Urban climbing.
00:24:03,00:24:06,It's something that there are quite a few heroes
00:24:06,00:24:07,of urban climbing.
00:24:07,00:24:10,"In 2016, there was a guy who got in trouble"
00:24:10,00:24:12,because he tried to scale Trump Tower.
00:24:12,00:24:14,And he sent three hours doing it.
00:24:14,00:24:16,"And he was using suction cups on his hands,"
00:24:16,00:24:18,"like hand on his hands and feet, in fact."
00:24:18,00:24:20,So it was a massive suction cup.
00:24:20,00:24:22,And he reached the 21st floor.
00:24:22,00:24:24,But NYPD were desperately trying to catch him.
00:24:24,00:24:25,It was bizarre to watch.
00:24:25,00:24:27,So they kept on sort of smashing windows
00:24:27,00:24:30,"up the building to try and reach out, to grab him."
00:24:30,00:24:32,And they couldn't get him.
00:24:32,00:24:34,They kept trying to impede his progress like climbing
00:24:34,00:24:36,"through air vents and stuff, I think."
00:24:36,00:24:37,And they just couldn't do it.
00:24:37,00:24:39,"And eventually, they set up two massive air bags,"
00:24:39,00:24:41,"like mattresses, in case he fell down,"
00:24:41,00:24:43,just below him and on the pavement.
00:24:43,00:24:46,And he was asked afterwards why he'd done it.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"So there was this huge rigmarole, just three hours,"
00:24:48,00:24:49,really just 21st floor.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"And then the police sprung out of the window,"
00:24:52,00:24:53,"grabbed him, and pulled him in."
00:24:53,00:24:54,"Said, why on earth have you done that?"
00:24:54,00:24:57,"And he said, look, I'm just a political researcher."
00:24:57,00:24:59,And I really wanted to meet Donald Trump.
00:24:59,00:25:02,"You know, just we were talking about Alan Robert."
00:25:02,00:25:04,He has vertigo.
00:25:04,00:25:05,Really?
00:25:05,00:25:06,He suffers from vertigo.
00:25:06,00:25:08,And vertigo is sort of feeding the earth
00:25:08,00:25:10,"to free yourself off a great height, isn't it?"
00:25:10,00:25:11,It's not fear of height.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"No, it's all in her inner ear problem,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,which makes you dizzy.
00:25:14,00:25:15,"Yeah, stuff."
00:25:15,00:25:17,"I thought then you got the earth, so you"
00:25:17,00:25:18,feel like the ground was coming towards you.
00:25:18,00:25:22,I think you feel very dizzy and you feel a bit unstable.
00:25:22,00:25:24,And he's had that since 1982.
00:25:24,00:25:25,And he's still done it.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Yeah.
00:25:26,00:25:28,He had it after he was showing students
00:25:28,00:25:30,"how to climb with his hands behind his back,"
00:25:30,00:25:33,and then fell 26 feet off the wall.
00:25:33,00:25:34,Yeah.
00:25:34,00:25:37,He's married with three kids.
00:25:37,00:25:39,"And I read an interview with his wife,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"because they said, you must be freaked out."
00:25:42,00:25:43,"Every single time he goes and climbs a building,"
00:25:43,00:25:44,how are you feeling?
00:25:44,00:25:46,"And she sort of kind of said, well, I"
00:25:46,00:25:47,"knew what I was getting into, really,"
00:25:47,00:25:49,"because when she first met him, both of his arms"
00:25:49,00:25:52,were in plaster casts from a wall.
00:25:52,00:25:56,The one thing that defeated him in London in 2002
00:25:56,00:25:57,was the weather.
00:25:57,00:25:59,He got three quarters up the way of number one
00:25:59,00:26:02,Canada Square in Canary Wharf.
00:26:02,00:26:05,"It was so cold wet and windy, he just got completely stuck"
00:26:05,00:26:08,and had to be rescued by a window-cleaning left.
00:26:08,00:26:09,Oh.
00:26:09,00:26:10,It's amazing.
00:26:10,00:26:14,"But it's got a long and illustrious history of inclining,"
00:26:14,00:26:15,"which, by the way, it's called--"
00:26:15,00:26:16,it's got a number of names.
00:26:16,00:26:20,It could be called edificeering or stegopherly.
00:26:20,00:26:22,So that's the official term for it.
00:26:22,00:26:23,And I really like the etymology of this.
00:26:23,00:26:26,"So the Greek stegos is roof, so it's"
00:26:26,00:26:28,"a love of roof, so it's like climbing up onto roofs."
00:26:28,00:26:30,It's from the same roof as what's
00:26:30,00:26:32,like the other word that you just see with stegosaurus.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"Yeah, it's from the same roof as stegosaurus,"
00:26:34,00:26:37,because that means roofed lizard.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"Because when they first found stegosaurus,"
00:26:38,00:26:39,they thought--
00:26:39,00:26:40,People climbing up it.
00:26:40,00:26:42,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:42,00:26:43,They had a roof on top.
00:26:43,00:26:47,"No, it was-- so they thought that the plate on top of a stegosaurus"
00:26:47,00:26:49,"would be horizontal rather than vertical,"
00:26:49,00:26:51,"so they thought that it had a roof over it,"
00:26:51,00:26:52,so it's called roofed lizard.
00:26:52,00:26:53,That's so cool.
00:26:53,00:26:54,It's cool.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"But an urban climbing obstacle, stegopherly,"
00:26:56,00:27:00,has a long history in Oxygen Cambridge University.
00:27:00,00:27:02,So the first urban climber was a guy
00:27:02,00:27:05,"called Jeffrey Winthrop Young, who published a bit"
00:27:05,00:27:08,called the roof climber's guide to Trinity at College
00:27:08,00:27:09,Cambridge.
00:27:09,00:27:11,And it gave really detailed instructions
00:27:11,00:27:13,on which roots to take up.
00:27:13,00:27:15,And then there was another guy called
00:27:15,00:27:18,"Noel Howard Simmington, who wrote one in 1937."
00:27:18,00:27:20,"Again, nine climbers guide to Cambridge."
00:27:20,00:27:22,And his pseudonym was Whipple Snaith.
00:27:22,00:27:24,And this is so weird.
00:27:24,00:27:26,The person who reviewed his book and wrote
00:27:26,00:27:29,about the details of climbing up Cambridge buildings
00:27:29,00:27:31,was also called Whipple.
00:27:31,00:27:32,He was called Tom Whipple.
00:27:32,00:27:35,So the modern day Cambridge building
00:27:35,00:27:36,climber is called Tom Whipple.
00:27:36,00:27:37,I know Tom Whipple.
00:27:37,00:27:38,No way.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"Well, I don't know if it's the same Tom Whipple."
00:27:40,00:27:41,"Yeah, I'm sure it will be."
00:27:41,00:27:42,I know the circles you're moving.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"No, it's good."
00:27:44,00:27:46,Have you guys heard of the human fly?
00:27:46,00:27:47,I know there's no anecdote.
00:27:47,00:27:49,To know the human fly.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"Well, he's a journalist."
00:27:50,00:27:51,"Yeah, he is."
00:27:51,00:27:53,He's a very nice guy.
00:27:53,00:27:54,Tell us about the human fly.
00:27:54,00:27:57,Yeah.
00:27:57,00:28:00,His name is Tom Whipple.
00:28:00,00:28:04,"So OK, we need to move on."
00:28:04,00:28:07,So the human fly was a guy called Henry Gardner.
00:28:07,00:28:10,And he was one of the first really impressive building
00:28:10,00:28:10,climbers.
00:28:10,00:28:13,He was in the 1910s and 20s.
00:28:13,00:28:18,"He climbed 700 buildings without gear, frequently wearing a suit."
00:28:18,00:28:21,And he was paid to do it by companies
00:28:21,00:28:24,to promote their offices in the new skyscrapers.
00:28:24,00:28:26,"So in 1916, he climbed to the ninth floor window"
00:28:26,00:28:29,"of a skyscraper, climbed into the window"
00:28:29,00:28:32,of a bank branch and opened an account at the bank.
00:28:32,00:28:34,That's what the stunts he did.
00:28:34,00:28:36,"Or he would do the, you know, open an insurance thing."
00:28:36,00:28:38,"And he was really, really famous."
00:28:38,00:28:39,We don't know what happened to him.
00:28:39,00:28:41,He went missing in 1925.
00:28:41,00:28:42,"Oh, really?"
00:28:42,00:28:44,"He probably fell off a building, didn't he?"
00:28:44,00:28:46,"If he was, yes."
00:28:46,00:28:47,I'm afraid he might have.
00:28:47,00:28:50,"That Robert guy does it for money now, doesn't he?"
00:28:50,00:28:52,He basically does it sponsored and he usually uses
00:28:52,00:28:54,actual climbing gear and stuff like that.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"But actually, a lot of people do die."
00:28:56,00:28:59,"So this Harry Gardner, who was, actually,"
00:28:59,00:29:01,"it was Grover Cleveland, the president who"
00:29:01,00:29:04,"nicknamed him the human flight, apparently."
00:29:04,00:29:07,And he said that 120 of those who sought to imitate me
00:29:07,00:29:11,in this hazardous profession have fallen to death.
00:29:11,00:29:12,So he was saying that that happened.
00:29:12,00:29:13,And people have looked into this.
00:29:13,00:29:14,Scientists have looked into it.
00:29:14,00:29:17,There's been a study in 2006.
00:29:17,00:29:18,"And they said, in every country, there"
00:29:18,00:29:21,is an excess of male deaths due to potentially
00:29:21,00:29:22,avoidable reasons.
00:29:22,00:29:28,"According to their theory, this is what they"
00:29:28,00:29:31,"quote to the saying, men are idiots."
00:29:31,00:29:33,And idiots do stupid things.
00:29:33,00:29:43,"And on that note, we need to move onto our final fact"
00:29:43,00:29:44,of the show.
00:29:44,00:29:46,And that is James.
00:29:46,00:29:47,OK.
00:29:47,00:29:50,My fact this week is that in the early Eurovision Song
00:29:50,00:29:55,"Contests, songs could not be performed in public before the event."
00:29:55,00:29:58,One Danish song was banned after the composer whistled it
00:29:58,00:30:01,in a TV broadcaster's canteen.
00:30:01,00:30:02,Wow.
00:30:02,00:30:03,This is incredible.
00:30:03,00:30:05,"So yeah, this was in the bit where you had"
00:30:05,00:30:08,to become the Danish entry.
00:30:08,00:30:10,And there were six different songs.
00:30:10,00:30:12,And this guy was just in the canteen having his lunch.
00:30:12,00:30:14,And he was just kind of whistling it to himself.
00:30:14,00:30:17,And then they did the actual thing where they performed it.
00:30:17,00:30:21,"And the people that were going, sounds a bit familiar, isn't it?"
00:30:21,00:30:22,And then they got banned.
00:30:22,00:30:23,No.
00:30:23,00:30:25,And what is he maybe secretly doing it to try
00:30:25,00:30:27,and to seed the tune in people's minds
00:30:27,00:30:29,or is there no suggestion of that?
00:30:29,00:30:31,"You know what, I haven't thought of that."
00:30:31,00:30:32,"But yeah, I mean, probably not."
00:30:32,00:30:35,I think that's a very cynical take.
00:30:35,00:30:36,"Well, an amazing song."
00:30:36,00:30:39,"But they were like, wait, that's the song I heard in that canteen"
00:30:39,00:30:41,a week ago.
00:30:41,00:30:42,What a shame it couldn't enter.
00:30:42,00:30:43,"Yeah, that's true."
00:30:43,00:30:46,What a great whistler he must be.
00:30:46,00:30:50,"Whistler, everyone is a better whistler than they are a singer."
00:30:50,00:30:50,What?
00:30:50,00:30:53,It's easier to match a tune that you've heard whistling
00:30:53,00:30:54,than it is singing.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"There are some people who can't whistle, right?"
00:30:56,00:30:58,I've met a few people who can't whistle.
00:30:58,00:30:59,Right.
00:30:59,00:31:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:01,00:31:05,"So yeah, well, OK, hang on."
00:31:05,00:31:09,"If you can whistle, you are a better whistler, probably,"
00:31:09,00:31:10,than you are a singer.
00:31:10,00:31:11,It's much weaker than--
00:31:11,00:31:15,Tell me about Todd Whipple.
00:31:15,00:31:15,"That's interesting, really."
00:31:15,00:31:17,"Well, they've looked at that."
00:31:17,00:31:18,That's not just your opinion.
00:31:18,00:31:20,It's not just my opinion.
00:31:20,00:31:22,"Well, this isn't an opinion based on that."
00:31:22,00:31:24,They've done studies to test the picture whistler.
00:31:24,00:31:28,"They've done studies asking people, can you repeat this tune"
00:31:28,00:31:29,sung or repeat it?
00:31:29,00:31:32,"And it's because-- I mean, you know, it's obviously much easier"
00:31:32,00:31:33,"to make a tune on the musical instrument,"
00:31:33,00:31:36,because they're specifically designed to match the specific notes.
00:31:36,00:31:39,But muscles are just a bit less precise.
00:31:39,00:31:44,I've been getting closer with it in your opinion.
00:31:44,00:31:47,"You know, when the Eurovision song contest first started,"
00:31:47,00:31:49,Britain decided we didn't want to take part
00:31:49,00:31:51,in this Eurovision song contest.
00:31:51,00:31:55,So we decided to have our own British song contest
00:31:55,00:31:59,"of British populist songs, which was one by Dennis Lotus,"
00:31:59,00:32:01,who was born in South Africa.
00:32:01,00:32:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:32:04,00:32:07,Because I don't really understand about Eurovision.
00:32:07,00:32:09,And I think it is bigger here than it is in Britain.
00:32:09,00:32:11,But it's the continent's systems every year
00:32:11,00:32:12,that it's not political.
00:32:12,00:32:13,It should never be political.
00:32:13,00:32:14,And it's just about the music.
00:32:14,00:32:16,But it is so patiently political.
00:32:16,00:32:18,I don't understand why everyone doesn't embrace that.
00:32:18,00:32:21,So there have been everything about the history of Eurovision.
00:32:21,00:32:25,"In 2009, though, it was just after the Russia Georgia conflict."
00:32:25,00:32:28,"And Georgia had to withdraw its entry,"
00:32:28,00:32:30,because the organizers had told them they had to change
00:32:30,00:32:33,"their lyrics and the title of their entry song, which"
00:32:33,00:32:35,"was, we don't want to put in, which"
00:32:35,00:32:40,is a very unveiled reference to Putin.
00:32:40,00:32:41,So yeah.
00:32:41,00:32:44,And then it's back and forth all the time.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"Yeah, there was-- when it first came,"
00:32:46,00:32:48,it was supposed to bring Europe together.
00:32:48,00:32:52,"But Turkey pulled out in 1976, because Greece were taking part."
00:32:52,00:32:54,"But then Greece pulled out in 1975,"
00:32:54,00:32:57,because Turkey were taking part.
00:32:57,00:32:59,"Greece sent to Ireland in 2008, because they"
00:32:59,00:33:00,mentioned Macedonia.
00:33:00,00:33:04,And they sent to Finland in 2007 for being satanic.
00:33:04,00:33:07,But then Finland censored Israel in the same year
00:33:07,00:33:08,for mentioning nuclear weapons.
00:33:08,00:33:10,"And this year, Israel's embassy complained"
00:33:10,00:33:13,to the Netherlands after they paraded their Eurovision winner.
00:33:13,00:33:17,And Iran moved all of its diplomats from Azerbaijan in 2012
00:33:17,00:33:19,"and protested it, hosting the contest,"
00:33:19,00:33:22,even though Iran's nothing to do with Eurovision.
00:33:22,00:33:26,"And when Israel won in 1978, the TV show in Georgia"
00:33:26,00:33:29,told viewers that Belgium had won.
00:33:29,00:33:34,"And in 1973, Portugal arrested the writer of its own song."
00:33:34,00:33:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:35,00:33:37,Because they thought it wasn't fascist enough.
00:33:37,00:33:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:38,00:33:41,[APPLAUSE]
00:33:41,00:33:43,Very cool.
00:33:43,00:33:47,So glad and so glad we're all friends together.
00:33:47,00:33:50,Do you know Salvador Dali was involved with the Eurovision
00:33:50,00:33:51,song?
00:33:51,00:33:54,"Yeah, 1969, the stage-- so it was in Madrid."
00:33:54,00:33:57,"And the stage had this giant sculpture, a metal sculpture"
00:33:57,00:33:58,on stage.
00:33:58,00:34:00,And that was designed by Salvador Dali.
00:34:00,00:34:03,"But not only that, he also designed their press material,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,all the press packages and stuff.
00:34:05,00:34:06,That sounds like an early job.
00:34:06,00:34:08,"That's different, isn't it?"
00:34:08,00:34:10,"Now, he was a man who had trouble telling the time."
00:34:10,00:34:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:12,00:34:13,Let's face it.
00:34:13,00:34:15,[APPLAUSE]
00:34:15,00:34:19,The 1978 one was particularly controversial.
00:34:19,00:34:23,So the 1970s was the one that Israel won.
00:34:23,00:34:25,"I think, and during the contest, it became obvious"
00:34:25,00:34:26,that Israel was going to win.
00:34:26,00:34:30,And most Arabic countries were transmitting it
00:34:30,00:34:32,on their TV stations.
00:34:32,00:34:35,And they canceled the transmission as soon as it became obvious.
00:34:35,00:34:36,So they were just quickly flipped to another channel
00:34:36,00:34:38,within their explanation.
00:34:38,00:34:40,"And actually, you say that the children said that Belgium had won."
00:34:40,00:34:41,And they just replaced their transmission
00:34:41,00:34:43,with a bunch of daffodils.
00:34:43,00:34:45,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:45,00:34:45,Very cool.
00:34:45,00:34:50,So it was a-- you mentioned the British equivalent.
00:34:50,00:34:51,Yes.
00:34:51,00:34:53,"There was a Soviet Union equivalent as well,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"which was called Intervision, the Individuals song contest."
00:34:56,00:34:58,It only happened four times.
00:34:58,00:35:00,And we've spoken about this before.
00:35:00,00:35:02,Is this was the way that you voted?
00:35:02,00:35:05,It was that-- a lot of people didn't have
00:35:05,00:35:08,telephones in the Soviet Union.
00:35:08,00:35:11,So you had to turn on your lights if you liked the song.
00:35:11,00:35:13,And you had to turn them off if you didn't like the song.
00:35:13,00:35:16,And they just measured the load on each country's electricity
00:35:16,00:35:17,network.
00:35:17,00:35:18,No.
00:35:18,00:35:20,And that determined how many points you got.
00:35:20,00:35:21,Nice.
00:35:21,00:35:22,That's clever.
00:35:22,00:35:24,"Yeah, that's true."
00:35:24,00:35:26,And it was amazing.
00:35:26,00:35:29,"It was the wild west of songs, of some contest."
00:35:29,00:35:32,"So for example, one entrant in those four years"
00:35:32,00:35:35,stayed on stage for 45 minutes.
00:35:35,00:35:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:36,00:35:38,Just kept going until they were removed.
00:35:38,00:35:41,The thing about that is that you had to--
00:35:41,00:35:44,I think someone else pointed this out in our class reading--
00:35:44,00:35:47,you had to sit in pitch dark for all of the songs you didn't like.
00:35:47,00:35:50,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:50,00:35:52,You can't turn your lights on.
00:35:52,00:35:54,How miserable you don't like the song anyway.
00:35:54,00:35:57,"Also, bizarrely, Canada was an entrant in two of the, I think,"
00:35:57,00:35:59,four years that that was going.
00:35:59,00:36:01,"They have weird entrants, like the fact that Australia"
00:36:01,00:36:03,"is a neurovisionist, obviously, a bit weird,"
00:36:03,00:36:05,"and also a bit painful, because they"
00:36:05,00:36:09,"have the highest score on average, the Australians."
00:36:09,00:36:10,I'm an Aussie.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"Fuck you, I'm fine."
00:36:12,00:36:13,So good.
00:36:13,00:36:14,We've been there in five times.
00:36:14,00:36:17,"And in three of those five, we've made it to the top 10."
00:36:17,00:36:20,"Yeah, I wonder how many of you were."
00:36:20,00:36:21,What did you come this year?
00:36:21,00:36:23,[LAUGHTER]
00:36:23,00:36:27,I feel we're all going to lose the reggae of Sweden.
00:36:27,00:36:29,"Yeah, do you know if you actually go to the Eurovision"
00:36:29,00:36:34,"Song Contest, what you have to do is adhere to very strict rules"
00:36:34,00:36:35,about what can go in with you.
00:36:35,00:36:38,"So most places you go to, there's a list of things"
00:36:38,00:36:40,that are not allowed to be taken into a venue.
00:36:40,00:36:43,"But with the European Song Contest, it's things"
00:36:43,00:36:47,"like helmets, adhesive tape, golf balls, another loud,"
00:36:47,00:36:49,and shopping trolleys.
00:36:49,00:36:51,They specify shopping trolleys.
00:36:51,00:36:54,It just feels like they're each year they're responding
00:36:54,00:36:56,to one disastrous entry.
00:36:56,00:36:59,"So I think about within the last decade,"
00:36:59,00:37:01,the Greek team performed on a trampoline.
00:37:01,00:37:02,Did they?
00:37:02,00:37:02,Yeah.
00:37:02,00:37:04,So I don't know if trampolines are on the list.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"No, I mean, no, this is for the people coming."
00:37:07,00:37:08,It's not for the people.
00:37:08,00:37:10,"Sorry, it's for audience people, sorry, OK."
00:37:10,00:37:13,There hasn't been something in the Eurovision Song Contest
00:37:13,00:37:16,just singing and hitting golf balls into the audience.
00:37:16,00:37:19,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:19,00:37:21,It would be so unsurprising.
00:37:21,00:37:21,Yeah.
00:37:21,00:37:25,"So there was the Russians who came second, I think,"
00:37:25,00:37:28,"a few years ago, with that team of grannies"
00:37:28,00:37:31,who baked bread on stage.
00:37:31,00:37:32,Yeah.
00:37:32,00:37:34,"I mean, it is a strange contest."
00:37:34,00:37:37,"There was-- in 1985, the contest was held in Gothenburg."
00:37:37,00:37:40,[APPLAUSE]
00:37:40,00:37:41,Cool.
00:37:41,00:37:44,It's such an easy way of getting the cheers.
00:37:44,00:37:45,Shameless.
00:37:45,00:37:49,And it was very popular amongst British viewers.
00:37:49,00:37:51,"And a lot of people tuned in, where you wouldn't really"
00:37:51,00:37:52,think they would do.
00:37:52,00:37:54,And that's because the Swedish entry was
00:37:54,00:37:57,entitled Bra vibration.
00:37:57,00:37:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:37:59,00:38:03,Is that--
00:38:03,00:38:03,Wow.
00:38:03,00:38:04,Wow.
00:38:04,00:38:09,For-- is that some kind of milking tool?
00:38:09,00:38:11,"Well, for the people who are in this room,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,I believe it means good vibrations.
00:38:14,00:38:17,"Oh, I see."
00:38:17,00:38:19,"Wow, vibration."
00:38:19,00:38:23,"In 1997, Denmark's entry was a rap indian-ish about a guy"
00:38:23,00:38:27,who had fallen in love with a woman from directory inquiries.
00:38:27,00:38:31,"In 1918, Norway's entry was a song about the construction"
00:38:31,00:38:35,of a hydroelectric power plant.
00:38:35,00:38:38,"Estonia in 2013 had a song, which repeatedly"
00:38:38,00:38:41,"just said the phrase, ""A local man called Kostakov"
00:38:41,00:38:45,"went to Latvia yesterday."""
00:38:45,00:38:48,"And in 2006, Lithuania had a song called"
00:38:48,00:38:50,"""We are the winners,"" which just said,"
00:38:50,00:38:53,"""We are the winners again and again and again and again."""
00:38:53,00:38:56,And they came sick.
00:38:56,00:39:01,I want to know if they ever found a local man called Kostakov.
00:39:01,00:39:03,"We're going to have to rock off, guys."
00:39:03,00:39:05,"Well, OK, what do I think?"
00:39:05,00:39:05,Yeah.
00:39:05,00:39:09,"The first person to get in Ilpoir, as in no points in Eurovision,"
00:39:09,00:39:14,was a guy called Jan Tegen from Norway.
00:39:14,00:39:15,OK.
00:39:15,00:39:18,"But he became a national hero, because he got no points."
00:39:18,00:39:23,And his song was number one for two months.
00:39:23,00:39:26,I'm remained in the top 10 for three months afterwards.
00:39:26,00:39:29,"And he also had a number one album called ""This Year's Loser."""
00:39:29,00:39:31,[LAUGHTER]
00:39:31,00:39:39,"OK, that is all of our facts."
