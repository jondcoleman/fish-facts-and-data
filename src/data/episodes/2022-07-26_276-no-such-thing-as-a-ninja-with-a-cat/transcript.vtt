00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:35.800
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.900
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 and James Harkin.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.020
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.820
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.620
 And in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.820
 Starting with you, Andy.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.460
 My fact is that Sweden's public art body

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.140
 has just commissioned an artwork, which

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 will hire someone to do nothing at Gothenburg's

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.820
 course of art and train station for the next 120 years.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.020
 [APPLAUSE]

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.020
 120 years.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.020
 120 years.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.020
 120 years.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.780
 So that can't be the same person for 120 years.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.300
 Well, it might be.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.020
 We don't know about medical advances in the next century.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.020
 That's true.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.260
 So this is a thing.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.900
 It's called eternal employment.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.980
 And Gothenburg has a new train station called Coursesvarkin.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.020
 And I don't know if you can tell the home,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.940
 but people here are very excited about it.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.060
 There was a competition to provide a public artwork.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.180
 And there were two artists who won, called Simon Golden

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.340
 and Jacob Senneby.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.460
 And they have half a million pounds to spend.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.020
 And they spent it on hiring an employee

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.140
 to do whatever they like, forever.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.860
 As long as you check in and check out of your work each day,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.900
 you will get 21,600 Kroner a month, which

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.060
 is enough to buy five beers here.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.460
 But then the application-- you can still go for this,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.060
 by the way.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 The application deadline is the 15th of December, 2025.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.540
 OK?

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.060
 Yeah.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.860
 And their duties will be taken up.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.820
 Well, the black of duties will be taken up on the 15th of March,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.260
 2026.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.020
 OK.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.860
 So if you're bad with deadlines like me,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.660
 you can put that off for another six years.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.380
 And there's a job description online, which is quite poetic.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.460
 It goes, there's a scent.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.740
 Do you smell it?

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.220
 The scent of something.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.580
 We smell it.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.580
 It's seaweed.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.540
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.540
 You're seaweed.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.780
 You want to be seaweed.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.940
 You shall be seaweed.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.060
 You know that.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.540
 Thank you for knowing.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.900
 Thank you for seaweed.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.260
 You're standing there, right there, standing like what?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.580
 Like a prawn.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.380
 A positive prawn.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.140
 A flexible prawn.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.300
 An unpretentious prawn.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.580
 A goal-oriented prawn.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.500
 Thank you.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500
 Thanks.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 Wow.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.180
 So I think that tells you everything that you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.500
 have to do for this shelf.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.780
 Any questions?

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.500
 Does that sound more normal in Swedish?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.620
 Google translates on a hell of a job.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 So I like that.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.660
 The way it's going to be, as well, is once the station

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.460
 is open, the applicant has been chosen,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.300
 and he's got, or she has, residency of the job.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.420
 There's going to be fluorescent lights that go on

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.100
 on the station level, or the platform levels,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.940
 to let all passengers know that the person doing nothing

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.580
 is at work, that they're here either doing something,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.980
 or absolutely nothing.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.740
 And you can't tell who they are if they're on the platforms,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.140
 but there's going to be two rooms that they can go to.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.340
 One is a glass room, where you can see what they're doing,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.140
 and the other is just a closed-off room, which they can just

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.780
 choose to sit in, and you never see.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.300
 But actually, they don't have to stay

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.180
 on in the train station at all.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.780
 As long as they clock in and clock out,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.940
 they could bug a rough all day.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.780
 Yeah, that's it.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.260
 But there are things you can't do.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 So you can't go and get another job.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.220
 That is seen as not playing the game.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.620
 But the job does come with a pension, and with holiday.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.780
 So you've got a holiday from doing nothing.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.060
 It's not actually a brilliant paid job.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.900
 It's fine.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.580
 But if the salary is really below average--

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.700
 And I work it in 120 years, it's going to be worth literally.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.500
 Well, it's going up.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.980
 It's going up within 30 years.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.620
 By 3% a year.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.380
 And if you die, they will just give the job to something else.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.380
 Yeah.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.140
 I think that's how jobs work, generally.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.020
 Every company folds, but everyone dies.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.900
 I guess we need to retire that role, though.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.580
 Persons serving at the counter of McDonald's.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.540
 It's just going to have to be an empty counter now.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.540
 But we should see what his purpose is, really.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.500
 Which they are making a point.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.220
 So it's inspired by Thomas Piketty's capital

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.340
 in the 21st century.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.540
 That very trendy book for anyone claiming to be academic,

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.820
 or some just-- so it's about the return on capital

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.780
 being higher than the average increase in wages.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.260
 So it's basically-- there's this art prize money, which

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.900
 was $7 million, or I think.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.620
 And the idea is that they're going to invest that.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.420
 And the return on that investment is going

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.580
 to yield that personal salary for 120 years.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.820
 So the idea is money makes more money than humans do.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.580
 Which is depressing.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.460
 But still fun for that person who's doing the job.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.020
 Can I say a very quick thing about?

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.260
 So this is art meets train station.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.060
 And so the most ambitious crossover in the history.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.020
 And so I was looking into sort of entertaining art sort

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.820
 of things that we're going on with train stations.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.540
 And I read this fact, which is in London, in our underground

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.780
 station, we have the very famous iconic Mind the Gap,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.260
 Mind the Gap, which is set.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.140
 So when that was initially recorded,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.460
 it was recorded by a sound engineer called Peter Lodge.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.060
 And he got an actor who was a well-known actor of the time.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.380
 And he got into recording.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.420
 He recorded Mind the Gap and Stan Clear of the Doors.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 And after it was recorded, and they were sort of getting

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.540
 it ready to send it out, the guy suddenly said,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.300
 I want royalties for every time.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.460
 Oh, yeah.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.620
 And they went, you can't have that.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.380
 That's insane.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.980
 And he said, no, that's my deal.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.100
 So they cut him off.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.340
 And they were going to re-record it.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.020
 But they listened to the recording of the sound engineer,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.300
 Peter Lodge, who was testing the microphones going mind the gap.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.700
 And they went, that's good enough.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.940
 And he became--

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.340
 He was the original voice of the London Underground,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.660
 the sound engineer, testing the microphones.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.260
 That's great.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.780
 Yeah.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.220
 Because we have a very, quite a famous thing in London

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.300
 about the Mind the Gap announcement.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.100
 Maybe the station announcement at one station,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.060
 I can't remember which, which is recorded by a guy

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.900
 who died a few years ago.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.380
 And then they changed the recording

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.020
 because someone else got it.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.420
 They thought they'd jazz up the station.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.220
 And the widow of the guy who died wrote to the station,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:00.740
 didn't she?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.460
 And said, please, can you change that back?

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.620
 That's the only time I hear my husband's voice.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.180
 Yeah, his name was Oswald Lawrence.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.620
 It was in Bankman station.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:08.820
 It was on the Northern line.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.180
 And they changed it back so she could always hear his voice,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.900
 saying it.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.940
 Yeah, that's really nice.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:14.660
 Yeah.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.660
 Speaking of London, so there's--

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.420
 Oh, it's kept in practical, too.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.100
 You're not even going to like where this goes.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.580
 I'm going to say, so if you live in London,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.380
 there's another job you can get which seems quite cushy.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.860
 It is to become a luxury product tester.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.740
 For that, you get a $75,000 salary, which is about $100,000.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.220
 And you get to test supercars yachts and private islands.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.020
 Wow.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.660
 OK, so this morning I applied for this job.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.860
 Let's see, you look up jobs testing luxury islands.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.820
 I found out there is a man whose job is to watch paint drying.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.860
 And he's a real person.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.020
 He's called Keith Jackson.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.460
 And he works for an industrial paint firm.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.060
 And a big part of his job is assessing

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.140
 the drying time of industrial paint.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.820
 And that doesn't sound important, does it?

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:11.660
 But I really can't.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.940
 He must have been watching it the whole time, has he?

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.180
 He might have a break.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.180
 He'll probably have a break.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.740
 Imagine if he has a break for 15 minutes,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.740
 he comes back and he's already trying.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.180
 That's a bad pay in the office, isn't it?

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.020
 Fuck say.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.820
 Do you think paint is like a watch pot?

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.500
 Do you think it boils as soon as your back is turned?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.500
 No, the reason it's important that it happens

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.380
 is because sometimes paint things.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.820
 And then you need to know how long the paint will take to be dry.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.700
 So, for example, loved and underground,

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.820
 they can only be painted stations between three o'clock

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.260
 and five o'clock in the morning.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.460
 And then it has to be dry enough to walk on.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.740
 So this is a very high-stake situation.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:49.500
 Wow.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 And the high-stakes and medium, low to medium, the medium.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.180
 But he said people do love and find it amusing

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.660
 when I tell them what I do.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.740
 He said it could be described as the most boring job

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.300
 in the world, but it is a very important one.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.300
 Watching paint dry sounds quite easy,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.060
 but it can be stressful at times.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.260
 So also while you're looking at jobs of watching paint dry,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:19.580
 I was looking at jobs of watching pornography.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.060
 And apparently there's a nightclub in Denmark

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.460
 that's hiring someone to watch 20 hours of pornographic films

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.660
 for 2,500 pounds equivalent.

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.020
 And the reason is they want to select the best parts

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.420
 of the soundtrack that they'll make a playlist of,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.220
 that they'll play in the nightclub bathroom.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.780
 Sure, there's the reason.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.340
 I've been looking at some kind of jobs

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.020
 of sound, some people who are kind of lazy at work.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.420
 So this obviously would suit this job,

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.540
 but the train station would suit someone who's quite lazy at work.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.500
 There've been some good people who have been in the past.

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.540
 So there was a civil servant called Carlos Retio.

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.740
 He was a Spanish civil servant.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.980
 He skipped work for a decade.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.020
 He used to clock in at 7.30 in the morning.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.620
 And then he'd returned to work to clock out

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.940
 at 4 in the afternoon.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.140
 So he's perfect for this station job.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.460
 He took home a 50 grand salary.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.740
 And he then, when he was caught, and it was discovered

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.940
 that he'd just been skipping work for over 10 years.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.740
 He then admitted to it fine.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.260
 And then there was an art exhibition put on in the town

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.100
 that used a council venue.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.380
 And the exhibition was called Love for Valencia,

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.300
 the works of a man who never worked.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.740
 And it was booked under what turned out to be a fake name.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.980
 And they discovered later it was put on by him,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.900
 this man who skipped work the whole time,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.820
 as kind of a peon to his own glory

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.180
 and having skipped work.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.420
 And there were paintings, there were sculptures,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.380
 and there were bronze busts of this man talking about

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.020
 how he succeeded in not working.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.540
 The council discovered that it was him who booked it

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.820
 and they canceled it.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.780
 But he discovered that he got no charges.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.660
 He got no big fine.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.380
 He was suspended from work.

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.100
 Not even fired.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.820
 Speaking of doing nothing, there is a hotel with a,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.060
 or the was, the hotel's so success

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.900
 but they used to have a suite called the Checkout Suite.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.780
 And if you did nothing and you use no internet,

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.060
 then you'd get the suite for free.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.220
 OK, so it worked out how much internet you were using

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:18.740
 and how much work you were doing.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.300
 And if you used the time to just relax and do nothing,

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.900
 they gave it you for free.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.860
 This was the Hotel Ballora, which is in Gothenburg,

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.820
 which is the hotel where staying, and at the moment, yes.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.540
 So I spoke to the receptionist this afternoon.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.300
 And she said, it ran for three months

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.180
 and every single person who went there

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.780
 managed to get it for free.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.780
 Wow.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:41.420
 There must be something that the people of Gothenburg

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.060
 are just quite happy sitting around going, you know what?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.100
 I'm just going to fill.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.580
 You know what, if you've got a few sheets of slightly damp paint,

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:49.660
 the time flies by.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.660
 [LAUGHTER]

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:56.580
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.140
 And that is Chazinsky.

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:03.060
 Yes, my fact this week is that Ninjas sword sheaths

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.140
 had removable tips so that if they ever had to hide underwater,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.260
 they could use them like a snorkel to breathe.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.580
 That's so cool.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.860
 It's so great.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.940
 And so they brought the sword with them as well, right?

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.180
 Yeah, yeah, you do bring the sword.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.300
 That's the main thing.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.780
 But it's basically being an ninja

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.900
 was all about kind of adapting to your environment.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.820
 It was like being a sort of 15-17 century Japanese James Bond.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.380
 It really was.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.860
 They had all these gadgets.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.180
 And one of them was the sword.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.860
 And the scabbard, they would use it like a snorkel,

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.460
 because hiding underwater was a major part of being an ninja.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.380
 And so what?

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.020
 I find it hard to put this into words, but what?

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.540
 So why would you need to be underwater, as much?

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:50.620
 So basically, what an ninja was was,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.780
 it was sort of like the flip side of a samurai.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.860
 So samurai in Japan were very well respected,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.380
 honorable, noble fighters.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.940
 And the ninja was the sneaky, mercenary agent.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.300
 They were very, very looked down upon at the time

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.860
 they were around, which, and they were,

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.100
 they had their heyday the 15th or 17th century in Japan.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.900
 And their function was basically espionage.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.420
 So they were spies and deception and surprise attack

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.500
 and covert methods.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.220
 And they did a lot of hiding and running away.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.820
 And one of their main ways of hiding

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.100
 was using the water.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.940
 So certain ninja texts from the time

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.980
 advise that in daytime, hide underwater.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.140
 So it's not to be seen.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.860
 You just spend the whole day underwater.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:29.860
 Really?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.260
 And so you need this snorkel-like thing

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.620
 on the end of your sword.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.940
 And so the scabbard end can double as a breathing tube.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.180
 One of the texts that I read, advising ninjas,

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:40.100
 said that the end of your scabbard,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.020
 if you had the removable tip taken off,

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.660
 could also be a hearing aid or a megaphone.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:45.420
 [LAUGHTER]

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:46.420
 Cool.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.220
 Wow.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.220
 That's fantastic.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.660
 I could also be used as a step ladder

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.340
 for climbing golf offenses.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:52.980
 Oh, yeah.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.980
 Well, you'd sort of jab it into the wall.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:58.140
 I think it might be, what I imagine that this might be wrong,

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.020
 because this just came out of my imagination.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.220
 But, you know, like with a sword,

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.900
 you have that like crossbit that kind of hides your hand.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.340
 But if you turn it upside down, you could just step on it.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:11.660
 Oh, I thought even if you stabbed it into the wall,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.780
 you could bounce off the sword.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.540
 Yes.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.060
 And I tell you a cool thing that ninjas could do.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.660
 So ninjas had incredible abilities

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.660
 according to the old texts.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.940
 One other thing they could do is they

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.740
 could tell the time of day by looking at a cat's eye.

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.580
 So if you asked a ninja what time is it?

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.540
 And the cat was around.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.420
 They could look at the cat.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.460
 And they would study the people of the eye,

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.100
 which changes during the day according to the sun.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.820
 And if they can't see the cat, it's nighttime.

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.900
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.900
 Yeah?

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.300
 [APPLAUSE]

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.420
 What, that didn't happen, did it?

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.740
 You would have to have a cat on you at all times.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.380
 It's more difficult to carry a cat around to know the time

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.540
 than it is to just guess the time.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:03.460
 But it would be a party trick, as you would say.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.260
 Well, then everyone on the party knows you're a ninja, don't they?

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.780
 They didn't go to parties.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.820
 Their whole raison d'etre was conceiting their identity.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.420
 Oh, it's just cool as a James Bond of--

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.820
 That's what James Bond did.

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.340
 You can't keep a cat on the water.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.220
 They hate the water.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.700
 They can do that.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.580
 So patronized by these guys sometimes,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.820
 they could read cat's eyes.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.140
 And also--

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.820
 So can we just decancise actually change according to the--

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.340
 I do.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.460
 They do very slightly because of the amount of likes on the letter.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.820
 Yeah, but that's not a reliable indicator of time, is it?

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.980
 Because if you're in a dark room, but it's midday,

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.020
 and you look at the cat and the cat's eyes are massive,

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.940
 you think, oh, great, it's nighttime, I can leave my dark room.

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.460
 It's nice.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.540
 Midday, you're going to be spotted immediately.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.380
 No, but this is a completely unworkable system.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.700
 It's not a system.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.660
 [APPLAUSE]

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:00.580
 So I'm so angry.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.260
 It's like saying they have an ability.

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.220
 Oh, they're going to do it 24 hours a day.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.140
 It must be a lie.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.780
 It's-- you know, they do it when a cat's around, like that's--

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.660
 I can do stuff when a cat's around that I

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.100
 won't need to do when it's not around.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.580
 We don't need to know about you, probably, though.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.660
 This might be a good moment to mention

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.260
 that it's very difficult to study ninjas,

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:24.740
 because there's little side evidence

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.260
 that a lot of rumour about what they could do.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.600
 So there are a few really, really good texts,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.420
 like the Book of Ninja, which I'm sure

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.300
 down is drawing from here.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.060
 But a lot of people are sort of in pain,

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.820
 and they're just going to fly, or that they could read minds,

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.020
 or that they could go invisible.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.580
 And that was all bullshit.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:41.500
 But they could do a lot.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.140
 But the rock, narrowest at noon, when you see their eyes,

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.660
 narrowed right in the air.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.300
 Do you know why--

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.100
 It's 12 p.m.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.020
 One way they could tell the time, which I thought was quite

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.380
 cool, that wasn't one of the books.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.780
 And this was written in like the 1630s, I think,

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.460
 was they said, "A way to see if time is passing if you're

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.100
 hiding at night to ambush is work out which

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.460
 nostril you're breathing out of because you're nostrils."

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.380
 So you know how you're only ever breathing out

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.300
 of one nostril at a time.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.860
 And this swaps around sporadically.

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.900
 And the rule was that it swaps around roughly every hour.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.900
 And so if you're aware that you're nostrils have just swaps,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.940
 then a hammer's gone by.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.300
 All right, all right, ninjas.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.860
 Synchronize your noses.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.540
 Can I just say, yeah, there are some people

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.060
 who think that ninjas weren't really a thing.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.780
 Like, they didn't exist nearly as much as

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.940
 is now believed by popular culture.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.140
 And because there's some little evidence of it,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.660
 so there was a Japan expert from the University of Leeds,

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.300
 who said that ninjas actively didn't exist in the way we--

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:43.900
 But that's what ninjas want you to think.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.700
 Oh, yeah.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.380
 There's some kind of hiding all this.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.820
 They're all just underwater.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.420
 So the kind of thing of someone--

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:53.660
 basically, the idea of someone running around in Black

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.420
 pajamas is not coherent as an idea,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.100
 because it will be very obvious.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.460
 So it's mostly agricultural land at this time in history.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.740
 So you'd be dressed as a farmer if you were an ninja.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.580
 If you see a guy running around in Black soaking wet pajamas

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:16.900
 with a cat's algorithm, he's going to sink out.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.220
 I mean, so there is lots of--

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.380
 so he gave an example, actually.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:24.700
 So the year is 1,600, two of your enemies are fighting a battle.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.700
 So you send a couple of guys dressed as farmers to the area

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.060
 to watch the battle and report back about what's happening.

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.020
 That's ninja work.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.260
 So that's the kind of--

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.340
 a lot of it was more, I think, observation than nunchucks

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.940
 and thrice.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.020
 But it was extremely so efficient.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.460
 So like, it's stories that people tend to think

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.740
 are very trustworthy.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.260
 From that period recorded it, there's

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.700
 a guy called Fuji Bayashi, who recorded

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.460
 a lot of the ninjas methods.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:51.940
 And they were bound by a sort of spirituality, which

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.900
 was ruled by five elements.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.180
 And these elements were wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.500
 And these all represented different ways of fighting,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.140
 or hiding, or getting away.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.260
 And they're really funny.

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.580
 So he recorded the ways you'd use these different elements.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.380
 So in the water one, it would be, for instance,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.300
 you'd use your sword as the breathing tube.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.660
 Or you would have to be trained to throw large quantities

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.540
 of duckweed on water that you think you might escape

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.940
 through later, so that you could then hide among its leaves

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.900
 and float with them to safety.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.060
 OK, yeah.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.700
 Very clever.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.780
 I found a one that might be an earth method,

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.860
 if that's one of the elements.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.660
 So there's apparently a skill called Uzura Gakuri, which

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.900
 is curling oneself into a ball to look like a rock.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.460
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.260
 So you believe that one?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.260
 No, I actually don't.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.660
 But then there's someone who comes disguised as some paper,

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:47.860
 and they can just be a fast guy.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.980
 [LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.620
 Yeah, we're just saying that they don't carry animals with them,

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.420
 cats with them.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.100
 But they did.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.700
 Supposedly, carry crickets with them.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.260
 Boxes of crickets.

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.500
 And the idea was if they needed to go somewhere,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.820
 but they were a bit noisy, they could then release the crickets.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.420
 And the crickets would make crickety noises,

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.500
 and then they could quickly shuffle over

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500
 to where they need to be.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:10.100
 Ah, that's nice.

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.260
 OK, how do they keep the crickets quiet?

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.260
 They keep them in a jar or a box.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.020
 This is much more plausible than the cat thing, so far.

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.540
 So they also used to wear fake children's feet.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.540
 What do you think?

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.540
 The crickets.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.540
 Oh, no.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.100
 No, the ninjas.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:34.100
 So it is said, I need to say, it is said, is rumored,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:38.220
 that the ninjas used to wear on the souls of their shoes,

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.740
 sort of either children's feet or an elderly woman's foot.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.820
 Didn't know what that looks like.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.620
 So the footprints in, let's say, the sand,

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:48.700
 or their soggy feet coming out of the river,

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.140
 be like, which child must have been swimming in that?

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.580
 So they wouldn't be deceiving.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.340
 Well, it's true that American cattle wrestlers

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.940
 used to wear shoes which had cow hooves on the bottom of them,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.180
 so you would think that it was cows that had gone past

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.220
 or horses rather than yet humans.

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.500
 And in Bhutan, it said that yetis can take their feet off

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.140
 and put them on backwards, so it looks like they've

00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:10.180
 gone that way when, in fact, they are on that way.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.060
 I was really trying to help.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.540
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.180
 And that is my fact.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.300
 My fact this week is that one month before the French Spider

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.300
 Man successfully climbed the second tallest building

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.180
 in the world, he was hospitalised after falling

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.140
 from a seven foot tall traffic light.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:35.980
 Now, this was to promote his climb of the second--

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.020
 what was at the time, actually, the tallest building

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.620
 in the world, which was in Taiwan.

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.820
 And he was climbing this traffic light.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.820
 The photographer was there.

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.540
 He slipped, fell, got 40 stitches, was hospitalised,

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.620
 and it jeopardised the actual climb itself.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.060
 They thought he might not be able to do it,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.500
 but he did pull through.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.660
 And he is an urban climber.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.340
 He is.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.300
 Yeah, his name is Alain Roberts.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.140
 And he is online.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.660
 I don't know the community that well,

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.660
 but when you see online, he sort of regarded

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.700
 as the greatest urban climber of our day.

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.700
 I mean, he's in his mid-50s now.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.860
 I think he's about 56.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.380
 And he's still climbing extremely tall buildings.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:15.140
 It's amazing.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.260
 Although he's bound for climbing in Britain.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.420
 We don't like him.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.900
 He was-- I feel kind of bound for him.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.540
 So he climbed the Heron Tower in London,

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:23.900
 great tall skyscraper.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.500
 And he was arrested the moment he reached the top.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.420
 I just feel like, so he took him over half an hour.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.300
 And he was waiting for him at the top.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.140
 I was like, what else is he going to do?

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.140
 I'm going to climb down the thing, are they?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.180
 He's only wasted half an hour.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.100
 I think that's OK.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:39.620
 You're right.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:42.220
 And then he's wasted the 20-week suspended jail sentence

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.500
 that he got, and £5,500.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.780
 Well, he also, in 2012, he was spotted inside

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.700
 the shard building in London.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.340
 And the building's owners subsequently

00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:52.780
 obtain the injunction, prevents

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.780
 them from ever returning to their building.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.780
 Ah, I thought he'd be saying--

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:00.180
 I thought he'd be saying he realized, oh, I'm on the wrong side.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.700
 He's lost it up the stairs going, this is easy.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.300
 So he's climbed over 150 skyscrapers.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.740
 And one thing he says is that the first two meters

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.260
 are almost the most important, because after that,

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.700
 the police can't grab your feet.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.700
 I'm so late.

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.060
 As Anna was saying, the police are often there waiting

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.700
 for him when he gets to the top of the building.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:23.900
 And I've read in interviews that the only thing he has on him

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.940
 is chalk for his hands, as he's climbing,

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.740
 and he wears special shoes.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.820
 But that's not quite true, because I think what he also

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.900
 carries on him is a task, so he knows what time it is.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.900
 Yes.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:36.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.060
 Box of crickets, so no one can hear him coming.

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:42.660
 His climbing shoes are actually the shape of an old woman's

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.660
 feet.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:45.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.140
 Come on.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.580
 Well, it looks like the old woman climbed

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.540
 the south face of the building.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.740
 So no, what he actually does carry with him

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:57.580
 is his passport and his lawyer's number.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.180
 And he just hands that to the police as soon as he gets there.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.460
 But it's quite-- it's probably a common thing.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.420
 Urban climbing.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.500
 It's something that there are quite a few heroes

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.300
 of urban climbing.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.260
 In 2016, there was a guy who got in trouble

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.460
 because he tried to scale Trump Tower.

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.340
 And he sent three hours doing it.

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.860
 And he was using suction cups on his hands,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.460
 like hand on his hands and feet, in fact.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.220
 So it was a massive suction cup.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.220
 And he reached the 21st floor.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.860
 But NYPD were desperately trying to catch him.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.700
 It was bizarre to watch.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.820
 So they kept on sort of smashing windows

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.380
 up the building to try and reach out, to grab him.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.060
 And they couldn't get him.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.020
 They kept trying to impede his progress like climbing

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.300
 through air vents and stuff, I think.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.140
 And they just couldn't do it.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.460
 And eventually, they set up two massive air bags,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.820
 like mattresses, in case he fell down,

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:43.660
 just below him and on the pavement.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.340
 And he was asked afterwards why he'd done it.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.860
 So there was this huge rigmarole, just three hours,

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:49.940
 really just 21st floor.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.180
 And then the police sprung out of the window,

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.620
 grabbed him, and pulled him in.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:54.940
 Said, why on earth have you done that?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.060
 And he said, look, I'm just a political researcher.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.900
 And I really wanted to meet Donald Trump.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.860
 You know, just we were talking about Alan Robert.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.740
 He has vertigo.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:05.260
 Really?

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.740
 He suffers from vertigo.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.820
 And vertigo is sort of feeding the earth

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.540
 to free yourself off a great height, isn't it?

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:11.340
 It's not fear of height.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.940
 No, it's all in her inner ear problem,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.740
 which makes you dizzy.

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.940
 Yeah, stuff.

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.460
 I thought then you got the earth, so you

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.980
 feel like the ground was coming towards you.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.940
 I think you feel very dizzy and you feel a bit unstable.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.580
 And he's had that since 1982.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.340
 And he's still done it.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:26.180
 Yeah.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.220
 He had it after he was showing students

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.940
 how to climb with his hands behind his back,

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.700
 and then fell 26 feet off the wall.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.940
 Yeah.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.220
 He's married with three kids.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.060
 And I read an interview with his wife,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:42.020
 because they said, you must be freaked out.

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.980
 Every single time he goes and climbs a building,

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.820
 how are you feeling?

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.020
 And she sort of kind of said, well, I

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.300
 knew what I was getting into, really,

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.620
 because when she first met him, both of his arms

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:52.340
 were in plaster casts from a wall.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.180
 The one thing that defeated him in London in 2002

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.580
 was the weather.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.780
 He got three quarters up the way of number one

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.420
 Canada Square in Canary Wharf.

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.820
 It was so cold wet and windy, he just got completely stuck

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.740
 and had to be rescued by a window-cleaning left.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.740
 Oh.

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.780
 It's amazing.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:14.020
 But it's got a long and illustrious history of inclining,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.820
 which, by the way, it's called--

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.780
 it's got a number of names.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.540
 It could be called edificeering or stegopherly.

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.020
 So that's the official term for it.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.820
 And I really like the etymology of this.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.460
 So the Greek stegos is roof, so it's

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.820
 a love of roof, so it's like climbing up onto roofs.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.260
 It's from the same roof as what's

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:32.420
 like the other word that you just see with stegosaurus.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.420
 Yeah, it's from the same roof as stegosaurus,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.020
 because that means roofed lizard.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.980
 Because when they first found stegosaurus,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.500
 they thought--

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.500
 People climbing up it.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.740
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.820
 They had a roof on top.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.740
 No, it was-- so they thought that the plate on top of a stegosaurus

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:49.540
 would be horizontal rather than vertical,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:51.660
 so they thought that it had a roof over it,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:52.940
 so it's called roofed lizard.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:53.940
 That's so cool.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:54.940
 It's cool.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:56.940
 But an urban climbing obstacle, stegopherly,

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.260
 has a long history in Oxygen Cambridge University.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.980
 So the first urban climber was a guy

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.740
 called Jeffrey Winthrop Young, who published a bit

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.700
 called the roof climber's guide to Trinity at College

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.540
 Cambridge.

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.300
 And it gave really detailed instructions

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.260
 on which roots to take up.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.020
 And then there was another guy called

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.740
 Noel Howard Simmington, who wrote one in 1937.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.500
 Again, nine climbers guide to Cambridge.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.860
 And his pseudonym was Whipple Snaith.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.260
 And this is so weird.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.140
 The person who reviewed his book and wrote

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.660
 about the details of climbing up Cambridge buildings

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.060
 was also called Whipple.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.580
 He was called Tom Whipple.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.060
 So the modern day Cambridge building

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.700
 climber is called Tom Whipple.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:37.740
 I know Tom Whipple.

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.740
 No way.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.220
 Well, I don't know if it's the same Tom Whipple.

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:41.100
 Yeah, I'm sure it will be.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.740
 I know the circles you're moving.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.820
 No, it's good.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.620
 Have you guys heard of the human fly?

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:47.860
 I know there's no anecdote.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.340
 To know the human fly.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:50.860
 Well, he's a journalist.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:51.940
 Yeah, he is.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:53.020
 He's a very nice guy.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.140
 Tell us about the human fly.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.300
 Yeah.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.740
 His name is Tom Whipple.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:04.300
 So OK, we need to move on.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.020
 So the human fly was a guy called Henry Gardner.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:10.100
 And he was one of the first really impressive building

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.700
 climbers.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.060
 He was in the 1910s and 20s.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:18.380
 He climbed 700 buildings without gear, frequently wearing a suit.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.380
 And he was paid to do it by companies

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.140
 to promote their offices in the new skyscrapers.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.900
 So in 1916, he climbed to the ninth floor window

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.260
 of a skyscraper, climbed into the window

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.420
 of a bank branch and opened an account at the bank.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.660
 That's what the stunts he did.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.860
 Or he would do the, you know, open an insurance thing.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.940
 And he was really, really famous.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:39.980
 We don't know what happened to him.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.740
 He went missing in 1925.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.260
 Oh, really?

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.820
 He probably fell off a building, didn't he?

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.140
 If he was, yes.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.620
 I'm afraid he might have.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.020
 That Robert guy does it for money now, doesn't he?

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.740
 He basically does it sponsored and he usually uses

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.620
 actual climbing gear and stuff like that.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.220
 But actually, a lot of people do die.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.460
 So this Harry Gardner, who was, actually,

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.620
 it was Grover Cleveland, the president who

00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.020
 nicknamed him the human flight, apparently.

00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.660
 And he said that 120 of those who sought to imitate me

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.300
 in this hazardous profession have fallen to death.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:12.420
 So he was saying that that happened.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.660
 And people have looked into this.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.740
 Scientists have looked into it.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.020
 There's been a study in 2006.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.660
 And they said, in every country, there

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.380
 is an excess of male deaths due to potentially

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:22.580
 avoidable reasons.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:28.020
 According to their theory, this is what they

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:31.620
 quote to the saying, men are idiots.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.700
 And idiots do stupid things.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:43.420
 And on that note, we need to move onto our final fact

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.420
 of the show.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.660
 And that is James.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.060
 OK.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.460
 My fact this week is that in the early Eurovision Song

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:55.020
 Contests, songs could not be performed in public before the event.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.780
 One Danish song was banned after the composer whistled it

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.780
 in a TV broadcaster's canteen.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:02.780
 Wow.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.660
 This is incredible.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.860
 So yeah, this was in the bit where you had

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.500
 to become the Danish entry.

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.140
 And there were six different songs.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.420
 And this guy was just in the canteen having his lunch.

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.580
 And he was just kind of whistling it to himself.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:17.500
 And then they did the actual thing where they performed it.

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.020
 And the people that were going, sounds a bit familiar, isn't it?

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.580
 And then they got banned.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.580
 No.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.740
 And what is he maybe secretly doing it to try

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.780
 and to seed the tune in people's minds

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.540
 or is there no suggestion of that?

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.220
 You know what, I haven't thought of that.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:32.980
 But yeah, I mean, probably not.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.540
 I think that's a very cynical take.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:36.740
 Well, an amazing song.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.660
 But they were like, wait, that's the song I heard in that canteen

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.180
 a week ago.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.980
 What a shame it couldn't enter.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:43.940
 Yeah, that's true.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.340
 What a great whistler he must be.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:50.100
 Whistler, everyone is a better whistler than they are a singer.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:50.620
 What?

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:53.980
 It's easier to match a tune that you've heard whistling

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.700
 than it is singing.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:56.460
 There are some people who can't whistle, right?

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.420
 I've met a few people who can't whistle.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.420
 Right.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.700
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.620
 So yeah, well, OK, hang on.

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.740
 If you can whistle, you are a better whistler, probably,

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.740
 than you are a singer.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.660
 It's much weaker than--

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.020
 Tell me about Todd Whipple.

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.940
 That's interesting, really.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:17.300
 Well, they've looked at that.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.580
 That's not just your opinion.

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.180
 It's not just my opinion.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.460
 Well, this isn't an opinion based on that.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.980
 They've done studies to test the picture whistler.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.020
 They've done studies asking people, can you repeat this tune

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:29.860
 sung or repeat it?

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.660
 And it's because-- I mean, you know, it's obviously much easier

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.860
 to make a tune on the musical instrument,

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.780
 because they're specifically designed to match the specific notes.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.420
 But muscles are just a bit less precise.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.100
 I've been getting closer with it in your opinion.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.500
 You know, when the Eurovision song contest first started,

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.660
 Britain decided we didn't want to take part

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:51.900
 in this Eurovision song contest.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.500
 So we decided to have our own British song contest

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.980
 of British populist songs, which was one by Dennis Lotus,

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.460
 who was born in South Africa.

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:04.380
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.060
 Because I don't really understand about Eurovision.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:09.700
 And I think it is bigger here than it is in Britain.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.540
 But it's the continent's systems every year

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.540
 that it's not political.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.540
 It should never be political.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.740
 And it's just about the music.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.220
 But it is so patiently political.

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.860
 I don't understand why everyone doesn't embrace that.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.860
 So there have been everything about the history of Eurovision.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.580
 In 2009, though, it was just after the Russia Georgia conflict.

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:28.340
 And Georgia had to withdraw its entry,

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.340
 because the organizers had told them they had to change

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.300
 their lyrics and the title of their entry song, which

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.500
 was, we don't want to put in, which

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.060
 is a very unveiled reference to Putin.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:41.540
 So yeah.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.300
 And then it's back and forth all the time.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.420
 Yeah, there was-- when it first came,

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.860
 it was supposed to bring Europe together.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:52.940
 But Turkey pulled out in 1976, because Greece were taking part.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.980
 But then Greece pulled out in 1975,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:57.380
 because Turkey were taking part.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.700
 Greece sent to Ireland in 2008, because they

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.940
 mentioned Macedonia.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.540
 And they sent to Finland in 2007 for being satanic.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.060
 But then Finland censored Israel in the same year

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:08.900
 for mentioning nuclear weapons.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.780
 And this year, Israel's embassy complained

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.660
 to the Netherlands after they paraded their Eurovision winner.

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.220
 And Iran moved all of its diplomats from Azerbaijan in 2012

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.180
 and protested it, hosting the contest,

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.460
 even though Iran's nothing to do with Eurovision.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.060
 And when Israel won in 1978, the TV show in Georgia

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.940
 told viewers that Belgium had won.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.420
 And in 1973, Portugal arrested the writer of its own song.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.260
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.220
 Because they thought it wasn't fascist enough.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.620
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.780
 [APPLAUSE]

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.340
 Very cool.

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:47.420
 So glad and so glad we're all friends together.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.500
 Do you know Salvador Dali was involved with the Eurovision

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:51.500
 song?

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.460
 Yeah, 1969, the stage-- so it was in Madrid.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.940
 And the stage had this giant sculpture, a metal sculpture

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:58.460
 on stage.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.620
 And that was designed by Salvador Dali.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.740
 But not only that, he also designed their press material,

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.420
 all the press packages and stuff.

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:06.820
 That sounds like an early job.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.060
 That's different, isn't it?

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.260
 Now, he was a man who had trouble telling the time.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.700
 Let's face it.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:15.660
 [APPLAUSE]

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:19.540
 The 1978 one was particularly controversial.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.100
 So the 1970s was the one that Israel won.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.420
 I think, and during the contest, it became obvious

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.940
 that Israel was going to win.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.380
 And most Arabic countries were transmitting it

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.220
 on their TV stations.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.060
 And they canceled the transmission as soon as it became obvious.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.940
 So they were just quickly flipped to another channel

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.140
 within their explanation.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:40.580
 And actually, you say that the children said that Belgium had won.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.940
 And they just replaced their transmission

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.700
 with a bunch of daffodils.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.140
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:45.940
 Very cool.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.380
 So it was a-- you mentioned the British equivalent.

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.220
 Yes.

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:53.500
 There was a Soviet Union equivalent as well,

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.100
 which was called Intervision, the Individuals song contest.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.020
 It only happened four times.

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.100
 And we've spoken about this before.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.820
 Is this was the way that you voted?

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.860
 It was that-- a lot of people didn't have

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.500
 telephones in the Soviet Union.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.740
 So you had to turn on your lights if you liked the song.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.940
 And you had to turn them off if you didn't like the song.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.580
 And they just measured the load on each country's electricity

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:17.820
 network.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:18.820
 No.

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:20.300
 And that determined how many points you got.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300
 Nice.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.300
 That's clever.

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.780
 Yeah, that's true.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.140
 And it was amazing.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:29.980
 It was the wild west of songs, of some contest.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:32.740
 So for example, one entrant in those four years

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.220
 stayed on stage for 45 minutes.

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.220
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:38.620
 Just kept going until they were removed.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.140
 The thing about that is that you had to--

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.060
 I think someone else pointed this out in our class reading--

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.020
 you had to sit in pitch dark for all of the songs you didn't like.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.020
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.100
 You can't turn your lights on.

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.060
 How miserable you don't like the song anyway.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.660
 Also, bizarrely, Canada was an entrant in two of the, I think,

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:59.300
 four years that that was going.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.660
 They have weird entrants, like the fact that Australia

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.820
 is a neurovisionist, obviously, a bit weird,

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.780
 and also a bit painful, because they

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.540
 have the highest score on average, the Australians.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:10.820
 I'm an Aussie.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.900
 Fuck you, I'm fine.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:13.580
 So good.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:14.980
 We've been there in five times.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.620
 And in three of those five, we've made it to the top 10.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.060
 Yeah, I wonder how many of you were.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.500
 What did you come this year?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.820
 [LAUGHTER]

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.140
 I feel we're all going to lose the reggae of Sweden.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.620
 Yeah, do you know if you actually go to the Eurovision

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.140
 Song Contest, what you have to do is adhere to very strict rules

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.780
 about what can go in with you.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.340
 So most places you go to, there's a list of things

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.900
 that are not allowed to be taken into a venue.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.180
 But with the European Song Contest, it's things

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.940
 like helmets, adhesive tape, golf balls, another loud,

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:49.300
 and shopping trolleys.

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.820
 They specify shopping trolleys.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.260
 It just feels like they're each year they're responding

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.860
 to one disastrous entry.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.300
 So I think about within the last decade,

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.540
 the Greek team performed on a trampoline.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.060
 Did they?

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:02.900
 Yeah.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.900
 So I don't know if trampolines are on the list.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.580
 No, I mean, no, this is for the people coming.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.740
 It's not for the people.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.980
 Sorry, it's for audience people, sorry, OK.

00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.460
 There hasn't been something in the Eurovision Song Contest

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.660
 just singing and hitting golf balls into the audience.

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.580
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.260
 It would be so unsurprising.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:21.980
 Yeah.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.820
 So there was the Russians who came second, I think,

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.900
 a few years ago, with that team of grannies

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.940
 who baked bread on stage.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.460
 Yeah.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.340
 I mean, it is a strange contest.

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:37.940
 There was-- in 1985, the contest was held in Gothenburg.

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:40.700
 [APPLAUSE]

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.220
 Cool.

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:44.060
 It's such an easy way of getting the cheers.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.180
 Shameless.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:49.620
 And it was very popular amongst British viewers.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.900
 And a lot of people tuned in, where you wouldn't really

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.900
 think they would do.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.860
 And that's because the Swedish entry was

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.060
 entitled Bra vibration.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.060
 [LAUGHTER]

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.140
 Is that--

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:03.660
 Wow.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.660
 Wow.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:09.780
 For-- is that some kind of milking tool?

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.900
 Well, for the people who are in this room,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.700
 I believe it means good vibrations.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.420
 Oh, I see.

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:19.140
 Wow, vibration.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.540
 In 1997, Denmark's entry was a rap indian-ish about a guy

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:27.980
 who had fallen in love with a woman from directory inquiries.

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.300
 In 1918, Norway's entry was a song about the construction

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:35.260
 of a hydroelectric power plant.

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.860
 Estonia in 2013 had a song, which repeatedly

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.820
 just said the phrase, "A local man called Kostakov

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:45.420
 went to Latvia yesterday."

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.940
 And in 2006, Lithuania had a song called

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.620
 "We are the winners," which just said,

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:53.780
 "We are the winners again and again and again and again."

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.740
 And they came sick.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.900
 I want to know if they ever found a local man called Kostakov.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.780
 We're going to have to rock off, guys.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.020
 Well, OK, what do I think?

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.860
 Yeah.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.900
 The first person to get in Ilpoir, as in no points in Eurovision,

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:14.060
 was a guy called Jan Tegen from Norway.

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.900
 OK.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.700
 But he became a national hero, because he got no points.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.100
 And his song was number one for two months.

00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.580
 I'm remained in the top 10 for three months afterwards.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:29.780
 And he also had a number one album called "This Year's Loser."

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.500
 [LAUGHTER]

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:39.540
 OK, that is all of our facts.

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.020
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.020

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.820

 Thank you.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.220
 [APPLAUSE]

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:17.800
 (upbeat music)
