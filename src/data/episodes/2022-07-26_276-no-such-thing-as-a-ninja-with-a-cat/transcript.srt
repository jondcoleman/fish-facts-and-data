 My name is Dan Schreiber.

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,900
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
 and James Harkin.

21
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,020
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

22
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,820
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,620
 And in no particular order, here we go.

24
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,820
 Starting with you, Andy.

25
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,460
 My fact is that Sweden's public art body

26
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,140
 has just commissioned an artwork, which

27
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,140
 will hire someone to do nothing at Gothenburg's

28
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:01,820
 course of art and train station for the next 120 years.

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,020
 [APPLAUSE]

30
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:08,020
 120 years.

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
 120 years.

32
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
 120 years.

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,780
 So that can't be the same person for 120 years.

34
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,300
 Well, it might be.

35
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,020
 We don't know about medical advances in the next century.

36
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
 That's true.

37
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,260
 So this is a thing.

38
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,900
 It's called eternal employment.

39
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,980
 And Gothenburg has a new train station called Coursesvarkin.

40
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,020
 And I don't know if you can tell the home,

41
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,940
 but people here are very excited about it.

42
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,260
 [LAUGHTER]

43
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,060
 There was a competition to provide a public artwork.

44
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,180
 And there were two artists who won, called Simon Golden

45
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,340
 and Jacob Senneby.

46
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,460
 And they have half a million pounds to spend.

47
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,020
 And they spent it on hiring an employee

48
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,140
 to do whatever they like, forever.

49
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,860
 As long as you check in and check out of your work each day,

50
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,900
 you will get 21,600 Kroner a month, which

51
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,060
 is enough to buy five beers here.

52
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,740
 [LAUGHTER]

53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,460
 But then the application-- you can still go for this,

54
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,060
 by the way.

55
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,060
 The application deadline is the 15th of December, 2025.

56
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,540
 OK?

57
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,060
 Yeah.

58
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,860
 And their duties will be taken up.

59
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,820
 Well, the black of duties will be taken up on the 15th of March,

60
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,260
 2026.

61
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,020
 OK.

62
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,860
 So if you're bad with deadlines like me,

63
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,660
 you can put that off for another six years.

64
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,380
 And there's a job description online, which is quite poetic.

65
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,460
 It goes, there's a scent.

66
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,740
 Do you smell it?

67
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,220
 The scent of something.

68
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,580
 We smell it.

69
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
 It's seaweed.

70
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,540
 [LAUGHTER]

71
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,540
 You're seaweed.

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,780
 You want to be seaweed.

73
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,940
 You shall be seaweed.

74
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,060
 You know that.

75
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,540
 Thank you for knowing.

76
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,900
 Thank you for seaweed.

77
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,260
 You're standing there, right there, standing like what?

78
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,580
 Like a prawn.

79
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,380
 A positive prawn.

80
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,140
 A flexible prawn.

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,300
 An unpretentious prawn.

82
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,580
 A goal-oriented prawn.

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,500
 Thank you.

84
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
 Thanks.

85
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 Wow.

86
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,180
 So I think that tells you everything that you

87
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,500
 have to do for this shelf.

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,780
 Any questions?

89
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,500
 Does that sound more normal in Swedish?

90
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,620
 Google translates on a hell of a job.

91
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,620
 So I like that.

92
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,660
 The way it's going to be, as well, is once the station

93
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,460
 is open, the applicant has been chosen,

94
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,300
 and he's got, or she has, residency of the job.

95
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,420
 There's going to be fluorescent lights that go on

96
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:29,100
 on the station level, or the platform levels,

97
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,940
 to let all passengers know that the person doing nothing

98
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,580
 is at work, that they're here either doing something,

99
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,980
 or absolutely nothing.

100
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,740
 And you can't tell who they are if they're on the platforms,

101
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,140
 but there's going to be two rooms that they can go to.

102
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,340
 One is a glass room, where you can see what they're doing,

103
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,140
 and the other is just a closed-off room, which they can just

104
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,780
 choose to sit in, and you never see.

105
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,300
 But actually, they don't have to stay

106
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,180
 on in the train station at all.

107
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,780
 As long as they clock in and clock out,

108
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,940
 they could bug a rough all day.

109
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,780
 Yeah, that's it.

110
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,260
 But there are things you can't do.

111
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,860
 So you can't go and get another job.

112
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,220
 That is seen as not playing the game.

113
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,620
 But the job does come with a pension, and with holiday.

114
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,780
 So you've got a holiday from doing nothing.

115
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,060
 It's not actually a brilliant paid job.

116
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,900
 It's fine.

117
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,580
 But if the salary is really below average--

118
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,700
 And I work it in 120 years, it's going to be worth literally.

119
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,500
 Well, it's going up.

120
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,980
 It's going up within 30 years.

121
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,620
 By 3% a year.

122
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,380
 And if you die, they will just give the job to something else.

123
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,380
 Yeah.

124
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,140
 I think that's how jobs work, generally.

125
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,020
 Every company folds, but everyone dies.

126
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,900
 I guess we need to retire that role, though.

127
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,580
 Persons serving at the counter of McDonald's.

128
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,540
 It's just going to have to be an empty counter now.

129
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
 But we should see what his purpose is, really.

130
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,500
 Which they are making a point.

131
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,220
 So it's inspired by Thomas Piketty's capital

132
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,340
 in the 21st century.

133
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,540
 That very trendy book for anyone claiming to be academic,

134
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,820
 or some just-- so it's about the return on capital

135
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,780
 being higher than the average increase in wages.

136
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,260
 So it's basically-- there's this art prize money, which

137
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,900
 was $7 million, or I think.

138
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,620
 And the idea is that they're going to invest that.

139
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,420
 And the return on that investment is going

140
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,580
 to yield that personal salary for 120 years.

141
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,820
 So the idea is money makes more money than humans do.

142
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,580
 Which is depressing.

143
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,460
 But still fun for that person who's doing the job.

144
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,020
 Can I say a very quick thing about?

145
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,260
 So this is art meets train station.

146
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,060
 And so the most ambitious crossover in the history.

147
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,020
 And so I was looking into sort of entertaining art sort

148
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,820
 of things that we're going on with train stations.

149
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,540
 And I read this fact, which is in London, in our underground

150
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,780
 station, we have the very famous iconic Mind the Gap,

151
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,260
 Mind the Gap, which is set.

152
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,140
 So when that was initially recorded,

153
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,460
 it was recorded by a sound engineer called Peter Lodge.

154
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,060
 And he got an actor who was a well-known actor of the time.

155
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,380
 And he got into recording.

156
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,420
 He recorded Mind the Gap and Stan Clear of the Doors.

157
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,140
 And after it was recorded, and they were sort of getting

158
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,540
 it ready to send it out, the guy suddenly said,

159
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,300
 I want royalties for every time.

160
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,620
 [LAUGHTER]

161
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,460
 Oh, yeah.

162
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,620
 And they went, you can't have that.

163
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,380
 That's insane.

164
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,980
 And he said, no, that's my deal.

165
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,100
 So they cut him off.

166
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,340
 And they were going to re-record it.

167
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,020
 But they listened to the recording of the sound engineer,

168
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,300
 Peter Lodge, who was testing the microphones going mind the gap.

169
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,700
 And they went, that's good enough.

170
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,940
 And he became--

171
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,340
 He was the original voice of the London Underground,

172
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,660
 the sound engineer, testing the microphones.

173
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,260
 That's great.

174
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,780
 Yeah.

175
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,220
 Because we have a very, quite a famous thing in London

176
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,300
 about the Mind the Gap announcement.

177
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,100
 Maybe the station announcement at one station,

178
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,060
 I can't remember which, which is recorded by a guy

179
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,900
 who died a few years ago.

180
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,380
 And then they changed the recording

181
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,020
 because someone else got it.

182
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,420
 They thought they'd jazz up the station.

183
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,220
 And the widow of the guy who died wrote to the station,

184
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,740
 didn't she?

185
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,460
 And said, please, can you change that back?

186
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,620
 That's the only time I hear my husband's voice.

187
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,180
 Yeah, his name was Oswald Lawrence.

188
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,620
 It was in Bankman station.

189
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,820
 It was on the Northern line.

190
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,180
 And they changed it back so she could always hear his voice,

191
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:11,900
 saying it.

192
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,940
 Yeah, that's really nice.

193
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,660
 Yeah.

194
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,660
 Speaking of London, so there's--

195
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,420
 Oh, it's kept in practical, too.

196
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,100
 You're not even going to like where this goes.

197
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,580
 I'm going to say, so if you live in London,

198
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,380
 there's another job you can get which seems quite cushy.

199
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,860
 It is to become a luxury product tester.

200
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,740
 For that, you get a $75,000 salary, which is about $100,000.

201
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,220
 And you get to test supercars yachts and private islands.

202
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,020
 Wow.

203
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,660
 OK, so this morning I applied for this job.

204
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,860
 Let's see, you look up jobs testing luxury islands.

205
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,820
 I found out there is a man whose job is to watch paint drying.

206
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,860
 And he's a real person.

207
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,020
 He's called Keith Jackson.

208
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,460
 And he works for an industrial paint firm.

209
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,060
 And a big part of his job is assessing

210
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,140
 the drying time of industrial paint.

211
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,820
 And that doesn't sound important, does it?

212
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,660
 But I really can't.

213
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,940
 He must have been watching it the whole time, has he?

214
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,180
 He might have a break.

215
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,180
 He'll probably have a break.

216
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,740
 Imagine if he has a break for 15 minutes,

217
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,740
 he comes back and he's already trying.

218
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,180
 That's a bad pay in the office, isn't it?

219
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,020
 Fuck say.

220
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,820
 Do you think paint is like a watch pot?

221
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,500
 Do you think it boils as soon as your back is turned?

222
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
 No, the reason it's important that it happens

223
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,380
 is because sometimes paint things.

224
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,820
 And then you need to know how long the paint will take to be dry.

225
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,700
 So, for example, loved and underground,

226
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,820
 they can only be painted stations between three o'clock

227
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,260
 and five o'clock in the morning.

228
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,460
 And then it has to be dry enough to walk on.

229
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,740
 So this is a very high-stake situation.

230
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,500
 Wow.

231
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,500
 And the high-stakes and medium, low to medium, the medium.

232
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,180
 But he said people do love and find it amusing

233
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,660
 when I tell them what I do.

234
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,740
 He said it could be described as the most boring job

235
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,300
 in the world, but it is a very important one.

236
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
 Watching paint dry sounds quite easy,

237
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,060
 but it can be stressful at times.

238
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,060
 [LAUGHTER]

239
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,260
 So also while you're looking at jobs of watching paint dry,

240
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,580
 I was looking at jobs of watching pornography.

241
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,060
 And apparently there's a nightclub in Denmark

242
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,460
 that's hiring someone to watch 20 hours of pornographic films

243
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,660
 for 2,500 pounds equivalent.

244
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,020
 And the reason is they want to select the best parts

245
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,420
 of the soundtrack that they'll make a playlist of,

246
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,220
 that they'll play in the nightclub bathroom.

247
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,780
 Sure, there's the reason.

248
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,340
 I've been looking at some kind of jobs

249
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,020
 of sound, some people who are kind of lazy at work.

250
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,420
 So this obviously would suit this job,

251
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,540
 but the train station would suit someone who's quite lazy at work.

252
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,500
 There've been some good people who have been in the past.

253
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,540
 So there was a civil servant called Carlos Retio.

254
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,740
 He was a Spanish civil servant.

255
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,980
 He skipped work for a decade.

256
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,020
 He used to clock in at 7.30 in the morning.

257
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,620
 And then he'd returned to work to clock out

258
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,940
 at 4 in the afternoon.

259
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,140
 So he's perfect for this station job.

260
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,460
 He took home a 50 grand salary.

261
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,740
 And he then, when he was caught, and it was discovered

262
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,940
 that he'd just been skipping work for over 10 years.

263
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,740
 He then admitted to it fine.

264
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,260
 And then there was an art exhibition put on in the town

265
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,100
 that used a council venue.

266
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,380
 And the exhibition was called Love for Valencia,

267
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,300
 the works of a man who never worked.

268
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,740
 And it was booked under what turned out to be a fake name.

269
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,980
 And they discovered later it was put on by him,

270
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,900
 this man who skipped work the whole time,

271
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,820
 as kind of a peon to his own glory

272
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,180
 and having skipped work.

273
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,420
 And there were paintings, there were sculptures,

274
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,380
 and there were bronze busts of this man talking about

275
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,020
 how he succeeded in not working.

276
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,540
 The council discovered that it was him who booked it

277
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,820
 and they canceled it.

278
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,780
 But he discovered that he got no charges.

279
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,660
 He got no big fine.

280
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,380
 He was suspended from work.

281
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,100
 Not even fired.

282
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,260
 [LAUGHTER]

283
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,820
 Speaking of doing nothing, there is a hotel with a,

284
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,060
 or the was, the hotel's so success

285
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,900
 but they used to have a suite called the Checkout Suite.

286
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,780
 And if you did nothing and you use no internet,

287
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,060
 then you'd get the suite for free.

288
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,220
 OK, so it worked out how much internet you were using

289
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,740
 and how much work you were doing.

290
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,300
 And if you used the time to just relax and do nothing,

291
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
 they gave it you for free.

292
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,860
 This was the Hotel Ballora, which is in Gothenburg,

293
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,820
 which is the hotel where staying, and at the moment, yes.

294
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,540
 So I spoke to the receptionist this afternoon.

295
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,300
 And she said, it ran for three months

296
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,180
 and every single person who went there

297
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,780
 managed to get it for free.

298
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
 Wow.

299
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,420
 There must be something that the people of Gothenburg

300
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,060
 are just quite happy sitting around going, you know what?

301
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,100
 I'm just going to fill.

302
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,580
 You know what, if you've got a few sheets of slightly damp paint,

303
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,660
 the time flies by.

304
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,660
 [LAUGHTER]

305
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,580
 OK, it is time for fact number two.

306
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,140
 And that is Chazinsky.

307
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,060
 Yes, my fact this week is that Ninjas sword sheaths

308
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,140
 had removable tips so that if they ever had to hide underwater,

309
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,260
 they could use them like a snorkel to breathe.

310
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,580
 That's so cool.

311
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,860
 It's so great.

312
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,940
 And so they brought the sword with them as well, right?

313
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,180
 Yeah, yeah, you do bring the sword.

314
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,300
 That's the main thing.

315
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,780
 But it's basically being an ninja

316
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,900
 was all about kind of adapting to your environment.

317
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,820
 It was like being a sort of 15-17 century Japanese James Bond.

318
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,380
 It really was.

319
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,860
 They had all these gadgets.

320
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,180
 And one of them was the sword.

321
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,860
 And the scabbard, they would use it like a snorkel,

322
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,460
 because hiding underwater was a major part of being an ninja.

323
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,380
 And so what?

324
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,380
 [LAUGHTER]

325
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,020
 I find it hard to put this into words, but what?

326
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,540
 So why would you need to be underwater, as much?

327
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,620
 So basically, what an ninja was was,

328
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,780
 it was sort of like the flip side of a samurai.

329
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,860
 So samurai in Japan were very well respected,

330
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
 honorable, noble fighters.

331
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,940
 And the ninja was the sneaky, mercenary agent.

332
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,300
 They were very, very looked down upon at the time

333
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,860
 they were around, which, and they were,

334
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,100
 they had their heyday the 15th or 17th century in Japan.

335
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,900
 And their function was basically espionage.

336
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,420
 So they were spies and deception and surprise attack

337
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
 and covert methods.

338
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,220
 And they did a lot of hiding and running away.

339
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,820
 And one of their main ways of hiding

340
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,100
 was using the water.

341
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,940
 So certain ninja texts from the time

342
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,980
 advise that in daytime, hide underwater.

343
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,140
 So it's not to be seen.

344
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,860
 You just spend the whole day underwater.

345
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,860
 Really?

346
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,260
 And so you need this snorkel-like thing

347
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,620
 on the end of your sword.

348
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,940
 And so the scabbard end can double as a breathing tube.

349
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,180
 One of the texts that I read, advising ninjas,

350
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,100
 said that the end of your scabbard,

351
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,020
 if you had the removable tip taken off,

352
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,660
 could also be a hearing aid or a megaphone.

353
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,420
 [LAUGHTER]

354
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,420
 Cool.

355
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,220
 Wow.

356
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
 That's fantastic.

357
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,660
 I could also be used as a step ladder

358
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,340
 for climbing golf offenses.

359
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,980
 Oh, yeah.

360
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
 Well, you'd sort of jab it into the wall.

361
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,140
 I think it might be, what I imagine that this might be wrong,

362
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,020
 because this just came out of my imagination.

363
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,220
 But, you know, like with a sword,

364
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,900
 you have that like crossbit that kind of hides your hand.

365
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,340
 But if you turn it upside down, you could just step on it.

366
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,660
 Oh, I thought even if you stabbed it into the wall,

367
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,780
 you could bounce off the sword.

368
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,540
 Yes.

369
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,060
 And I tell you a cool thing that ninjas could do.

370
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,660
 So ninjas had incredible abilities

371
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,660
 according to the old texts.

372
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
 One other thing they could do is they

373
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,740
 could tell the time of day by looking at a cat's eye.

374
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,580
 So if you asked a ninja what time is it?

375
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,540
 And the cat was around.

376
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,420
 They could look at the cat.

377
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,460
 And they would study the people of the eye,

378
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,100
 which changes during the day according to the sun.

379
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,820
 And if they can't see the cat, it's nighttime.

380
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,900
 [LAUGHTER]

381
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
 Yeah?

382
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,300
 [APPLAUSE]

383
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,420
 What, that didn't happen, did it?

384
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,740
 You would have to have a cat on you at all times.

385
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,380
 It's more difficult to carry a cat around to know the time

386
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,540
 than it is to just guess the time.

387
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,460
 But it would be a party trick, as you would say.

388
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,260
 Well, then everyone on the party knows you're a ninja, don't they?

389
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,780
 They didn't go to parties.

390
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,820
 Their whole raison d'etre was conceiting their identity.

391
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,420
 Oh, it's just cool as a James Bond of--

392
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,820
 That's what James Bond did.

393
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,340
 You can't keep a cat on the water.

394
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,220
 They hate the water.

395
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,700
 They can do that.

396
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,580
 So patronized by these guys sometimes,

397
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,820
 they could read cat's eyes.

398
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,140
 And also--

399
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,820
 So can we just decancise actually change according to the--

400
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,340
 I do.

401
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,460
 They do very slightly because of the amount of likes on the letter.

402
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,820
 Yeah, but that's not a reliable indicator of time, is it?

403
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,980
 Because if you're in a dark room, but it's midday,

404
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,020
 and you look at the cat and the cat's eyes are massive,

405
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,940
 you think, oh, great, it's nighttime, I can leave my dark room.

406
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,460
 It's nice.

407
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,540
 Midday, you're going to be spotted immediately.

408
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,380
 No, but this is a completely unworkable system.

409
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,700
 It's not a system.

410
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,660
 [APPLAUSE]

411
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:00,580
 So I'm so angry.

412
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,260
 It's like saying they have an ability.

413
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,220
 Oh, they're going to do it 24 hours a day.

414
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,140
 It must be a lie.

415
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,780
 It's-- you know, they do it when a cat's around, like that's--

416
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,660
 I can do stuff when a cat's around that I

417
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,100
 won't need to do when it's not around.

418
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,580
 We don't need to know about you, probably, though.

419
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,660
 This might be a good moment to mention

420
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,260
 that it's very difficult to study ninjas,

421
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,740
 because there's little side evidence

422
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,260
 that a lot of rumour about what they could do.

423
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,600
 So there are a few really, really good texts,

424
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,420
 like the Book of Ninja, which I'm sure

425
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,300
 down is drawing from here.

426
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,060
 But a lot of people are sort of in pain,

427
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,820
 and they're just going to fly, or that they could read minds,

428
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,020
 or that they could go invisible.

429
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,580
 And that was all bullshit.

430
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
 But they could do a lot.

431
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,140
 But the rock, narrowest at noon, when you see their eyes,

432
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,660
 narrowed right in the air.

433
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,300
 Do you know why--

434
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,100
 It's 12 p.m.

435
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,020
 One way they could tell the time, which I thought was quite

436
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,380
 cool, that wasn't one of the books.

437
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,780
 And this was written in like the 1630s, I think,

438
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,460
 was they said, "A way to see if time is passing if you're

439
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,100
 hiding at night to ambush is work out which

440
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,460
 nostril you're breathing out of because you're nostrils."

441
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,380
 So you know how you're only ever breathing out

442
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,300
 of one nostril at a time.

443
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,860
 And this swaps around sporadically.

444
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,900
 And the rule was that it swaps around roughly every hour.

445
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,900
 And so if you're aware that you're nostrils have just swaps,

446
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,940
 then a hammer's gone by.

447
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,300
 All right, all right, ninjas.

448
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,860
 Synchronize your noses.

449
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,580
 [LAUGHTER]

450
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,540
 Can I just say, yeah, there are some people

451
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,060
 who think that ninjas weren't really a thing.

452
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:31,780
 Like, they didn't exist nearly as much as

453
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,940
 is now believed by popular culture.

454
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,140
 And because there's some little evidence of it,

455
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,660
 so there was a Japan expert from the University of Leeds,

456
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,300
 who said that ninjas actively didn't exist in the way we--

457
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,900
 But that's what ninjas want you to think.

458
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,700
 Oh, yeah.

459
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,380
 There's some kind of hiding all this.

460
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,820
 They're all just underwater.

461
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,420
 So the kind of thing of someone--

462
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,660
 basically, the idea of someone running around in Black

463
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,420
 pajamas is not coherent as an idea,

464
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,100
 because it will be very obvious.

465
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,460
 So it's mostly agricultural land at this time in history.

466
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,740
 So you'd be dressed as a farmer if you were an ninja.

467
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,580
 If you see a guy running around in Black soaking wet pajamas

468
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,900
 with a cat's algorithm, he's going to sink out.

469
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,220
 I mean, so there is lots of--

470
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,380
 so he gave an example, actually.

471
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,700
 So the year is 1,600, two of your enemies are fighting a battle.

472
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,700
 So you send a couple of guys dressed as farmers to the area

473
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,060
 to watch the battle and report back about what's happening.

474
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,020
 That's ninja work.

475
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,260
 So that's the kind of--

476
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,340
 a lot of it was more, I think, observation than nunchucks

477
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,940
 and thrice.

478
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,020
 But it was extremely so efficient.

479
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,460
 So like, it's stories that people tend to think

480
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,740
 are very trustworthy.

481
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,260
 From that period recorded it, there's

482
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,700
 a guy called Fuji Bayashi, who recorded

483
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,460
 a lot of the ninjas methods.

484
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,940
 And they were bound by a sort of spirituality, which

485
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,900
 was ruled by five elements.

486
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,180
 And these elements were wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.

487
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,500
 And these all represented different ways of fighting,

488
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,140
 or hiding, or getting away.

489
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,260
 And they're really funny.

490
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,580
 So he recorded the ways you'd use these different elements.

491
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,380
 So in the water one, it would be, for instance,

492
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,300
 you'd use your sword as the breathing tube.

493
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,660
 Or you would have to be trained to throw large quantities

494
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,540
 of duckweed on water that you think you might escape

495
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,940
 through later, so that you could then hide among its leaves

496
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,900
 and float with them to safety.

497
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,060
 OK, yeah.

498
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,700
 Very clever.

499
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,780
 I found a one that might be an earth method,

500
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,860
 if that's one of the elements.

501
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,660
 So there's apparently a skill called Uzura Gakuri, which

502
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,900
 is curling oneself into a ball to look like a rock.

503
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,460
 [LAUGHTER]

504
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,260
 So you believe that one?

505
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,260
 No, I actually don't.

506
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,660
 But then there's someone who comes disguised as some paper,

507
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,860
 and they can just be a fast guy.

508
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,980
 [LAUGHTER]

509
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,620
 Yeah, we're just saying that they don't carry animals with them,

510
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,420
 cats with them.

511
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,100
 But they did.

512
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,700
 Supposedly, carry crickets with them.

513
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,260
 Boxes of crickets.

514
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,500
 And the idea was if they needed to go somewhere,

515
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,820
 but they were a bit noisy, they could then release the crickets.

516
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,420
 And the crickets would make crickety noises,

517
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,500
 and then they could quickly shuffle over

518
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
 to where they need to be.

519
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,100
 Ah, that's nice.

520
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,260
 OK, how do they keep the crickets quiet?

521
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,260
 They keep them in a jar or a box.

522
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,020
 This is much more plausible than the cat thing, so far.

523
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,540
 So they also used to wear fake children's feet.

524
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
 What do you think?

525
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
 The crickets.

526
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
 Oh, no.

527
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,100
 No, the ninjas.

528
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,100
 So it is said, I need to say, it is said, is rumored,

529
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,220
 that the ninjas used to wear on the souls of their shoes,

530
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,740
 sort of either children's feet or an elderly woman's foot.

531
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,820
 Didn't know what that looks like.

532
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,620
 So the footprints in, let's say, the sand,

533
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,700
 or their soggy feet coming out of the river,

534
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,140
 be like, which child must have been swimming in that?

535
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,580
 So they wouldn't be deceiving.

536
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,340
 Well, it's true that American cattle wrestlers

537
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,940
 used to wear shoes which had cow hooves on the bottom of them,

538
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,180
 so you would think that it was cows that had gone past

539
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,220
 or horses rather than yet humans.

540
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,500
 And in Bhutan, it said that yetis can take their feet off

541
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,140
 and put them on backwards, so it looks like they've

542
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,180
 gone that way when, in fact, they are on that way.

543
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,060
 I was really trying to help.

544
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,540
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

545
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,180
 And that is my fact.

546
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,300
 My fact this week is that one month before the French Spider

547
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,300
 Man successfully climbed the second tallest building

548
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,180
 in the world, he was hospitalised after falling

549
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,140
 from a seven foot tall traffic light.

550
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,980
 Now, this was to promote his climb of the second--

551
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,020
 what was at the time, actually, the tallest building

552
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,620
 in the world, which was in Taiwan.

553
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,820
 And he was climbing this traffic light.

554
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,820
 The photographer was there.

555
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,540
 He slipped, fell, got 40 stitches, was hospitalised,

556
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,620
 and it jeopardised the actual climb itself.

557
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,060
 They thought he might not be able to do it,

558
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,500
 but he did pull through.

559
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,660
 And he is an urban climber.

560
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,340
 He is.

561
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,300
 Yeah, his name is Alain Roberts.

562
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,140
 And he is online.

563
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,660
 I don't know the community that well,

564
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,660
 but when you see online, he sort of regarded

565
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,700
 as the greatest urban climber of our day.

566
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
 I mean, he's in his mid-50s now.

567
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,860
 I think he's about 56.

568
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,380
 And he's still climbing extremely tall buildings.

569
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,140
 It's amazing.

570
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,260
 Although he's bound for climbing in Britain.

571
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,420
 We don't like him.

572
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,900
 He was-- I feel kind of bound for him.

573
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,540
 So he climbed the Heron Tower in London,

574
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,900
 great tall skyscraper.

575
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,500
 And he was arrested the moment he reached the top.

576
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,420
 I just feel like, so he took him over half an hour.

577
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,300
 And he was waiting for him at the top.

578
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,140
 I was like, what else is he going to do?

579
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,140
 I'm going to climb down the thing, are they?

580
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,180
 He's only wasted half an hour.

581
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,100
 I think that's OK.

582
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,620
 You're right.

583
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,220
 And then he's wasted the 20-week suspended jail sentence

584
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,500
 that he got, and £5,500.

585
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,780
 Well, he also, in 2012, he was spotted inside

586
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,700
 the shard building in London.

587
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,340
 And the building's owners subsequently

588
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,780
 obtain the injunction, prevents

589
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,780
 them from ever returning to their building.

590
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,780
 Ah, I thought he'd be saying--

591
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,180
 I thought he'd be saying he realized, oh, I'm on the wrong side.

592
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:03,700
 He's lost it up the stairs going, this is easy.

593
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,300
 So he's climbed over 150 skyscrapers.

594
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,740
 And one thing he says is that the first two meters

595
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,260
 are almost the most important, because after that,

596
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,700
 the police can't grab your feet.

597
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
 [LAUGHTER]

598
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
 I'm so late.

599
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,060
 As Anna was saying, the police are often there waiting

600
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,700
 for him when he gets to the top of the building.

601
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,900
 And I've read in interviews that the only thing he has on him

602
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,940
 is chalk for his hands, as he's climbing,

603
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,740
 and he wears special shoes.

604
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,820
 But that's not quite true, because I think what he also

605
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,900
 carries on him is a task, so he knows what time it is.

606
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
 Yes.

607
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,580
 [LAUGHTER]

608
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,060
 Box of crickets, so no one can hear him coming.

609
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,660
 His climbing shoes are actually the shape of an old woman's

610
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,660
 feet.

611
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,140
 [LAUGHTER]

612
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
 Come on.

613
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,580
 Well, it looks like the old woman climbed

614
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:52,540
 the south face of the building.

615
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,740
 So no, what he actually does carry with him

616
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,580
 is his passport and his lawyer's number.

617
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,180
 And he just hands that to the police as soon as he gets there.

618
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,460
 But it's quite-- it's probably a common thing.

619
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,420
 Urban climbing.

620
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,500
 It's something that there are quite a few heroes

621
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,300
 of urban climbing.

622
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,260
 In 2016, there was a guy who got in trouble

623
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,460
 because he tried to scale Trump Tower.

624
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,340
 And he sent three hours doing it.

625
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,860
 And he was using suction cups on his hands,

626
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,460
 like hand on his hands and feet, in fact.

627
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,220
 So it was a massive suction cup.

628
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
 And he reached the 21st floor.

629
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,860
 But NYPD were desperately trying to catch him.

630
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,700
 It was bizarre to watch.

631
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,820
 So they kept on sort of smashing windows

632
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,380
 up the building to try and reach out, to grab him.

633
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,060
 And they couldn't get him.

634
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,020
 They kept trying to impede his progress like climbing

635
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,300
 through air vents and stuff, I think.

636
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,140
 And they just couldn't do it.

637
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,460
 And eventually, they set up two massive air bags,

638
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,820
 like mattresses, in case he fell down,

639
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,660
 just below him and on the pavement.

640
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,340
 And he was asked afterwards why he'd done it.

641
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,860
 So there was this huge rigmarole, just three hours,

642
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,940
 really just 21st floor.

643
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,180
 And then the police sprung out of the window,

644
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,620
 grabbed him, and pulled him in.

645
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,940
 Said, why on earth have you done that?

646
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,060
 And he said, look, I'm just a political researcher.

647
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,900
 And I really wanted to meet Donald Trump.

648
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,860
 You know, just we were talking about Alan Robert.

649
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,740
 He has vertigo.

650
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,260
 Really?

651
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,740
 He suffers from vertigo.

652
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,820
 And vertigo is sort of feeding the earth

653
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,540
 to free yourself off a great height, isn't it?

654
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,340
 It's not fear of height.

655
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,940
 No, it's all in her inner ear problem,

656
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,740
 which makes you dizzy.

657
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,940
 Yeah, stuff.

658
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,460
 I thought then you got the earth, so you

659
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,980
 feel like the ground was coming towards you.

660
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,940
 I think you feel very dizzy and you feel a bit unstable.

661
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,580
 And he's had that since 1982.

662
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,340
 And he's still done it.

663
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,180
 Yeah.

664
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,220
 He had it after he was showing students

665
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,940
 how to climb with his hands behind his back,

666
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,700
 and then fell 26 feet off the wall.

667
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,940
 Yeah.

668
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,220
 He's married with three kids.

669
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,060
 And I read an interview with his wife,

670
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,020
 because they said, you must be freaked out.

671
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,980
 Every single time he goes and climbs a building,

672
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,820
 how are you feeling?

673
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,020
 And she sort of kind of said, well, I

674
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,300
 knew what I was getting into, really,

675
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,620
 because when she first met him, both of his arms

676
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,340
 were in plaster casts from a wall.

677
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,180
 The one thing that defeated him in London in 2002

678
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,580
 was the weather.

679
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,780
 He got three quarters up the way of number one

680
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,420
 Canada Square in Canary Wharf.

681
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,820
 It was so cold wet and windy, he just got completely stuck

682
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,740
 and had to be rescued by a window-cleaning left.

683
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
 Oh.

684
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,780
 It's amazing.

685
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:14,020
 But it's got a long and illustrious history of inclining,

686
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,820
 which, by the way, it's called--

687
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:16,780
 it's got a number of names.

688
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,540
 It could be called edificeering or stegopherly.

689
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,020
 So that's the official term for it.

690
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,820
 And I really like the etymology of this.

691
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,460
 So the Greek stegos is roof, so it's

692
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,820
 a love of roof, so it's like climbing up onto roofs.

693
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,260
 It's from the same roof as what's

694
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,420
 like the other word that you just see with stegosaurus.

695
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,420
 Yeah, it's from the same roof as stegosaurus,

696
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,020
 because that means roofed lizard.

697
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,980
 Because when they first found stegosaurus,

698
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,500
 they thought--

699
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
 People climbing up it.

700
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,740
 [LAUGHTER]

701
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,820
 They had a roof on top.

702
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,740
 No, it was-- so they thought that the plate on top of a stegosaurus

703
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,540
 would be horizontal rather than vertical,

704
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,660
 so they thought that it had a roof over it,

705
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,940
 so it's called roofed lizard.

706
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
 That's so cool.

707
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
 It's cool.

708
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,940
 But an urban climbing obstacle, stegopherly,

709
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,260
 has a long history in Oxygen Cambridge University.

710
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,980
 So the first urban climber was a guy

711
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,740
 called Jeffrey Winthrop Young, who published a bit

712
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,700
 called the roof climber's guide to Trinity at College

713
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,540
 Cambridge.

714
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,300
 And it gave really detailed instructions

715
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,260
 on which roots to take up.

716
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,020
 And then there was another guy called

717
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,740
 Noel Howard Simmington, who wrote one in 1937.

718
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,500
 Again, nine climbers guide to Cambridge.

719
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,860
 And his pseudonym was Whipple Snaith.

720
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,260
 And this is so weird.

721
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,140
 The person who reviewed his book and wrote

722
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,660
 about the details of climbing up Cambridge buildings

723
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,060
 was also called Whipple.

724
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,580
 He was called Tom Whipple.

725
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,060
 So the modern day Cambridge building

726
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,700
 climber is called Tom Whipple.

727
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,740
 I know Tom Whipple.

728
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,740
 No way.

729
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,220
 Well, I don't know if it's the same Tom Whipple.

730
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,100
 Yeah, I'm sure it will be.

731
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,740
 I know the circles you're moving.

732
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,820
 No, it's good.

733
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,620
 Have you guys heard of the human fly?

734
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,860
 I know there's no anecdote.

735
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,340
 To know the human fly.

736
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,860
 Well, he's a journalist.

737
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,940
 Yeah, he is.

738
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,020
 He's a very nice guy.

739
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,140
 Tell us about the human fly.

740
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,300
 Yeah.

741
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,740
 His name is Tom Whipple.

742
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,300
 So OK, we need to move on.

743
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,020
 So the human fly was a guy called Henry Gardner.

744
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,100
 And he was one of the first really impressive building

745
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,700
 climbers.

746
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,060
 He was in the 1910s and 20s.

747
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,380
 He climbed 700 buildings without gear, frequently wearing a suit.

748
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,380
 And he was paid to do it by companies

749
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,140
 to promote their offices in the new skyscrapers.

750
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,900
 So in 1916, he climbed to the ninth floor window

751
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,260
 of a skyscraper, climbed into the window

752
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,420
 of a bank branch and opened an account at the bank.

753
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,660
 That's what the stunts he did.

754
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,860
 Or he would do the, you know, open an insurance thing.

755
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,940
 And he was really, really famous.

756
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,980
 We don't know what happened to him.

757
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,740
 He went missing in 1925.

758
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,260
 Oh, really?

759
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,820
 He probably fell off a building, didn't he?

760
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,140
 If he was, yes.

761
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,620
 I'm afraid he might have.

762
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,020
 That Robert guy does it for money now, doesn't he?

763
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,740
 He basically does it sponsored and he usually uses

764
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,620
 actual climbing gear and stuff like that.

765
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,220
 But actually, a lot of people do die.

766
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,460
 So this Harry Gardner, who was, actually,

767
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,620
 it was Grover Cleveland, the president who

768
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,020
 nicknamed him the human flight, apparently.

769
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,660
 And he said that 120 of those who sought to imitate me

770
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,300
 in this hazardous profession have fallen to death.

771
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,420
 So he was saying that that happened.

772
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,660
 And people have looked into this.

773
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,740
 Scientists have looked into it.

774
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,020
 There's been a study in 2006.

775
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,660
 And they said, in every country, there

776
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,380
 is an excess of male deaths due to potentially

777
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,580
 avoidable reasons.

778
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,020
 According to their theory, this is what they

779
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,620
 quote to the saying, men are idiots.

780
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,700
 And idiots do stupid things.

781
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:43,420
 And on that note, we need to move onto our final fact

782
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,420
 of the show.

783
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,660
 And that is James.

784
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,060
 OK.

785
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,460
 My fact this week is that in the early Eurovision Song

786
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,020
 Contests, songs could not be performed in public before the event.

787
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,780
 One Danish song was banned after the composer whistled it

788
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,780
 in a TV broadcaster's canteen.

789
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:02,780
 Wow.

790
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,660
 This is incredible.

791
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,860
 So yeah, this was in the bit where you had

792
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,500
 to become the Danish entry.

793
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,140
 And there were six different songs.

794
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,420
 And this guy was just in the canteen having his lunch.

795
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,580
 And he was just kind of whistling it to himself.

796
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,500
 And then they did the actual thing where they performed it.

797
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,020
 And the people that were going, sounds a bit familiar, isn't it?

798
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,580
 And then they got banned.

799
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,580
 No.

800
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,740
 And what is he maybe secretly doing it to try

801
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,780
 and to seed the tune in people's minds

802
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,540
 or is there no suggestion of that?

803
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,220
 You know what, I haven't thought of that.

804
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,980
 But yeah, I mean, probably not.

805
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,540
 I think that's a very cynical take.

806
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,740
 Well, an amazing song.

807
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,660
 But they were like, wait, that's the song I heard in that canteen

808
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,180
 a week ago.

809
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,980
 What a shame it couldn't enter.

810
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,940
 Yeah, that's true.

811
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,340
 What a great whistler he must be.

812
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,100
 Whistler, everyone is a better whistler than they are a singer.

813
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:50,620
 What?

814
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,980
 It's easier to match a tune that you've heard whistling

815
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,700
 than it is singing.

816
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,460
 There are some people who can't whistle, right?

817
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,420
 I've met a few people who can't whistle.

818
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,420
 Right.

819
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,700
 [LAUGHTER]

820
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,620
 So yeah, well, OK, hang on.

821
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,740
 If you can whistle, you are a better whistler, probably,

822
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,740
 than you are a singer.

823
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,660
 It's much weaker than--

824
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:15,020
 Tell me about Todd Whipple.

825
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,940
 That's interesting, really.

826
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,300
 Well, they've looked at that.

827
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,580
 That's not just your opinion.

828
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,180
 It's not just my opinion.

829
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,460
 Well, this isn't an opinion based on that.

830
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,980
 They've done studies to test the picture whistler.

831
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,020
 They've done studies asking people, can you repeat this tune

832
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,860
 sung or repeat it?

833
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,660
 And it's because-- I mean, you know, it's obviously much easier

834
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,860
 to make a tune on the musical instrument,

835
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,780
 because they're specifically designed to match the specific notes.

836
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,420
 But muscles are just a bit less precise.

837
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,100
 I've been getting closer with it in your opinion.

838
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,500
 You know, when the Eurovision song contest first started,

839
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,660
 Britain decided we didn't want to take part

840
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,900
 in this Eurovision song contest.

841
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,500
 So we decided to have our own British song contest

842
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,980
 of British populist songs, which was one by Dennis Lotus,

843
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,460
 who was born in South Africa.

844
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,380
 [LAUGHTER]

845
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,060
 Because I don't really understand about Eurovision.

846
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,700
 And I think it is bigger here than it is in Britain.

847
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,540
 But it's the continent's systems every year

848
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
 that it's not political.

849
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
 It should never be political.

850
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,740
 And it's just about the music.

851
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,220
 But it is so patiently political.

852
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,860
 I don't understand why everyone doesn't embrace that.

853
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,860
 So there have been everything about the history of Eurovision.

854
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,580
 In 2009, though, it was just after the Russia Georgia conflict.

855
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:28,340
 And Georgia had to withdraw its entry,

856
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,340
 because the organizers had told them they had to change

857
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,300
 their lyrics and the title of their entry song, which

858
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,500
 was, we don't want to put in, which

859
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,060
 is a very unveiled reference to Putin.

860
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,540
 So yeah.

861
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,300
 And then it's back and forth all the time.

862
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,420
 Yeah, there was-- when it first came,

863
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,860
 it was supposed to bring Europe together.

864
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,940
 But Turkey pulled out in 1976, because Greece were taking part.

865
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,980
 But then Greece pulled out in 1975,

866
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,380
 because Turkey were taking part.

867
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,700
 Greece sent to Ireland in 2008, because they

868
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,940
 mentioned Macedonia.

869
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,540
 And they sent to Finland in 2007 for being satanic.

870
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:07,060
 But then Finland censored Israel in the same year

871
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,900
 for mentioning nuclear weapons.

872
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,780
 And this year, Israel's embassy complained

873
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,660
 to the Netherlands after they paraded their Eurovision winner.

874
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,220
 And Iran moved all of its diplomats from Azerbaijan in 2012

875
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,180
 and protested it, hosting the contest,

876
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,460
 even though Iran's nothing to do with Eurovision.

877
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,060
 And when Israel won in 1978, the TV show in Georgia

878
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,940
 told viewers that Belgium had won.

879
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,420
 And in 1973, Portugal arrested the writer of its own song.

880
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,260
 [LAUGHTER]

881
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,220
 Because they thought it wasn't fascist enough.

882
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,620
 [LAUGHTER]

883
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,780
 [APPLAUSE]

884
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,340
 Very cool.

885
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,420
 So glad and so glad we're all friends together.

886
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,500
 Do you know Salvador Dali was involved with the Eurovision

887
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
 song?

888
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,460
 Yeah, 1969, the stage-- so it was in Madrid.

889
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,940
 And the stage had this giant sculpture, a metal sculpture

890
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,460
 on stage.

891
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,620
 And that was designed by Salvador Dali.

892
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,740
 But not only that, he also designed their press material,

893
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,420
 all the press packages and stuff.

894
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,820
 That sounds like an early job.

895
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,060
 That's different, isn't it?

896
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,260
 Now, he was a man who had trouble telling the time.

897
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,820
 [LAUGHTER]

898
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,700
 Let's face it.

899
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,660
 [APPLAUSE]

900
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,540
 The 1978 one was particularly controversial.

901
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,100
 So the 1970s was the one that Israel won.

902
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,420
 I think, and during the contest, it became obvious

903
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,940
 that Israel was going to win.

904
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,380
 And most Arabic countries were transmitting it

905
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,220
 on their TV stations.

906
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,060
 And they canceled the transmission as soon as it became obvious.

907
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,940
 So they were just quickly flipped to another channel

908
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,140
 within their explanation.

909
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,580
 And actually, you say that the children said that Belgium had won.

910
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,940
 And they just replaced their transmission

911
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,700
 with a bunch of daffodils.

912
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,140
 [LAUGHTER]

913
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,940
 Very cool.

914
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,380
 So it was a-- you mentioned the British equivalent.

915
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,220
 Yes.

916
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,500
 There was a Soviet Union equivalent as well,

917
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,100
 which was called Intervision, the Individuals song contest.

918
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,020
 It only happened four times.

919
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,100
 And we've spoken about this before.

920
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,820
 Is this was the way that you voted?

921
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,860
 It was that-- a lot of people didn't have

922
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,500
 telephones in the Soviet Union.

923
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,740
 So you had to turn on your lights if you liked the song.

924
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,940
 And you had to turn them off if you didn't like the song.

925
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,580
 And they just measured the load on each country's electricity

926
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,820
 network.

927
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,820
 No.

928
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,300
 And that determined how many points you got.

929
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
 Nice.

930
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,300
 That's clever.

931
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,780
 Yeah, that's true.

932
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,140
 And it was amazing.

933
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,980
 It was the wild west of songs, of some contest.

934
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,740
 So for example, one entrant in those four years

935
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,220
 stayed on stage for 45 minutes.

936
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,220
 [LAUGHTER]

937
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,620
 Just kept going until they were removed.

938
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:41,140
 The thing about that is that you had to--

939
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:44,060
 I think someone else pointed this out in our class reading--

940
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,020
 you had to sit in pitch dark for all of the songs you didn't like.

941
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,020
 [LAUGHTER]

942
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,100
 You can't turn your lights on.

943
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,060
 How miserable you don't like the song anyway.

944
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,660
 Also, bizarrely, Canada was an entrant in two of the, I think,

945
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,300
 four years that that was going.

946
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,660
 They have weird entrants, like the fact that Australia

947
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,820
 is a neurovisionist, obviously, a bit weird,

948
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,780
 and also a bit painful, because they

949
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,540
 have the highest score on average, the Australians.

950
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,820
 I'm an Aussie.

951
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,900
 Fuck you, I'm fine.

952
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,580
 So good.

953
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,980
 We've been there in five times.

954
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,620
 And in three of those five, we've made it to the top 10.

955
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:20,060
 Yeah, I wonder how many of you were.

956
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,500
 What did you come this year?

957
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,820
 [LAUGHTER]

958
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,140
 I feel we're all going to lose the reggae of Sweden.

959
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,620
 Yeah, do you know if you actually go to the Eurovision

960
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,140
 Song Contest, what you have to do is adhere to very strict rules

961
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,780
 about what can go in with you.

962
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,340
 So most places you go to, there's a list of things

963
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,900
 that are not allowed to be taken into a venue.

964
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,180
 But with the European Song Contest, it's things

965
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,940
 like helmets, adhesive tape, golf balls, another loud,

966
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,300
 and shopping trolleys.

967
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,820
 They specify shopping trolleys.

968
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,260
 It just feels like they're each year they're responding

969
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,860
 to one disastrous entry.

970
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,300
 So I think about within the last decade,

971
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,540
 the Greek team performed on a trampoline.

972
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,060
 Did they?

973
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,900
 Yeah.

974
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
 So I don't know if trampolines are on the list.

975
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,580
 No, I mean, no, this is for the people coming.

976
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,740
 It's not for the people.

977
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,980
 Sorry, it's for audience people, sorry, OK.

978
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,460
 There hasn't been something in the Eurovision Song Contest

979
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,660
 just singing and hitting golf balls into the audience.

980
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,580
 [LAUGHTER]

981
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,260
 It would be so unsurprising.

982
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,980
 Yeah.

983
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,820
 So there was the Russians who came second, I think,

984
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,900
 a few years ago, with that team of grannies

985
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,940
 who baked bread on stage.

986
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:32,460
 Yeah.

987
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,340
 I mean, it is a strange contest.

988
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,940
 There was-- in 1985, the contest was held in Gothenburg.

989
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,700
 [APPLAUSE]

990
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,220
 Cool.

991
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,060
 It's such an easy way of getting the cheers.

992
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,180
 Shameless.

993
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,620
 And it was very popular amongst British viewers.

994
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,900
 And a lot of people tuned in, where you wouldn't really

995
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
 think they would do.

996
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,860
 And that's because the Swedish entry was

997
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,060
 entitled Bra vibration.

998
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,060
 [LAUGHTER]

999
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,140
 Is that--

1000
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,660
 Wow.

1001
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,660
 Wow.

1002
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,780
 For-- is that some kind of milking tool?

1003
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,900
 Well, for the people who are in this room,

1004
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,700
 I believe it means good vibrations.

1005
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,420
 Oh, I see.

1006
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,140
 Wow, vibration.

1007
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,540
 In 1997, Denmark's entry was a rap indian-ish about a guy

1008
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:27,980
 who had fallen in love with a woman from directory inquiries.

1009
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,300
 In 1918, Norway's entry was a song about the construction

1010
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,260
 of a hydroelectric power plant.

1011
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,860
 Estonia in 2013 had a song, which repeatedly

1012
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,820
 just said the phrase, "A local man called Kostakov

1013
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,420
 went to Latvia yesterday."

1014
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,940
 And in 2006, Lithuania had a song called

1015
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,620
 "We are the winners," which just said,

1016
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,780
 "We are the winners again and again and again and again."

1017
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,740
 And they came sick.

1018
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,900
 I want to know if they ever found a local man called Kostakov.

1019
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,780
 We're going to have to rock off, guys.

1020
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,020
 Well, OK, what do I think?

1021
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,860
 Yeah.

1022
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,900
 The first person to get in Ilpoir, as in no points in Eurovision,

1023
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:14,060
 was a guy called Jan Tegen from Norway.

1024
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,900
 OK.

1025
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,700
 But he became a national hero, because he got no points.

1026
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:23,100
 And his song was number one for two months.

1027
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,580
 I'm remained in the top 10 for three months afterwards.

1028
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,780
 And he also had a number one album called "This Year's Loser."

1029
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,500
 [LAUGHTER]

1030
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:39,540
 OK, that is all of our facts.

1031
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,020
 Thank you so much for listening.

 Thank you so much, Gothenburg.

1049
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,820
 You've been amazing.

1050
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,180
 We'll see you again.

1051
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,580
 Good night.
