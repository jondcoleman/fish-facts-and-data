00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,320
 Hi everybody, before we start this week's show, we have to let you know that it is a special summer compilation of all the most wonderful stuff that, for time, space and legal reasons, we have not been able to fit into shows over the last few months.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,880
 Hang on a second, so we're releasing a whole show that was legally dubious.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:27,160
 This is the end of No Such Thing as a Fish, we're gonna be sued by Figgs, the people who were on the Fermilab, Russia, all of these things are mentioned in the show.

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,200
 And my catchphrase this week is 'Balls, balls, balls', so listen out for that.

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,040
 Is it? In what context?

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,720
 You heard it a few weeks ago, you'll hear it again shortly.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,280
 No, no wonder that was cut.

8
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,040
 Alright, on with the show.

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,600
 'Balls, balls, balls'

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,240
 There's a theory that we only have hands because of Figgs, so...

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
 I believe it, I believe it.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,120
 It's that our hands evolved as tools for assessing whether Figgs are soft or not, okay?

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,240
 So this sounds insane, but it's a proper theory from a Dartmouth paper, okay?

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,160
 And what chimpanzees do in the wild, they squeeze fruit just like we do in a supermarket to work out whether it's good.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,440
 Go do that, Andy.

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,680
 Oh yeah, okay, don't do that now.

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,760
 Yeah, fine.

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,680
 They squeeze fruit like we used to until four months ago in a supermarket.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,520
 Which, and that might have helped us develop fine motor control because

20
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,920
 chimpanzees get a massive advantage from being able to squeeze fruit,

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,800
 because they can do it four times faster than if they have to detach it, bite it and then assess it, right?

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,120
 So they can tell much faster, like birds and monkeys, they have to rely on visual information or on oral information,

23
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,840
 i.e. eating a bit of it.

24
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,200
 So chimpanzees have an advantage there.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,040
 Do they ever do the thing where they squeeze it a bit too hard,

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,560
 they put their thumb through it and then they try and bury it under some other figs and pretend that they haven't touched it?

27
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,320
 This is why you shouldn't squeeze stuff in a supermarket, guys.

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,720
 Every time you squeeze an avocado, it's making it bruised for the next person who comes along.

29
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,400
 Or if you put your thumb through it, then it's even worse.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,520
 Eventually it'll be perfect, but eventually it's perfect for the 40th or 50th person who touches that avocado.

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,680
 Exactly.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,760
 I mean, there are so many fruits, you've got to do the squeeze test.

33
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,840
 So I can't believe they've never used supermarket fruit in crime-solving because every item is covered in fingerprints.

34
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,840
 Just a thought for the men.

35
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,280
 But it's not as if they're getting to a crime scene and they're going, "Should we dust the avocados?"

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,200
 No, no, don't waste your time on that, but what do you mean?

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,440
 I think what Anna's saying is you go to a crime scene, you find some fingerprints, then you go to the nearest Tesco and you dust all the fruit.

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
 Yeah, exactly.

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
 Sorry, that does work.

40
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,920
 And then you cross-reference it with the CCTV of who's been in the supermarket. It's a genius idea.

41
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
 Everyone goes to the supermarket, apart from the "Acado Killer".

42
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,920
 Don't get away with it for years.

43
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,480
 There's a lab in...

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,720
 Is it called Fermilab now? The physics guys in America?

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,480
 It was called the National Accelerator Lab back in the day.

46
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,640
 And in 1971 they were testing their particle accelerator.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,720
 So, you know, it has huge 13-ton magnets all the way around this four-mile ring.

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,960
 And they noticed that it kept failing and it kept messing up

49
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,480
 because the magnets were kind of being pulled into the vacuum tubes

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:29,480
 and they were leaving these little metal slivers inside the actual tube, which is meant to be all empty.

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,800
 So, how do you get inside those tubes to empty them out?

52
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,880
 How do you gain access?

53
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,120
 Do you cover yourself in butter and then slip in?

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,960
 Well, you're too big to go in.

55
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,800
 You have to send something into the tube.

56
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
 A child?

57
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
 A ferret.

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 A ferret.

59
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
 A ferret is always a bloody ferret, isn't it?

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
 Into a particle accelerator.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,480
 They got a ferret called Felicia for $30 and she didn't want to go.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,920
 She had to be trained with progressively larger tubes

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,680
 because they just started off by putting her at this 300-foot tube

64
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
 and she said, "I'm not going in there, obviously."

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,720
 So, it was a talking ferret.

66
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,840
 A talking ferret and she was still only $30.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
 Wow.

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,200
 She could only talk after she came out of the particle accelerator.

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,200
 I don't know what happened in there.

70
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,960
 Yeah, but then she pulled it through

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,360
 and then they were able to attach a cleaning swab and they clean it properly.

72
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,000
 Very sadly, she died the following year.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Ah.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,520
 But knowing that she'd been of use to mankind, which is what ferrets want.

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,160
 Well, so she was at a sanctuary.

76
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,920
 I think she might have died because do you remember we talked about how female ferrets die

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
 if they don't have sex for a year?

78
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,800
 Come on, if you've just been in a particle accelerator

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,640
 and you could tell that story, you would get in a lot of sex.

80
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,040
 Hey, garden gnomes, are they basically the replacement of hermits?

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,600
 Did we do them out of a job when the garden gnome was invented?

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,800
 There's debate. I believe there's debate about this.

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,800
 Right.

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,040
 Some people point out that they live in your garden

85
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,520
 and they're bearded and weird.

86
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,360
 And then other people say, "No, they are flamboyant.

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,520
 Are they showing off and they're clearly not like hermits at all?"

88
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
 They're just both kinds of people who like to live in your garden.

89
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
 I don't think they're flamboyant.

90
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,120
 I can't believe we've stolen this debate from Newsnight.

91
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,160
 Well, in fact, because I just very quickly,

92
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
 when I was reading about hermits and they said that gnomes had replaced them,

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,760
 I discovered that one of the most notable producers of gnomes

94
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,320
 was a man called Tom Major Bell,

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,520
 who was the prime minister, John Major's father.

96
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,520
 Really?

97
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
 Yeah, he was one of the most notable.

98
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,920
 And so he had a company called Major's Garden Ornaments.

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,480
 Major's Garden Ornaments.

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,320
 And yeah, and that took them from being quite a sort of not well-to-do family

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,560
 to becoming middle class.

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,120
 I mean, effectively gnomes are the reason

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,880
 that John Major became prime minister.

104
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
 Wow.

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,480
 I mean, I'm speculating there to a huge degree.

106
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,400
 No, I think that's fair. I think that's right.

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
 That's incredible.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
 Yeah.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,560
 Didn't he then become a acrobat or something?

110
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
 No.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,560
 Yeah, he was.

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
 He was here.

113
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
 He was whole life.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,480
 He was a circus performer and an acrobat.

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,280
 I'm sick of people laughing at me at night.

116
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
 My circus job.

117
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,480
 I'm going to get into a serious career.

118
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,920
 And that's supposedly where, this is just a bit of trivia,

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,680
 but supposedly where David Bowie got Major Tom from

120
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,520
 because he saw on a poster Tom Major.

121
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,360
 So Major Tom of the Space Oddity Song.

122
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,040
 But yeah, so Garden Gnomes gave us a prime minister.

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
 Wow.

124
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,320
 It really does take David Bowie down a few rungs of cool

125
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,080
 knowing that that song was written about John Major's dad.

126
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,080
 Well, actually...

127
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
 I don't know if he'd want that broadcast.

128
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
 Here's what's even weirder.

129
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,440
 The first ever David Bowie song was the Laughing Gnome.

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,680
 That was his first single.

131
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
 Wow.

132
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 Yeah.

133
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
 It's a gnome conspiracy.

134
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
 Just suddenly realized that.

135
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
 Yeah.

136
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
 Spooky.

137
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,200
 Well, there's that church as well that I think we all probably know about,

138
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,960
 which is called the Sand Covered Church.

139
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,080
 And what was special about that?

140
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,360
 So this is in Cordwell and an encroaching sand dune

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,160
 or just a whole cover of desert was heading towards it.

142
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
 And this church slowly got covered up and covered up by sand

143
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,040
 that it got to the point where no one could get into the church itself.

144
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,320
 So they were constantly having to dig the sand away to get through the door.

145
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
 Wow.

146
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:26,200
 There's a story that the vicar was once lowered once a year via a skylight into the church

147
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
 so that he could perform a once a year sermon.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,000
 I actually can't find any sources for that except for QI.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So I don't know.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,040
 When was this done?

151
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,040
 Was it recent?

152
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
 Or was it 19th century?

153
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
 No.

154
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 19th century.

155
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
 Yeah.

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
 Yeah.

157
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
 And it's a very old church.

158
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,120
 It still stands as a sort of restored version of it, which is just the steeple sticking out

159
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
 of the ground now.

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
 And the rest of the church presumably still has buried underneath it.

161
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,160
 Can I ask what series of QI was it on?

162
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,640
 Was it before I started or?

163
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
 Yeah.

164
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
 No.

165
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,640
 It was actually part of the Telegraph articles that used to be written by QI.

166
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
 Oh, yeah.

167
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
 I used to write those.

168
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
 Okay.

169
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
 Yeah.

170
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
 Yeah, that's one.

171
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
 All right.

172
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 Luckily.

173
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,120
 Can I just ask, Dan, if the vicar's being lowered in through a skylight to give a sermon,

174
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,040
 to whom is he giving that sermon when presumably no one else has entered through the door?

175
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,600
 He's a missionary converting the death worms, that's the thing.

176
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
 I have a feeling it was a symbolic thing.

177
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,120
 They had to do it once a year to sort of claim that it was still a church.

178
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,920
 It was something along those lines.

179
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
 Yeah.

180
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
 It wasn't to a congregation though.

181
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,840
 I think that would really increase the church attendance, which is a worry often.

182
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,280
 If your vicar flew in through the roof every time he gave you a sermon, that's cool enough

183
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
 that I might start going to church.

184
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
 Yeah.

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,280
 Did you know, this is just on the Public Health England report.

186
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,240
 So there's this report in 2017 that said, "You've got to reduce sugar in cereals."

187
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,640
 But I read the report and bizarrely, it divides food into various categories and KitKats and

188
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,680
 Penguin bars are not chocolate bars.

189
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
 Hmm.

190
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
 They're biscuits.

191
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
 What?

192
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
 Weird fact I found.

193
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 Yeah.

194
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 They're biscuits.

195
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
 Oh, is this normal news to you guys?

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
 I just was making a leap to what else it could be.

197
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,400
 I kind of half agree that penguins maybe aren't chocolate bars, but KitKats bang on chocolate

198
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
 bars.

199
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
 Absolutely.

200
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
 Yeah.

201
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
 Look at the KitKat chunky.

202
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
 Yeah.

203
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,280
 It's specified two-finger KitKats actually, so it could be that the KitKat chunky was

204
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
 elsewhere.

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
 It's still the best kit.

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,080
 It also cited, under chocolate confectionaries, an example, the chocolate lollipop, which

207
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
 I don't think I've ever had.

208
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
 Is that a thing?

209
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
 Sounds great.

210
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
 I haven't ever had one.

211
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,360
 There's some in my house, some chocolate lollipops, and I have a big bowl of dum-dums

212
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
 in my house.

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,280
 Like, there's about probably about 200 in there, and some of them taste like chocolate,

214
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
 and they're the worst ones.

215
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,680
 I thought you meant dum-dums, the explosive bullets used in the assassination attempt on

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 Ronald Reagan.

217
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 I was going to say, James.

218
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
 Edit this bit out.

219
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,640
 I thought you meant pacifiers because I've got a shitload of those.

220
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,280
 Dum-dums, you know, they're like, what are they called?

221
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,880
 Well, chop-a-chops, but American versions of chop-a-chops.

222
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
 Oh, lollipops.

223
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,880
 Okay.

225
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
 Fair enough.

226
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
 Have you guys heard of the Golden Mole Award?

227
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
 No.

228
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
 No?

229
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
 No.

230
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,640
 Okay, so this was set up in 2016 by NPR, and specifically inspired by the fact that the

231
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,840
 Golden Mole does have this rainbow shine on its fur and doesn't know it, and they talk

232
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,760
 of it as being accidental brilliance, the fact that they have no idea it's there.

233
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,920
 They are accidentally brilliant, and so the Golden Mole Award for Accidental Brilliance

234
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:31,200
 was set up by NPR, and the idea was to award scientists who made accidentally brilliant

235
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,680
 discoveries when they weren't looking for the thing that they found.

236
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,520
 So, for example, there was a biologist called Shelley Adamo who was trying to study the

237
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,840
 stress levels in crickets, and in order to do that she introduced a predator, which was

238
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,040
 a bearded dragon, and the idea was the bearded dragon was meant to just scare them by being

239
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,800
 around them, and she could suss out the stress.

240
00:10:53,800 --> 00:11:00,680
 But the lizard accidentally passed on a virus which infected the crickets, and the crickets

241
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,620
 gave the crickets this insane libido, and they started mating, and it was suddenly discovered

242
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,400
 that it was a parasitic aphrodisiac, and they had no idea that this lizard would ever have

243
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,240
 the ability to pass on something like this to crickets and make them have sex.

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,640
 So Accidental Brilliance as a discovery, and it champions all of these great moments for

245
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,000
 scientists who've had these little situations, and it happened in 2016, and it's never happened

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 again.

247
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 I don't know why they stopped it.

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,560
 It's such a wonderful idea for an award.

249
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,000
 Oh, I thought you meant the – so the awards never happened again.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,880
 Sorry, yeah, the awards, the Golden Mole Awards, as far as I can tell, have only been awarded

251
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,720
 in 2016, and then that's it.

252
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,240
 They retired it as a –

253
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,640
 And do they have any theories about why it's an aphrodisiac?

254
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,080
 Yeah, 'cause it could be like, you know, if I was there with my partner, and then there's

255
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,040
 a huge herd of lions coming towards us on the horizon, which I guess is the equivalent.

256
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,840
 I guess you'd think, sod it, might as well, right?

257
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,960
 Get another shag out before we're torn to shreds.

258
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 Is that what they're thinking?

259
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
 No.

260
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
 We don't know.

261
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,560
 I think Dad specified it was a parasitic organism which jumped from the dragon to the

262
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
 crickets.

263
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,240
 So that's one theory, is the organism, but is the other theory that you only live once

264
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
 at a treat?

265
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
 No, no.

266
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
 You're right, you're right.

267
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,240
 It's true.

268
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,240
 Shelly Adamo and her biology degree, we should have the annotations scheme.

269
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
 Exactly.

270
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,760
 That's probably why they stopped the award, 'cause everyone just went, well, that's

271
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
 a stupid theory.

272
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,840
 Your theory about the parasite, I know you've found an actual parasite in the crickets,

273
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,680
 and I know you can see that it came from the dragon, and I know that you've given it to

274
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,440
 other crickets, and they do exactly the same thing.

275
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,400
 I know all that, but what about –

276
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
 But clearly.

277
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
 Yeah.

278
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,360
 Clearly, the crickets are just going, carp ADM.

279
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,880
 Get on it, literally.

280
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,760
 This experiment, we didn't quite go into it then, I think, right?

281
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,200
 So, basically, what they had was like a big perspex circular tank with two walls so the

282
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,600
 sand dunes could go around the circumference of the circle, right, and they could kind

283
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,720
 of chase each other, and it was like a wind tunnel that sent it round, but the guy who

284
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:06,400
 did it was called Carol Batcik, or Carol Batcik, and he works at Cambridge University,

285
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,000
 and the reason that he did this experiment is he was just looking at one sand dune going

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,360
 around his thing, and he's thinking, "This is boring."

287
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,800
 It's taking ages to get any kind of data, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going

288
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,880
 to double my capacity and put two sand dunes in, and then I could get twice as much data.

289
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,920
 I'm just going to do that, and then when he did that, it started a new experiment that

290
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,320
 he hadn't intended to do, which was to see how the two interact with each other.

291
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,160
 Do you think, when he proposed that, people said, "You're Batcik crazy," because his

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,120
 name is Batcik, which sounds like, "Yes."

293
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,280
 I thought of it immediately when you said "Batcik," and then your explanation was

294
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,560
 so good, but I didn't realise it would be that long, and so gradually, that became

295
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,920
 less of a point in making the joke. It's good you've shown us your workings.

296
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,680
 Yeah, and it's nice that you held onto it. I was thinking it's important to explain

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,360
 why you don't get a laugh when you don't. His name sounds like a colloquial term for

298
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,520
 COVID, really. Batcik. We should all just say we're Batcik.

299
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,240
 That's just more catchy.

300
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:27,560
 Kat, if I wasn't going to cut out these joke out. In 2005, Alaska Zoo had an elephant,

301
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:33,880
 which was very ... She was kind of overweight because she was in captivity. She couldn't

302
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,760
 walk. So they had a problem here. So how would you solve that?

303
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,520
 You would give her a treadmill. Exactly. They built the first ... As far as I can tell,

304
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,840
 the only ever world's elephant treadmill. Oh my goodness.

305
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,400
 They got a company which does heavy-duty conveyor belts for mining, and they put that together,

306
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:02,520
 22 feet long. They could support this 4,000-kilo elephant. This was September 2005. The headline

307
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,000
 was "Now to get the elephant on the treadmill." The next headline from the same website was

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,720
 "Elephant Scorns Her Treadmill." She hated it. She never got fully onto it once.

309
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:21,280
 I can kind of empathize with that. Everyone hates treadmills, don't they?

310
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,240
 And she was later moved to a sanctuary in California. But guess what happened to the

311
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,920
 treadmill? It was used for different animals. My spot, like 5,000 of them.

312
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:40,880
 So kind of close, in a way. It was bought by a dog musher for his whole dog team.

313
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,280
 That's great. God, that's a fat dog you've got. I don't know how that's managing to run

314
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,080
 across the Arctic. If it's the same weight as an elephant ...

315
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,800
 No, it's a whole pack of dogs. No. It's a pack of dogs because it's a

316
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,320
 22-foot-long one. It's a pack of dogs that makes sense, not one obese dog that they were

317
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,520
 trying to bring the weight down. They had one particular one, a Russian mission, actually.

318
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,040
 So this is after the fall of the Soviet Union. They kept hurling probes at Mars.

319
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,360
 The Mars 96 Russian mission was carrying 200 grams of plutonium, and it was going to use

320
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,640
 it as a power source, but obviously an incredibly radioactive element.

321
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,440
 And it messed up, as so many of those probes do. And so while it was trying to escape the

322
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,120
 Earth orbit, it failed, and it broke apart. And then there was just this satellite carrying

323
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,640
 plutonium, which would be incredibly dangerous if it broke up anywhere on the planet, that

324
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,640
 was spinning around around the Earth. And all the countries of the Earth were kind of

325
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,600
 watching it, like watching a roulette wheel. And at one point, they thought, "I think it's

326
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,080
 going to land in Australia. It's going to land in Australia." And Clinton called up John

327
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,320
 Howard in Australia and said, "Okay, I'm really sorry. I think you're going to be hit by some

328
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,320
 plutonium. We'll help you out. Don't worry about it." And then it sort of missed Australia.

329
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,280
 And then the official report went out that it landed in the Pacific Ocean, which was

330
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,840
 weird because about 200 people in Chile said that they'd seen something burn up in the

331
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,080
 atmosphere and crash into the ground. And they've now sort of admitted that it's probably

332
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:12,400
 somewhere on the border of Chile and Bolivia. And if you see something, don't do anything

333
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
 with it.

334
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,720
 It's a bit like Pass the Parcel, isn't it? Where it just keeps going around and keeps

335
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,760
 going around and you don't know when it's going to stop. Like the Earth is just... Or

336
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,840
 actually, it's more like, do you remember those games where it's like a water balloon

337
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,640
 and you keep passing it around to everyone and eventually it blows up in your face or

338
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
 something?

339
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
 No.

340
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
 Never done that.

341
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
 No.

342
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,960
 How has the water balloon exploded in this? Like, is there explosive in the water balloon?

343
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,440
 I think it's in like a piece of plastic or something. I don't really know. You know

344
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,320
 what this is? This is a game which you could buy when I was a teenager or younger and we

345
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,960
 weren't allowed to have it, so I only saw it in adverse.

346
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,600
 Oh no, wait, I think I remember the adverse because I think in the middle of the water

347
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,960
 balloon is an unstable isotope of uranium and that might decay at any point which will

348
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,200
 make the balloon go pop.

349
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,880
 Quickly some stuff on wrestling or not?

350
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
 Oh, well, yeah.

351
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
 Yeah.

352
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,880
 Some funny wrestling nicknames.

353
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
 Yeah.

354
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
 Oh, okay.

355
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,400
 There's lots of lists on line of good wrestling nicknames. Jimmy Wang Yang.

356
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
 Nice.

357
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
 I'm out of him.

358
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
 No.

359
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
 Beaver Cleavage.

360
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
 Amazing.

361
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 Beaver Cleavage.

362
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
 Beaver Cleavage.

363
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,000
 Are these desirable attributes for a wrestler? Why do you want a Beaver Cleavage? What even

364
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,080
 is that? Is there a dam on it?

365
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,760
 At the time there was a TV show called Leave It To Beaver, apparently. I don't know what

366
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,720
 it was about, but apparently his name came from that for some reason.

367
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:44,120
 Have you heard of Balls Mahoney? He was another wrestler. His fans would shout, Balls, Balls,

368
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,920
 Balls, while he punched his opponents.

369
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,720
 Where did he punch them?

370
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,440
 And I haven't got that written down, because it feels like a request, doesn't it?

371
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,320
 Can I just mention the possibly real-life animal whisperer who Dr. Doolittle was based

372
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
 on?

373
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
 Oh, yeah.

374
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
 Yeah.

375
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,600
 So we're actually not sure about this, but his life resembled Dr. Doolittle's in a way,

376
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,920
 and it turns out that it could be that Dr. Doolittle is the same person as Dr. Jekyll

377
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,160
 and Mr. Hyde.

378
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
 No way.

379
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,160
 Point points.

380
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
 He's three people?

381
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,360
 That's so funny. He drinks one dose of the potion. He turns into Edward Hyde, a psychopathic

382
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,080
 murderer, but if he drinks two, he turns into a sort of charming animal doctor.

383
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 Yeah, that's right.

384
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,080
 Cool.

385
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,880
 But he keeps on mixing up the potions, and that's where the essential property of Dr.

386
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
 Jekyll, Mr. Hyde and Dr. Doolittle, the original text, lies.

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,960
 Isn't Mr. Hyde like almost an animal creature in himself? So like, he would be able to talk

388
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,160
 to him, to his animal self?

389
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,640
 Yes, to himself. That's why he had to invent Dr. Doolittle to talk to Mr. Hyde. No, none

390
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,640
 of that's true, except for the fact that we think both characters are based on a Scottish

391
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,320
 surgeon called John Hunter, who was one of the leading surgeons of the 18th century. He

392
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,680
 was very famous. And this is just based on similarities in his life. So he really liked

393
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,960
 animals, and he was also a grave robber. So the grave robber thing is a bit more Dr.

394
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,080
 Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the lucky animals thing is a bit more Dr. Doolittle.

395
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,120
 It's weird how they don't mention the animal talking in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or they

396
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,200
 don't mention the grave robbing in Dr. Doolittle. It's so weird.

397
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:19,840
 Different genres, aren't they? But Hunter had over 3,500 animals, and some of them

398
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,840
 were dead.

399
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,000
 Wait, were most of them flies? I mean, narrow it down.

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,560
 That would be cheating.

401
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,640
 He had one dog, one horse, and then 3,498 flies.

402
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,000
 He had more good ones than that. He had two leopards, so he lived in Leicester Square,

403
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,240
 and he had two leopards who lived in his garden and once got loose and ended up in a fight

404
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,660
 with some local dogs, and he had to restrain them. He kept a pet bull in his house, which

405
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,000
 he used to wrestle for fun, which is great.

406
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 All in Central London.

407
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Yeah.

408
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 All in Central London.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,080
 He used to live in, there's a pub that I think is called the Moon Over Water or something

410
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,240
 like that, which is on Leicester Square, and that was his house. And at the back of

411
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,680
 his house, he had a massive sort of place where he cut open bodies and stuff like that.

412
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,080
 I think if it's the right person, I'm thinking of, I think it was.

413
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,440
 Yeah, there's that place where he cut bodies and then where he talked to his pet rabbit

414
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,440
 next to it. It's nice. He actually did keep a lot of bees, so maybe that was where some

415
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,000
 of the cheating came in, Andy. One of his friends explained that he befriended the bees,

416
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,040
 and especially the less well-known kind. And this is the guy who might have been Dr. Doolittle.

417
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,840
 And I did read that he died of heart disease that was complicated by syphilis, which he

418
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,680
 may have given himself when he inoculated his own penis in his studies on gonorrhea.

419
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,040
 To get syphilis from yourself is pretty bad, isn't it? That's annoying.

420
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,000
 I mean, that's an excuse, isn't it? When you go home to your wife, she says, "Where did

421
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,200
 you get syphilis, Robbie? Think quick, think quick, think quick. Oh, I inoculated my own

422
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
 penis with gonorrhea."

423
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:59,520
 Damn it! Where did you get the gonorrhea from? Shit! Trying to get rid of chlamydia. Oh,

424
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
 God, damn it.

425
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,000
 Just one more luffa thing. I found a really fun luffa patent, so I was going through all

426
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,840
 the patents looking for luffa. It's a word search luffa. So there was one in 1889. This

427
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,360
 is just when they were taking off. Someone invented the luffa sock puppet, and the idea

428
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:22,680
 is that luffas full size, they can't get into those hard to reach spots. So behind the ears,

429
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,840
 for instance, and so a little sock puppet luffa was invented, you could scrape behind your

430
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
 ears.

431
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
 Oh, I see.

432
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,120
 Yeah. And similarly, more than 100 years later, what sounds like something very similar

433
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,080
 was invented. In 1994, there's a patent for a finger-mounted toothbrush. Also a great

434
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,920
 idea, stick a bit of luffa over the end of your finger.

435
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,400
 Oh, my God. I've seen those.

436
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,320
 Don't they sell those in motorway service stations?

437
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
 Yeah.

438
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 I'm sure I've... There we go.

439
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
 That's inspired.

440
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 Maybe it took off.

441
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,760
 Quite a few times. Yeah, quite a few times I've been stuck and sleeping in a service

442
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,440
 station, and I've had to get myself one of those toothbrushes.

443
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,560
 Your marriage is on the rocks, isn't it? That's incredible.

444
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,800
 It's thought that the patent itself says toothbrushes require a certain amount of dexterity to

445
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,760
 get in the mouth, and it's easier if you just use your finger.

446
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,960
 But some people will have short fingers and long mouths.

447
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
 Come on, Andy.

448
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,400
 I can touch my back too, just about, but...

449
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,040
 Not many people are going to have such short fingers or such long mouths that they can't

450
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,680
 reach some of their teeth. That's a very small amount of the population.

451
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,680
 But isn't the point that the toothbrush, like, if your hands are dirty, your toothbrush is

452
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,000
 clean, whereas if you've got to get to the very back of your mouth, you've been rolling

453
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
 around in a luffa field.

454
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
 Well, that's true.

455
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,160
 You know, wash your hands, guys. If we've learned anything for the last three months.

456
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,160
 I will give you, Andy, that this wouldn't work on crocodiles, for instance, but I agree

457
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,560
 that most humans are correctly proportioned.

458
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,440
 Or Tyrannosaurus rexes.

459
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
 So difficult.

460
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,360
 A horse walks into a bar, and the bowman says, "Why the long face?"

461
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,080
 And the horse says, "It's because I've not been able to clean my teeth for a week because

462
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,120
 of this new hoof brush I've got."

463
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
 It doesn't work.

464
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,360
 Just while we're talking about sort of other bizarre transportation from the early days,

465
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,960
 I was looking into the 1920s.

466
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,360
 I found a motorized baby carriage that was used in England.

467
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,400
 This was to get, so that had on the back, a sort of nurse chauffeur who would stand on

468
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,280
 what was a motorized baby carriage.

469
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,720
 So you can see pictures of it where the baby is laying in a bassinet, and they're standing

470
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,360
 on the back as if on a little platform, and it had an internal engine, which they said

471
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,520
 was really nice for sort of creating a little buzz and hum.

472
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
 You know how babies fall asleep in cars?

473
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,120
 It's kind of giving it that kind of vibe.

474
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
 And it could go up to four miles an hour.

475
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,000
 So people would just be nurses on the back, traveling with their babies.

476
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Yeah.

477
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 Did the nurse stand on the back?

478
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,680
 Was it like being on a Segway or something?

479
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,680
 Yeah, exactly.

480
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
 Or were they walking?

481
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
 Exactly.

482
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 They were standing on the back.

483
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,680
 Yeah.

484
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
 Yeah.

485
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
 When was that done?

486
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
 So, yeah.

487
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
 It was in England.

488
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
 Sorry, when?

489
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
 In the 1920s.

490
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,680
 Yeah, 1920s.

491
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,440
 And I found this one other thing, which I think this is one of those prototype things.

492
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
 We have a photo of it.

493
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,920
 I don't think it got anywhere very far, but there was a man in LA who wanted to sit while

494
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,920
 walking.

495
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,480
 So he wanted transportation to do that.

496
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,360
 So he effectively invented a unicycle, which was instead of, so he sat on a seat, but instead

497
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:28,440
 of it leading to a wheel, it led to two other legs, that when he spun the pedals, would

498
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,920
 walk the legs underneath his legs.

499
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,400
 So he was sort of eight foot tall-ish, and these legs, which had proper shoes on, would

500
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,280
 be walking underneath him, but he would be sitting and pedaling, it's a bit sorry for

501
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,280
 me.

502
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,280
 And he's pedaling the legs with his own legs.

503
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
 Yeah.

504
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
 Yeah.

505
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,600
 So he's using his legs to pedal some legs that are below him.

506
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,200
 So it's all the disadvantages of cycling, but with the pace of walking.

507
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,200
 Yes.

508
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,800
 Basically, all the worst parts of cycling and all the worst parts of walking in one.

509
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:04,540
 What's your why didn't you catch on?

510
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,240
 So Mozart, when he came to London, was actually a bit of a disaster, because he was brought

511
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,080
 to London with his sister, Nanel, and his father, and they kind of launched this big

512
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,120
 promo campaign to make him the sort of superstar child along with his sister.

513
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
 And people just didn't believe it.

514
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,920
 They just refused to believe that a genius that young could be that talented.

515
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,000
 And so there was a sort of promotional backlash.

516
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,160
 Everyone in the papers was like, "You're a hoaxer, you're a fraudster, can't be true."

517
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,240
 So weirdly, he ended up playing in a pub in London.

518
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,440
 He played for the king initially, and then by the end of his time in London, he was

519
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
 playing in a tavern.

520
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,520
 That's a good open mic night, isn't it?

521
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,880
 Imagine going on after Mozart.

522
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,320
 Some owls do farming.

523
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,160
 They cultivate other animals to eat.

524
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
 Did you know this?

525
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
 No.

526
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
 No.

527
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
 You know about the burrowing owl?

528
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,120
 I'm sure you've come across it.

529
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,360
 It burrows on the ground instead of living in trees, like an idiot.

530
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,120
 But it has a little burrow, and it takes dung into its burrow and then eats the dung beetles.

531
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,960
 So it slightly cultivates dung beetles so that it can have something to eat.

532
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,320
 I don't think it burrows though, does it?

533
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,320
 It steals burrows.

534
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 What?

535
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
 Yeah.

536
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 The burrowing owl does not burrow.

537
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,320
 It's a big old misnomer.

538
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,320
 Oh my goodness.

539
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
 It nicks other animals' burrows.

540
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
 It burrows burrows.

541
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
 It's a burrow burrow.

542
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,760
 It should be called the burrowing owl.

543
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,840
 So it will live in the burrows of prairie dogs or badgers or squirrels.

544
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,200
 Owls never make their own nests, they're very lazy, and they collect all this dung.

545
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,720
 So not only does it nick these people's homes, but then it collects loads of poo and piles

546
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,000
 it up at the entrance to attract the beetles.

547
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,520
 I think it's quite a clever idea, isn't it?

548
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,000
 Because if someone steals your burrow and then you go and try and get it back, but they

549
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,240
 filled it with poo, you're probably like, "All right, fine, you can have it."

550
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,240
 Fair enough.

551
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
 Yeah.

552
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,000
 There is one other owl which does this, which is, I haven't found too much more evidence

553
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 of this.

554
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,320
 I've only got a little bit, but it's the little owl, which I can only assume based on its

555
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:11,800
 name is absolutely massive, and it stashes meat and then supposedly grows maggots from

556
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 the meat.

557
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,800
 Really?

558
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,520
 And then it's put up in the meat for its own food.

559
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
 Yeah.

560
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
 Wow.

561
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
 Because that's more like farming.

562
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,520
 To me, that's more like farming, because the other one is more like fishing for dung

563
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
 beetles, isn't it?

564
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,440
 You put some dung out and the dung beetles come along and you reel them in.

565
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,480
 But this one is actually growing maggots.

566
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,720
 That's like farming.

567
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
 That's incredible.

568
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,480
 We should stop propagating the idea that maggots can grow on something.

569
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:44,120
 You know, that idea was debunked about 200 years ago, I think, guys.

570
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,420
 The wife, I got this lion's corpse in my living room and I'm just waiting to get the bees

571
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
 out of it.

572
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,000
 What a niche joke about taking that.

573
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 Yeah, exactly.

574
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,160
 You're going to have to look up golden syrup cans to get that, everyone.

575
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,520
 During World War II, the BBC banned pericomos deep in the heart of Texas during work hours,

576
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,480
 so you weren't allowed to play it from nine to five.

577
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,800
 And the reason was that it's got a little bit where people clap along and they were

578
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,440
 worried that people who are working in ammunition plants might clap and drop the bombs.

579
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
 That was amazing.

580
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,760
 I mean, was it a case that if you dropped a bomb, it exploded?

581
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,320
 Because if so, I think they need a better health and safety on the bombs.

582
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,320
 You're right.

583
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,760
 It doesn't feel like that would happen.

584
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,680
 Another ammunition factory has exploded based off one person dropping a thing.

585
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:39,720
 I suppose, probably, it was just that it was distracting the workers rather than they might

586
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,720
 blow themselves up.

587
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,720
 I don't know.

588
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,160
 I think bombs are, you're encouraged not to drop bombs, aren't you?

589
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
 That's, yeah.

590
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,920
 I imagine if I got a bomb that came over from Amazon, I hope on the box it would say, "Do

591
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
 not drop."

592
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
 Yeah.

593
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,640
 Confusing, though, when you're in a plane, actually ready to drop the bomb and you see

594
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,280
 that little label on the side.

595
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:07,600
 Yeah, before Champagne came to the world, before Dom Perignon started selling his Champagne,

596
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,200
 we always drank Peri and that was, it was fizzy, basically, I mean, baby Champagne's

597
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
 a bit like Champagne.

598
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,600
 It's like almost the same thing and we were drinking it 150 years before Champagne was

599
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
 invented.

600
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,960
 It used to be one of the main drinks.

601
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
 Dom Perignon, right?

602
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 Brilliant.

603
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
 Brilliant.

604
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
 Brilliant.

605
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
 Brilliant.

606
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
 Brilliant.

607
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,640
 Brilliant.

608
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,680
 That was a cool pie fact the other day, sorry for the tangent, just very quickly, but pie,

609
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:40,240
 if you look at it in a mirror, it's 3.14.

610
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
 Spells pie.

611
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
 Yeah.

612
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
 Yeah.

613
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
 Well done.

614
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,240
 It's good.

615
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
 It's great.

616
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
 Welcome to the party.

617
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
 It's exciting, isn't it?

618
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
 I don't know that.

619
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,720
 I remember the first time I learned that, yeah.

620
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
 Yeah, me too.

621
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
 It was quite a day.

622
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
 I'm sorry.

623
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,960
 We were just talking pie and mirrors and I brought something completely relevant.

624
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
 Four backwards.

625
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
 Four backwards.

626
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,400
 Oh, I guess it looks a bit like a pie.

627
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
 Yeah, I see it now.

628
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
 We love it.

629
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,880
 I think we're just saying that we, because you sort of like sometimes have seen that,

630
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,800
 done that in school and been really excited by it when you're 11.

631
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,080
 I'm just excited that you're having that moment now.

632
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,520
 Well, I went to a Steiner school.

633
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,520
 Yeah.

634
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:23,320
 If you put the number 58,008 into a calculator and turn it upside down, spells out boobs.

635
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,520
 Get out of, no, I didn't know that one.

636
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
 I didn't know that one.

637
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,160
 I'm all over boobs and boobless and boobies.

638
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,000
 They teach boobs at the Steiner schools.

639
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 They do.

640
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 That's what we got.

641
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,200
 Do you know the saying bringing owls to Athens?

642
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
 Yeah.

643
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,560
 It's like bringing coals to Newcastle.

644
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
 Yeah.

645
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,960
 It's a much classier version of bringing coals to Newcastle because the owl was the emblem

646
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,960
 of Athens.

647
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,960
 Yeah.

648
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
 And so, yeah.

649
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,600
 I say bringing some of us to Tula.

650
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 Do you?

651
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,640
 It's like bringing some of us to Tula.

652
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,540
 That's just another version of that.

653
00:31:54,540 --> 00:32:00,120
 I don't know where Tula is, and I'm not 100% of what a Samovar is either.

654
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,720
 I thought you were talking Latin, but I've just realized that that's it.

655
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,560
 I think it's in Southern Russia.

656
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
 I don't know.

657
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
 I actually don't know where Samovar is either.

658
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
 Might be in Georgia.

659
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
 Where Tula is.

660
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
 I think Samovars are everywhere.

661
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,760
 Don't remember anyone who's bought a Samovar.

662
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,760
 I think what is clear is that I'm using this phrase, which I don't understand at all.

663
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,140
 There were some happy endings in P.T. Barnum's acts, right, so there were a few nice stories.

664
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:30,660
 There was a woman called Katie Brumbach, who became known as the Great Sandwina, who was

665
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,660
 just amazing.

666
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,380
 I actually can't believe she existed, so she was a famous strong woman.

667
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,700
 She came from a circus performing family and she trained to be strong from an early age.

668
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,300
 And she beat Eugene Sandow in a fight.

669
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,260
 So Eugene Sandow, I actually don't think we've ever mentioned him, but he was the champion

670
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,740
 strong man of the 19th century.

671
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,920
 He was like the first strong man, wasn't he?

672
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,720
 You know, if you ever see pictures of these kind of really muscly people holding up barbells,

673
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,600
 he's basically what they're all based on.

674
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,920
 Yeah, I think the actual trophy for the Mr Olympia is based on his body.

675
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,040
 Yeah, he's the father of modern bodybuilding.

676
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
 Wow.

677
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
 There you go.

678
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,480
 Well, it should have been this lady, the Great Sandwina, because in 1902, she'd heard all

679
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,880
 this chat about Eugene and she did an act where she'd call men up from the audience and

680
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,300
 invite them to fight her, and they all thought they could beat her and none of them could.

681
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,460
 And Eugene Sandow fought her, or they actually had a competition to see who could lift the

682
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,420
 biggest weight, and she won.

683
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,660
 So there was a 300 pound weight, which is like a 22 stone man.

684
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,620
 Like if you're that overweight, there's a documentary about you, kind of level.

685
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,300
 And she raised that up above her head, I think, with one arm, and Eugene couldn't even get

686
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,460
 it up like over his chest.

687
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,780
 That is really amazing.

688
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,600
 It's unbelievable because you can imagine being able to beat someone in a wrestling

689
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,120
 match because you have different skills or something, but lifting weights is like literally

690
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,560
 just muscle mass, isn't it?

691
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,640
 Really, that's all it is.

692
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
 So, wow.

693
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
 Yeah.

694
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,600
 She met her husband after kicking his ass in a wrestling ring.

695
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,480
 He was one of the people who accepted the challenge to try and fight her, and his memories

696
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,720
 are basically walking into the ring and then nothing, and then blue sky above him.

697
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,680
 So she knocked him out, and they fell in love afterwards.

698
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,740
 And yeah, she had a loving relationship with him.

699
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
 Yeah, 52 years.

700
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,540
 I wonder how much he had in the decision.

701
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,340
 How much he had.

702
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,480
 I do, yes, I don't think, yeah.

703
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,540
 Just one more thing, and we probably won't use this, but it's so interesting, I just

704
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
 want to say it.

705
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:39,180
 And that is that, one more thing is that skates, you know, the fish, they use incubators on

706
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,180
 their eggs.

707
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:44,520
 So they lay eggs, like some fish, like sharks for instance, they also do it.

708
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:49,380
 They lay these things called mermaid's purses, which are essentially their eggs.

709
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,700
 And the skates, they intentionally put their eggs next to hydrothermal vents, which is a

710
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,000
 bit at the bottom of the ocean, where heat comes out, like volcanic heat.

711
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,320
 And they deliberately, they don't put it directly next to it, because it would boil the eggs.

712
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,120
 They put it just the right distance away, that it accelerates the speed in which the

713
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,900
 eggs kind of grow.

714
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,900
 That's genius.

715
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,740
 And so they have their own artificial incubation, even though they're fish.

716
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,340
 And if you have left it a little bit too close, then you can just do the old take the top

717
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:25,580
 off egg and soldiers, soft boiled egg.

718
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,140
 What would you dip in if you are in the water, you'd have to get some sort of passing shrimp?

719
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,980
 Your soldiers, your bread's going to be soggy, isn't it?

720
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,760
 I always think, so there's been this debate about whether we need sharp knives, like pointed

721
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,040
 knives at all now.

722
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:49,960
 And this is the point that I think, literally on a weekly basis, amazingly, you can't believe

723
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,720
 you're using this as an excuse to bring up this argument again.

724
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,760
 You've cut it out every time, James, and if you keep cutting it out, keep reading it up.

725
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,360
 So here's the debate listeners, please take your votes.

726
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,940
 Still, we don't really need the pointy end of sharp knives because we don't really use

727
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
 that.

728
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:08,940
 We use the sharp bit.

729
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
 But when do you use the point?

730
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:15,220
 Now, James, weirdo James, shoves the pointed end into his tomatoes to cut them up.

731
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,620
 What I say is just use a serrated knife.

732
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,980
 Well, you know what, literally yesterday, I was stabbed someone with a pointed knife.

733
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
 I know.

734
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,060
 I was cutting some sourdough bread and I stabbed it before I did the cut.

735
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:33,600
 And I thought Anna would not approve of this.

736
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,080
 There is a pair called a stinking bishop.

737
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,720
 Do you know that one?

738
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
 No.

739
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
 Is that related to the cheese?

740
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
 Yeah.

741
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,720
 Exactly.

742
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
 So those two things are related.

743
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,720
 And how are they related?

744
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,720
 Same bishop.

745
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
 Like, poor guy.

746
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
 Poor, stinky old bishop.

747
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,960
 Kind of, but not really, though.

748
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,960
 Okay.

749
00:36:49,960 --> 00:37:04,020
 So you often eat, if you're in the 1970s, apple and cheese on a stick.

750
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,020
 You do?

751
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
 Yeah.

752
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
 So is it related to that?

753
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,600
 No, it's not that.

754
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,980
 It is that stinking bishop cheese is made with peri that's made from the stinking bishop

755
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
 pear.

756
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,540
 And that's how it gets its name.

757
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
 Oh, cool.

758
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,940
 Well, the pear came first.

759
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,480
 The pear came first and you make some peri, some alcohol out of it, and then you steep

760
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,420
 the milk and the cheese in that stuff and it helps the bacteria grow and that's how

761
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
 you get your cheese.

762
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,140
 That's very, very cool.

763
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:36,520
 There was a story as well about a guy who accidentally swallowed one of those iPhone

764
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
 head pot.

765
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
 I'm wearing one right now.

766
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
 These new earphones.

767
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
 I noticed you're only wearing one, Dan.

768
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
 Where's the other?

769
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,120
 I am that guy.

770
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,120
 We'll see in two to three days what's happened to the other one.

771
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,500
 Yeah, so he swallowed it and then you can do a tracker thing where it can locate your

772
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
 headphone.

773
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,660
 I've not actually used that yet.

774
00:37:53,660 --> 00:38:00,080
 And apparently he says heard the beeps from within and he passed the headphone and it's

775
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,940
 still worked and it still had 40-ish percent left on it by the time it came out.

776
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:05,940
 No way.

777
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,940
 That's amazing.

778
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,340
 That was not an Apple product then, surely.

779
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,660
 They were offering trips to go and see the Titanic recently, I think.

780
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:19,000
 In fact, there was supposed to be a tourist thing this year, which I imagine is not happening

781
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
 anymore.

782
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,440
 But this is Stockton Rush, is this guy who's, I think he's like the CEO, a guy called Stockton

783
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
 Rush.

784
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,320
 He's the CEO of something called Ocean Gate Expeditions and he's offering tourists week

785
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
 long trips to go down in submersibles to visit the Titanic.

786
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,120
 And it's the first time since this couple got married that they've offered it to anyone.

787
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,920
 So they used to until I think about 2012.

788
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,740
 And each seat cost $105,000, which is exactly the inflation-adjusted price of a first-class

789
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,900
 ticket on the Titanic.

790
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
 So that's nice.

791
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
 Wow.

792
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,060
 Or it did initially and he liked that sort of symmetry.

793
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,700
 But then he actually had to raise the price because he realized that it wasn't expensive

794
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,980
 enough.

795
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,180
 I never realized it was that expensive to go on the Titanic.

796
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,140
 That's an incredible amount of money to go.

797
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,260
 It's unbelievable, isn't it?

798
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
 Yeah.

799
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,260
 Yeah, that's huge.

800
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
 First-class, I guess.

801
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,000
 Yeah, I know what you mean, but a hundred grand to go on a boat.

802
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
 Mad.

803
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,280
 It's not just, James, it wasn't just a boat, it's not just going out on your mate's boat.

804
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,920
 It was the boat.

805
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,440
 Anyway, it had to be postponed in this trip.

806
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,640
 First of all, because it's supposed to leave from the coast of Canada and it's a Norwegian

807
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,520
 ship that he's like got to take these tourists out in so they can go down to the Titanic.

808
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,400
 And there's all those weird shipping rules.

809
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,340
 So Canada suddenly said, "Oh, wait, your ship's going to be flying a Norwegian flag.

810
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:46,620
 You're not allowed to leave our coastal waters flying a Norwegian flag."

811
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,620
 So he's put hundreds of thousands of dollars into this expedition.

812
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:52,940
 And then there's a flag issue, which Shadi Mani had to postpone.

813
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,420
 Take your float down.

814
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,420
 What's his problem?

815
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,100
 I would have thought, "Just repaint it.

816
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,000
 Paint a maple leaf on top of it."

817
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,380
 I've got a feeling that the rules are a bit more complicated than that, Dad.

818
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,420
 I think when you have a flag of a country, there might be some paperwork to fill in rather

819
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:09,000
 than just going, "Fuck it, I'll put a different flag up."

820
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 I don't know.

821
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,600
 Sometimes the simplest solution is the one that's disregarded.

822
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,200
 I'll give him a Zoom call, I'll consult.

823
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
 Where's Wally Books?

824
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
 Yeah.

825
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,880
 You know those things where he's in different parts of the page and it's a very busy page?

826
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,560
 They are based on a German trend called Vimal Builder Books, which is literally a teaming

827
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,200
 picture book.

828
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,240
 And the idea of those was originally you would have a picture with loads of stuff happening

829
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,700
 in all the different parts of the page, and it would be a child's job to make stories

830
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,820
 up about all the different people who are living in the different parts of this page.

831
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,380
 So it's like a really creative way of teaching children how to use their imaginations.

832
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,380
 Yeah.

833
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,380
 Isn't that cool?

834
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,380
 That's great.

835
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,380
 That's cool.

836
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,380
 Wow.

837
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,380
 So we've dumbed down.

838
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,380
 Where's Wally?

839
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,340
 Well, we've tripled dumbed it down because we think they come from paintings by Bosch and

840
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
 Breugel.

841
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:03,820
 And you know those amazing pictures like the Garden of Earth doing lights or whatever it's

842
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,880
 called, where there's just stuff happening everywhere, it's kind of based on those.

843
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
 Cool.

844
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,440
 And then we just looking for some idiot with a stripy jumper.

845
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,720
 And sometimes there are loads of other people wearing stripy jumpers in the same page.

846
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
 It's so crazy.

847
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,800
 It's why they are at the beach if they're wearing stripy jumpers, it doesn't make any

848
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
 sense.

849
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:25,240
 In real life, Wells Wally at the beach would be really easy because he's the only one

850
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
 in a jumper.

851
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
 That's true.

852
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
 That's true.

853
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
 Where's Wally?

854
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,060
 The master addition, which is where's Wally?

855
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,120
 Newest addition.

856
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,740
 Very popular in Germany, though.

857
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,900
 My favourite animal that lives on sand dunes is the Saharan silver ant.

858
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,900
 And that's because this is one of the fastest ants in the world, maybe the fastest ants

859
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,060
 in the world.

860
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,260
 It's so fast.

861
00:41:53,260 --> 00:42:00,880
 It can run at 855 millimetres per second, which, believe me, in the ants world is super

862
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,880
 fast.

863
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,920
 I can run at 855 millimetres per second just about.

864
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,920
 Yeah.

865
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,600
 Well, can you run 108 times your own body length in a second?

866
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
 No.

867
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
 I don't think I can.

868
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,600
 Yeah.

869
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,600
 Exactly.

870
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,160
 He does 47 strides per second.

871
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
 Wow.

872
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,160
 Okay.

873
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,840
 So that is Michael Johnson, the old runner who he had a kind of weird way of running

874
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,740
 where he did lots more strides than normal people.

875
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,400
 And even he only did four steps per second.

876
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,340
 And this guy did 47 per second.

877
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,180
 So it's like, you know, those cartoons where you just see the legs going around in a circle.

878
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,340
 It's a bit like that.

879
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,060
 I didn't know Michael Johnson did that.

880
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,900
 Did it look really weird when you watched it?

881
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,900
 Yeah.

882
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,900
 Did it look like he had an extra pair of legs?

883
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,740
 He was famously, he ran in a different way than anyone else.

884
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,700
 So he ran really upright and he moved his legs really, really quickly.

885
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,040
 But presumably in really small, smaller strides, like a ballerina tiptoeing across the stage.

886
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
 Smaller strides.

887
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,040
 Yeah.

888
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,960
 Can I ask a question about Michael Johnson, for example, if, okay, if you came up with

889
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,840
 a new way of running and let's say, let's just say that you came up with a way of doing

890
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,880
 forward cartwheels or forward rolls that happened to be faster than any other sprinter

891
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,360
 on the planet, would you be allowed to do that?

892
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,880
 Or is it easy to use your hands?

893
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,880
 It's a possibly flop.

894
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,880
 Isn't it?

895
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,080
 Oh, you mean if can you use your hands to run?

896
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,080
 Yeah.

897
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,180
 That's a bit different than what I was thinking.

898
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,420
 If you ran on all fours, like kids sometimes do.

899
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
 Yeah.

900
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,620
 Actually, no, I think you can because if you're in a running race and you fall over, like

901
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,260
 let's say you're in a steeple chase race where you're jumping over hurdles.

902
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:37,860
 If you fall over and your hands touch the floor, you're not disqualified, are you?

903
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,860
 No, you're not.

904
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,860
 Yeah, that's right.

905
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,700
 So, yeah, I imagine if you want to run with all four arms and legs, like a race horse,

906
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,700
 I think you'd be able to.

907
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,480
 I'm sure I've said before that I invented a new way of doing the walking race, which

908
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,320
 I believe is faster than the way that they do it in the Olympics.

909
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,820
 Wow.

910
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:04,520
 It's extremely long strides and you move your hips a lot and I reckon it's faster than

911
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,120
 anyone can walk in their style.

912
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:12,640
 But if I do it for about 10 seconds, I get unbelievably tired.

913
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,460
 I think it might just not be very energy efficient, but it might be just that I'm terribly

914
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,460
 unfit.

915
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,780
 So, you know, it's out there.

916
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,780
 If any professional walkers want to hit me.

917
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,060
 Is there a 100-meter walk sprint?

918
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,700
 Unfortunately, the shortest distance they go, I think, is about 20 kilometers.

919
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,660
 And the longest distance I've ever gone in this technique is about 20 meters.

920
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,620
 We could set it up though.

921
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,780
 Why don't we set up when we're all allowed back together, you versus Andy, Andy Cartwheeling

922
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:49,440
 his way to the end, a new walk sprinting your way to the end, and Dan and I all being popcorn.

923
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,120
 It's a shame if you have invented that new kind of run, like Michael Johnson has, that

924
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,200
 you have to expose it.

925
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,040
 There's no way that you can wear like a box around your leg so that everyone's just going,

926
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,040
 "What's he doing?

927
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,760
 Yeah, we can't work out.

928
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:02,760
 Why is he so much faster?"

929
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,440
 Well, you could wear a sarong.

930
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,840
 Maybe that's what David Beckham was doing, because he was a very fast footballer, wasn't

931
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
 he?

932
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,540
 Maybe Michael the sarong to conceal his trick of doing seven more steps a minute than anyone

933
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,540
 else.

934
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:19,220
 But I think the problem is, if you're wearing a sarong in the Olympics and you're running,

935
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:25,780
 then people will just assume you're on a unicycle.

936
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,900
 And so, yeah, they probably won't like it.

937
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,900
 Right.

938
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,900
 That's what they'd assume.

939
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,940
 You'd have to ritually take the sarong off at the end of the race to show that you had

940
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,840
 no wheels under there.

941
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,620
 It's not, you should just ban it altogether, sarongs, I think, in running races.

942
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,620
 It's not worth the hassle.

943
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,620
 Yeah.

944
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:44,040
 It's quite a tight wrap as well, a sarong, probably on a long skirt.

945
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,880
 It's quite thick material, you're rubbing the face in it by.

946
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
 You need the massive box.

947
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,880
 That's what you need.

948
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,880
 A massive box.

949
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,880
 Covering everything below the waist.

950
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,880
 Yeah.

951
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,320
 Does anyone have anything else on sand dunes?

952
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,240
 No.

953
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,520
 I got one fact about pairs, which I think is quite amazing.

954
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,680
 Do you know the phrase, "It's all gone pear-shaped"?

955
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,680
 Yeah.

956
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,680
 Yeah.

957
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,380
 That phrase dates back to 1983, is the earliest we have an example of, and it was used in

958
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,160
 the Navy.

959
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,180
 And the phrase, "It's all gone peat-tongue," is only four years younger.

960
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,180
 Wow!

961
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,640
 So, "It's all gone peat-tongue" was from 1987, and "It's all gone pear-shaped" is from

962
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,640
 1983.

963
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,640
 That four-year difference.

964
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,640
 It's amazing.

965
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,640
 Isn't it great, that?

966
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,640
 Yeah.

967
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,640
 You would have thought.

968
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:40,360
 What's so wrong in the '80s that there are so many other ways of saying this is screwed

969
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
 up?

970
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,360
 Thatcher.

971
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,360
 Thatcher.

972
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
 There you go.

973
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,240
 Another time that a pair was an insult was this amazing period in 19th-century France

974
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,840
 where it became this massive political meme.

975
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,560
 This is the coolest thing.

976
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,240
 So, this is in the 1830s.

977
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,240
 There was a famous caricaturist and political satirist called Charles-Philippin, Charles-Philippin.

978
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:06,760
 And he started publishing offensive pictures of the king, and he was taken to court for

979
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:07,960
 insulting the king.

980
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,880
 And he said, "How do you guys know that's the king?

981
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,720
 Look, I've even put someone else's name underneath it."

982
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,320
 And they were like, "Well, it looks like the king."

983
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,480
 He said, "Oh, well, that's, you know, you've made that assumption, not me."

984
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,480
 Oh, well, I'm great.

985
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,720
 And then to demonstrate you could interpret anything as looking like the king, he drew

986
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,240
 a pear, and then he showed in four pictures how a pear could gradually transform into the

987
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,240
 king's face.

988
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,400
 And anyway, which was a pretty cocky thing to do in court, and he didn't get away with

989
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,800
 it, and he was sent to prison for a while, but this became a meme for the king.

990
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:41,000
 So, like, all these caricaturists and all these magazines published pictures of pears,

991
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,360
 and that was a byword for how crap the king was.

992
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,800
 And it was really hard to prosecute because they're just drawing pears.

993
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,680
 And eventually they cracked down on the pear image.

994
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,320
 And so what this guy did was he started writing, so at one point they were told to stop drawing

995
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,480
 pears, and if you had a publication and you'd had like a legal thing saying you weren't

996
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,400
 allowed to publish something, you had to publish that legal thing to be like, "Sorry,

997
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,400
 we did wrong."

998
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,360
 So he published what they'd been told by the government, but he published the text in

999
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,440
 a pear shape.

1000
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
 Which looks really beautiful.

1001
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
 Brilliant.

1002
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,440
 It's a real slap in the face.

1003
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,440
 Wow.

1004
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,440
 So good.

1005
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:18,440
 He's asking for trouble, that guy, isn't he?

1006
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,440
 Yeah.

1007
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:20,440
 I guess.

1008
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,440
 He is.

1009
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,600
 And he was shut down.

1010
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:28,560
 Another pear that looks like another sort of leader is the Yu mini Buddha pears.

1011
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,880
 Have you seen those?

1012
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:30,880
 No.

1013
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:31,880
 No.

1014
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,880
 This is a guy in China.

1015
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,880
 He's a farmer.

1016
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,720
 He spent years and years doing this, where he's been creating molds, where the pear grows

1017
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,520
 inside the mold.

1018
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,760
 And for years he's been trying to get it to look like a baby Buddha.

1019
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,440
 And he's succeeded.

1020
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,800
 He's got 10,000 of them, which he brought over to the UK.

1021
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:54,440
 And you look at them and it's like a little squished-together Buddha, but it's a pear.

1022
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,840
 And it's, why?

1023
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,120
 I imagine it's easier to sell a pear that looks like a Buddha than a pear that looks

1024
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,120
 like a pear.

1025
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,120
 It's just cool.

1026
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,120
 It's just cool.

1027
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,640
 And actually, you know those soda and alcohol bottles where you get a pear inside?

1028
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,640
 Oh, yeah.

1029
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,440
 I was trying to work out how do you get the pear inside.

1030
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,720
 And the answer is you grow the pear inside the bottle from the tree.

1031
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,720
 So that's how they do it.

1032
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:23,080
 They hang the bottle upside down and they weave through the branch and they allow it

1033
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,080
 to grow inside.

1034
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,080
 Then they cut that off.

1035
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,240
 And that's how they get it in there.

1036
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,740
 That's crazy.

1037
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,920
 I didn't even know about the phenomenon of pears in bottles, but I'm still excited to

1038
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,440
 know about how they do.

1039
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,440
 That's so cool.

1040
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,440
 Yeah, it's not massive, but you do see them occasionally.

1041
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:40,280
 And they do the same thing with ships in bottles, don't they?

1042
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:47,120
 You get the tree and then you put the branch in.

1043
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
 He should call those pears.

1044
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,120
 I can't believe it's not butter.

1045
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
 Yes.

1046
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
 Beautiful.

1047
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
 Beautiful.

1048
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:05,120
 Well, that's the kind of thing we cut out.

1049
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,200
 Okay, that's it.

1050
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,840
 That is all of our collection of offcuts for this week.

1051
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,240
 Thank you so much for listening.

1052
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,160
 We will be back again next week with another episode.

1053
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,120
 Until then, you can get us on our Twitter accounts.

1054
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:21,640
 So I'm on that Shriverland, James is at James Harkin, and Andy, you like saying yours?

1055
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,640
 I do.

1056
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,280
 It's bulls, bulls, bulls.

1057
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,600
 Wow, really committing to that.

1058
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,960
 It wasn't worth the commitment.

1059
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
 It's @andrewhunterum.

1060
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:30,960

1063
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,480

 Goodbye.

1070

 Bye.

1071
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
 Bye.

1072
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:50,960
 Bye.

1073
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,960
 Bye.

1074
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:51,960
 Bye.

1075
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:52,960
 Bye.

1076
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:52,960
 Bye.

1077
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,960
 Bye.

1078
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:53,960
 Bye.

1079
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,540
 (upbeat music)

1080
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,120
 (upbeat music)
