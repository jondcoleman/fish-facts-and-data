00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.320
 Hi everybody, before we start this week's show, we have to let you know that it is a special summer compilation of all the most wonderful stuff that, for time, space and legal reasons, we have not been able to fit into shows over the last few months.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 Hang on a second, so we're releasing a whole show that was legally dubious.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.160
 This is the end of No Such Thing as a Fish, we're gonna be sued by Figgs, the people who were on the Fermilab, Russia, all of these things are mentioned in the show.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.200
 And my catchphrase this week is 'Balls, balls, balls', so listen out for that.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.040
 Is it? In what context?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.720
 You heard it a few weeks ago, you'll hear it again shortly.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280
 No, no wonder that was cut.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.040
 Alright, on with the show.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.600
 'Balls, balls, balls'

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.240
 There's a theory that we only have hands because of Figgs, so...

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.280
 I believe it, I believe it.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.120
 It's that our hands evolved as tools for assessing whether Figgs are soft or not, okay?

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.240
 So this sounds insane, but it's a proper theory from a Dartmouth paper, okay?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 And what chimpanzees do in the wild, they squeeze fruit just like we do in a supermarket to work out whether it's good.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.440
 Go do that, Andy.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.680
 Oh yeah, okay, don't do that now.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.760
 Yeah, fine.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.680
 They squeeze fruit like we used to until four months ago in a supermarket.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.520
 Which, and that might have helped us develop fine motor control because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.920
 chimpanzees get a massive advantage from being able to squeeze fruit,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.800
 because they can do it four times faster than if they have to detach it, bite it and then assess it, right?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.120
 So they can tell much faster, like birds and monkeys, they have to rely on visual information or on oral information,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.840
 i.e. eating a bit of it.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200
 So chimpanzees have an advantage there.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.040
 Do they ever do the thing where they squeeze it a bit too hard,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.560
 they put their thumb through it and then they try and bury it under some other figs and pretend that they haven't touched it?

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.320
 This is why you shouldn't squeeze stuff in a supermarket, guys.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.720
 Every time you squeeze an avocado, it's making it bruised for the next person who comes along.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.400
 Or if you put your thumb through it, then it's even worse.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.520
 Eventually it'll be perfect, but eventually it's perfect for the 40th or 50th person who touches that avocado.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.680
 Exactly.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.760
 I mean, there are so many fruits, you've got to do the squeeze test.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.840
 So I can't believe they've never used supermarket fruit in crime-solving because every item is covered in fingerprints.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.840
 Just a thought for the men.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.280
 But it's not as if they're getting to a crime scene and they're going, "Should we dust the avocados?"

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 No, no, don't waste your time on that, but what do you mean?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.440
 I think what Anna's saying is you go to a crime scene, you find some fingerprints, then you go to the nearest Tesco and you dust all the fruit.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.320
 Sorry, that does work.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.920
 And then you cross-reference it with the CCTV of who's been in the supermarket. It's a genius idea.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.640
 Everyone goes to the supermarket, apart from the "Acado Killer".

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.920
 Don't get away with it for years.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.480
 There's a lab in...

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.720
 Is it called Fermilab now? The physics guys in America?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.480
 It was called the National Accelerator Lab back in the day.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.640
 And in 1971 they were testing their particle accelerator.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.720
 So, you know, it has huge 13-ton magnets all the way around this four-mile ring.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.960
 And they noticed that it kept failing and it kept messing up

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.480
 because the magnets were kind of being pulled into the vacuum tubes

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.480
 and they were leaving these little metal slivers inside the actual tube, which is meant to be all empty.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.800
 So, how do you get inside those tubes to empty them out?

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.880
 How do you gain access?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.120
 Do you cover yourself in butter and then slip in?

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.960
 Well, you're too big to go in.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.800
 You have to send something into the tube.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
 A child?

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800
 A ferret.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.800
 A ferret.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.800
 A ferret is always a bloody ferret, isn't it?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
 Into a particle accelerator.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.480
 They got a ferret called Felicia for $30 and she didn't want to go.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.920
 She had to be trained with progressively larger tubes

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.680
 because they just started off by putting her at this 300-foot tube

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.880
 and she said, "I'm not going in there, obviously."

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.720
 So, it was a talking ferret.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.840
 A talking ferret and she was still only $30.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.480
 Wow.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.200
 She could only talk after she came out of the particle accelerator.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200
 I don't know what happened in there.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.960
 Yeah, but then she pulled it through

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.360
 and then they were able to attach a cleaning swab and they clean it properly.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.000
 Very sadly, she died the following year.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Ah.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.520
 But knowing that she'd been of use to mankind, which is what ferrets want.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.160
 Well, so she was at a sanctuary.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.920
 I think she might have died because do you remember we talked about how female ferrets die

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.720
 if they don't have sex for a year?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.800
 Come on, if you've just been in a particle accelerator

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.640
 and you could tell that story, you would get in a lot of sex.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.040
 Hey, garden gnomes, are they basically the replacement of hermits?

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.600
 Did we do them out of a job when the garden gnome was invented?

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.800
 There's debate. I believe there's debate about this.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 Right.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.040
 Some people point out that they live in your garden

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.520
 and they're bearded and weird.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.360
 And then other people say, "No, they are flamboyant.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.520
 Are they showing off and they're clearly not like hermits at all?"

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.840
 They're just both kinds of people who like to live in your garden.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.680
 I don't think they're flamboyant.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.120
 I can't believe we've stolen this debate from Newsnight.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.160
 Well, in fact, because I just very quickly,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.160
 when I was reading about hermits and they said that gnomes had replaced them,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.760
 I discovered that one of the most notable producers of gnomes

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.320
 was a man called Tom Major Bell,

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.520
 who was the prime minister, John Major's father.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520
 Really?

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.280
 Yeah, he was one of the most notable.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.920
 And so he had a company called Major's Garden Ornaments.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.480
 Major's Garden Ornaments.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.320
 And yeah, and that took them from being quite a sort of not well-to-do family

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.560
 to becoming middle class.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.120
 I mean, effectively gnomes are the reason

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.880
 that John Major became prime minister.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880
 Wow.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.480
 I mean, I'm speculating there to a huge degree.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.400
 No, I think that's fair. I think that's right.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400
 That's incredible.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.400
 Yeah.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.560
 Didn't he then become a acrobat or something?

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.560
 No.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560
 Yeah, he was.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560
 He was here.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560
 He was whole life.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.480
 He was a circus performer and an acrobat.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.280
 I'm sick of people laughing at me at night.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280
 My circus job.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.480
 I'm going to get into a serious career.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.920
 And that's supposedly where, this is just a bit of trivia,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.680
 but supposedly where David Bowie got Major Tom from

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.520
 because he saw on a poster Tom Major.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.360
 So Major Tom of the Space Oddity Song.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.040
 But yeah, so Garden Gnomes gave us a prime minister.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.040
 Wow.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.320
 It really does take David Bowie down a few rungs of cool

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.080
 knowing that that song was written about John Major's dad.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080
 Well, actually...

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080
 I don't know if he'd want that broadcast.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080
 Here's what's even weirder.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.440
 The first ever David Bowie song was the Laughing Gnome.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.680
 That was his first single.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680
 Wow.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680
 Yeah.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680
 It's a gnome conspiracy.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.680
 Just suddenly realized that.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680
 Yeah.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
 Spooky.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.200
 Well, there's that church as well that I think we all probably know about,

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.960
 which is called the Sand Covered Church.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.080
 And what was special about that?

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.360
 So this is in Cordwell and an encroaching sand dune

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.160
 or just a whole cover of desert was heading towards it.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.400
 And this church slowly got covered up and covered up by sand

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.040
 that it got to the point where no one could get into the church itself.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.320
 So they were constantly having to dig the sand away to get through the door.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320
 Wow.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:26.200
 There's a story that the vicar was once lowered once a year via a skylight into the church

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.200
 so that he could perform a once a year sermon.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.000
 I actually can't find any sources for that except for QI.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 So I don't know.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.040
 When was this done?

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040
 Was it recent?

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.040
 Or was it 19th century?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.040
 No.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040
 19th century.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.040
 Yeah.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.040
 Yeah.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.040
 And it's a very old church.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.120
 It still stands as a sort of restored version of it, which is just the steeple sticking out

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.120
 of the ground now.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.120
 And the rest of the church presumably still has buried underneath it.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.160
 Can I ask what series of QI was it on?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.640
 Was it before I started or?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640
 Yeah.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.640
 No.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.640
 It was actually part of the Telegraph articles that used to be written by QI.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.640
 I used to write those.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.640
 Okay.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 Yeah.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640
 Yeah, that's one.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.640
 All right.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640
 Luckily.

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.120
 Can I just ask, Dan, if the vicar's being lowered in through a skylight to give a sermon,

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.040
 to whom is he giving that sermon when presumably no one else has entered through the door?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.600
 He's a missionary converting the death worms, that's the thing.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.640
 I have a feeling it was a symbolic thing.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.120
 They had to do it once a year to sort of claim that it was still a church.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.920
 It was something along those lines.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.920
 Yeah.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920
 It wasn't to a congregation though.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.840
 I think that would really increase the church attendance, which is a worry often.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.280
 If your vicar flew in through the roof every time he gave you a sermon, that's cool enough

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.880
 that I might start going to church.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
 Yeah.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.280
 Did you know, this is just on the Public Health England report.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.240
 So there's this report in 2017 that said, "You've got to reduce sugar in cereals."

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.640
 But I read the report and bizarrely, it divides food into various categories and KitKats and

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.680
 Penguin bars are not chocolate bars.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680
 Hmm.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.680
 They're biscuits.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680
 What?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680
 Weird fact I found.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680
 Yeah.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680
 They're biscuits.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680
 Oh, is this normal news to you guys?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.160
 I just was making a leap to what else it could be.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:04.400
 I kind of half agree that penguins maybe aren't chocolate bars, but KitKats bang on chocolate

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.400
 bars.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.400
 Absolutely.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.400
 Yeah.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.400
 Look at the KitKat chunky.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.400
 Yeah.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.280
 It's specified two-finger KitKats actually, so it could be that the KitKat chunky was

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.280
 elsewhere.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.280
 It's still the best kit.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.080
 It also cited, under chocolate confectionaries, an example, the chocolate lollipop, which

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.120
 I don't think I've ever had.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.120
 Is that a thing?

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.120
 Sounds great.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.120
 I haven't ever had one.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.360
 There's some in my house, some chocolate lollipops, and I have a big bowl of dum-dums

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360
 in my house.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.280
 Like, there's about probably about 200 in there, and some of them taste like chocolate,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.080
 and they're the worst ones.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.680
 I thought you meant dum-dums, the explosive bullets used in the assassination attempt on

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.680
 Ronald Reagan.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.680
 I was going to say, James.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.680
 Edit this bit out.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:47.640
 I thought you meant pacifiers because I've got a shitload of those.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.280
 Dum-dums, you know, they're like, what are they called?

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.880
 Well, chop-a-chops, but American versions of chop-a-chops.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:55.880
 Oh, lollipops.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880
 Okay.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880
 Fair enough.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.120
 Have you guys heard of the Golden Mole Award?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120
 No.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120
 No?

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
 No.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.640
 Okay, so this was set up in 2016 by NPR, and specifically inspired by the fact that the

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.840
 Golden Mole does have this rainbow shine on its fur and doesn't know it, and they talk

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.760
 of it as being accidental brilliance, the fact that they have no idea it's there.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.920
 They are accidentally brilliant, and so the Golden Mole Award for Accidental Brilliance

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:31.200
 was set up by NPR, and the idea was to award scientists who made accidentally brilliant

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.680
 discoveries when they weren't looking for the thing that they found.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.520
 So, for example, there was a biologist called Shelley Adamo who was trying to study the

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:45.840
 stress levels in crickets, and in order to do that she introduced a predator, which was

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:51.040
 a bearded dragon, and the idea was the bearded dragon was meant to just scare them by being

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.800
 around them, and she could suss out the stress.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:00.680
 But the lizard accidentally passed on a virus which infected the crickets, and the crickets

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.620
 gave the crickets this insane libido, and they started mating, and it was suddenly discovered

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:10.400
 that it was a parasitic aphrodisiac, and they had no idea that this lizard would ever have

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.240
 the ability to pass on something like this to crickets and make them have sex.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.640
 So Accidental Brilliance as a discovery, and it champions all of these great moments for

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:25.000
 scientists who've had these little situations, and it happened in 2016, and it's never happened

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
 again.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 I don't know why they stopped it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.560
 It's such a wonderful idea for an award.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.000
 Oh, I thought you meant the – so the awards never happened again.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.880
 Sorry, yeah, the awards, the Golden Mole Awards, as far as I can tell, have only been awarded

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.720
 in 2016, and then that's it.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.240
 They retired it as a –

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.640
 And do they have any theories about why it's an aphrodisiac?

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.080
 Yeah, 'cause it could be like, you know, if I was there with my partner, and then there's

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.040
 a huge herd of lions coming towards us on the horizon, which I guess is the equivalent.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.840
 I guess you'd think, sod it, might as well, right?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.960
 Get another shag out before we're torn to shreds.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.960
 Is that what they're thinking?

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960
 No.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960
 We don't know.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.560
 I think Dad specified it was a parasitic organism which jumped from the dragon to the

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560
 crickets.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.240
 So that's one theory, is the organism, but is the other theory that you only live once

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240
 at a treat?

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240
 No, no.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240
 You're right, you're right.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240
 It's true.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.240
 Shelly Adamo and her biology degree, we should have the annotations scheme.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.240
 Exactly.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.760
 That's probably why they stopped the award, 'cause everyone just went, well, that's

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760
 a stupid theory.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.840
 Your theory about the parasite, I know you've found an actual parasite in the crickets,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.680
 and I know you can see that it came from the dragon, and I know that you've given it to

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.440
 other crickets, and they do exactly the same thing.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.400
 I know all that, but what about –

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400
 But clearly.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400
 Yeah.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.360
 Clearly, the crickets are just going, carp ADM.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.880
 Get on it, literally.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.760
 This experiment, we didn't quite go into it then, I think, right?

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:50.200
 So, basically, what they had was like a big perspex circular tank with two walls so the

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.600
 sand dunes could go around the circumference of the circle, right, and they could kind

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.720
 of chase each other, and it was like a wind tunnel that sent it round, but the guy who

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:06.400
 did it was called Carol Batcik, or Carol Batcik, and he works at Cambridge University,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.000
 and the reason that he did this experiment is he was just looking at one sand dune going

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.360
 around his thing, and he's thinking, "This is boring."

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:22.800
 It's taking ages to get any kind of data, and so what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.880
 to double my capacity and put two sand dunes in, and then I could get twice as much data.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.920
 I'm just going to do that, and then when he did that, it started a new experiment that

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.320
 he hadn't intended to do, which was to see how the two interact with each other.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:43.160
 Do you think, when he proposed that, people said, "You're Batcik crazy," because his

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.120
 name is Batcik, which sounds like, "Yes."

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.280
 I thought of it immediately when you said "Batcik," and then your explanation was

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.560
 so good, but I didn't realise it would be that long, and so gradually, that became

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.920
 less of a point in making the joke. It's good you've shown us your workings.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.680
 Yeah, and it's nice that you held onto it. I was thinking it's important to explain

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:12.360
 why you don't get a laugh when you don't. His name sounds like a colloquial term for

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.520
 COVID, really. Batcik. We should all just say we're Batcik.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.240
 That's just more catchy.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:27.560
 Kat, if I wasn't going to cut out these joke out. In 2005, Alaska Zoo had an elephant,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:33.880
 which was very ... She was kind of overweight because she was in captivity. She couldn't

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.760
 walk. So they had a problem here. So how would you solve that?

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.520
 You would give her a treadmill. Exactly. They built the first ... As far as I can tell,

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.840
 the only ever world's elephant treadmill. Oh my goodness.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:54.400
 They got a company which does heavy-duty conveyor belts for mining, and they put that together,

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:02.520
 22 feet long. They could support this 4,000-kilo elephant. This was September 2005. The headline

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.000
 was "Now to get the elephant on the treadmill." The next headline from the same website was

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.720
 "Elephant Scorns Her Treadmill." She hated it. She never got fully onto it once.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.280
 I can kind of empathize with that. Everyone hates treadmills, don't they?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.240
 And she was later moved to a sanctuary in California. But guess what happened to the

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:31.920
 treadmill? It was used for different animals. My spot, like 5,000 of them.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:40.880
 So kind of close, in a way. It was bought by a dog musher for his whole dog team.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.280
 That's great. God, that's a fat dog you've got. I don't know how that's managing to run

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.080
 across the Arctic. If it's the same weight as an elephant ...

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.800
 No, it's a whole pack of dogs. No. It's a pack of dogs because it's a

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.320
 22-foot-long one. It's a pack of dogs that makes sense, not one obese dog that they were

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:05.520
 trying to bring the weight down. They had one particular one, a Russian mission, actually.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.040
 So this is after the fall of the Soviet Union. They kept hurling probes at Mars.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.360
 The Mars 96 Russian mission was carrying 200 grams of plutonium, and it was going to use

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.640
 it as a power source, but obviously an incredibly radioactive element.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:24.440
 And it messed up, as so many of those probes do. And so while it was trying to escape the

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:29.120
 Earth orbit, it failed, and it broke apart. And then there was just this satellite carrying

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:33.640
 plutonium, which would be incredibly dangerous if it broke up anywhere on the planet, that

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.640
 was spinning around around the Earth. And all the countries of the Earth were kind of

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.600
 watching it, like watching a roulette wheel. And at one point, they thought, "I think it's

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:46.080
 going to land in Australia. It's going to land in Australia." And Clinton called up John

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.320
 Howard in Australia and said, "Okay, I'm really sorry. I think you're going to be hit by some

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.320
 plutonium. We'll help you out. Don't worry about it." And then it sort of missed Australia.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.280
 And then the official report went out that it landed in the Pacific Ocean, which was

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:02.840
 weird because about 200 people in Chile said that they'd seen something burn up in the

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.080
 atmosphere and crash into the ground. And they've now sort of admitted that it's probably

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:12.400
 somewhere on the border of Chile and Bolivia. And if you see something, don't do anything

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.400
 with it.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.720
 It's a bit like Pass the Parcel, isn't it? Where it just keeps going around and keeps

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.760
 going around and you don't know when it's going to stop. Like the Earth is just... Or

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.840
 actually, it's more like, do you remember those games where it's like a water balloon

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.640
 and you keep passing it around to everyone and eventually it blows up in your face or

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640
 something?

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640
 No.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.640
 Never done that.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640
 No.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.960
 How has the water balloon exploded in this? Like, is there explosive in the water balloon?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.440
 I think it's in like a piece of plastic or something. I don't really know. You know

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:48.320
 what this is? This is a game which you could buy when I was a teenager or younger and we

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.960
 weren't allowed to have it, so I only saw it in adverse.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.600
 Oh no, wait, I think I remember the adverse because I think in the middle of the water

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.960
 balloon is an unstable isotope of uranium and that might decay at any point which will

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.200
 make the balloon go pop.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.880
 Quickly some stuff on wrestling or not?

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880
 Oh, well, yeah.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.880
 Yeah.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880
 Some funny wrestling nicknames.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880
 Yeah.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880
 Oh, okay.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.400
 There's lots of lists on line of good wrestling nicknames. Jimmy Wang Yang.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.400
 Nice.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400
 I'm out of him.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.400
 No.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400
 Beaver Cleavage.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400
 Amazing.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400
 Beaver Cleavage.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400
 Beaver Cleavage.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:27.000
 Are these desirable attributes for a wrestler? Why do you want a Beaver Cleavage? What even

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.080
 is that? Is there a dam on it?

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.760
 At the time there was a TV show called Leave It To Beaver, apparently. I don't know what

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.720
 it was about, but apparently his name came from that for some reason.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:44.120
 Have you heard of Balls Mahoney? He was another wrestler. His fans would shout, Balls, Balls,

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.920
 Balls, while he punched his opponents.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.720
 Where did he punch them?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:52.440
 And I haven't got that written down, because it feels like a request, doesn't it?

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.320
 Can I just mention the possibly real-life animal whisperer who Dr. Doolittle was based

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320
 on?

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.320
 Yeah.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.600
 So we're actually not sure about this, but his life resembled Dr. Doolittle's in a way,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.920
 and it turns out that it could be that Dr. Doolittle is the same person as Dr. Jekyll

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.160
 and Mr. Hyde.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160
 No way.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160
 Point points.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
 He's three people?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.360
 That's so funny. He drinks one dose of the potion. He turns into Edward Hyde, a psychopathic

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.080
 murderer, but if he drinks two, he turns into a sort of charming animal doctor.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.080
 Yeah, that's right.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080
 Cool.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.880
 But he keeps on mixing up the potions, and that's where the essential property of Dr.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.000
 Jekyll, Mr. Hyde and Dr. Doolittle, the original text, lies.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.960
 Isn't Mr. Hyde like almost an animal creature in himself? So like, he would be able to talk

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.160
 to him, to his animal self?

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:42.640
 Yes, to himself. That's why he had to invent Dr. Doolittle to talk to Mr. Hyde. No, none

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.640
 of that's true, except for the fact that we think both characters are based on a Scottish

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:50.320
 surgeon called John Hunter, who was one of the leading surgeons of the 18th century. He

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.680
 was very famous. And this is just based on similarities in his life. So he really liked

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.960
 animals, and he was also a grave robber. So the grave robber thing is a bit more Dr.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.080
 Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the lucky animals thing is a bit more Dr. Doolittle.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.120
 It's weird how they don't mention the animal talking in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, or they

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:12.200
 don't mention the grave robbing in Dr. Doolittle. It's so weird.

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:19.840
 Different genres, aren't they? But Hunter had over 3,500 animals, and some of them

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840
 were dead.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.000
 Wait, were most of them flies? I mean, narrow it down.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.560
 That would be cheating.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.640
 He had one dog, one horse, and then 3,498 flies.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.000
 He had more good ones than that. He had two leopards, so he lived in Leicester Square,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.240
 and he had two leopards who lived in his garden and once got loose and ended up in a fight

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:45.660
 with some local dogs, and he had to restrain them. He kept a pet bull in his house, which

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.000
 he used to wrestle for fun, which is great.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 All in Central London.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
 Yeah.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
 All in Central London.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.080
 He used to live in, there's a pub that I think is called the Moon Over Water or something

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.240
 like that, which is on Leicester Square, and that was his house. And at the back of

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.680
 his house, he had a massive sort of place where he cut open bodies and stuff like that.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.080
 I think if it's the right person, I'm thinking of, I think it was.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.440
 Yeah, there's that place where he cut bodies and then where he talked to his pet rabbit

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.440
 next to it. It's nice. He actually did keep a lot of bees, so maybe that was where some

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:20.000
 of the cheating came in, Andy. One of his friends explained that he befriended the bees,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:27.040
 and especially the less well-known kind. And this is the guy who might have been Dr. Doolittle.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.840
 And I did read that he died of heart disease that was complicated by syphilis, which he

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:36.680
 may have given himself when he inoculated his own penis in his studies on gonorrhea.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.040
 To get syphilis from yourself is pretty bad, isn't it? That's annoying.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.000
 I mean, that's an excuse, isn't it? When you go home to your wife, she says, "Where did

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.200
 you get syphilis, Robbie? Think quick, think quick, think quick. Oh, I inoculated my own

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200
 penis with gonorrhea."

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:59.520
 Damn it! Where did you get the gonorrhea from? Shit! Trying to get rid of chlamydia. Oh,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520
 God, damn it.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:05.000
 Just one more luffa thing. I found a really fun luffa patent, so I was going through all

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.840
 the patents looking for luffa. It's a word search luffa. So there was one in 1889. This

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.360
 is just when they were taking off. Someone invented the luffa sock puppet, and the idea

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:22.680
 is that luffas full size, they can't get into those hard to reach spots. So behind the ears,

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:26.840
 for instance, and so a little sock puppet luffa was invented, you could scrape behind your

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840
 ears.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840
 Oh, I see.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.120
 Yeah. And similarly, more than 100 years later, what sounds like something very similar

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.080
 was invented. In 1994, there's a patent for a finger-mounted toothbrush. Also a great

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.920
 idea, stick a bit of luffa over the end of your finger.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.400
 Oh, my God. I've seen those.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.320
 Don't they sell those in motorway service stations?

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.320
 Yeah.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.320
 I'm sure I've... There we go.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.320
 That's inspired.

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.320
 Maybe it took off.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.760
 Quite a few times. Yeah, quite a few times I've been stuck and sleeping in a service

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.440
 station, and I've had to get myself one of those toothbrushes.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:04.560
 Your marriage is on the rocks, isn't it? That's incredible.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.800
 It's thought that the patent itself says toothbrushes require a certain amount of dexterity to

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.760
 get in the mouth, and it's easier if you just use your finger.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.960
 But some people will have short fingers and long mouths.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.760
 Come on, Andy.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.400
 I can touch my back too, just about, but...

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:25.040
 Not many people are going to have such short fingers or such long mouths that they can't

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.680
 reach some of their teeth. That's a very small amount of the population.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:33.680
 But isn't the point that the toothbrush, like, if your hands are dirty, your toothbrush is

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:37.000
 clean, whereas if you've got to get to the very back of your mouth, you've been rolling

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.200
 around in a luffa field.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200
 Well, that's true.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.160
 You know, wash your hands, guys. If we've learned anything for the last three months.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:49.160
 I will give you, Andy, that this wouldn't work on crocodiles, for instance, but I agree

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.560
 that most humans are correctly proportioned.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.440
 Or Tyrannosaurus rexes.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440
 So difficult.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.360
 A horse walks into a bar, and the bowman says, "Why the long face?"

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.080
 And the horse says, "It's because I've not been able to clean my teeth for a week because

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.120
 of this new hoof brush I've got."

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.120
 It doesn't work.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.360
 Just while we're talking about sort of other bizarre transportation from the early days,

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.960
 I was looking into the 1920s.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.360
 I found a motorized baby carriage that was used in England.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.400
 This was to get, so that had on the back, a sort of nurse chauffeur who would stand on

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.280
 what was a motorized baby carriage.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.720
 So you can see pictures of it where the baby is laying in a bassinet, and they're standing

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:34.360
 on the back as if on a little platform, and it had an internal engine, which they said

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.520
 was really nice for sort of creating a little buzz and hum.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.200
 You know how babies fall asleep in cars?

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.120
 It's kind of giving it that kind of vibe.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.640
 And it could go up to four miles an hour.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.000
 So people would just be nurses on the back, traveling with their babies.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000
 Yeah.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
 Did the nurse stand on the back?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.680
 Was it like being on a Segway or something?

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680
 Yeah, exactly.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
 Or were they walking?

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680
 Exactly.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680
 They were standing on the back.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680
 Yeah.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680
 Yeah.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680
 When was that done?

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680
 So, yeah.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680
 It was in England.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680
 Sorry, when?

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680
 In the 1920s.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680
 Yeah, 1920s.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.440
 And I found this one other thing, which I think this is one of those prototype things.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440
 We have a photo of it.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:13.920
 I don't think it got anywhere very far, but there was a man in LA who wanted to sit while

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.920
 walking.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.480
 So he wanted transportation to do that.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.360
 So he effectively invented a unicycle, which was instead of, so he sat on a seat, but instead

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:28.440
 of it leading to a wheel, it led to two other legs, that when he spun the pedals, would

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.920
 walk the legs underneath his legs.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.400
 So he was sort of eight foot tall-ish, and these legs, which had proper shoes on, would

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.280
 be walking underneath him, but he would be sitting and pedaling, it's a bit sorry for

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.280
 me.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.280
 And he's pedaling the legs with his own legs.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.280
 Yeah.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280
 Yeah.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.600
 So he's using his legs to pedal some legs that are below him.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:52.200
 So it's all the disadvantages of cycling, but with the pace of walking.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.200
 Yes.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.800
 Basically, all the worst parts of cycling and all the worst parts of walking in one.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:04.540
 What's your why didn't you catch on?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:09.240
 So Mozart, when he came to London, was actually a bit of a disaster, because he was brought

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:13.080
 to London with his sister, Nanel, and his father, and they kind of launched this big

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.120
 promo campaign to make him the sort of superstar child along with his sister.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.320
 And people just didn't believe it.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:22.920
 They just refused to believe that a genius that young could be that talented.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.000
 And so there was a sort of promotional backlash.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.160
 Everyone in the papers was like, "You're a hoaxer, you're a fraudster, can't be true."

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:33.240
 So weirdly, he ended up playing in a pub in London.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.440
 He played for the king initially, and then by the end of his time in London, he was

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.440
 playing in a tavern.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.520
 That's a good open mic night, isn't it?

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.880
 Imagine going on after Mozart.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.320
 Some owls do farming.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:52.160
 They cultivate other animals to eat.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.160
 Did you know this?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.160
 No.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.160
 No.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.160
 You know about the burrowing owl?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.120
 I'm sure you've come across it.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.360
 It burrows on the ground instead of living in trees, like an idiot.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:09.120
 But it has a little burrow, and it takes dung into its burrow and then eats the dung beetles.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:13.960
 So it slightly cultivates dung beetles so that it can have something to eat.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.320
 I don't think it burrows though, does it?

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320
 It steals burrows.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320
 What?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320
 Yeah.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320
 The burrowing owl does not burrow.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320
 It's a big old misnomer.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.320
 Oh my goodness.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
 It nicks other animals' burrows.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.320
 It burrows burrows.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
 It's a burrow burrow.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.760
 It should be called the burrowing owl.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.840
 So it will live in the burrows of prairie dogs or badgers or squirrels.

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:38.200
 Owls never make their own nests, they're very lazy, and they collect all this dung.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.720
 So not only does it nick these people's homes, but then it collects loads of poo and piles

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.000
 it up at the entrance to attract the beetles.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.520
 I think it's quite a clever idea, isn't it?

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.000
 Because if someone steals your burrow and then you go and try and get it back, but they

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.240
 filled it with poo, you're probably like, "All right, fine, you can have it."

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.240
 Fair enough.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240
 Yeah.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.000
 There is one other owl which does this, which is, I haven't found too much more evidence

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
 of this.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.320
 I've only got a little bit, but it's the little owl, which I can only assume based on its

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.800
 name is absolutely massive, and it stashes meat and then supposedly grows maggots from

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800
 the meat.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800
 Really?

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.520
 And then it's put up in the meat for its own food.

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.520
 Yeah.

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520
 Wow.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520
 Because that's more like farming.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.520
 To me, that's more like farming, because the other one is more like fishing for dung

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520
 beetles, isn't it?

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.440
 You put some dung out and the dung beetles come along and you reel them in.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.480
 But this one is actually growing maggots.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.720
 That's like farming.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.720
 That's incredible.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.480
 We should stop propagating the idea that maggots can grow on something.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:44.120
 You know, that idea was debunked about 200 years ago, I think, guys.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:48.420
 The wife, I got this lion's corpse in my living room and I'm just waiting to get the bees

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.420
 out of it.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.000
 What a niche joke about taking that.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.160
 You're going to have to look up golden syrup cans to get that, everyone.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:05.520
 During World War II, the BBC banned pericomos deep in the heart of Texas during work hours,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.480
 so you weren't allowed to play it from nine to five.

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.800
 And the reason was that it's got a little bit where people clap along and they were

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:17.440
 worried that people who are working in ammunition plants might clap and drop the bombs.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:19.440
 That was amazing.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:24.760
 I mean, was it a case that if you dropped a bomb, it exploded?

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.320
 Because if so, I think they need a better health and safety on the bombs.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320
 You're right.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.760
 It doesn't feel like that would happen.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.680
 Another ammunition factory has exploded based off one person dropping a thing.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:39.720
 I suppose, probably, it was just that it was distracting the workers rather than they might

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.720
 blow themselves up.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720
 I don't know.

00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:45.160
 I think bombs are, you're encouraged not to drop bombs, aren't you?

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.160
 That's, yeah.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.920
 I imagine if I got a bomb that came over from Amazon, I hope on the box it would say, "Do

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920
 not drop."

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920
 Yeah.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.640
 Confusing, though, when you're in a plane, actually ready to drop the bomb and you see

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.280
 that little label on the side.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:07.600
 Yeah, before Champagne came to the world, before Dom Perignon started selling his Champagne,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.200
 we always drank Peri and that was, it was fizzy, basically, I mean, baby Champagne's

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200
 a bit like Champagne.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.600
 It's like almost the same thing and we were drinking it 150 years before Champagne was

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600
 invented.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.960
 It used to be one of the main drinks.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.640
 Dom Perignon, right?

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640
 Brilliant.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.680
 That was a cool pie fact the other day, sorry for the tangent, just very quickly, but pie,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:40.240
 if you look at it in a mirror, it's 3.14.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.240
 Spells pie.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.240
 Yeah.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240
 Yeah.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240
 Well done.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240
 It's good.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240
 It's great.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.240
 Welcome to the party.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.240
 It's exciting, isn't it?

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240
 I don't know that.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.720
 I remember the first time I learned that, yeah.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.720
 Yeah, me too.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.720
 It was quite a day.

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.720
 I'm sorry.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.960
 We were just talking pie and mirrors and I brought something completely relevant.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960
 Four backwards.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960
 Four backwards.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.400
 Oh, I guess it looks a bit like a pie.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400
 Yeah, I see it now.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.400
 We love it.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.880
 I think we're just saying that we, because you sort of like sometimes have seen that,

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.800
 done that in school and been really excited by it when you're 11.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.080
 I'm just excited that you're having that moment now.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.520
 Well, I went to a Steiner school.

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.520
 Yeah.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:23.320
 If you put the number 58,008 into a calculator and turn it upside down, spells out boobs.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.520
 Get out of, no, I didn't know that one.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:26.520
 I didn't know that one.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.160
 I'm all over boobs and boobless and boobies.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.000
 They teach boobs at the Steiner schools.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
 They do.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
 That's what we got.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.200
 Do you know the saying bringing owls to Athens?

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.200
 Yeah.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.560
 It's like bringing coals to Newcastle.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.560
 Yeah.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.960
 It's a much classier version of bringing coals to Newcastle because the owl was the emblem

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960
 of Athens.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:44.960
 Yeah.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.960
 And so, yeah.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.600
 I say bringing some of us to Tula.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.600
 Do you?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.640
 It's like bringing some of us to Tula.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.540
 That's just another version of that.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:32:00.120
 I don't know where Tula is, and I'm not 100% of what a Samovar is either.

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.720
 I thought you were talking Latin, but I've just realized that that's it.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.560
 I think it's in Southern Russia.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.560
 I don't know.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.560
 I actually don't know where Samovar is either.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:10.560
 Might be in Georgia.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560
 Where Tula is.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.560
 I think Samovars are everywhere.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.760
 Don't remember anyone who's bought a Samovar.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:20.760
 I think what is clear is that I'm using this phrase, which I don't understand at all.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.140
 There were some happy endings in P.T. Barnum's acts, right, so there were a few nice stories.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.660
 There was a woman called Katie Brumbach, who became known as the Great Sandwina, who was

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.660
 just amazing.

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.380
 I actually can't believe she existed, so she was a famous strong woman.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.700
 She came from a circus performing family and she trained to be strong from an early age.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.300
 And she beat Eugene Sandow in a fight.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.260
 So Eugene Sandow, I actually don't think we've ever mentioned him, but he was the champion

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.740
 strong man of the 19th century.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.920
 He was like the first strong man, wasn't he?

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.720
 You know, if you ever see pictures of these kind of really muscly people holding up barbells,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.600
 he's basically what they're all based on.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:03.920
 Yeah, I think the actual trophy for the Mr Olympia is based on his body.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.040
 Yeah, he's the father of modern bodybuilding.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040
 Wow.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040
 There you go.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.480
 Well, it should have been this lady, the Great Sandwina, because in 1902, she'd heard all

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:16.880
 this chat about Eugene and she did an act where she'd call men up from the audience and

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.300
 invite them to fight her, and they all thought they could beat her and none of them could.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.460
 And Eugene Sandow fought her, or they actually had a competition to see who could lift the

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.420
 biggest weight, and she won.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.660
 So there was a 300 pound weight, which is like a 22 stone man.

00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.620
 Like if you're that overweight, there's a documentary about you, kind of level.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.300
 And she raised that up above her head, I think, with one arm, and Eugene couldn't even get

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:41.460
 it up like over his chest.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.780
 That is really amazing.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.600
 It's unbelievable because you can imagine being able to beat someone in a wrestling

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.120
 match because you have different skills or something, but lifting weights is like literally

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.560
 just muscle mass, isn't it?

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.640
 Really, that's all it is.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640
 So, wow.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640
 Yeah.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.600
 She met her husband after kicking his ass in a wrestling ring.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.480
 He was one of the people who accepted the challenge to try and fight her, and his memories

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.720
 are basically walking into the ring and then nothing, and then blue sky above him.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.680
 So she knocked him out, and they fell in love afterwards.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.740
 And yeah, she had a loving relationship with him.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:15.740
 Yeah, 52 years.

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:19.540
 I wonder how much he had in the decision.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.340
 How much he had.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:27.480
 I do, yes, I don't think, yeah.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.540
 Just one more thing, and we probably won't use this, but it's so interesting, I just

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540
 want to say it.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:39.180
 And that is that, one more thing is that skates, you know, the fish, they use incubators on

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180
 their eggs.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:44.520
 So they lay eggs, like some fish, like sharks for instance, they also do it.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:49.380
 They lay these things called mermaid's purses, which are essentially their eggs.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:54.700
 And the skates, they intentionally put their eggs next to hydrothermal vents, which is a

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.000
 bit at the bottom of the ocean, where heat comes out, like volcanic heat.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.320
 And they deliberately, they don't put it directly next to it, because it would boil the eggs.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.120
 They put it just the right distance away, that it accelerates the speed in which the

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.900
 eggs kind of grow.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.900
 That's genius.

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.740
 And so they have their own artificial incubation, even though they're fish.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.340
 And if you have left it a little bit too close, then you can just do the old take the top

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:25.580
 off egg and soldiers, soft boiled egg.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:30.140
 What would you dip in if you are in the water, you'd have to get some sort of passing shrimp?

00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:34.980
 Your soldiers, your bread's going to be soggy, isn't it?

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:38.760
 I always think, so there's been this debate about whether we need sharp knives, like pointed

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.040
 knives at all now.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:49.960
 And this is the point that I think, literally on a weekly basis, amazingly, you can't believe

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.720
 you're using this as an excuse to bring up this argument again.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:58.760
 You've cut it out every time, James, and if you keep cutting it out, keep reading it up.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.360
 So here's the debate listeners, please take your votes.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:06.940
 Still, we don't really need the pointy end of sharp knives because we don't really use

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.940
 that.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.940
 We use the sharp bit.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:09.940
 But when do you use the point?

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:15.220
 Now, James, weirdo James, shoves the pointed end into his tomatoes to cut them up.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.620
 What I say is just use a serrated knife.

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:22.980
 Well, you know what, literally yesterday, I was stabbed someone with a pointed knife.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:23.980
 I know.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.060
 I was cutting some sourdough bread and I stabbed it before I did the cut.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.600
 And I thought Anna would not approve of this.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.080
 There is a pair called a stinking bishop.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.720
 Do you know that one?

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.720
 No.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.720
 Is that related to the cheese?

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:41.720
 Yeah.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:42.720
 Exactly.

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.720
 So those two things are related.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.720
 And how are they related?

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720
 Same bishop.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.720
 Like, poor guy.

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.720
 Poor, stinky old bishop.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:48.960
 Kind of, but not really, though.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960
 Okay.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:37:04.020
 So you often eat, if you're in the 1970s, apple and cheese on a stick.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.020
 You do?

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.020
 Yeah.

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.020
 So is it related to that?

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.600
 No, it's not that.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:13.980
 It is that stinking bishop cheese is made with peri that's made from the stinking bishop

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.980
 pear.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.540
 And that's how it gets its name.

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.540
 Oh, cool.

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:18.940
 Well, the pear came first.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:23.480
 The pear came first and you make some peri, some alcohol out of it, and then you steep

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:29.420
 the milk and the cheese in that stuff and it helps the bacteria grow and that's how

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:30.420
 you get your cheese.

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.140
 That's very, very cool.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.520
 There was a story as well about a guy who accidentally swallowed one of those iPhone

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.520
 head pot.

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.720
 I'm wearing one right now.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720
 These new earphones.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.720
 I noticed you're only wearing one, Dan.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.720
 Where's the other?

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.120
 I am that guy.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:47.120
 We'll see in two to three days what's happened to the other one.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.500
 Yeah, so he swallowed it and then you can do a tracker thing where it can locate your

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:52.500
 headphone.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.660
 I've not actually used that yet.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:38:00.080
 And apparently he says heard the beeps from within and he passed the headphone and it's

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.940
 still worked and it still had 40-ish percent left on it by the time it came out.

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:05.940
 No way.

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.940
 That's amazing.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.340
 That was not an Apple product then, surely.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.660
 They were offering trips to go and see the Titanic recently, I think.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:19.000
 In fact, there was supposed to be a tourist thing this year, which I imagine is not happening

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
 anymore.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.440
 But this is Stockton Rush, is this guy who's, I think he's like the CEO, a guy called Stockton

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.440
 Rush.

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.320
 He's the CEO of something called Ocean Gate Expeditions and he's offering tourists week

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.000
 long trips to go down in submersibles to visit the Titanic.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.120
 And it's the first time since this couple got married that they've offered it to anyone.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.920
 So they used to until I think about 2012.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.740
 And each seat cost $105,000, which is exactly the inflation-adjusted price of a first-class

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.900
 ticket on the Titanic.

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.900
 So that's nice.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.900
 Wow.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.060
 Or it did initially and he liked that sort of symmetry.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.700
 But then he actually had to raise the price because he realized that it wasn't expensive

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.980
 enough.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.180
 I never realized it was that expensive to go on the Titanic.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:05.140
 That's an incredible amount of money to go.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.260
 It's unbelievable, isn't it?

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.260
 Yeah.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:09.260
 Yeah, that's huge.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.260
 First-class, I guess.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:16.000
 Yeah, I know what you mean, but a hundred grand to go on a boat.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
 Mad.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.280
 It's not just, James, it wasn't just a boat, it's not just going out on your mate's boat.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.920
 It was the boat.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.440
 Anyway, it had to be postponed in this trip.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:31.640
 First of all, because it's supposed to leave from the coast of Canada and it's a Norwegian

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.520
 ship that he's like got to take these tourists out in so they can go down to the Titanic.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.400
 And there's all those weird shipping rules.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.340
 So Canada suddenly said, "Oh, wait, your ship's going to be flying a Norwegian flag.

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.620
 You're not allowed to leave our coastal waters flying a Norwegian flag."

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.620
 So he's put hundreds of thousands of dollars into this expedition.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.940
 And then there's a flag issue, which Shadi Mani had to postpone.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:54.420
 Take your float down.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.420
 What's his problem?

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.100
 I would have thought, "Just repaint it.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.000
 Paint a maple leaf on top of it."

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.380
 I've got a feeling that the rules are a bit more complicated than that, Dad.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.420
 I think when you have a flag of a country, there might be some paperwork to fill in rather

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.000
 than just going, "Fuck it, I'll put a different flag up."

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.000
 I don't know.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.600
 Sometimes the simplest solution is the one that's disregarded.

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.200
 I'll give him a Zoom call, I'll consult.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:18.200
 Where's Wally Books?

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.200
 Yeah.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.880
 You know those things where he's in different parts of the page and it's a very busy page?

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:30.560
 They are based on a German trend called Vimal Builder Books, which is literally a teaming

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.200
 picture book.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.240
 And the idea of those was originally you would have a picture with loads of stuff happening

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.700
 in all the different parts of the page, and it would be a child's job to make stories

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.820
 up about all the different people who are living in the different parts of this page.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:50.380
 So it's like a really creative way of teaching children how to use their imaginations.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380
 Yeah.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.380
 Isn't that cool?

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:53.380
 That's great.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.380
 That's cool.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:55.380
 Wow.

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.380
 So we've dumbed down.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.380
 Where's Wally?

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.340
 Well, we've tripled dumbed it down because we think they come from paintings by Bosch and

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.340
 Breugel.

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.820
 And you know those amazing pictures like the Garden of Earth doing lights or whatever it's

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.880
 called, where there's just stuff happening everywhere, it's kind of based on those.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880
 Cool.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:11.440
 And then we just looking for some idiot with a stripy jumper.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:15.720
 And sometimes there are loads of other people wearing stripy jumpers in the same page.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.720
 It's so crazy.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.800
 It's why they are at the beach if they're wearing stripy jumpers, it doesn't make any

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800
 sense.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.240
 In real life, Wells Wally at the beach would be really easy because he's the only one

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.240
 in a jumper.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240
 That's true.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240
 That's true.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240
 Where's Wally?

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.060
 The master addition, which is where's Wally?

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.120
 Newest addition.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:40.740
 Very popular in Germany, though.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.900
 My favourite animal that lives on sand dunes is the Saharan silver ant.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.900
 And that's because this is one of the fastest ants in the world, maybe the fastest ants

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.060
 in the world.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.260
 It's so fast.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:42:00.880
 It can run at 855 millimetres per second, which, believe me, in the ants world is super

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:01.880
 fast.

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.920
 I can run at 855 millimetres per second just about.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.920
 Yeah.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.600
 Well, can you run 108 times your own body length in a second?

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600
 No.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600
 I don't think I can.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600
 Yeah.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600
 Exactly.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.160
 He does 47 strides per second.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160
 Wow.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160
 Okay.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.840
 So that is Michael Johnson, the old runner who he had a kind of weird way of running

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.740
 where he did lots more strides than normal people.

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:29.400
 And even he only did four steps per second.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.340
 And this guy did 47 per second.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.180
 So it's like, you know, those cartoons where you just see the legs going around in a circle.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.340
 It's a bit like that.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.060
 I didn't know Michael Johnson did that.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.900
 Did it look really weird when you watched it?

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:40.900
 Yeah.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:41.900
 Did it look like he had an extra pair of legs?

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.740
 He was famously, he ran in a different way than anyone else.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:49.700
 So he ran really upright and he moved his legs really, really quickly.

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:55.040
 But presumably in really small, smaller strides, like a ballerina tiptoeing across the stage.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.040
 Smaller strides.

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.040
 Yeah.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.960
 Can I ask a question about Michael Johnson, for example, if, okay, if you came up with

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.840
 a new way of running and let's say, let's just say that you came up with a way of doing

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.880
 forward cartwheels or forward rolls that happened to be faster than any other sprinter

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.360
 on the planet, would you be allowed to do that?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.880
 Or is it easy to use your hands?

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880
 It's a possibly flop.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880
 Isn't it?

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.080
 Oh, you mean if can you use your hands to run?

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.080
 Yeah.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.180
 That's a bit different than what I was thinking.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:24.420
 If you ran on all fours, like kids sometimes do.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420
 Yeah.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.620
 Actually, no, I think you can because if you're in a running race and you fall over, like

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:34.260
 let's say you're in a steeple chase race where you're jumping over hurdles.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.860
 If you fall over and your hands touch the floor, you're not disqualified, are you?

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.860
 No, you're not.

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860
 Yeah, that's right.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:45.700
 So, yeah, I imagine if you want to run with all four arms and legs, like a race horse,

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.700
 I think you'd be able to.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:52.480
 I'm sure I've said before that I invented a new way of doing the walking race, which

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:56.320
 I believe is faster than the way that they do it in the Olympics.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.820
 Wow.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:04.520
 It's extremely long strides and you move your hips a lot and I reckon it's faster than

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.120
 anyone can walk in their style.

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:12.640
 But if I do it for about 10 seconds, I get unbelievably tired.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.460
 I think it might just not be very energy efficient, but it might be just that I'm terribly

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.460
 unfit.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.780
 So, you know, it's out there.

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.780
 If any professional walkers want to hit me.

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.060
 Is there a 100-meter walk sprint?

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:31.700
 Unfortunately, the shortest distance they go, I think, is about 20 kilometers.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.660
 And the longest distance I've ever gone in this technique is about 20 meters.

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.620
 We could set it up though.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.780
 Why don't we set up when we're all allowed back together, you versus Andy, Andy Cartwheeling

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:49.440
 his way to the end, a new walk sprinting your way to the end, and Dan and I all being popcorn.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.120
 It's a shame if you have invented that new kind of run, like Michael Johnson has, that

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.200
 you have to expose it.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:59.040
 There's no way that you can wear like a box around your leg so that everyone's just going,

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.040
 "What's he doing?

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.760
 Yeah, we can't work out.

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760
 Why is he so much faster?"

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.440
 Well, you could wear a sarong.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.840
 Maybe that's what David Beckham was doing, because he was a very fast footballer, wasn't

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:09.840
 he?

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:13.540
 Maybe Michael the sarong to conceal his trick of doing seven more steps a minute than anyone

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:14.540
 else.

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:19.220
 But I think the problem is, if you're wearing a sarong in the Olympics and you're running,

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:25.780
 then people will just assume you're on a unicycle.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.900
 And so, yeah, they probably won't like it.

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:28.900
 Right.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.900
 That's what they'd assume.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.940
 You'd have to ritually take the sarong off at the end of the race to show that you had

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.840
 no wheels under there.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.620
 It's not, you should just ban it altogether, sarongs, I think, in running races.

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:39.620
 It's not worth the hassle.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:40.620
 Yeah.

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.040
 It's quite a tight wrap as well, a sarong, probably on a long skirt.

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:48.880
 It's quite thick material, you're rubbing the face in it by.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880
 You need the massive box.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880
 That's what you need.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880
 A massive box.

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880
 Covering everything below the waist.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.880
 Yeah.

00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.320
 Does anyone have anything else on sand dunes?

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.240
 No.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:04.520
 I got one fact about pairs, which I think is quite amazing.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.680
 Do you know the phrase, "It's all gone pear-shaped"?

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:08.680
 Yeah.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.680
 Yeah.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:14.380
 That phrase dates back to 1983, is the earliest we have an example of, and it was used in

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.160
 the Navy.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.180
 And the phrase, "It's all gone peat-tongue," is only four years younger.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180
 Wow!

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:29.640
 So, "It's all gone peat-tongue" was from 1987, and "It's all gone pear-shaped" is from

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:30.640
 1983.

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.640
 That four-year difference.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.640
 It's amazing.

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.640
 Isn't it great, that?

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:34.640
 Yeah.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.640
 You would have thought.

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:40.360
 What's so wrong in the '80s that there are so many other ways of saying this is screwed

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.360
 up?

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360
 Thatcher.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.360
 Thatcher.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.360
 There you go.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:49.240
 Another time that a pair was an insult was this amazing period in 19th-century France

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.840
 where it became this massive political meme.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.560
 This is the coolest thing.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.240
 So, this is in the 1830s.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:02.240
 There was a famous caricaturist and political satirist called Charles-Philippin, Charles-Philippin.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.760
 And he started publishing offensive pictures of the king, and he was taken to court for

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.960
 insulting the king.

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:09.880
 And he said, "How do you guys know that's the king?

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:12.720
 Look, I've even put someone else's name underneath it."

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.320
 And they were like, "Well, it looks like the king."

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.480
 He said, "Oh, well, that's, you know, you've made that assumption, not me."

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.480
 Oh, well, I'm great.

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.720
 And then to demonstrate you could interpret anything as looking like the king, he drew

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:28.240
 a pear, and then he showed in four pictures how a pear could gradually transform into the

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240
 king's face.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.400
 And anyway, which was a pretty cocky thing to do in court, and he didn't get away with

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:36.800
 it, and he was sent to prison for a while, but this became a meme for the king.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:41.000
 So, like, all these caricaturists and all these magazines published pictures of pears,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.360
 and that was a byword for how crap the king was.

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.800
 And it was really hard to prosecute because they're just drawing pears.

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.680
 And eventually they cracked down on the pear image.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.320
 And so what this guy did was he started writing, so at one point they were told to stop drawing

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.480
 pears, and if you had a publication and you'd had like a legal thing saying you weren't

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.400
 allowed to publish something, you had to publish that legal thing to be like, "Sorry,

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.400
 we did wrong."

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:09.360
 So he published what they'd been told by the government, but he published the text in

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.440
 a pear shape.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.440
 Which looks really beautiful.

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.440
 Brilliant.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.440
 It's a real slap in the face.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440
 Wow.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440
 So good.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.440
 He's asking for trouble, that guy, isn't he?

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.440
 Yeah.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.440
 I guess.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.440
 He is.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.600
 And he was shut down.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:28.560
 Another pear that looks like another sort of leader is the Yu mini Buddha pears.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.880
 Have you seen those?

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880
 No.

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880
 No.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.880
 This is a guy in China.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:33.880
 He's a farmer.

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.720
 He spent years and years doing this, where he's been creating molds, where the pear grows

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.520
 inside the mold.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.760
 And for years he's been trying to get it to look like a baby Buddha.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.440
 And he's succeeded.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.800
 He's got 10,000 of them, which he brought over to the UK.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.440
 And you look at them and it's like a little squished-together Buddha, but it's a pear.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.840
 And it's, why?

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.120
 I imagine it's easier to sell a pear that looks like a Buddha than a pear that looks

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120
 like a pear.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120
 It's just cool.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120
 It's just cool.

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.640
 And actually, you know those soda and alcohol bottles where you get a pear inside?

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:07.640
 Oh, yeah.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.440
 I was trying to work out how do you get the pear inside.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:16.720
 And the answer is you grow the pear inside the bottle from the tree.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720
 So that's how they do it.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.080
 They hang the bottle upside down and they weave through the branch and they allow it

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:24.080
 to grow inside.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.080
 Then they cut that off.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:27.240
 And that's how they get it in there.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.740
 That's crazy.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.920
 I didn't even know about the phenomenon of pears in bottles, but I'm still excited to

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.440
 know about how they do.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.440
 That's so cool.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.440
 Yeah, it's not massive, but you do see them occasionally.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.280
 And they do the same thing with ships in bottles, don't they?

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:47.120
 You get the tree and then you put the branch in.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120
 He should call those pears.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.120
 I can't believe it's not butter.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120
 Yes.

00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.120
 Beautiful.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.120
 Beautiful.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:50:05.120
 Well, that's the kind of thing we cut out.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.200
 Okay, that's it.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.840
 That is all of our collection of offcuts for this week.

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.240

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640
 I do.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:24.280
 It's bulls, bulls, bulls.

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.600
 Wow, really committing to that.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.960
 It wasn't worth the commitment.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.960
 It's @andrewhunterum.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.960

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.540
 (upbeat music)

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.120
 (upbeat music)
