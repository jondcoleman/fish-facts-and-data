00:00:00,00:00:04,Hi guys! I just wanted to let you know before we start this show that one of our
00:00:04,00:00:08,"numbers is doing a comedy show and that- Is it me, Ana?"
00:00:08,00:00:11,"It's not you James, you know about that, wouldn't you?"
00:00:11,00:00:14,"No, it's me. It's not Dan. What? It's not you."
00:00:14,00:00:17,"Is it you, Ana? It's not me. Oh, that I'm not interested."
00:00:17,00:00:20,"I have no interest either. Yeah, that's going to put people off now. They've realized it's not me."
00:00:20,00:00:26,It is Andrew Hunter Murray. Whoo! Keeps on having to add new shows to his
00:00:26,00:00:31,"bloody comedy show because people keep on filling them out and- All right, sorry again."
00:00:31,00:00:37,"Just read the card of God. We were to watch it the other week, didn't we?"
00:00:37,00:00:40,"Yeah, it's really, really funny. It's so funny. It's really, really good."
00:00:40,00:00:45,"Yeah, it's great. It's really funny. It's full of characters. You get to see Andy"
00:00:45,00:00:51,being the stupidest version of himself doing. He's a rhyming librarian lady at a book club.
00:00:51,00:00:56,He's a Samba man. It's amazing. Spoilers. So many spoilers.
00:00:56,00:01:00,"No, it's excellent. It's absurd and insane and hilarious. You should go and see it."
00:01:00,00:01:07,It's on the 27th and the 28th of March at the Soho Theatre. It's at 7.45. Go and see it now.
00:01:07,00:01:11,"Well, don't go and see it now. Go see what it's up."
00:01:11,00:01:14,"Also, before we begin, you'll notice that James is not here this week."
00:01:14,00:01:18,Sitting in his place is Erika McCallister. Erika McCallister is a friend of ours.
00:01:18,00:01:24,"She works at the Natural History Museum and she is their curator of flies, Diptura."
00:01:24,00:01:28,And she's got a new book out. It's called The Secret Life of Flies.
00:01:28,00:01:31,She took three years to write this book. It's everything that she knows about flies.
00:01:31,00:01:34,And she knows a lot about flies. She knows so much stuff about flies.
00:01:34,00:01:39,"And also, she has no time for people who don't like flies, which is why I wasn't allowed"
00:01:39,00:01:43,on the book. Exactly. So the book's going to be out April 3rd.
00:01:43,00:01:46,It was really exciting to have her on the show. She was really awesome.
00:01:46,00:01:49,And she told us that she was going to make sure she always brought it back to flies.
00:01:49,00:01:52,"And she did, no matter what we were talking about."
00:01:52,00:01:53,"Okay, on with the show."
00:01:53,00:02:14,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast"
00:02:14,00:02:17,coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:02:17,00:02:21,"My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:02:21,00:02:25,"and the Natural History Museum's Curator of Diptura, that means flies."
00:02:25,00:02:29,"It's Erika McCallister. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:02:29,00:02:34,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,"here we go. Starting with you, Erika."
00:02:37,00:02:42,My fact is that the vinegar flies burn is so long that if humans have the same sperm
00:02:42,00:02:49,"to body ratio as the fly, for example, then, Dan sperm would be the size of a sperm whale."
00:02:49,00:02:53,Whoa. Do you feel proud? That's.
00:02:53,00:02:59,"So when you say size, is that the as long as a blue one, as a sperm whale?"
00:02:59,00:03:02,"As a sperm whale. If it was blue one, that'd be quite extraordinary."
00:03:02,00:03:06,"But it's a sperm whale. It's about 120 feet, I read."
00:03:06,00:03:07,Right. Is that right or not?
00:03:07,00:03:10,"Meter, the science. Can you not do a meter?"
00:03:10,00:03:14,"No, no, it's new. No, it's 33 meters. 33 meters."
00:03:14,00:03:16,Yeah. A third of a hundred meters sprinting thing.
00:03:16,00:03:21,So three of Dan's sperm will be able to stretch the length of Usain Bolt's run.
00:03:21,00:03:21,Yes. Yeah.
00:03:21,00:03:24,"That's quite a nice graphic, I hadn't."
00:03:24,00:03:27,Why does that thought process? But thank you.
00:03:27,00:03:29,Why do they need sperm that long?
00:03:29,00:03:31,They don't have a lot of sperm.
00:03:31,00:03:34,"Oh, okay. And they don't go through the teenage years, so they don't waste it."
00:03:34,00:03:38,"And what they do is that because the females are very, very promiscuous."
00:03:38,00:03:42,Okay. And this is all nature that females are designed to be promiscuous.
00:03:42,00:03:45,And we're only doing it for our offspring. It's not for fun.
00:03:45,00:03:46,That's what I tell people.
00:03:46,00:03:51,"And so we originally thought that if there was lots of sperm competition,"
00:03:51,00:03:53,you make loads of it and it was great.
00:03:53,00:03:56,"And actually, what these do is their sperm is so large,"
00:03:56,00:03:59,the actual sperm pushes the other sperm out of the way.
00:03:59,00:04:01,Whoa. I know.
00:04:01,00:04:05,"Pushes them out of the way in the opening, in the genital opening."
00:04:05,00:04:09,It pushes the other sperm out of the way. Yep. They've got quite exciting penises.
00:04:09,00:04:10,Have they? What are their penises?
00:04:10,00:04:12,We don't know what other penises are like.
00:04:12,00:04:15,"Hello. I mean, it depends on species."
00:04:15,00:04:18,"Some of them have got like little comes, some of them have got little whips,"
00:04:18,00:04:20,"they've got little tickling organs, they've got all sorts of things."
00:04:20,00:04:24,"Oh, it's just like a whole and some as shop, but just inside a penis."
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Another thing I read is that this particular fly, vinegar fly,"
00:04:29,00:04:32,has testes which are a tenth of its body weight.
00:04:32,00:04:34,They're enormous because they have to produce this.
00:04:34,00:04:37,So they're not the biggest in comparison to body size and animal kingdom.
00:04:37,00:04:40,The sage bookish cricket gets that 14%.
00:04:40,00:04:43,"And you can look it up. You know, we study this."
00:04:43,00:04:46,"But they do need because when they want to produce this sperm,"
00:04:46,00:04:48,"and it is one at a time that basically it's pumped out,"
00:04:48,00:04:51,not like the thousands that Dan weights.
00:04:51,00:04:55,"Yeah. So Dan's testicles here,"
00:04:55,00:04:56,Dan have estimated your weight.
00:04:56,00:05:00,"I think they'd be well over a stone, maybe seven and a half kilos."
00:05:00,00:05:02,So as you're lining up next to St. Bolts.
00:05:03,00:05:07,"Yeah, bouncing along on them like space hoppers."
00:05:07,00:05:11,Wow.
00:05:11,00:05:15,I also got a real image of your sperm that I want someone to draw
00:05:15,00:05:18,with just very thick rimmed glasses and weird...
00:05:18,00:05:22,"If you're listening to this, do not draw that and send it to at Shriberland."
00:05:22,00:05:22,Don't do it.
00:05:22,00:05:25,And this is the other thing about it.
00:05:25,00:05:28,"So supposedly the sperm are, they're like balls of twine."
00:05:28,00:05:30,"Yeah, no, they're really, really thin."
00:05:30,00:05:33,So it looks like someone has just given a cat a load of wool.
00:05:33,00:05:34,Right.
00:05:34,00:05:36,And then somebody's coming in and quickly had to tidy up
00:05:36,00:05:38,and shoved it all back to get it.
00:05:38,00:05:41,It's always the same when the cleaning lady comes out of there.
00:05:41,00:05:49,The guy who I think first found out about the vinegar flight
00:05:49,00:05:50,and their extremely long sperm...
00:05:50,00:05:51,Yeah.
00:05:51,00:05:56,"Scott Pitnik, he has a tattoo of a sperm cell on his arm"
00:05:56,00:05:58,to sort of commemorate this discovery.
00:05:58,00:05:58,That's very cool.
00:05:58,00:06:01,He's put up photos of it online and it is all over his arm.
00:06:01,00:06:03,"Well, it have to be."
00:06:03,00:06:05,"Well, it is the length of his arm."
00:06:05,00:06:07,It's a huge tattoo.
00:06:07,00:06:09,"Although he should have made it the length of, you know,"
00:06:09,00:06:10,"as we've said, proportionally."
00:06:10,00:06:12,"Well, the length is probably the length of the sperm now."
00:06:12,00:06:12,"Yeah, the sperm now."
00:06:12,00:06:15,"Yeah, so he should have made it running all up and down his body."
00:06:15,00:06:17,"Yeah, he needs 30 metres of it."
00:06:17,00:06:17,Yeah.
00:06:17,00:06:19,I guess he should.
00:06:19,00:06:26,It's true that the way as someone who looks for new species of flies
00:06:26,00:06:28,"as you do at the Natural History Museum,"
00:06:28,00:06:30,is it true that you identify them through their genitals
00:06:30,00:06:32,more than anything else?
00:06:32,00:06:35,"Well, not through their genitals, but hey, because that would be odd."
00:06:35,00:06:38,"But yeah, species descriptions is basically,"
00:06:38,00:06:40,it's always done on male genitalia.
00:06:40,00:06:42,Female genitalia is really similar.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Uh-huh.
00:06:43,00:06:47,So the whole thing about it being a lock and key doesn't quite make sense.
00:06:47,00:06:49,"But the idea now, I have got this great idea"
00:06:49,00:06:53,that we're very into 3D printing and micro-CT scanning.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"We can actually do 3D genitalia, kick glasses, walk through."
00:06:57,00:06:59,We could have like theme parks or fly genitalia.
00:06:59,00:07:00,I think that...
00:07:00,00:07:03,I'm sure the NHM would totally go for a new gallery
00:07:03,00:07:05,of like walks through genitalia.
00:07:05,00:07:08,Is this the thing that you've been pitching in every weekly machine glass?
00:07:08,00:07:10,Any more business before we end?
00:07:10,00:07:11,Could you call it through the p-hole?
00:07:11,00:07:12,Ah!
00:07:12,00:07:16,"Isn't that... So I was reading about, apparently,"
00:07:16,00:07:18,they think the reason it has one big sperm
00:07:18,00:07:23,that it leaves in a packet on top of the women's abdomen
00:07:23,00:07:24,and then she puts it into her genitals.
00:07:24,00:07:28,The reason it's so big is so that it blocks it up like a plug
00:07:28,00:07:29,to what the flies do.
00:07:29,00:07:31,"No, I mean, basically every animal has a plug."
00:07:31,00:07:32,Humans have plugs.
00:07:32,00:07:34,Ars is just a little bit more fluid.
00:07:34,00:07:36,"Oh, yeah."
00:07:36,00:07:38,So the female seminal fluid is the plug
00:07:38,00:07:40,trying to kill all the sperm.
00:07:40,00:07:42,But also the European plugs are slightly different.
00:07:42,00:07:43,They are very.
00:07:43,00:07:46,And you need an adaptor sometimes.
00:07:46,00:07:49,"And so, yeah, so flies go out of their way to try and make these plugs"
00:07:49,00:07:51,and a lot of flies actually use themselves.
00:07:51,00:07:53,So they do practice sexual suicide.
00:07:53,00:07:57,"The male, when he's in cop with the female"
00:07:57,00:07:59,"and he's pumped his sperm up, yeah."
00:07:59,00:08:01,"A lot of them will sacrifice themselves,"
00:08:01,00:08:03,will let the females eat them.
00:08:03,00:08:06,"And then, so she's so busy doing that,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,it's a longer sperm transferral.
00:08:08,00:08:10,So he's got a greater chance.
00:08:10,00:08:11,So he uses him.
00:08:11,00:08:13,So there's a type of bite in midge.
00:08:13,00:08:16,"So basically, when she's in cop and she's facing him,"
00:08:16,00:08:18,"she saw through his eyeballs,"
00:08:18,00:08:20,"releases a digestive enzyme,"
00:08:20,00:08:23,"his insides dissolve, she sucks them up,"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"his body breaks off, snaps, leaves the penis in her,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,she just whips it out afterwards.
00:08:28,00:08:29,Brilliant. Whoa.
00:08:29,00:08:31,"You know when we are parents, as humans,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,talk about the sacrifices they've made.
00:08:33,00:08:35,"Yeah, they made nothing."
00:08:35,00:08:36,No idea.
00:08:36,00:08:39,And my body dissolved by your mother.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"Well, the bush crickets with your massive sperm,"
00:08:42,00:08:43,she will eat his wings.
00:08:43,00:08:44,How come?
00:08:44,00:08:46,"Because he gives us, I think, like, midcop"
00:08:46,00:08:48,to nibble on to keep her there.
00:08:48,00:08:50,Because females basically only care about food.
00:08:50,00:08:52,And then does he have to walk home afterwards?
00:08:52,00:08:53,"No, he can't fly away."
00:08:53,00:08:54,He can't do anything.
00:08:54,00:08:55,"Basically, that's it for him,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,because no other female is going to be interested.
00:08:57,00:08:59,No point in even doing the wingless walk of shame.
00:08:59,00:09:02,It's why I go on any date with a packet of pringles
00:09:02,00:09:03,in either hand.
00:09:03,00:09:05,"It's so, it's a moment only you're honest."
00:09:05,00:09:06,It's so middate.
00:09:06,00:09:08,"I can provide the pringles to them,"
00:09:08,00:09:09,and they'll stay on the date with me for longer.
00:09:09,00:09:11,"Yeah, because you've got to keep the female interested."
00:09:11,00:09:12,There's a whole group of flies
00:09:12,00:09:14,that the females don't even hunt.
00:09:14,00:09:16,And so the males will bring them gifts.
00:09:16,00:09:18,"So the females with feed, they would have sex,"
00:09:18,00:09:19,it was all great.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"But the females finished before the males,"
00:09:21,00:09:22,so the females would just disappear.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"And the males were like, ""But we haven't finished."""
00:09:24,00:09:27,And so the males learned to wrap up their gifts.
00:09:27,00:09:29,So it was like taking a box of chocolates.
00:09:29,00:09:32,So she'd take so much time opening the fly up
00:09:32,00:09:34,that he would have lots of sex.
00:09:34,00:09:36,But it went in the opposite way.
00:09:36,00:09:38,Because then she spent so much time.
00:09:38,00:09:39,"He was like, ""Well, I finished."""
00:09:39,00:09:41,So another group basically stole back
00:09:41,00:09:42,this half-eaten box of chocolates
00:09:42,00:09:45,and re-wrapped it to give it to another fly.
00:09:45,00:09:46,What are they wrapping it in?
00:09:46,00:09:47,A box of livers.
00:09:47,00:09:47,Nice.
00:09:47,00:09:50,"Yeah, it's my favourite kind of wrapping paper."
00:09:50,00:09:53,So some other questions I have about flies while you're here.
00:09:53,00:09:55,"So they flap their wings super fast, right?"
00:09:55,00:09:57,"But like 300 times a second, which I find insane."
00:09:57,00:09:59,But I was reading that some of them have
00:09:59,00:10:01,someone called it a gear box mechanism
00:10:01,00:10:04,where do they have grooves or something
00:10:04,00:10:06,and they can kind of change gear
00:10:06,00:10:09,to make themselves go faster or slower?
00:10:09,00:10:11,They do have that.
00:10:11,00:10:12,But flies probably are the most efficient
00:10:12,00:10:14,and most amazing flies on the planet.
00:10:14,00:10:16,But their vision is what's really important here.
00:10:16,00:10:18,Because they see so much faster.
00:10:18,00:10:21,So we are always at half a second behind real time.
00:10:21,00:10:21,What?
00:10:21,00:10:24,It takes us that long to process what goes on.
00:10:24,00:10:26,"So actually, we're never in the present moment."
00:10:26,00:10:27,Okay.
00:10:27,00:10:28,We're always in the past.
00:10:28,00:10:30,But flies are merely second.
00:10:30,00:10:31,"Millie, mini, mini, like nanos."
00:10:31,00:10:34,So it hints why they do everything so much faster.
00:10:34,00:10:37,"Because so if I, and obviously I'm advocating,"
00:10:37,00:10:38,do not swap them.
00:10:38,00:10:39,"But if we went to swap them,"
00:10:39,00:10:41,they would just see that it's really slow motion
00:10:41,00:10:43,and at the last minute they could just walk out the way.
00:10:43,00:10:45,"So if you do want to catch a fly,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,do it really slowly.
00:10:46,00:10:49,Because then actually it appears like a solid object.
00:10:49,00:10:50,I will.
00:10:50,00:10:51,But I will need you at the end of the first matrix.
00:10:51,00:10:52,Very much like me.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Okay.
00:10:53,00:10:53,Yeah.
00:10:53,00:10:55,"Well, they have to describe that."
00:10:55,00:10:56,It's the soul.
00:10:56,00:10:56,Yeah.
00:10:56,00:10:57,"Well, bullet time."
00:10:57,00:10:58,Bullet time.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"Yeah, bullet time is what they call it in the matrix"
00:11:00,00:11:01,when everything goes slow and mushy.
00:11:01,00:11:03,"Yeah, I should have watched."
00:11:03,00:11:05,Binderman can do that as well as you see in that scene
00:11:05,00:11:07,in Spider-Man and spiders catch flies.
00:11:07,00:11:10,"Ah, but there's flies that eat spiders."
00:11:10,00:11:10,No.
00:11:10,00:11:11,"No, no, no, it is."
00:11:11,00:11:12,And they are so cool.
00:11:12,00:11:14,There's three species in the UK
00:11:14,00:11:16,"and they're called acrycerides, hunchback flies."
00:11:16,00:11:17,And they look gorgeous.
00:11:17,00:11:19,"And the female, she lays loads of eggs,"
00:11:19,00:11:20,but she doesn't lay them.
00:11:20,00:11:23,She's basically got a machine gun as an oviposter.
00:11:23,00:11:26,And so she just rapidly fars out hundreds of these eggs.
00:11:26,00:11:28,"It's like, tch, tch, tch, around the garden."
00:11:28,00:11:30,And she wants them to land on vegetation
00:11:30,00:11:32,that's slightly raised off the ground.
00:11:32,00:11:35,"And then the larvae, I've got like a sucker on the end of them."
00:11:35,00:11:37,And they kind of like stand up in the air
00:11:37,00:11:39,"that they just don't care, waving around."
00:11:39,00:11:40,And then they look down.
00:11:40,00:11:41,"And when a spider runs along,"
00:11:41,00:11:43,they kind of hurl themselves out the spider.
00:11:43,00:11:45,And then they run to the spider.
00:11:45,00:11:46,"By the way, they've got no legs."
00:11:46,00:11:49,"So like inchworm crawling to the spider,"
00:11:49,00:11:51,up the leg into the abdomen.
00:11:51,00:11:52,"Oh, no."
00:11:52,00:11:54,"But what's really cool, if the spider is immature,"
00:11:54,00:11:55,"and spiders can live to up to five years,"
00:11:55,00:11:57,"they would do a little bit of munching,"
00:11:57,00:11:59,and then basically go to sleep and wake up
00:11:59,00:12:00,"when the spider is mature,"
00:12:00,00:12:02,and they can eat the right organs.
00:12:02,00:12:02,Really?
00:12:02,00:12:05,"So they're inside the, they have a nap inside the spider."
00:12:05,00:12:06,For two years?
00:12:06,00:12:07,Three years.
00:12:07,00:12:07,But it's not just spiders.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"So I read that there was, there's a name here"
00:12:10,00:12:11,"that I can't properly pronounce,"
00:12:11,00:12:14,but Lucilla Bufunivora.
00:12:14,00:12:14,Have you heard of that?
00:12:14,00:12:15,Buffy for shorts?
00:12:15,00:12:16,Yeah.
00:12:16,00:12:17,Lucilla.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"Yeah, and so they have a similar larvae thing"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"where they go into a frog's head,"
00:12:21,00:12:23,and then they eat the frog's head from the inside.
00:12:23,00:12:24,And it is amazing.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"If you see the frog's head,"
00:12:25,00:12:26,have you seen the...
00:12:26,00:12:27,"Yeah, I saw the photos."
00:12:27,00:12:27,"Yeah, okay."
00:12:27,00:12:28,"Go and have a look at the images,"
00:12:28,00:12:30,"because it's like completely deformed,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,"like collapsed, it's like..."
00:12:32,00:12:35,Not sure which would be advocating this sort of behaviour.
00:12:35,00:12:36,"With your garden, honestly,"
00:12:36,00:12:38,"if you really knew what was going on in there,"
00:12:38,00:12:40,"it's just like, it's..."
00:12:40,00:12:41,It's disgusting.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"Yeah, and everyone isn't about cute nature,"
00:12:43,00:12:45,"and everything is eating everything,"
00:12:45,00:12:48,ripping limbs off and eating their inside out.
00:12:48,00:12:57,"Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:12:57,00:12:59,and that is my fact.
00:12:59,00:13:00,"My fact this week is that,"
00:13:00,00:13:02,"whenever he got really angry,"
00:13:02,00:13:04,Winston Churchill would throw his teeth across the room.
00:13:04,00:13:07,Whenever...
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Wow, not every single time,"
00:13:09,00:13:11,"but when he got really angry,"
00:13:11,00:13:14,apparently that's when you knew the teeth were coming out.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"So Winston Churchill had false teeth, dentures,"
00:13:18,00:13:20,and he had three sets of them.
00:13:20,00:13:22,"He had a dentist who made them for him,"
00:13:22,00:13:24,"called Derrick Cudlip,"
00:13:24,00:13:27,and Derrick Cudlip specifically made these teeth.
00:13:27,00:13:30,"And so he used to get called into the war rooms,"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"whenever Churchill flung his teeth across the room,"
00:13:33,00:13:34,because they would break.
00:13:34,00:13:36,So he would arrive with a new set of teeth
00:13:36,00:13:37,"to give him to pop back in,"
00:13:37,00:13:39,"and then he would take the old pair,"
00:13:39,00:13:40,and he would go off and he would fix them
00:13:40,00:13:42,while he was gone.
00:13:42,00:13:44,"So he used to break them a lot, Churchill,"
00:13:44,00:13:45,when he got angry.
00:13:45,00:13:47,Some of it was by throwing it against the wall.
00:13:47,00:13:49,The other times was when he was biting too hard
00:13:49,00:13:51,through stress and anger of what was going on.
00:13:51,00:13:54,"And it was so important these teeth to him,"
00:13:54,00:13:57,"because as far as Churchill was concerned,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,part of the major push of winning the war
00:13:59,00:14:01,"was his voice, was him going on the radio"
00:14:01,00:14:03,and saying all these inspiring things.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"So when the call-up came for the dentist to go to war,"
00:14:07,00:14:09,"he tore up the paper and said,"
00:14:09,00:14:11,"""It is more important for the war effort that this man is here,"
00:14:11,00:14:14,looking after my teeth than it is for him to be fighting
00:14:14,00:14:16,"on the front lines."""
00:14:16,00:14:17,"It was his technician, wasn't it?"
00:14:17,00:14:19,"Cudlett was the technician who made it,"
00:14:19,00:14:22,"and then his dentist was so Wilfred Fisch,"
00:14:22,00:14:23,both excellent names.
00:14:23,00:14:27,"So as you say, he thought his speech was very important,"
00:14:27,00:14:28,"and he had a slight speech impediment,"
00:14:28,00:14:30,so he had kind of a list.
00:14:30,00:14:31,And he thought that was a vital part
00:14:31,00:14:33,of how he was going to rally the troops.
00:14:33,00:14:36,And so he made them make specially designed dentures
00:14:36,00:14:36,"that were slightly soft,"
00:14:36,00:14:38,so that he could actually preserve his list.
00:14:39,00:14:42,So that he could make invigorating list-be-speakers that he did.
00:14:42,00:14:42,Amazing.
00:14:42,00:14:43,Yeah.
00:14:43,00:14:44,And you can...
00:14:44,00:14:46,So the reason I know about this is because I read an article
00:14:46,00:14:49,where a few years ago his teeth were auctioned off.
00:14:49,00:14:51,"So someone actually bought his teeth,"
00:14:51,00:14:55,"and it was sold, I believe, by the family of Mr. Cudlett."
00:14:55,00:14:56,"And, uh..."
00:14:56,00:14:56,Yeah.
00:14:56,00:14:57,I can't take that name seriously.
00:14:57,00:15:00,Sorry.
00:15:00,00:15:03,"But the ridicule thing, the guy who bought them,"
00:15:03,00:15:06,he was a collector of Churchill memorabilia.
00:15:06,00:15:08,And he already owned the microphone
00:15:08,00:15:10,that Churchill had made a lot of these speeches into.
00:15:10,00:15:13,And then he had the teeth that went with the microphone.
00:15:13,00:15:16,So he said in a sense he had reunited them.
00:15:16,00:15:18,"I mean, all he was missing was actually wisdom Churchill."
00:15:18,00:15:19,Yeah.
00:15:19,00:15:21,The Guardian had lied about the auctioning of the teeth.
00:15:21,00:15:22,I just have to read it.
00:15:22,00:15:23,We shall bite them on the beaches.
00:15:23,00:15:24,Pretty good.
00:15:24,00:15:25,Very good.
00:15:25,00:15:25,Yeah.
00:15:25,00:15:28,I actually looked up as far as I could
00:15:28,00:15:30,a list of things that had been auctioned off Churchill's.
00:15:30,00:15:32,So there were quite a few things.
00:15:32,00:15:34,His funeral plans were auctioned.
00:15:34,00:15:36,They went for 472 pounds.
00:15:36,00:15:41,A violin made from one of his cigar boxes was also auctioned off
00:15:41,00:15:44,"and a Calgary Stetson, Calboy Hat."
00:15:44,00:15:45,That was auctioned off as well.
00:15:45,00:15:47,I read the thing that was auctioned off.
00:15:47,00:15:48,"It came with a DVD,"
00:15:48,00:15:50,which showed a clip of him putting on the hat.
00:15:50,00:15:54,"Which is kind of sensible,"
00:15:54,00:15:55,because you want authentication.
00:15:55,00:15:58,One thing that of Churchill's that went up for auction
00:15:58,00:16:01,was a file of his blood.
00:16:01,00:16:03,And it was withdrawn from auction
00:16:03,00:16:06,"after the very understandable objections of his family members,"
00:16:06,00:16:09,who said we don't need a file of Winston Churchill's blood going up for sale.
00:16:09,00:16:11,"But it was only put on auction at £300,"
00:16:11,00:16:14,which I think if you're going to do the really gruesome thing
00:16:14,00:16:16,"of putting a file of somebody's blood up,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,at least put it up for £50.
00:16:18,00:16:20,"We were looking into this,"
00:16:20,00:16:21,because obviously you go around the world
00:16:21,00:16:23,and you go into all the nice big cathedrals
00:16:23,00:16:24,and there's an artifact.
00:16:24,00:16:27,"And it's like, okay, I have a finger of Jesus Christ."
00:16:27,00:16:28,"And we're like, brilliant."
00:16:28,00:16:32,And I've now seen God knows how many vials of blood of Jesus Christ.
00:16:32,00:16:33,Really?
00:16:33,00:16:34,"Yeah, and so the scientist of me is like,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"oh, we should just sequence this."
00:16:36,00:16:37,Yeah.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"You know, we can do it now."
00:16:38,00:16:39,We've got the technology.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"And with all the bones and all the artifacts,"
00:16:41,00:16:44,"apparently you can make like four, five Jesus Christ."
00:16:44,00:16:45,But the natural history museum gets--
00:16:45,00:16:46,"No, we haven't got said no."
00:16:46,00:16:50,"No, we don't get said no, so I think."
00:16:50,00:16:51,Could you make your own Jesus Christ?
00:16:51,00:16:53,"Well, this is it."
00:16:53,00:16:55,"Well, no."
00:16:55,00:16:59,So it's not like when you guys brought back the ibex in 2000.
00:16:59,00:17:01,We didn't bring it back.
00:17:01,00:17:01,"No, it wasn't."
00:17:01,00:17:05,"No, no. What else I do? I sort of meant you."
00:17:05,00:17:07,I sort of meant you guys as an all-scientist.
00:17:07,00:17:09,Yeah. Look at the same diptra.
00:17:09,00:17:13,"No, you have to say I'm not doing anything with it."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Well, another Churchill relic is, uh,"
00:17:15,00:17:17,went to auction in 2015.
00:17:17,00:17:19,And that was the stub of one of his cigars
00:17:19,00:17:22,"that he had smoked while in hospital, in his hospital bed."
00:17:22,00:17:24,Times have changed.
00:17:24,00:17:28,"But he, uh, you can get a lot of that out there."
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Cigars of Churchill's, little stubs."
00:17:31,00:17:32,There's plenty of them around.
00:17:32,00:17:33,They keep going on auction.
00:17:33,00:17:35,And the reason is that he never used to finish a cigar.
00:17:35,00:17:37,He used to only smoke them halfway through.
00:17:37,00:17:39,And there's a lot of accounts of Churchill
00:17:39,00:17:41,being very of cutely aware of the fact
00:17:41,00:17:44,that the cigar was his trademark look.
00:17:44,00:17:47,So there's accounts of him as they're pulling up to places.
00:17:47,00:17:48,"Him saying, ""Stop the car."""
00:17:48,00:17:50,"And he'd light up a cigar and say, ""Branding."""
00:17:50,00:17:51,It's all about branding.
00:17:51,00:17:52,You wouldn't say that exact word.
00:17:52,00:17:53,Did he say branding?
00:17:53,00:17:55,It's all about branding.
00:17:55,00:17:57,"That is, in 50 years, that's going to be a Churchill misquote."
00:17:57,00:17:59,And it's going to be your fault.
00:17:59,00:18:00,"Branding, it's all about branding."
00:18:00,00:18:01,It was something like that.
00:18:01,00:18:02,I don't remember what it was.
00:18:02,00:18:04,"He does seem very corporate, though."
00:18:04,00:18:04,"Yeah, exactly."
00:18:04,00:18:07,"I mean, he's worrying about how he speaks and his teeth."
00:18:07,00:18:10,"Yeah. Well, and of course, the thing with his whiskey-drinking way,"
00:18:10,00:18:11,he knew that whiskey was part of his image.
00:18:11,00:18:14,And he massively watered down his whiskey all the time
00:18:14,00:18:15,because he didn't want to be drunk.
00:18:15,00:18:17,But I think that's fair enough.
00:18:17,00:18:19,I think it's good that he wasn't absolutely smashed
00:18:19,00:18:20,all the way through the wall.
00:18:20,00:18:21,"Obviously, that's fine."
00:18:21,00:18:23,But he didn't have to cultivate the whiskey image.
00:18:23,00:18:24,Yeah.
00:18:24,00:18:27,"It's all very, as he wants, as I believe he once said,"
00:18:27,00:18:29,"branding, it's all about branding."
00:18:30,00:18:33,"Just on his cigars, his mum hated the fact that he smokes cigars."
00:18:33,00:18:37,"And she said to him when he was 15,"
00:18:37,00:18:38,"if you knew how foolish and silly you looked doing it,"
00:18:38,00:18:40,you would give up immediately.
00:18:40,00:18:42,"And I just love the idea, because parents always say that"
00:18:42,00:18:44,"when you start smoking and you're 15,"
00:18:44,00:18:45,"they're like, you look like an idiot."
00:18:45,00:18:47,I know you think you look cool.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"And Churchill's mum was saying to him,"
00:18:48,00:18:50,you look like a damn full Churchill.
00:18:50,00:18:53,And she actually paid him to give up smoking.
00:18:53,00:18:54,So he did give up for six months.
00:18:54,00:18:57,I think you've done a really bad public health message there.
00:18:59,00:19:01,"I think then look, he turned out really well."
00:19:01,00:19:02,"Yes, take up smoking."
00:19:02,00:19:03,Take up smoking.
00:19:03,00:19:05,"One day, you two could defeat fascism."
00:19:05,00:19:10,"You said, Dan, about how he thought the speeches"
00:19:10,00:19:13,were a hugely important part of the war effort
00:19:13,00:19:15,"in Maryland, this kind of stuff."
00:19:15,00:19:17,I was reading about the reaction to one of his
00:19:17,00:19:19,"most famous speeches, the Dunkirk one."
00:19:19,00:19:24,So just after the British army had been kicked out of France
00:19:24,00:19:27,"by the Nazis, the speech we shall fight on the beaches"
00:19:27,00:19:32,and in all the other locations at the first draft had it.
00:19:32,00:19:35,"Like it's fill in here, branding, close."
00:19:35,00:19:38,"Anyway, supposedly that reaction didn't,"
00:19:38,00:19:40,the speech did not get a great reaction.
00:19:40,00:19:41,"So when you read it out in the House of Commons,"
00:19:41,00:19:44,"his wife, Clementine, she told a friend that,"
00:19:44,00:19:46,"and I'm quoting here, a great section of the Tory party"
00:19:46,00:19:49,were not behind Winston and had received his speech
00:19:49,00:19:50,even in silent silence.
00:19:50,00:19:54,So lots of the reactions were not actually as good
00:19:54,00:19:55,as we think they were at the time.
00:19:55,00:19:57,"And it was more when the tide of the war turned a bit,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"for example, at about 1942,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,that they've really got a greater reaction then.
00:20:02,00:20:05,Okay. Is it true that he basically just used
00:20:05,00:20:07,Anglo-Saxon words in that speech?
00:20:07,00:20:08,"Oh, I don't know."
00:20:08,00:20:11,Because he really went like patriotic.
00:20:11,00:20:12,"Patriotic, patriotic."
00:20:12,00:20:14,So he tried to use any other words.
00:20:14,00:20:17,"So it's all very solid, old English words."
00:20:17,00:20:19,That is so fascinating.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"Yeah, yeah. Even though they're kind of Germanic"
00:20:22,00:20:24,"in origin, really should have been using"
00:20:24,00:20:26,some nice romance languages like the French.
00:20:26,00:20:27,"That wasn't good, so well."
00:20:27,00:20:33,"So the original speech when Churchill made it wasn't broadcast,"
00:20:33,00:20:35,because the House of Commons wasn't wired for sound.
00:20:35,00:20:36,"And on the radio that evening they said,"
00:20:36,00:20:38,Churchill said these things in the House of Commons today
00:20:38,00:20:39,and then quoted him.
00:20:39,00:20:41,"So where did we get the recording,"
00:20:41,00:20:42,"sorry, of the features script,"
00:20:42,00:20:44,if it wasn't recorded in the House of Commons at the time?
00:20:44,00:20:46,Churchill re-recorded them later on.
00:20:46,00:20:47,No way.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"And in fact, he recorded them after the war was over."
00:20:49,00:20:50,"He's so cool, Pratt."
00:20:50,00:20:52,That is so cool.
00:20:52,00:20:55,He is aware. He's like a barmer getting into
00:20:55,00:20:57,"a recording booth and doing his ""Yes, We Can"" speech again."
00:20:57,00:21:01,"Yeah, well, it was in 1949 that he recorded these."
00:21:01,00:21:04,And these were the ones that were sold by EMI
00:21:04,00:21:05,and I think possibly DACA2.
00:21:05,00:21:08,And they were sold in the States as well.
00:21:08,00:21:10,This is honestly so disappointing.
00:21:10,00:21:12,I reckon I've definitely listened to those at some point
00:21:12,00:21:15,with a bottle of wine and took up really emotional
00:21:15,00:21:17,"and thought, God, it's like I'm right there."
00:21:17,00:21:20,And that's just him sitting in 1949
00:21:20,00:21:22,in a little white business room.
00:21:22,00:21:24,That is so depressing.
00:21:24,00:21:26,It's the experience of hearing them.
00:21:26,00:21:27,It's very emotive.
00:21:27,00:21:28,"And I think when you hear those words,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"you know, we can all remember him saying how he says,"
00:21:31,00:21:32,we will fight them on the beaches.
00:21:32,00:21:34,We actually says we will fight on the beaches.
00:21:34,00:21:35,So there we go.
00:21:35,00:21:36,"Oh, please."
00:21:36,00:21:38,"I mean, even doing it later on as he did,"
00:21:38,00:21:40,he could probably add more emphasis
00:21:40,00:21:42,'cause he knew how it turned out.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"Yeah, so he can really go, hey, look at this bit."
00:21:45,00:21:46,Yeah.
00:21:46,00:21:48,"And everyone's like, wow, you're amazing."
00:21:48,00:21:50,"I've got a funny feeling, guys."
00:21:50,00:21:51,We're gonna win.
00:21:51,00:21:52,I'm gonna be successful in that bit.
00:21:52,00:22:00,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:22:00,00:22:02,And that is Chazinski.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"Yeah, my fact this week is that art galleries"
00:22:05,00:22:08,wedge marbles between paintings and the wall
00:22:08,00:22:10,"so that if anyone tries to steal the painting,"
00:22:10,00:22:12,the marbles fall on the floor and make a clattering noise.
00:22:12,00:22:16,And that's just a classic art gallery anti-theft device.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"Is that a classic, isn't it?"
00:22:19,00:22:20,It is a classic.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"Yeah, so I read this in Salon."
00:22:21,00:22:25,And it was in an article called How to Foil and Art Heist.
00:22:25,00:22:27,And the person who wrote it is someone
00:22:27,00:22:29,who advises museums on this kind of thing and galleries.
00:22:29,00:22:31,And he said he can't name the museums who do this
00:22:31,00:22:33,because they don't want to give away
00:22:33,00:22:35,their really advanced tactics.
00:22:35,00:22:36,"But yeah, apparently this is quite common,"
00:22:36,00:22:37,especially if there are galleries
00:22:37,00:22:39,that have budget constraints.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"He just shoves some marbles, wedge them"
00:22:41,00:22:42,between the painting and the wall.
00:22:42,00:22:44,"And as you can imagine, if a thief tries"
00:22:44,00:22:46,to lift the painting off the wall
00:22:46,00:22:47,"and they go clattering to the ground,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,the thief might scarper.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Yeah, maybe more a trip as they're going away."
00:22:50,00:22:52,"A trip, yeah."
00:22:52,00:22:54,"Outside my flat, when they put the garden gates"
00:22:54,00:22:56,"and they were like, have you have this extra bit"
00:22:56,00:22:59,"on top of the garden gates, which is really flimsy."
00:22:59,00:23:02,"So if someone tries to climb over, that smashes."
00:23:02,00:23:05,"And it's, yeah, so a lot of people eat like,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"""Oh, it's the home alone method"
00:23:07,00:23:09,"of defending your gallery, isn't it?"""
00:23:09,00:23:11,The gallery's also recommend installing
00:23:11,00:23:14,torrentulas around the place
00:23:14,00:23:15,and little cardboard cutouts of people
00:23:15,00:23:17,to look like the gallery's security guards.
00:23:17,00:23:20,"Yeah, just dancing all the time in the winter."
00:23:20,00:23:21,But you wouldn't have torrentulas.
00:23:21,00:23:22,That'd be like the worst.
00:23:22,00:23:24,They can only just flick hairs.
00:23:24,00:23:26,You want to really go for something else in the torrentula.
00:23:26,00:23:27,What'd you go for?
00:23:27,00:23:29,I'd go for a deaf stalker scorpion.
00:23:29,00:23:30,Death stalker scorpion.
00:23:30,00:23:33,"Or a scollopendra, like the big centerpiece."
00:23:33,00:23:34,"Here you go, tipster."
00:23:34,00:23:36,I'd just say they're pretty more aggressive.
00:23:36,00:23:39,I'd love if you were in charge of security.
00:23:39,00:23:40,"I know, it's somewhere."
00:23:40,00:23:41,So good.
00:23:41,00:23:44,I don't have flesh-eating spiders.
00:23:44,00:23:45,They go away in slowly.
00:23:45,00:23:49,These necrotic wounds carried on eat in the public.
00:23:49,00:23:52,"We have lots of problems because obviously in the old days,"
00:23:52,00:23:54,natural history collectors were very obsessive.
00:23:54,00:23:56,"Obviously, we're very normal nowadays."
00:23:56,00:23:58,A lot of people would come in
00:23:58,00:24:00,with various different apparel
00:24:00,00:24:02,to actually go through the collections
00:24:02,00:24:05,and pick out specimens they hadn't got in their own collections.
00:24:05,00:24:09,So this is the era of top hats and things like that?
00:24:09,00:24:12,"So underneath, they would have like foam bases"
00:24:12,00:24:14,"in the top, in the inside of their top hat."
00:24:14,00:24:16,"So they'd go into the collection,"
00:24:16,00:24:17,"stick a load of butterflies in it,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,put that out back over to the account.
00:24:19,00:24:19,Wow.
00:24:19,00:24:21,No way.
00:24:21,00:24:23,And these were collectors who just wanted to steal from them.
00:24:23,00:24:27,"Yeah, there's some very famous cases."
00:24:27,00:24:30,"And there's a lot of people who, I mean, that's wrong."
00:24:30,00:24:32,"But what they did, a lot of them, was even worse."
00:24:32,00:24:35,They took the data of the specimens.
00:24:35,00:24:37,"Now to me, that's like you might as well."
00:24:37,00:24:38,"Oh, and that is ruined."
00:24:38,00:24:39,It's ruined for life.
00:24:39,00:24:40,There's nothing we can do.
00:24:40,00:24:42,"When it was collected away, it is just a dead set."
00:24:42,00:24:45,"So you know what, steal and hopefully we'll get it back one day"
00:24:45,00:24:48,because some child in the family like three generations
00:24:48,00:24:50,almost donated to us.
00:24:50,00:24:52,"But if you take off the data, that's it."
00:24:52,00:24:53,It's dead.
00:24:53,00:24:54,It's double dead.
00:24:54,00:24:56,Why did you take off the shelf of the dead to us?
00:24:56,00:24:58,There's nothing we could do with it.
00:24:58,00:25:01,"Why would they sort of take, they leave the thing behind,"
00:25:01,00:25:02,but they just take the--
00:25:02,00:25:04,"Yeah, you had a very famous person."
00:25:04,00:25:06,Mine's taken.
00:25:06,00:25:08,"He did a very, he did it all the time."
00:25:08,00:25:11,And he also put on different data.
00:25:11,00:25:13,"And it was like, oh, just a mess with you."
00:25:13,00:25:15,"No, was he trying to build up his own collection?"
00:25:15,00:25:16,Yeah.
00:25:16,00:25:18,He was trying to say I've collected all these things.
00:25:18,00:25:21,He was trying to make himself to be the most amazing collector
00:25:21,00:25:23,"at the time, and it was like, oh."
00:25:23,00:25:26,"Yes, and that's why we're very careful about security."
00:25:26,00:25:27,And top hats no longer loud.
00:25:27,00:25:29,"No longer loud, no."
00:25:29,00:25:34,I think I found the most prolific art destroyer
00:25:34,00:25:36,who was not a thief of art.
00:25:36,00:25:39,"It's a woman called Mrs. Brightviser,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,who was the mother of a French art thief
00:25:42,00:25:46,and destroyed the art that her son had stolen.
00:25:46,00:25:47,Why?
00:25:47,00:25:48,"When he asked her to, to destroy evidence."
00:25:48,00:25:49,"To, uh-- All right."
00:25:49,00:25:51,And I've got written down here that she destroyed
00:25:51,00:25:54,"a billion pounds worth of the art that he had stolen,"
00:25:54,00:25:55,very prolific art thief.
00:25:55,00:25:57,Why didn't he destroy it?
00:25:57,00:25:57,I don't--
00:25:57,00:25:59,He can't be your mum to do your dirty work.
00:25:59,00:26:00,"I know, but this is not-- he's not the only one."
00:26:00,00:26:02,"So there was a thief called Radu Dogharu,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,"who asked his mum to burn all the artworks he had stolen,"
00:26:05,00:26:06,so that the police wouldn't find them.
00:26:06,00:26:07,And she did.
00:26:07,00:26:09,She put them in the stove and she burned them all up.
00:26:09,00:26:12,And then forensics experts had to go through all the ashes
00:26:12,00:26:13,in the bottom of her stove
00:26:13,00:26:17,"and pick out tiny, tiny bits of, say, Picasso's signature."
00:26:17,00:26:20,"Like tiny, you know, fractions of a millimeter long."
00:26:20,00:26:20,Yeah.
00:26:20,00:26:22,"Just so they could measure them and say,"
00:26:22,00:26:25,that is the kind of paint that would have been used
00:26:25,00:26:26,in this money or whatever.
00:26:26,00:26:27,"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:26:27,00:26:30,"These were sad little boys living in their mum's attic,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,doing their crime and then bringing home
00:26:32,00:26:33,to their mum to sort out.
00:26:33,00:26:36,"It just bizarre, there have been two separate cases of, you know,"
00:26:36,00:26:38,getting your mum to destroy the art you stole it.
00:26:38,00:26:40,That is weird.
00:26:40,00:26:41,Just been reading--
00:26:41,00:26:42,Going to be good.
00:26:42,00:26:45,"A depot, which is this somewhere in the UK."
00:26:45,00:26:46,And a cat broke in.
00:26:46,00:26:48,And it took offense to one of the specimens.
00:26:48,00:26:50,And it just kept knocking it off.
00:26:50,00:26:52,And so they'd come in every morning
00:26:52,00:26:53,"and it was like, put it back up."
00:26:53,00:26:54,It could never find this cat.
00:26:54,00:26:56,"And it was only like CCTV,"
00:26:56,00:26:58,"because they were like, this is really weird."
00:26:58,00:27:01,Why is this one specimen always off?
00:27:01,00:27:04,"You brag about the great security you've got,"
00:27:04,00:27:06,but there's a cat that keeps repeatedly broken in.
00:27:06,00:27:09,You can only know that cats are naturally very good at that.
00:27:09,00:27:10,They are good at that.
00:27:10,00:27:12,"I've got one last thing, which is this is a really cool example"
00:27:12,00:27:16,of security in a museum that--
00:27:16,00:27:19,this is that the Museum of English Rural Life.
00:27:19,00:27:22,And it's a bit of security they didn't realize they had.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"They have, within their collection,"
00:27:24,00:27:28,"on display, a 150-year-old mouse trap."
00:27:28,00:27:30,And they came in one morning and sitting
00:27:30,00:27:35,"inside the mouse trap was a mouse caught in present day,"
00:27:35,00:27:38,as in the last few years.
00:27:38,00:27:40,"And so what it was is while they were doing renovations,"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"some mice managed to get into the museum,"
00:27:42,00:27:45,had managed to get through the little casing and got caught
00:27:45,00:27:49,by a mouse trap that had been set and built in 1861.
00:27:49,00:27:51,That is so cool.
00:27:51,00:27:56,"Yeah, by Colin Pollinger and Sons of Silsea West Sussex."
00:27:56,00:27:57,"And on the side of the box,"
00:27:57,00:28:00,it boasts perpetual mouse trap will last a lifetime.
00:28:00,00:28:01,"Oh, that's true."
00:28:01,00:28:02,It's longer than.
00:28:02,00:28:05,Someone needs to write in longer than before that.
00:28:05,00:28:06,"Yeah, that's super cool."
00:28:06,00:28:07,That's pretty cool.
00:28:07,00:28:10,One of the silliest things we've ever had stolen from the museum
00:28:10,00:28:12,is Copperlight.
00:28:12,00:28:13,He's done it from a dinosaur.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"Oh, yeah, the poo set."
00:28:15,00:28:16,It's market for that.
00:28:16,00:28:18,I wonder what he wants to do with it.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"Oh, it's just a cool--"
00:28:19,00:28:21,"It's the coolest Copperlight out, surely."
00:28:21,00:28:23,"Yeah, exactly, exactly."
00:28:23,00:28:24,"I mean, you can get any sort of--"
00:28:24,00:28:26,there's a museum of poo in the Isle of White.
00:28:26,00:28:26,Did you know that?
00:28:26,00:28:27,No.
00:28:27,00:28:29,"Yeah, they freeze."
00:28:29,00:28:30,They liquid nitrogen.
00:28:30,00:28:32,They freeze these poo's in spheres.
00:28:32,00:28:35,It's normal human poo's in the living room.
00:28:35,00:28:37,Are they accepting donations or--
00:28:37,00:28:39,"Apparently, there's a waiting list."
00:28:39,00:28:42,They're trying to get different animal poo and whatever.
00:28:42,00:28:43,We've been in contact.
00:28:43,00:28:44,So it's not a fossilized ancient poo.
00:28:44,00:28:46,It's just a dog's poo poop on the tree.
00:28:46,00:28:48,"And, but-- no, no, no, they're not."
00:28:48,00:28:49,They're quite selective.
00:28:49,00:28:50,OK.
00:28:50,00:28:51,Take any old shit.
00:28:51,00:28:52,It's got to be pedigree.
00:28:52,00:28:54,Pedigree poo.
00:28:54,00:28:57,Don't want to know what the gift shop looks like.
00:28:57,00:28:59,"Is it-- that's not even to the public, though, is it?"
00:28:59,00:29:00,What?
00:29:00,00:29:00,Great.
00:29:00,00:29:01,I love white.
00:29:01,00:29:01,Visit.
00:29:01,00:29:02,Here we come.
00:29:02,00:29:05,[MUSIC PLAYING]
00:29:05,00:29:11,"OK, it is time for a final fact of the show."
00:29:11,00:29:12,And that is Andy.
00:29:12,00:29:14,My fact is that prisoners in Siberia
00:29:14,00:29:19,used to eat prehistoric animals they found frozen in the ice.
00:29:19,00:29:20,Is that really true?
00:29:20,00:29:21,So what kind of animals?
00:29:21,00:29:21,Mammoths.
00:29:21,00:29:23,All kinds of animals.
00:29:23,00:29:23,Really?
00:29:23,00:29:24,Dinosaur.
00:29:24,00:29:25,Dinosaur.
00:29:25,00:29:26,Who said?
00:29:26,00:29:29,"Well, OK, according to Alexander Solzzynitsyn."
00:29:29,00:29:30,"OK, he's reliable."
00:29:30,00:29:31,He's very reliable.
00:29:31,00:29:34,He was a prisoner in Siberia for a very long time.
00:29:34,00:29:35,A very famous Russian author.
00:29:35,00:29:37,And he wrote a book called The Gulag Archipelago.
00:29:37,00:29:41,The idea of this huge chain of islands of Gulags
00:29:41,00:29:42,spread across Siberia.
00:29:42,00:29:43,Siberia is absolutely enormous.
00:29:43,00:29:44,And it's where Russia traditionally
00:29:44,00:29:48,sent all of its dissidents and any troublemakers.
00:29:48,00:29:49,And it's on the first page of his book.
00:29:49,00:29:54,He writes about some prisoners handing over some prehistoric
00:29:54,00:29:56,"squirrels they found, ground squirrels,"
00:29:56,00:29:59,to the camp geologist of the camp they were in.
00:29:59,00:30:01,"But he also said that on other occasions,"
00:30:01,00:30:03,prisoners had just devoured these things on the spot
00:30:03,00:30:05,because they were so hungry.
00:30:05,00:30:06,Other people have disputed it.
00:30:06,00:30:09,"They've said there wouldn't be much left of a ground squirrel,"
00:30:09,00:30:10,even if it had been frozen.
00:30:10,00:30:13,It would have petrified gone very hard.
00:30:13,00:30:14,So he claims it.
00:30:14,00:30:17,"Other people have said, is this possible?"
00:30:17,00:30:17,They get hard like wood.
00:30:17,00:30:20,Maybe they were just fish that had been stuck in a frozen river.
00:30:20,00:30:21,"But it's possible, yeah."
00:30:21,00:30:22,Yeah.
00:30:22,00:30:25,So there have been lots of reports for hundreds of years
00:30:25,00:30:27,"of people eating prehistoric animals, haven't they?"
00:30:27,00:30:30,Which I think people say are mostly apocryphal
00:30:30,00:30:32,and it's often mammoths.
00:30:32,00:30:34,"Well, they did, when the baby mammoth."
00:30:34,00:30:35,So when the N.A. and they defrosted
00:30:35,00:30:38,"and all the blood started leaking out, there was--"
00:30:38,00:30:40,"and I don't know if they actually took from that one,"
00:30:40,00:30:41,but they have eaten bits of mammoth.
00:30:41,00:30:43,Was that the one that was found quite a couple of years ago?
00:30:43,00:30:44,Yeah.
00:30:44,00:30:46,Who would they--
00:30:46,00:30:47,The researchers?
00:30:47,00:30:47,Oh.
00:30:47,00:30:49,"Yeah, it was like a big thing."
00:30:49,00:30:50,And that's pretty--
00:30:50,00:30:52,Is that risky thing to do?
00:30:52,00:30:53,I mean--
00:30:53,00:30:56,If the animal is frozen and it's kept constantly
00:30:56,00:31:00,"with a zero degrees, it's fine, which doesn't happen"
00:31:00,00:31:01,"basically in the environment, so that's what--"
00:31:01,00:31:03,But if it goes up and down in temperatures
00:31:03,00:31:05,"and it defrosts and then re-freezes,"
00:31:05,00:31:08,"that's when you're getting all the mold in the bacteria,"
00:31:08,00:31:10,being actually frozen into this specimen.
00:31:10,00:31:12,So that's when you can get all sorts of craziness.
00:31:12,00:31:14,"But if you heat it in the microwave for a minute,"
00:31:14,00:31:15,that's actually fine.
00:31:15,00:31:17,Because the average mammoth is going to fit in a microwave.
00:31:17,00:31:19,Yeah.
00:31:19,00:31:20,There was-- was it--
00:31:20,00:31:22,Alexei Tickanov has tried mammoth.
00:31:22,00:31:24,I think he might have been one of the zoologists
00:31:24,00:31:25,on that expedition.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"Or anyway, he said he's tasted mammoth."
00:31:27,00:31:28,And it was awful.
00:31:28,00:31:31,It tasted like meat left too long in a freezer.
00:31:31,00:31:31,I mean--
00:31:31,00:31:32,Which--
00:31:32,00:31:35,"We're trying to do it, that's amazing."
00:31:35,00:31:38,"Just on things found in ice, I read a really cool story"
00:31:38,00:31:41,"that in 2010, researchers were looking"
00:31:41,00:31:43,in Shackleton's base camp.
00:31:43,00:31:46,And they found underneath the floorboards
00:31:46,00:31:48,a crate of old whiskey.
00:31:48,00:31:51,"And they brought it up, and it was frozen."
00:31:51,00:31:52,"But when they were defrosting it,"
00:31:52,00:31:53,"and they were swirling around the bottles,"
00:31:53,00:31:54,they could hear liquid inside.
00:31:54,00:31:57,So the whiskey was still usable.
00:31:57,00:31:59,"Now, obviously, they were never going to drink it."
00:31:59,00:32:01,But the particular whiskey that was there
00:32:01,00:32:03,was from a company called McKinley.
00:32:03,00:32:06,And they'd lost the recipe since.
00:32:06,00:32:09,"So basically, we had the recipe again of a lost whiskey."
00:32:09,00:32:12,So what they did was they flew it over to Scotland.
00:32:12,00:32:14,"And there's a new company called Wyatt and McKay,"
00:32:14,00:32:15,who bought McKinley.
00:32:15,00:32:17,"And they put syringes through the cork,"
00:32:17,00:32:19,and they managed to get the whiskey out.
00:32:19,00:32:21,And they managed to replicate the recipe
00:32:21,00:32:25,of what that long-lost whiskey recipe was.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"And they made 50,000 bottles."
00:32:27,00:32:32,"So they sold it as a limited edition, $157 American per bottle."
00:32:32,00:32:33,"It's not limited, is it?"
00:32:33,00:32:34,Yeah.
00:32:34,00:32:35,"You know, when you get something limited edition,"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"you think, God, it's only me and tell not the people."
00:32:37,00:32:39,"I guess everything is a limited edition, isn't it?"
00:32:39,00:32:42,"Because no one's ever made an infinite number of anything, yes."
00:32:42,00:32:45,But so then they sent the bottles back.
00:32:45,00:32:46,To the base.
00:32:46,00:32:49,So it's still there as part of what was left out.
00:32:49,00:32:51,"Oh, what did they call it?"
00:32:51,00:32:52,"Ooh, I don't know."
00:32:52,00:32:54,I think they called it just what it was.
00:32:54,00:32:55,"OK, they didn't call it Shackleton."
00:32:55,00:32:56,"No, they shouldn't."
00:32:56,00:32:57,The American audience would have loved that.
00:32:57,00:32:59,Yeah.
00:32:59,00:33:01,Just on these ancient animals that
00:33:01,00:33:04,have been found in the permafrost and things like this.
00:33:04,00:33:07,So one really useful thing is squirrels.
00:33:07,00:33:10,Because they made nests.
00:33:10,00:33:12,And they made nests of all the local flora.
00:33:12,00:33:19,And so it's like a densely packed nest full of the kind of species
00:33:19,00:33:21,that you would have had growing in the ice age.
00:33:21,00:33:23,To freeze in her berry.
00:33:23,00:33:25,"Yeah, so you've got all these different species just gathered"
00:33:25,00:33:27,very conveniently in one place for the scientists to get to it.
00:33:27,00:33:28,That's really good.
00:33:28,00:33:29,"Yeah, that's great."
00:33:29,00:33:30,And this is the amazing thing.
00:33:30,00:33:33,"A few years ago, in 2012, scientists"
00:33:33,00:33:38,"grew the most ancient living organism, multicellular,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,on the planet.
00:33:39,00:33:42,"It's a plant, a little plant called sylene stenophila."
00:33:42,00:33:45,And it was brought back to life by these seeds
00:33:45,00:33:47,that the squirrels put in their nest.
00:33:47,00:33:50,"The seeds were 31 and 1/2,000 years old."
00:33:50,00:33:52,And we grew them into a plant.
00:33:52,00:33:53,And they still work.
00:33:53,00:33:54,And now we have lots of these things.
00:33:54,00:33:55,"And it's quite beautiful, isn't it?"
00:33:55,00:33:58,Is that really delicate looking white flower?
00:33:58,00:33:59,"I think so, yeah."
00:33:59,00:34:00,It's over the white flower on top.
00:34:00,00:34:01,"Yeah, it's really lovely."
00:34:01,00:34:02,"Wow, that's amazing."
00:34:02,00:34:03,"Yeah, that's incredible."
00:34:03,00:34:04,"Can I ask a quick question about,"
00:34:04,00:34:07,so has the Natural History Museum got a woolly mammoth?
00:34:07,00:34:11,That's ever been sort of thawed out of the ice?
00:34:11,00:34:14,I don't believe we have any.
00:34:14,00:34:15,"And the one that came to us to visit,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,"and everyone got to see, went back again."
00:34:18,00:34:18,OK.
00:34:18,00:34:20,"So if that, yeah, you can look, but--"
00:34:20,00:34:23,"Yeah, really, apparently 1% only of the woolly mammoths"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"that get dug out of the permafrost,"
00:34:25,00:34:26,all that thawed out of the permafrost ends up
00:34:26,00:34:28,and end up in scientific hands.
00:34:28,00:34:30,"Interest in the elephant tusks,"
00:34:30,00:34:33,"acytes, mammoth tusks aren't."
00:34:33,00:34:39,"So that they're not protected in terms of under the, yes."
00:34:39,00:34:39,So you're not--
00:34:39,00:34:41,"Well, because they're not considered fair enough."
00:34:41,00:34:43,"I mean, you can't really protect the mammoths any more, can you?"
00:34:43,00:34:46,"But you can stop the tusks from getting into the wrong hands, right?"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"You can say this is protected as in a museum, has to have that."
00:34:48,00:34:50,But we haven't got legislation for that.
00:34:50,00:34:52,Really?
00:34:52,00:34:54,"On other old foods that have been eaten,"
00:34:54,00:34:56,there's bog butter.
00:34:56,00:34:59,"Bog butter is a way that people used to store butter,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,and they would put it in bogs.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"This is especially in Scotland and Ireland,"
00:35:02,00:35:04,and it would be preserved.
00:35:04,00:35:07,"And I think recently we found 300 packs of bog butter,"
00:35:07,00:35:10,so there was a big uncovering in a swamp in Ireland.
00:35:10,00:35:14,"And it was up to 1,400 years old."
00:35:14,00:35:16,"And this woman called Helen Lucy Burke,"
00:35:16,00:35:17,"who I think is a journalist,"
00:35:17,00:35:20,"went to the museum where all this bog butter was on display,"
00:35:20,00:35:23,"1,400 years old, and it was being suspended on a plinth."
00:35:23,00:35:26,"And it's, yeah, it's like cheesy, lardy butter,"
00:35:26,00:35:29,"and she just grabbed a bit of it and ate it, which is quite cool."
00:35:29,00:35:31,And she said it wasn't disgusting.
00:35:31,00:35:31,It wasn't very nice.
00:35:31,00:35:34,"It was cheesy, ripe, and athletes' footy."
00:35:34,00:35:36,"I mean, but that sentence would be disgusting enough"
00:35:36,00:35:39,"if you had a friend who just grabbed a bunch of butter,"
00:35:39,00:35:40,and it's not that eating it.
00:35:40,00:35:42,"So, like, what did she have it on anything?"
00:35:42,00:35:43,Did she have toast with her?
00:35:43,00:35:44,Just on its own.
00:35:44,00:35:46,"I think it was quite solidified by that point, maybe."
00:35:46,00:35:47,"All right, like a biscuit."
00:35:47,00:35:49,"I quite like butter, just by itself."
00:35:49,00:35:50,"Yeah, but you wouldn't just stick your hands up."
00:35:50,00:35:52,I agree with you.
00:35:52,00:35:52,You're kidding.
00:35:52,00:35:55,"I just, it's one of those things that you can't."
00:35:55,00:35:57,I don't like chocolate.
00:35:57,00:35:58,I like butter.
00:35:58,00:35:59,All right.
00:35:59,00:35:59,Which is healthier?
00:35:59,00:36:01,Just eating chocolate or just eating butter?
00:36:01,00:36:02,Both are bad.
00:36:02,00:36:03,Both are bad.
00:36:03,00:36:04,They're good and small amounts.
00:36:04,00:36:06,It's not like I have a pack of butter.
00:36:06,00:36:08,Who would die first?
00:36:08,00:36:10,You only allow to eat butter or me only allow to eat chocolate.
00:36:10,00:36:12,"Well, at this rate, chocolate's dying out,"
00:36:12,00:36:13,so you would have the worst sort.
00:36:13,00:36:14,"Which, what?"
00:36:14,00:36:15,Chocolate's dying out?
00:36:15,00:36:16,"It's a problem, isn't there?"
00:36:16,00:36:19,"There is, because the pollinator's dying out."
00:36:19,00:36:20,And you know what the pollinator is?
00:36:20,00:36:22,It's a fly.
00:36:22,00:36:23,"It's a one-specific fly, then."
00:36:23,00:36:25,"Well, we think there's about 14 species."
00:36:25,00:36:26,We don't know.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"Well, can't you bring them back?"
00:36:27,00:36:28,Isn't this what you do?
00:36:28,00:36:30,"No, it's you're creating a habitat problem for them."
00:36:30,00:36:30,I don't blame me.
00:36:30,00:36:33,"I'm just saying, it's you people with your mastermind"
00:36:33,00:36:35,"of chocolate, you've gone out there,"
00:36:35,00:36:37,"and you're like, OK, let's say our monocultures."
00:36:37,00:36:38,"The adults have come along and they're like,"
00:36:38,00:36:39,"oh, don't like this."
00:36:39,00:36:43,"Oh, so they're genuinely like, this is limited stock."
00:36:43,00:36:45,"Like, this is an actual limited stock of this and there."
00:36:45,00:36:47,"Stick it in a bog, and then you'll be fine."
00:36:47,00:36:48,OK.
00:36:48,00:36:49,Wow.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"There's this very-- by the way, our mosquitos flies."
00:36:51,00:36:52,Yes.
00:36:52,00:36:53,OK.
00:36:53,00:36:54,I thought that might be something else.
00:36:54,00:36:56,Is a daddy long legs a fly?
00:36:56,00:36:58,"Ah, what are you calling a daddy long legs?"
00:36:58,00:36:58,"Oh, there are two, aren't there?"
00:36:58,00:37:00,"I mean-- No, there's three now."
00:37:00,00:37:01,"They've added a third one, just for fun."
00:37:01,00:37:04,"So, you know, this is why I shouldn't use common names"
00:37:04,00:37:04,or anything.
00:37:04,00:37:06,"So you've got the daddy long legs, the flying thing,"
00:37:06,00:37:08,"which is a crane fly, true fly."
00:37:08,00:37:09,That's the one.
00:37:09,00:37:11,"The second one is a pillion, which a harvestman."
00:37:11,00:37:15,"And the third type is the daddy long legs spider,"
00:37:15,00:37:17,which is the one that-- excuse to be called a cellar spider.
00:37:17,00:37:19,It's the one that hangs around in your living room.
00:37:19,00:37:20,"Oh, it's a very spindly one."
00:37:20,00:37:22,"And then it went, yeah, OK, and that can't fly either."
00:37:22,00:37:24,"No, but that's a spider, so that is venomous."
00:37:24,00:37:26,Are there any spiders that can fly?
00:37:26,00:37:27,Nope.
00:37:27,00:37:29,Unless they're using ferretic behavior.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"Oh, I'm kind of lying."
00:37:31,00:37:34,"Because balloon spiders, they balloon."
00:37:34,00:37:35,"So they exist, so yeah."
00:37:35,00:37:37,So they can get up into really high up.
00:37:37,00:37:39,"Wait, hang on, how did-- what, they float up?"
00:37:39,00:37:40,"No, they were still."

00:37:55,00:37:56,Yeah.
00:37:56,00:37:58,"And because it's so thin and they're so small,"
00:37:58,00:38:01,the viscosity of the air is such that they can go forth.
00:38:01,00:38:02,And it's them.
00:38:02,00:38:06,"If the only equivalent is if I let out my sperm, well-sized sperm,"
00:38:06,00:38:09,"and that caught the wind, it dragged me to the end"
