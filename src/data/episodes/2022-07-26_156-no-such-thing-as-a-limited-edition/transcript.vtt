WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hi guys! I just wanted to let you know before we start this show that one of our

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.480
 numbers is doing a comedy show and that- Is it me, Ana?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 It's not you James, you know about that, wouldn't you?

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.160
 No, it's me. It's not Dan. What? It's not you.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.040
 Is it you, Ana? It's not me. Oh, that I'm not interested.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.720
 I have no interest either. Yeah, that's going to put people off now. They've realized it's not me.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.160
 It is Andrew Hunter Murray. Whoo! Keeps on having to add new shows to his

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.040
 bloody comedy show because people keep on filling them out and- All right, sorry again.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 Just read the card of God. We were to watch it the other week, didn't we?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.400
 Yeah, it's really, really funny. It's so funny. It's really, really good.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.280
 Yeah, it's great. It's really funny. It's full of characters. You get to see Andy

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.760
 being the stupidest version of himself doing. He's a rhyming librarian lady at a book club.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.240
 He's a Samba man. It's amazing. Spoilers. So many spoilers.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.640
 No, it's excellent. It's absurd and insane and hilarious. You should go and see it.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.920
 It's on the 27th and the 28th of March at the Soho Theatre. It's at 7.45. Go and see it now.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.040
 Well, don't go and see it now. Go see what it's up.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.480
 Also, before we begin, you'll notice that James is not here this week.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.800
 Sitting in his place is Erika McCallister. Erika McCallister is a friend of ours.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.320
 She works at the Natural History Museum and she is their curator of flies, Diptura.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.000
 And she's got a new book out. It's called The Secret Life of Flies.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.600
 She took three years to write this book. It's everything that she knows about flies.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.960
 And she knows a lot about flies. She knows so much stuff about flies.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.280
 And also, she has no time for people who don't like flies, which is why I wasn't allowed

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.040
 on the book. Exactly. So the book's going to be out April 3rd.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.240
 It was really exciting to have her on the show. She was really awesome.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.920
 And she told us that she was going to make sure she always brought it back to flies.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.320
 And she did, no matter what we were talking about.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.840
 Okay, on with the show.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:14.400
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.440
 coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 My name is Dan Shriver and I'm sitting here with Anna Chazinski, Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.840
 and the Natural History Museum's Curator of Diptura, that means flies.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 It's Erika McCallister. And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.480
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.840
 here we go. Starting with you, Erika.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.960
 My fact is that the vinegar flies burn is so long that if humans have the same sperm

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.520
 to body ratio as the fly, for example, then, Dan sperm would be the size of a sperm whale.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.280
 Whoa. Do you feel proud? That's.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.760
 So when you say size, is that the as long as a blue one, as a sperm whale?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.400
 As a sperm whale. If it was blue one, that'd be quite extraordinary.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 But it's a sperm whale. It's about 120 feet, I read.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.840
 Right. Is that right or not?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.560
 Meter, the science. Can you not do a meter?

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.160
 No, no, it's new. No, it's 33 meters. 33 meters.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.720
 Yeah. A third of a hundred meters sprinting thing.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.040
 So three of Dan's sperm will be able to stretch the length of Usain Bolt's run.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.920
 Yes. Yeah.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.000
 That's quite a nice graphic, I hadn't.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.440
 Why does that thought process? But thank you.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440
 Why do they need sperm that long?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.280
 They don't have a lot of sperm.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.240
 Oh, okay. And they don't go through the teenage years, so they don't waste it.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.720
 And what they do is that because the females are very, very promiscuous.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.320
 Okay. And this is all nature that females are designed to be promiscuous.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.120
 And we're only doing it for our offspring. It's not for fun.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.240
 That's what I tell people.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.440
 And so we originally thought that if there was lots of sperm competition,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.600
 you make loads of it and it was great.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.160
 And actually, what these do is their sperm is so large,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520
 the actual sperm pushes the other sperm out of the way.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.360
 Whoa. I know.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.200
 Pushes them out of the way in the opening, in the genital opening.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.680
 It pushes the other sperm out of the way. Yep. They've got quite exciting penises.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.880
 Have they? What are their penises?

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.880
 We don't know what other penises are like.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.040
 Hello. I mean, it depends on species.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.640
 Some of them have got like little comes, some of them have got little whips,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.960
 they've got little tickling organs, they've got all sorts of things.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.800
 Oh, it's just like a whole and some as shop, but just inside a penis.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.920
 Another thing I read is that this particular fly, vinegar fly,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.560
 has testes which are a tenth of its body weight.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.880
 They're enormous because they have to produce this.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.920
 So they're not the biggest in comparison to body size and animal kingdom.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.560
 The sage bookish cricket gets that 14%.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.600
 And you can look it up. You know, we study this.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.400
 But they do need because when they want to produce this sperm,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.720
 and it is one at a time that basically it's pumped out,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.920
 not like the thousands that Dan weights.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.280
 Yeah. So Dan's testicles here,

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.480
 Dan have estimated your weight.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.320
 I think they'd be well over a stone, maybe seven and a half kilos.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.960
 So as you're lining up next to St. Bolts.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.680
 Yeah, bouncing along on them like space hoppers.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.920
 Wow.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.040
 I also got a real image of your sperm that I want someone to draw

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.160
 with just very thick rimmed glasses and weird...

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.160
 If you're listening to this, do not draw that and send it to at Shriberland.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.880
 Don't do it.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.360
 And this is the other thing about it.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.720
 So supposedly the sperm are, they're like balls of twine.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.320
 Yeah, no, they're really, really thin.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.680
 So it looks like someone has just given a cat a load of wool.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.080
 Right.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.480
 And then somebody's coming in and quickly had to tidy up

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.720
 and shoved it all back to get it.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.920
 It's always the same when the cleaning lady comes out of there.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:49.040
 The guy who I think first found out about the vinegar flight

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.720
 and their extremely long sperm...

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.200
 Yeah.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.160
 Scott Pitnik, he has a tattoo of a sperm cell on his arm

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.080
 to sort of commemorate this discovery.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.880
 That's very cool.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.920
 He's put up photos of it online and it is all over his arm.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.040
 Well, it have to be.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.440
 Well, it is the length of his arm.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.360
 It's a huge tattoo.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 Although he should have made it the length of, you know,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.560
 as we've said, proportionally.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.080
 Well, the length is probably the length of the sperm now.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.720
 Yeah, the sperm now.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.360
 Yeah, so he should have made it running all up and down his body.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.360
 Yeah, he needs 30 metres of it.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.680
 Yeah.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.760
 I guess he should.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.960
 It's true that the way as someone who looks for new species of flies

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.640
 as you do at the Natural History Museum,

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.880
 is it true that you identify them through their genitals

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.160
 more than anything else?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.920
 Well, not through their genitals, but hey, because that would be odd.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.400
 But yeah, species descriptions is basically,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.800
 it's always done on male genitalia.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.880
 Female genitalia is really similar.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.600
 Uh-huh.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.280
 So the whole thing about it being a lock and key doesn't quite make sense.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.840
 But the idea now, I have got this great idea

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.040
 that we're very into 3D printing and micro-CT scanning.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.040
 We can actually do 3D genitalia, kick glasses, walk through.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.600
 We could have like theme parks or fly genitalia.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.720
 I think that...

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.760
 I'm sure the NHM would totally go for a new gallery

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.360
 of like walks through genitalia.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.640
 Is this the thing that you've been pitching in every weekly machine glass?

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.240
 Any more business before we end?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.840
 Could you call it through the p-hole?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.720
 Ah!

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.240
 Isn't that... So I was reading about, apparently,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.720
 they think the reason it has one big sperm

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:23.040
 that it leaves in a packet on top of the women's abdomen

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.720
 and then she puts it into her genitals.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.080
 The reason it's so big is so that it blocks it up like a plug

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.040
 to what the flies do.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.760
 No, I mean, basically every animal has a plug.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.720
 Humans have plugs.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.720
 Ars is just a little bit more fluid.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.080
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.960
 So the female seminal fluid is the plug

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.480
 trying to kill all the sperm.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.320
 But also the European plugs are slightly different.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.680
 They are very.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:46.160
 And you need an adaptor sometimes.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.360
 And so, yeah, so flies go out of their way to try and make these plugs

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.520
 and a lot of flies actually use themselves.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.760
 So they do practice sexual suicide.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.440
 The male, when he's in cop with the female

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.360
 and he's pumped his sperm up, yeah.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.680
 A lot of them will sacrifice themselves,

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.760
 will let the females eat them.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.480
 And then, so she's so busy doing that,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.560
 it's a longer sperm transferral.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.320
 So he's got a greater chance.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.520
 So he uses him.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.600
 So there's a type of bite in midge.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.480
 So basically, when she's in cop and she's facing him,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480
 she saw through his eyeballs,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.640
 releases a digestive enzyme,

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.280
 his insides dissolve, she sucks them up,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.560
 his body breaks off, snaps, leaves the penis in her,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.160
 she just whips it out afterwards.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.840
 Brilliant. Whoa.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.840
 You know when we are parents, as humans,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.680
 talk about the sacrifices they've made.

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.280
 Yeah, they made nothing.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.960
 No idea.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.120
 And my body dissolved by your mother.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.000
 Well, the bush crickets with your massive sperm,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.360
 she will eat his wings.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.160
 How come?

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.640
 Because he gives us, I think, like, midcop

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.240
 to nibble on to keep her there.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.800
 Because females basically only care about food.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.640
 And then does he have to walk home afterwards?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.760
 No, he can't fly away.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.640
 He can't do anything.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.840
 Basically, that's it for him,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.360
 because no other female is going to be interested.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.600
 No point in even doing the wingless walk of shame.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.080
 It's why I go on any date with a packet of pringles

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.520
 in either hand.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.520
 It's so, it's a moment only you're honest.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.560
 It's so middate.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.160
 I can provide the pringles to them,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.680
 and they'll stay on the date with me for longer.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:11.440
 Yeah, because you've got to keep the female interested.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.800
 There's a whole group of flies

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.640
 that the females don't even hunt.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.640
 And so the males will bring them gifts.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.480
 So the females with feed, they would have sex,

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.440
 it was all great.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.120
 But the females finished before the males,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.800
 so the females would just disappear.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.960
 And the males were like, "But we haven't finished."

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.760
 And so the males learned to wrap up their gifts.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.520
 So it was like taking a box of chocolates.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.640
 So she'd take so much time opening the fly up

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.400
 that he would have lots of sex.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.080
 But it went in the opposite way.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.320
 Because then she spent so much time.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.360
 He was like, "Well, I finished."

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.280
 So another group basically stole back

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.960
 this half-eaten box of chocolates

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.120
 and re-wrapped it to give it to another fly.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.320
 What are they wrapping it in?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.280
 A box of livers.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:47.760
 Nice.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.080
 Yeah, it's my favourite kind of wrapping paper.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.600
 So some other questions I have about flies while you're here.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.120
 So they flap their wings super fast, right?

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.680
 But like 300 times a second, which I find insane.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.600
 But I was reading that some of them have

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.920
 someone called it a gear box mechanism

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.880
 where do they have grooves or something

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.480
 and they can kind of change gear

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.040
 to make themselves go faster or slower?

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.040
 They do have that.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.800
 But flies probably are the most efficient

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.720
 and most amazing flies on the planet.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.800
 But their vision is what's really important here.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.400
 Because they see so much faster.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.440
 So we are always at half a second behind real time.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:21.920
 What?

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.640
 It takes us that long to process what goes on.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.560
 So actually, we're never in the present moment.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.040
 Okay.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.000
 We're always in the past.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.320
 But flies are merely second.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.680
 Millie, mini, mini, like nanos.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.480
 So it hints why they do everything so much faster.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.040
 Because so if I, and obviously I'm advocating,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.400
 do not swap them.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.600
 But if we went to swap them,

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.600
 they would just see that it's really slow motion

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.600
 and at the last minute they could just walk out the way.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.360
 So if you do want to catch a fly,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.880
 do it really slowly.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.360
 Because then actually it appears like a solid object.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.160
 I will.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.840
 But I will need you at the end of the first matrix.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.880
 Very much like me.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.440
 Okay.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:53.920
 Yeah.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.520
 Well, they have to describe that.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.240
 It's the soul.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.640
 Yeah.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.680
 Well, bullet time.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.400
 Bullet time.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.080
 Yeah, bullet time is what they call it in the matrix

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.840
 when everything goes slow and mushy.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.040
 Yeah, I should have watched.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.280
 Binderman can do that as well as you see in that scene

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.920
 in Spider-Man and spiders catch flies.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.240
 Ah, but there's flies that eat spiders.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:10.880
 No.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.920
 No, no, no, it is.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.960
 And they are so cool.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.560
 There's three species in the UK

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.560
 and they're called acrycerides, hunchback flies.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.920
 And they look gorgeous.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.920
 And the female, she lays loads of eggs,

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.960
 but she doesn't lay them.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.840
 She's basically got a machine gun as an oviposter.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.800
 And so she just rapidly fars out hundreds of these eggs.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.880
 It's like, tch, tch, tch, around the garden.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.880
 And she wants them to land on vegetation

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.800
 that's slightly raised off the ground.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.120
 And then the larvae, I've got like a sucker on the end of them.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.040
 And they kind of like stand up in the air

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.120
 that they just don't care, waving around.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.080
 And then they look down.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.520
 And when a spider runs along,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.520
 they kind of hurl themselves out the spider.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.360
 And then they run to the spider.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.720
 By the way, they've got no legs.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.360
 So like inchworm crawling to the spider,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.040
 up the leg into the abdomen.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.000
 Oh, no.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.320
 But what's really cool, if the spider is immature,

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.840
 and spiders can live to up to five years,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.040
 they would do a little bit of munching,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.200
 and then basically go to sleep and wake up

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.800
 when the spider is mature,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.320
 and they can eat the right organs.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:02.960
 Really?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.600
 So they're inside the, they have a nap inside the spider.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.400
 For two years?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.040
 Three years.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.840
 But it's not just spiders.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.160
 So I read that there was, there's a name here

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.200
 that I can't properly pronounce,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.160
 but Lucilla Bufunivora.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:14.880
 Have you heard of that?

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.760
 Buffy for shorts?

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.240
 Yeah.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.040
 Lucilla.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.440
 Yeah, and so they have a similar larvae thing

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.280
 where they go into a frog's head,

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.520
 and then they eat the frog's head from the inside.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:24.320
 And it is amazing.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.440
 If you see the frog's head,

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.080
 have you seen the...

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.040
 Yeah, I saw the photos.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.840
 Yeah, okay.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.800
 Go and have a look at the images,

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800
 because it's like completely deformed,

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.640
 like collapsed, it's like...

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.040
 Not sure which would be advocating this sort of behaviour.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.160
 With your garden, honestly,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.000
 if you really knew what was going on in there,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
 it's just like, it's...

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.680
 It's disgusting.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.360
 Yeah, and everyone isn't about cute nature,

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.840
 and everything is eating everything,

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.880
 ripping limbs off and eating their inside out.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:57.680
 Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.040
 and that is my fact.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.400
 My fact this week is that,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.000
 whenever he got really angry,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.800
 Winston Churchill would throw his teeth across the room.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.840
 Whenever...

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.840
 Wow, not every single time,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.760
 but when he got really angry,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.000
 apparently that's when you knew the teeth were coming out.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.480
 So Winston Churchill had false teeth, dentures,

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.560
 and he had three sets of them.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.560
 He had a dentist who made them for him,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.640
 called Derrick Cudlip,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.680
 and Derrick Cudlip specifically made these teeth.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.640
 And so he used to get called into the war rooms,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.040
 whenever Churchill flung his teeth across the room,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.000
 because they would break.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 So he would arrive with a new set of teeth

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.520
 to give him to pop back in,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.040
 and then he would take the old pair,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.880
 and he would go off and he would fix them

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.080
 while he was gone.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.000
 So he used to break them a lot, Churchill,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.120
 when he got angry.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.360
 Some of it was by throwing it against the wall.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.600
 The other times was when he was biting too hard

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.600
 through stress and anger of what was going on.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.640
 And it was so important these teeth to him,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.120
 because as far as Churchill was concerned,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.680
 part of the major push of winning the war

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.920
 was his voice, was him going on the radio

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.920
 and saying all these inspiring things.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.760
 So when the call-up came for the dentist to go to war,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.200
 he tore up the paper and said,

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.840
 "It is more important for the war effort that this man is here,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.800
 looking after my teeth than it is for him to be fighting

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.240
 on the front lines."

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.680
 It was his technician, wasn't it?

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.520
 Cudlett was the technician who made it,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.000
 and then his dentist was so Wilfred Fisch,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.280
 both excellent names.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.360
 So as you say, he thought his speech was very important,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.720
 and he had a slight speech impediment,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.080
 so he had kind of a list.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.680
 And he thought that was a vital part

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.200
 of how he was going to rally the troops.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.080
 And so he made them make specially designed dentures

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:36.960
 that were slightly soft,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.880
 so that he could actually preserve his list.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.320
 So that he could make invigorating list-be-speakers that he did.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.880
 Amazing.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.360
 Yeah.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.080
 And you can...

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.720
 So the reason I know about this is because I read an article

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.280
 where a few years ago his teeth were auctioned off.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.280
 So someone actually bought his teeth,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.200
 and it was sold, I believe, by the family of Mr. Cudlett.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.080
 And, uh...

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.480
 Yeah.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.920
 I can't take that name seriously.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320
 Sorry.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.200
 But the ridicule thing, the guy who bought them,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.560
 he was a collector of Churchill memorabilia.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.320
 And he already owned the microphone

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.960
 that Churchill had made a lot of these speeches into.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.920
 And then he had the teeth that went with the microphone.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.480
 So he said in a sense he had reunited them.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.640
 I mean, all he was missing was actually wisdom Churchill.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.200
 Yeah.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.040
 The Guardian had lied about the auctioning of the teeth.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.000
 I just have to read it.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.840
 We shall bite them on the beaches.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.400
 Pretty good.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.120
 Very good.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:25.920
 Yeah.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.000
 I actually looked up as far as I could

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.960
 a list of things that had been auctioned off Churchill's.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.160
 So there were quite a few things.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.160
 His funeral plans were auctioned.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.080
 They went for 472 pounds.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.280
 A violin made from one of his cigar boxes was also auctioned off

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.000
 and a Calgary Stetson, Calboy Hat.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.760
 That was auctioned off as well.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.600
 I read the thing that was auctioned off.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.800
 It came with a DVD,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.560
 which showed a clip of him putting on the hat.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.160
 Which is kind of sensible,

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.440
 because you want authentication.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.480
 One thing that of Churchill's that went up for auction

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.120
 was a file of his blood.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.360
 And it was withdrawn from auction

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.240
 after the very understandable objections of his family members,

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.360
 who said we don't need a file of Winston Churchill's blood going up for sale.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.840
 But it was only put on auction at £300,

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.480
 which I think if you're going to do the really gruesome thing

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.640
 of putting a file of somebody's blood up,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.880
 at least put it up for £50.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.080
 We were looking into this,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.680
 because obviously you go around the world

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.280
 and you go into all the nice big cathedrals

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.880
 and there's an artifact.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.440
 And it's like, okay, I have a finger of Jesus Christ.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.800
 And we're like, brilliant.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.640
 And I've now seen God knows how many vials of blood of Jesus Christ.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.040
 Really?

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.640
 Yeah, and so the scientist of me is like,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.720
 oh, we should just sequence this.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.200
 Yeah.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.080
 You know, we can do it now.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.200
 We've got the technology.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.200
 And with all the bones and all the artifacts,

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.080
 apparently you can make like four, five Jesus Christ.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.840
 But the natural history museum gets--

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.800
 No, we haven't got said no.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.080
 No, we don't get said no, so I think.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.920
 Could you make your own Jesus Christ?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.440
 Well, this is it.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.600
 Well, no.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.920
 So it's not like when you guys brought back the ibex in 2000.

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.120
 We didn't bring it back.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.920
 No, it wasn't.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.440
 No, no. What else I do? I sort of meant you.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.680
 I sort of meant you guys as an all-scientist.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.920
 Yeah. Look at the same diptra.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.360
 No, you have to say I'm not doing anything with it.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.760
 Well, another Churchill relic is, uh,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.440
 went to auction in 2015.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.760
 And that was the stub of one of his cigars

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.960
 that he had smoked while in hospital, in his hospital bed.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.560
 Times have changed.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:28.480
 But he, uh, you can get a lot of that out there.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.720
 Cigars of Churchill's, little stubs.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.320
 There's plenty of them around.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.520
 They keep going on auction.

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.840
 And the reason is that he never used to finish a cigar.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.920
 He used to only smoke them halfway through.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.440
 And there's a lot of accounts of Churchill

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.920
 being very of cutely aware of the fact

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.880
 that the cigar was his trademark look.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.360
 So there's accounts of him as they're pulling up to places.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.480
 Him saying, "Stop the car."

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.480
 And he'd light up a cigar and say, "Branding."

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.680
 It's all about branding.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.800
 You wouldn't say that exact word.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.520
 Did he say branding?

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.200
 It's all about branding.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.840
 That is, in 50 years, that's going to be a Churchill misquote.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.040
 And it's going to be your fault.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.640
 Branding, it's all about branding.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.840
 It was something like that.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.720
 I don't remember what it was.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.080
 He does seem very corporate, though.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.960
 Yeah, exactly.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.440
 I mean, he's worrying about how he speaks and his teeth.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.480
 Yeah. Well, and of course, the thing with his whiskey-drinking way,

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.920
 he knew that whiskey was part of his image.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.080
 And he massively watered down his whiskey all the time

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.040
 because he didn't want to be drunk.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.120
 But I think that's fair enough.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.680
 I think it's good that he wasn't absolutely smashed

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.480
 all the way through the wall.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.600
 Obviously, that's fine.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.920
 But he didn't have to cultivate the whiskey image.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.720
 Yeah.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.520
 It's all very, as he wants, as I believe he once said,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.280
 branding, it's all about branding.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.920
 Just on his cigars, his mum hated the fact that he smokes cigars.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.040
 And she said to him when he was 15,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.960
 if you knew how foolish and silly you looked doing it,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.400
 you would give up immediately.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.720
 And I just love the idea, because parents always say that

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.400
 when you start smoking and you're 15,

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.520
 they're like, you look like an idiot.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.040
 I know you think you look cool.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.720
 And Churchill's mum was saying to him,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.560
 you look like a damn full Churchill.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.120
 And she actually paid him to give up smoking.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.320
 So he did give up for six months.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.440
 I think you've done a really bad public health message there.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.440
 I think then look, he turned out really well.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.800
 Yes, take up smoking.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.600
 Take up smoking.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.520
 One day, you two could defeat fascism.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.800
 You said, Dan, about how he thought the speeches

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.600
 were a hugely important part of the war effort

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.520
 in Maryland, this kind of stuff.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.680
 I was reading about the reaction to one of his

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.840
 most famous speeches, the Dunkirk one.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.000
 So just after the British army had been kicked out of France

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.200
 by the Nazis, the speech we shall fight on the beaches

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:32.080
 and in all the other locations at the first draft had it.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.440
 Like it's fill in here, branding, close.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.240
 Anyway, supposedly that reaction didn't,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.000
 the speech did not get a great reaction.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.440
 So when you read it out in the House of Commons,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.480
 his wife, Clementine, she told a friend that,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.480
 and I'm quoting here, a great section of the Tory party

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.120
 were not behind Winston and had received his speech

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.800
 even in silent silence.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.320
 So lots of the reactions were not actually as good

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.600
 as we think they were at the time.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.920
 And it was more when the tide of the war turned a bit,

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.000
 for example, at about 1942,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.320
 that they've really got a greater reaction then.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.360
 Okay. Is it true that he basically just used

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.280
 Anglo-Saxon words in that speech?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.320
 Oh, I don't know.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.120
 Because he really went like patriotic.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.880
 Patriotic, patriotic.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.880
 So he tried to use any other words.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.280
 So it's all very solid, old English words.

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.360
 That is so fascinating.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.160
 Yeah, yeah. Even though they're kind of Germanic

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.000
 in origin, really should have been using

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.560
 some nice romance languages like the French.

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.520
 That wasn't good, so well.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.120
 So the original speech when Churchill made it wasn't broadcast,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120
 because the House of Commons wasn't wired for sound.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.560
 And on the radio that evening they said,

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.480
 Churchill said these things in the House of Commons today

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.920
 and then quoted him.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.040
 So where did we get the recording,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.800
 sorry, of the features script,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.720
 if it wasn't recorded in the House of Commons at the time?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.560
 Churchill re-recorded them later on.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.280
 No way.

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.360
 And in fact, he recorded them after the war was over.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.880
 He's so cool, Pratt.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.000
 That is so cool.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.440
 He is aware. He's like a barmer getting into

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.840
 a recording booth and doing his "Yes, We Can" speech again.

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.360
 Yeah, well, it was in 1949 that he recorded these.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.000
 And these were the ones that were sold by EMI

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.760
 and I think possibly DACA2.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.560
 And they were sold in the States as well.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.720
 This is honestly so disappointing.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.960
 I reckon I've definitely listened to those at some point

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.920
 with a bottle of wine and took up really emotional

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.920
 and thought, God, it's like I'm right there.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.240
 And that's just him sitting in 1949

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.720
 in a little white business room.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.400
 That is so depressing.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.240
 It's the experience of hearing them.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.200
 It's very emotive.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.800
 And I think when you hear those words,

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.120
 you know, we can all remember him saying how he says,

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.720
 we will fight them on the beaches.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.480
 We actually says we will fight on the beaches.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.440
 So there we go.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.640
 Oh, please.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.720
 I mean, even doing it later on as he did,

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.640
 he could probably add more emphasis

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.240
 'cause he knew how it turned out.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.440
 Yeah, so he can really go, hey, look at this bit.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.240
 Yeah.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.240
 And everyone's like, wow, you're amazing.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.240
 I've got a funny feeling, guys.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.040
 We're gonna win.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.720
 I'm gonna be successful in that bit.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:22:00.720
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.880
 And that is Chazinski.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.120
 Yeah, my fact this week is that art galleries

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.000
 wedge marbles between paintings and the wall

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.160
 so that if anyone tries to steal the painting,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800
 the marbles fall on the floor and make a clattering noise.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.720
 And that's just a classic art gallery anti-theft device.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.760
 Is that a classic, isn't it?

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.560
 It is a classic.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.760
 Yeah, so I read this in Salon.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.440
 And it was in an article called How to Foil and Art Heist.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.200
 And the person who wrote it is someone

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.680
 who advises museums on this kind of thing and galleries.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.840
 And he said he can't name the museums who do this

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.280
 because they don't want to give away

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.280
 their really advanced tactics.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.640
 But yeah, apparently this is quite common,

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.920
 especially if there are galleries

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.760
 that have budget constraints.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:41.840
 He just shoves some marbles, wedge them

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.800
 between the painting and the wall.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.560
 And as you can imagine, if a thief tries

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.320
 to lift the painting off the wall

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.520
 and they go clattering to the ground,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.720
 the thief might scarper.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.960
 Yeah, maybe more a trip as they're going away.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.160
 A trip, yeah.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.400
 Outside my flat, when they put the garden gates

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.240
 and they were like, have you have this extra bit

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.280
 on top of the garden gates, which is really flimsy.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.080
 So if someone tries to climb over, that smashes.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.520
 And it's, yeah, so a lot of people eat like,

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.520
 "Oh, it's the home alone method

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:09.760
 of defending your gallery, isn't it?"

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.840
 The gallery's also recommend installing

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:14.000
 torrentulas around the place

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.600
 and little cardboard cutouts of people

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.760
 to look like the gallery's security guards.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.000
 Yeah, just dancing all the time in the winter.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.360
 But you wouldn't have torrentulas.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.640
 That'd be like the worst.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.000
 They can only just flick hairs.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.240
 You want to really go for something else in the torrentula.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:27.200
 What'd you go for?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.440
 I'd go for a deaf stalker scorpion.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.480
 Death stalker scorpion.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.200
 Or a scollopendra, like the big centerpiece.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.480
 Here you go, tipster.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.640
 I'd just say they're pretty more aggressive.

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.280
 I'd love if you were in charge of security.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.560
 I know, it's somewhere.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.920
 So good.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.240
 I don't have flesh-eating spiders.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.920
 They go away in slowly.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.120
 These necrotic wounds carried on eat in the public.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.640
 We have lots of problems because obviously in the old days,

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.880
 natural history collectors were very obsessive.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.640
 Obviously, we're very normal nowadays.

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.320
 A lot of people would come in

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.800
 with various different apparel

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.480
 to actually go through the collections

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.360
 and pick out specimens they hadn't got in their own collections.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.120
 So this is the era of top hats and things like that?

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.160
 So underneath, they would have like foam bases

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.800
 in the top, in the inside of their top hat.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.160
 So they'd go into the collection,

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.840
 stick a load of butterflies in it,

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.120
 put that out back over to the account.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.920
 Wow.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.120
 No way.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.520
 And these were collectors who just wanted to steal from them.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.760
 Yeah, there's some very famous cases.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.880
 And there's a lot of people who, I mean, that's wrong.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.960
 But what they did, a lot of them, was even worse.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.040
 They took the data of the specimens.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.120
 Now to me, that's like you might as well.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.400
 Oh, and that is ruined.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.440
 It's ruined for life.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.480
 There's nothing we can do.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.960
 When it was collected away, it is just a dead set.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.760
 So you know what, steal and hopefully we'll get it back one day

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:48.320
 because some child in the family like three generations

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.560
 almost donated to us.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.400
 But if you take off the data, that's it.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.200
 It's dead.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.240
 It's double dead.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.400
 Why did you take off the shelf of the dead to us?

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.800
 There's nothing we could do with it.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.440
 Why would they sort of take, they leave the thing behind,

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.480
 but they just take the--

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.640
 Yeah, you had a very famous person.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.160
 Mine's taken.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.880
 He did a very, he did it all the time.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.760
 And he also put on different data.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.760
 And it was like, oh, just a mess with you.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.600
 No, was he trying to build up his own collection?

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.080
 Yeah.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.320
 He was trying to say I've collected all these things.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.520
 He was trying to make himself to be the most amazing collector

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.520
 at the time, and it was like, oh.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.080
 Yes, and that's why we're very careful about security.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.920
 And top hats no longer loud.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.360
 No longer loud, no.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:34.320
 I think I found the most prolific art destroyer

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.880
 who was not a thief of art.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:39.360
 It's a woman called Mrs. Brightviser,

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.400
 who was the mother of a French art thief

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.800
 and destroyed the art that her son had stolen.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.200
 Why?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.800
 When he asked her to, to destroy evidence.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.840
 To, uh-- All right.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.440
 And I've got written down here that she destroyed

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.240
 a billion pounds worth of the art that he had stolen,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.680
 very prolific art thief.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.200
 Why didn't he destroy it?

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.680
 I don't--

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.200
 He can't be your mum to do your dirty work.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.720
 I know, but this is not-- he's not the only one.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.800
 So there was a thief called Radu Dogharu,

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.440
 who asked his mum to burn all the artworks he had stolen,

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.880
 so that the police wouldn't find them.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.360
 And she did.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.440
 She put them in the stove and she burned them all up.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.240
 And then forensics experts had to go through all the ashes

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.600
 in the bottom of her stove

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.360
 and pick out tiny, tiny bits of, say, Picasso's signature.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.080
 Like tiny, you know, fractions of a millimeter long.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.560
 Yeah.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.320
 Just so they could measure them and say,

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.360
 that is the kind of paint that would have been used

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.160
 in this money or whatever.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.520
 Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.640
 These were sad little boys living in their mum's attic,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.800
 doing their crime and then bringing home

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.840
 to their mum to sort out.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.240
 It just bizarre, there have been two separate cases of, you know,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.480
 getting your mum to destroy the art you stole it.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.640
 That is weird.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.920
 Just been reading--

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.800
 Going to be good.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.520
 A depot, which is this somewhere in the UK.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.960
 And a cat broke in.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.880
 And it took offense to one of the specimens.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.640
 And it just kept knocking it off.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.000
 And so they'd come in every morning

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.520
 and it was like, put it back up.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.880
 It could never find this cat.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.800
 And it was only like CCTV,

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.240
 because they were like, this is really weird.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.360
 Why is this one specimen always off?

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.240
 You brag about the great security you've got,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.640
 but there's a cat that keeps repeatedly broken in.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.200
 You can only know that cats are naturally very good at that.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.480
 They are good at that.

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.880
 I've got one last thing, which is this is a really cool example

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:16.560
 of security in a museum that--

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.520
 this is that the Museum of English Rural Life.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.560
 And it's a bit of security they didn't realize they had.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.960
 They have, within their collection,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.480
 on display, a 150-year-old mouse trap.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.640
 And they came in one morning and sitting

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:35.200
 inside the mouse trap was a mouse caught in present day,

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.080
 as in the last few years.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.240
 And so what it was is while they were doing renovations,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.000
 some mice managed to get into the museum,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.840
 had managed to get through the little casing and got caught

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.920
 by a mouse trap that had been set and built in 1861.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.280
 That is so cool.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:56.160
 Yeah, by Colin Pollinger and Sons of Silsea West Sussex.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.440
 And on the side of the box,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.240
 it boasts perpetual mouse trap will last a lifetime.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.680
 Oh, that's true.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.560
 It's longer than.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.600
 Someone needs to write in longer than before that.

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.960
 Yeah, that's super cool.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.760
 That's pretty cool.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.160
 One of the silliest things we've ever had stolen from the museum

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.080
 is Copperlight.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.840
 He's done it from a dinosaur.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.680
 Oh, yeah, the poo set.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.720
 It's market for that.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.800
 I wonder what he wants to do with it.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.680
 Oh, it's just a cool--

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.440
 It's the coolest Copperlight out, surely.

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.040
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.640
 I mean, you can get any sort of--

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.240
 there's a museum of poo in the Isle of White.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:26.960
 Did you know that?

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.600
 No.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.520
 Yeah, they freeze.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.400
 They liquid nitrogen.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.880
 They freeze these poo's in spheres.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.520
 It's normal human poo's in the living room.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.520
 Are they accepting donations or--

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.600
 Apparently, there's a waiting list.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.240
 They're trying to get different animal poo and whatever.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.200
 We've been in contact.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.800
 So it's not a fossilized ancient poo.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.640
 It's just a dog's poo poop on the tree.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.000
 And, but-- no, no, no, they're not.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.200
 They're quite selective.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.000
 OK.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.600
 Take any old shit.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.920
 It's got to be pedigree.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.000
 Pedigree poo.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.280
 Don't want to know what the gift shop looks like.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.520
 Is it-- that's not even to the public, though, is it?

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.080
 What?

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.720
 Great.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.440
 I love white.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:01.920
 Visit.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920
 Here we come.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:11.320
 OK, it is time for a final fact of the show.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.880
 And that is Andy.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.880
 My fact is that prisoners in Siberia

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.000
 used to eat prehistoric animals they found frozen in the ice.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.160
 Is that really true?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.320
 So what kind of animals?

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:21.840
 Mammoths.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.080
 All kinds of animals.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.880
 Really?

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.720
 Dinosaur.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.560
 Dinosaur.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.080
 Who said?

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.320
 Well, OK, according to Alexander Solzzynitsyn.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320
 OK, he's reliable.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.240
 He's very reliable.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.320
 He was a prisoner in Siberia for a very long time.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.480
 A very famous Russian author.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.920
 And he wrote a book called The Gulag Archipelago.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.320
 The idea of this huge chain of islands of Gulags

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.640
 spread across Siberia.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.840
 Siberia is absolutely enormous.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.880
 And it's where Russia traditionally

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.320
 sent all of its dissidents and any troublemakers.

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.760
 And it's on the first page of his book.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:54.520
 He writes about some prisoners handing over some prehistoric

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.720
 squirrels they found, ground squirrels,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:59.480
 to the camp geologist of the camp they were in.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.280
 But he also said that on other occasions,

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:03.680
 prisoners had just devoured these things on the spot

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.120
 because they were so hungry.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.360
 Other people have disputed it.

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.320
 They've said there wouldn't be much left of a ground squirrel,

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:10.440
 even if it had been frozen.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.760
 It would have petrified gone very hard.

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.800
 So he claims it.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.000
 Other people have said, is this possible?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:17.760
 They get hard like wood.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.200
 Maybe they were just fish that had been stuck in a frozen river.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.760
 But it's possible, yeah.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.280
 Yeah.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.520
 So there have been lots of reports for hundreds of years

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.920
 of people eating prehistoric animals, haven't they?

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.480
 Which I think people say are mostly apocryphal

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.040
 and it's often mammoths.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.120
 Well, they did, when the baby mammoth.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.920
 So when the N.A. and they defrosted

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.320
 and all the blood started leaking out, there was--

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.080
 and I don't know if they actually took from that one,

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.960
 but they have eaten bits of mammoth.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.760
 Was that the one that was found quite a couple of years ago?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760
 Yeah.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.280
 Who would they--

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.320
 The researchers?

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:47.960
 Oh.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.320
 Yeah, it was like a big thing.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.680
 And that's pretty--

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.000
 Is that risky thing to do?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
 I mean--

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.120
 If the animal is frozen and it's kept constantly

00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:00.080
 with a zero degrees, it's fine, which doesn't happen

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.800
 basically in the environment, so that's what--

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.480
 But if it goes up and down in temperatures

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.840
 and it defrosts and then re-freezes,

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.480
 that's when you're getting all the mold in the bacteria,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.960
 being actually frozen into this specimen.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:12.680
 So that's when you can get all sorts of craziness.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.360
 But if you heat it in the microwave for a minute,

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360
 that's actually fine.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.280
 Because the average mammoth is going to fit in a microwave.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.080
 Yeah.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080
 There was-- was it--

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.120
 Alexei Tickanov has tried mammoth.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.160
 I think he might have been one of the zoologists

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.320
 on that expedition.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.040
 Or anyway, he said he's tasted mammoth.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.360
 And it was awful.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.000
 It tasted like meat left too long in a freezer.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:31.520
 I mean--

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.160
 Which--

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.160
 We're trying to do it, that's amazing.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.800
 Just on things found in ice, I read a really cool story

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.840
 that in 2010, researchers were looking

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.800
 in Shackleton's base camp.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.120
 And they found underneath the floorboards

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.520
 a crate of old whiskey.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.000
 And they brought it up, and it was frozen.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.160
 But when they were defrosting it,

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.680
 and they were swirling around the bottles,

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.880
 they could hear liquid inside.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.120
 So the whiskey was still usable.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.160
 Now, obviously, they were never going to drink it.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.680
 But the particular whiskey that was there

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.680
 was from a company called McKinley.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.160
 And they'd lost the recipe since.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.680
 So basically, we had the recipe again of a lost whiskey.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:12.000
 So what they did was they flew it over to Scotland.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.240
 And there's a new company called Wyatt and McKay,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.520
 who bought McKinley.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.840
 And they put syringes through the cork,

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.520
 and they managed to get the whiskey out.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.840
 And they managed to replicate the recipe

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.720
 of what that long-lost whiskey recipe was.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.200
 And they made 50,000 bottles.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:32.520
 So they sold it as a limited edition, $157 American per bottle.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:33.600
 It's not limited, is it?

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:34.120
 Yeah.

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.200
 You know, when you get something limited edition,

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.160
 you think, God, it's only me and tell not the people.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.200
 I guess everything is a limited edition, isn't it?

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.880
 Because no one's ever made an infinite number of anything, yes.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.440
 But so then they sent the bottles back.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.800
 To the base.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.320
 So it's still there as part of what was left out.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.400
 Oh, what did they call it?

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.440
 Ooh, I don't know.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.040
 I think they called it just what it was.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.640
 OK, they didn't call it Shackleton.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.480
 No, they shouldn't.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.880
 The American audience would have loved that.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.360
 Yeah.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.520
 Just on these ancient animals that

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.640
 have been found in the permafrost and things like this.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.280
 So one really useful thing is squirrels.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.040
 Because they made nests.

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:12.800
 And they made nests of all the local flora.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:19.280
 And so it's like a densely packed nest full of the kind of species

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.560
 that you would have had growing in the ice age.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.040
 To freeze in her berry.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.320
 Yeah, so you've got all these different species just gathered

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:27.560
 very conveniently in one place for the scientists to get to it.

00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560
 That's really good.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560
 Yeah, that's great.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.880
 And this is the amazing thing.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.720
 A few years ago, in 2012, scientists

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.080
 grew the most ancient living organism, multicellular,

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.160
 on the planet.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.520
 It's a plant, a little plant called sylene stenophila.

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.240
 And it was brought back to life by these seeds

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.680
 that the squirrels put in their nest.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.800
 The seeds were 31 and 1/2,000 years old.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.760
 And we grew them into a plant.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.520
 And they still work.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.720
 And now we have lots of these things.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:55.880
 And it's quite beautiful, isn't it?

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.680
 Is that really delicate looking white flower?

00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.520
 I think so, yeah.

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.520
 It's over the white flower on top.

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.680
 Yeah, it's really lovely.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:02.480
 Wow, that's amazing.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.520
 Yeah, that's incredible.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.840
 Can I ask a quick question about,

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.960
 so has the Natural History Museum got a woolly mammoth?

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.760
 That's ever been sort of thawed out of the ice?

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.080
 I don't believe we have any.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.880
 And the one that came to us to visit,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.000
 and everyone got to see, went back again.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.680
 OK.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.360
 So if that, yeah, you can look, but--

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.640
 Yeah, really, apparently 1% only of the woolly mammoths

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.200
 that get dug out of the permafrost,

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.760
 all that thawed out of the permafrost ends up

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.480
 and end up in scientific hands.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.760
 Interest in the elephant tusks,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.800
 acytes, mammoth tusks aren't.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:39.000
 So that they're not protected in terms of under the, yes.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:39.760
 So you're not--

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.400
 Well, because they're not considered fair enough.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.960
 I mean, you can't really protect the mammoths any more, can you?

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.480
 But you can stop the tusks from getting into the wrong hands, right?

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.840
 You can say this is protected as in a museum, has to have that.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:50.880
 But we haven't got legislation for that.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.200
 Really?

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.640
 On other old foods that have been eaten,

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.320
 there's bog butter.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.920
 Bog butter is a way that people used to store butter,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.160
 and they would put it in bogs.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.880
 This is especially in Scotland and Ireland,

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.080
 and it would be preserved.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.840
 And I think recently we found 300 packs of bog butter,

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.880
 so there was a big uncovering in a swamp in Ireland.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.680
 And it was up to 1,400 years old.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.640
 And this woman called Helen Lucy Burke,

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.840
 who I think is a journalist,

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.640
 went to the museum where all this bog butter was on display,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.960
 1,400 years old, and it was being suspended on a plinth.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.200
 And it's, yeah, it's like cheesy, lardy butter,

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.080
 and she just grabbed a bit of it and ate it, which is quite cool.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:31.040
 And she said it wasn't disgusting.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:31.720
 It wasn't very nice.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.160
 It was cheesy, ripe, and athletes' footy.

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.800
 I mean, but that sentence would be disgusting enough

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.280
 if you had a friend who just grabbed a bunch of butter,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.440
 and it's not that eating it.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.320
 So, like, what did she have it on anything?

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.520
 Did she have toast with her?

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.480
 Just on its own.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.720
 I think it was quite solidified by that point, maybe.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.880
 All right, like a biscuit.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.440
 I quite like butter, just by itself.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.960
 Yeah, but you wouldn't just stick your hands up.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.120
 I agree with you.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.960
 You're kidding.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.680
 I just, it's one of those things that you can't.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.200
 I don't like chocolate.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.240
 I like butter.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.040
 All right.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:35:59.720
 Which is healthier?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.560
 Just eating chocolate or just eating butter?

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.360
 Both are bad.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.360
 Both are bad.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.880
 They're good and small amounts.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:06.840
 It's not like I have a pack of butter.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:08.120
 Who would die first?

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.800
 You only allow to eat butter or me only allow to eat chocolate.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.400
 Well, at this rate, chocolate's dying out,

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.680
 so you would have the worst sort.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.960
 Which, what?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.840
 Chocolate's dying out?

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.960
 It's a problem, isn't there?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.000
 There is, because the pollinator's dying out.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.440
 And you know what the pollinator is?

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:22.240
 It's a fly.

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.880
 It's a one-specific fly, then.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.360
 Well, we think there's about 14 species.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.040
 We don't know.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040
 Well, can't you bring them back?

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040
 Isn't this what you do?

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.080
 No, it's you're creating a habitat problem for them.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:30.960
 I don't blame me.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.200
 I'm just saying, it's you people with your mastermind

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.160
 of chocolate, you've gone out there,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.400
 and you're like, OK, let's say our monocultures.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.680
 The adults have come along and they're like,

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:39.720
 oh, don't like this.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.320
 Oh, so they're genuinely like, this is limited stock.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.560
 Like, this is an actual limited stock of this and there.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:47.640
 Stick it in a bog, and then you'll be fine.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.160
 OK.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.200
 Wow.

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.840
 There's this very-- by the way, our mosquitos flies.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.800
 Yes.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.800
 OK.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.920
 I thought that might be something else.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.320
 Is a daddy long legs a fly?

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.040
 Ah, what are you calling a daddy long legs?

00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:58.920
 Oh, there are two, aren't there?

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.040
 I mean-- No, there's three now.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:01.960
 They've added a third one, just for fun.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.000
 So, you know, this is why I shouldn't use common names

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:04.720
 or anything.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.920
 So you've got the daddy long legs, the flying thing,

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.480
 which is a crane fly, true fly.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.320
 That's the one.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.880
 The second one is a pillion, which a harvestman.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.080
 And the third type is the daddy long legs spider,

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.600
 which is the one that-- excuse to be called a cellar spider.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.120
 It's the one that hangs around in your living room.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.280
 Oh, it's a very spindly one.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.440
 And then it went, yeah, OK, and that can't fly either.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.200
 No, but that's a spider, so that is venomous.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.200
 Are there any spiders that can fly?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.320
 Nope.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.360
 Unless they're using ferretic behavior.

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.680
 Oh, I'm kind of lying.

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.000
 Because balloon spiders, they balloon.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.560
 So they exist, so yeah.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.760
 So they can get up into really high up.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.520
 Wait, hang on, how did-- what, they float up?

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:40.840
 No, they were still.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.680
 It's the silks.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.480
 Do you remember?

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.760
 They're reverse parachuters.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:45.760
 Yeah.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.280
 That's like saying, the weekend fly, isn't it?

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.040
 That's like saying, "We can fly," because we climb up.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.120
 We rope climb, isn't it?

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:50.960
 Oh, Bill.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.800
 Oh, what?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.200
 Yeah, because they're using ferret.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.600
 It's just literally released into the wind.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.120
 Yeah.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.360
 And because it's so thin and they're so small,

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.440
 the viscosity of the air is such that they can go forth.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.560
 And it's them.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:06.760
 If the only equivalent is if I let out my sperm, well-sized sperm,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.920
 and that caught the wind, it dragged me to the end

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.800
 before you saying bolt got there.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.760
 You rode on it.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.880
 Yeah, exactly.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.800
 It's extraordinary scenes at today's Olympics.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:24.320
 OK, that's it.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.320
 That's all of our facts.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.680

 Why not go to the Natural History Museum?

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.840
 Buy it from the shop there.
