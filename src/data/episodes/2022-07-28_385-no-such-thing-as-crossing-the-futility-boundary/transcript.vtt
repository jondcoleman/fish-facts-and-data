00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
 Hi everyone, welcome to this week's episode of no such thing as a fish coming to you live from my editing suite straight to your ears

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.220
 We are all on holiday this week having a nice relaxing time

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.600
 Enjoying the great British weather and so what we have for you is one of our

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.840
 Compilation specials loads of fun bits from the last few months that didn't quite fit into the show

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 But a really funny really stupid really just does messing around these are always my favorite episodes by the way

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.160
 I absolutely love them

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.400
 I genuinely think some of the best bits of fish that we've ever done have been in these conflations

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.240
 But it's all sorts of bits all sorts of subjects loads and loads of facts loads and loads of fun

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.580
 We really really hope you enjoy it. We will be back next week with a normal episode with a very special guest

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.120
 More on that next week, but for now I guess all there is to say is on with the podcast

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:18.160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish a weekly podcast coming to you from four undisclosed

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 Locations in the UK. My name is Dan Shriver

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.600
 I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski James Harkin and Andrew Hunter Murray and once again

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.760
 We have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in a particular order here

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 We go starting with you Andy

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.680
 My fact is that after his death Anton Chekov was brought back to Russia in a refrigerator wait in over fridge awaited well

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
 Well

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.760
 Bugs Bunny's gonna be doing my thing for me. I had a friend who used to sleep with his eyes open, so

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.920
 Every now and then we'd be sat in the front room like you know

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.720
 Playing video games or something or just chatting and then we'd be like oh rich hasn't spoken for a while

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.600
 He'd be sat there with his eyes open and it turned out he was asleep

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.520
 Are you sure he wasn't just trying to avoid talking to you

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 Clever way

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.320
 He did sometimes talk in his sleep and say shut the fuck up James

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:28.840
 We had just in the sort of modern-day theater version of that James and I got a behind-the-scenes tours of the Harry Potter and the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.400
 Curse child set which is the play and in the West End in London and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.600
 It we were told at the time that it takes about a million pounds a week to run the whole production

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.080
 There were so many different little bits and pieces that go into putting it on and one of the things that they have is

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.240
 There's a moment where

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.120
 Two of the characters need to emerge from a lake and they've built under the stage a massive water tank

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.120
 So on the payroll for the Curse child are two scuba instructors who go inside with these kid actors

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.560
 And they have a they have a little mouth breather on and then they come up through the stage

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.760
 Completely soaking so it's like this body of water, but that's how

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.360
 Can I just say I was on this tour with Dan and he's talking rubbish. It's all magic

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.480
 Completely magic and the reason I know that is because when you go backstage you can see all the ones

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.240
 backstage and they're plugged in to the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.760
 Electricity so you know that it's definitely working. I didn't know you needed to charge a wand. They're all Bluetooth

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 No

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.320
 Sorry, I don't understand why these children had to be submerged in water before they came on stage

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.120
 Was it just so they looked wet? No, no, they came up through the floor of the stage

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.080
 So it was a tank built underneath the stage. So they were coming up

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080
 You but why are they in that right?

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.640
 Plot coming out of a lake. Oh

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.740
 They're coming out of a lake. Sorry. I missed that bit. Right. Well, that makes sense. I

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.720
 Actually went to see the play so I should remember that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.440
 But I did leave at the interval

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.000
 It's literally just before the interval. It's the last thing you would have seen

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.040
 Well, I remember because Anna, you came out saying there's a fucking lake in this one alone a bullshit. Why are they so wet?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.240
 Why are they so wet?

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.060
 I don't understand how they did it. I can't my brain can't fathom

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.960
 Do you know who is the highest grossing actor of all time?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 I got sent this by our friend Justin Gaynor on email yesterday. He asked me if I knew

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.760
 So the highest grossing actor so what this means is if you're in a movie

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.800
 They add the entire amount of money that that movie has made to your amount

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.240
 So it's brilliant who's been in the most very very high-profile movies in history

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.800
 I think it was the guy who I mentioned a few episodes ago Frank Welker

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.220
 Scooby-Doo and the Grinch he did the dog in the Grinch think about that the Grinch is big

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.720
 But it's not the biggest think about the biggest movies of all time

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:09.820
 Andy Circus has been in the biggest movies of all time as CGI guy. So what's your what are you naming as biggest movies there?

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.640
 Avatar Lord of the Rings

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.120
 think bigger

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 Bigger than that even

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.200
 King Kong and Lord of the Rings Star Wars I guess have we heard of this person or is it?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.160
 Yeah, you've had a few extra and it's got the best chance to get this I would say but you are my is it someone who plays

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.460
 Harrison Fredby background II

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.520
 Yes, yes

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.940
 Someone in Jackie Chan films. No, no thick. What's the biggest grossing movie of all time? I was Titanic. No

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.080
 Ben her

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.060
 It's a new movie with the wind is fair, but I'm talking about actual money's adventures

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.600
 Okay, and almost all of the top 20 are Marvel films base. Yes, so Robert Downey Jr. Is no

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.760
 Someone who's been in all of them John Favreau. No

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.440
 Samuel L. Jackson. He's that he's number two. He's number two, but he's not been in all of them is a Stan Lee Stan Lee

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:19.240
 Because he is in a tiny cameo in every single Marvel movie up until he died and the couple after he died as well

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.760
 And so if you add up all of those amounts, then he is the biggest of all time

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.760
 And he was in more rats as well Kevin Smith's movie

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.880
 I'm not sure if he was in Little Doritz, but he might have been

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.320
 At the moment right now there are 200 spy albatrosses in the world

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.680
 Which are flying around logging illegal fishing vessels. This is very cool

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.200
 Fishermen hate albatrosses famously

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.720
 They do the H and mariner and stuff. So now they have good reason to hate them. They do have good reason. Yeah

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.760
 The French National Center for Scientific Research

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.000
 It fitted them with little GPS trackers because it's like there are so many illegal fishing boats out there

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:09.520
 But they and they switch off their their unique ID systems to try and take over all by all fishing boats

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.920
 Have a sort of radio ID system and if you're fishing in illegal waters, then you turn it off

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.920
 But the the birds cover so much ground

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.360
 You know, they can see a fishing boat from 20 miles away and they can pick up the the GPS signals that these

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.080
 boats aren't able to switch off and in the first six months of the trial

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 They found 353 fishing vessels in that time of which one third had their ID systems switched off

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.780
 Implying that they were up to no good and fishing in illegal waters. So this could be a this could be a useful

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.360
 Technique and do they so but they're doing it unwillingly the albatrosses, right?

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.840
 I think they ever get together and say I hate this bloody, you know monitoring collar. They've put on me

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.080
 It's a real it's a real albatross around my neck

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.760
 Very good. They find that very offensive actually Anna

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.520
 Didn't see for such a long time where you were going with that. I knew I'd have to see it all the way through it was

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.840
 It's just not quite common parlance enough that you don't have to finish it off

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.640
 Um, there's only one other thing I know about cheetahs. Um, and it's that this is a really strange thing

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.280
 It's that um, if you if you have cheetahs in a zoo, you have to be really careful to pick up their poos because

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.720
 They there's a particular disease which is spread via cheetah feces and normally they have massive ranges

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.560
 And you know, they never come across their own poos again. Well, obviously that's not the case in a zoo

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.800
 um, but in the wild

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.520
 Scientists study them by their poos and but it's a real problem because cheetah families all poo at the same time

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:40.800
 So if well, they do say a family that poos together stays together, don't they?

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.320
 It's really a nightmare. So you've got a cheetah family

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.040
 You're a scientist observing them and it gives you the dna and you can work out who's fathered whom

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.600
 Which is really interesting because cheetah females make with lots of different males and then produce a letter

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.720
 You know, you can have three different cubs in a letter by different three different fathers

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.920
 So it's useful to know who's fathered whom for your studies

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.200
 But obviously they spread out and do their mass poo at the same time

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.440
 You have to photograph all the cheetahs as they poo you have to map the poos

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.320
 Then you have to assign the right poo to the right cheetah and then you can study them by the dna

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.160
 I remember growing up in quite a large family and every morning it was a bit of a stress to see

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.560
 Who could get in for a shower first

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.320
 Imagine the jeopardy if you all have to poo at the same time

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.880
 That is oh my god, thank you

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.360
 If I've just had a vindaloo

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.400
 And I you know, I've got my seven siblings there and I'm saying I'm absolutely desperate guys. Are you ready yet?

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.320
 Well, I have to wait sort of seven hours until one of them is managing to crimp one out

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.840
 It's very stressful

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:47.680
 And then do you see that's why sometimes when you're wandering through Africa you see bags hanging on trees, don't you?

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.360
 Yeah, the cheetah scientists who've left those poo bags there and they always claim they're going to come back and pick them up

00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:00.080
 You know in recent podcasts and I was mentioning to us how Stephen king is the master of just taking anything

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.840
 And turning it into a horror story no matter how ridiculous. He just knows how to do it

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.360
 So have you guys heard of the Stephen king story the mangler?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.440
 No, no, and this this was made into a movie

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.160
 Um, the story is about a police detective investigating a sudden rash of deaths caused by an industrial laundry press

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.200
 And this is a laundry press that has become possessed by a demon

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:29.920
 So the the villain in this actual story is a laundry press itself going around killing people. Yeah

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.240
 Um, he can go around

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:39.200
 Well, actually he's more interesting to me. He's in he's in he's in his is in laundry room

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.640
 So no, uh, so you're safe if you don't go in the laundry room

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.440
 Yeah, that's a good strap line for the film

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.400
 In fact, I suppose you're you're kind of probably safe as long as you don't put yourself into the mango

00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.000
 Right. Yeah, it's not it can't really be able to the mango must have some kind of independent movement where it can attack you

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.360
 Right. How how's it might it's well, it might know it might lure you in it might be like

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.080
 Hey, hey come you know, it might it might speak and get you to go to it or something like that

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.120
 But I see what you're saying james. It's like we're all we're all safe from charles bronson unless we go into his cell

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.480
 Like that's you're right. Just don't go into his cell. It's a terrifying thought to leave us all with

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.640
 Well, they were they were very dangerous though mangles

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.920
 So in a way, this sounds like it was more historical documentary than his classic horror

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.120
 Um, they were people used to get injured all the time

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.280
 I was reading a book that was called save women's lives the history of washing machines

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:43.520
 Uh, which was written in 2003 about how um, and it went it was a by a guy who runs a museum about washing machines

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.680
 And he said whenever he showed people around at least one older person would reveal a scar they had for a mangle

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.560
 At some point so every you know every time he had one woman who was like

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.320
 Oh, yeah and revealed a huge bald patch on her head from where she was scalped by it

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:03.040
 Because they'd be steam powered quite often and then electric of course. So you couldn't stop them

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.760
 So if you got your hair caught in a mangle, that's your scalp

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.840
 Then why are all these people who presumably have PTSD from being mangled in a mangle going to a mangle museum?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.120
 It's um stock on syndrome, isn't it?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.560
 They've fallen in love with their mangler

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.360
 Wow, you see Stephen King finger on the pulse. There's obviously a huge market for this

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.680
 I gotta say that honestly like you always tell us how great Stephen King is and then you regale us with some bullshit story

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.080
 That makes no sense at all

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:40.800
 Diane Keaton just a bit of celebrity trivia. Yeah, Diane Keaton wore clothes pegs on her nose to try and make it thinner

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.960
 Never had any surgery plastic surgery, but in many ways. This is a kind of surgery

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:53.200
 She said in an interview that she did it and the only other person I can find who ever did that was meg and little women

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.640
 Who used to sleep every night with a peg on her nose to make her nose thinner? I don't think it worked for either of them

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.600
 But she must have got the idea from little women, right? That's but unless she got it from a cartoon

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.960
 Because that's the only other people I could think could do that. Yeah, which pegs on this when she was a child, Anna

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.520
 No, no when she was a young woman. Yeah, if you watch Annie Hall again, Andy, you'll see

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.240
 Diane Keaton has a peg on her nose

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.360
 Not the new ones. They've CGI'd it out. But yeah the original

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:25.280
 Anna, did you read that fact while reading about sylvio saba by any chance?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.320
 I didn't actually

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.120
 Well, he's got a he can teach

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.920
 Meg

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.200
 From little women and Diane Keaton

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.920
 I think I'll do because he has the record for the most clothes pegs on his face at the same time in one minute

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.240
 Actually, the most clothes pegs added to the face within a minute. All right. Has it a guess?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.840
 Uh

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.280
 Well, I don't think maybe my skin isn't stretchy enough

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.080
 But I can only imagine being able to get three or four on mine before it gets too stretched out

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.120
 I'm going to be honest the Guinness World Record is higher

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.200
 Yeah, but I didn't expect whether you asked me or when I said what I could do I wasn't thinking well, you know

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.600
 When you say how fast did Usain Bolt run the 100 meters? I don't think well

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.560
 I could do it in about 15 seconds. So probably about the same if it's a world record holder

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.920
 It's going to be better than me. It is better. It is five

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.640
 five

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.640
 Okay, let's be serious seven

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.840
 Okay, thanks guys. Um, it's 51 in a minute 51. That's almost one a second

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.320
 I know and I'm amazed at just the speed of adding them never mind how stretchy his skin is

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.160
 Yeah, but um, he he has a bit of form because he's one of these guys who has loads and loads of records

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.720
 So he's also got he's got about 200 records

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.160
 He's got the record for most underpants pulled on in 30 seconds

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.600
 Um, you can actually do both of those records at the same time if you had an outdoor clothesline, couldn't you?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.040
 I was really about russian dances and russian balls

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:56.880
 Um, they had a ball season in russia which lasted from christmas until masslennitsa, which is like pancake day

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.640
 It was brought in by peter the great

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.320
 So they were compulsory if you're in high society you had to go to these balls

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.560
 The only way is if you had a serious illness or you were in mourning you could miss the ball

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.640
 But otherwise you had to do it

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.120
 And then you would do all of these dances you would start with the waltz and then you would do a hungarian dance

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.800
 Then you'd do another dance another dance and then the final one was the mesurka

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:22.000
 Which was like a big russian dance where everyone puts their arms around each other, but then you pair off as well

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.880
 Uh, and of course anyone who's read anica rena will be very familiar with that kind of thing because of course, um

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.080
 When ana came into the ball and she danced with alexie. That was kind of the big

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.600
 Sorry, that's a bit of a spoiler. Don't put don't push your luck james mentioned

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:48.320
 There used to be cheaters in america

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:56.480
 Like not pet cheaters, but um real kind of wild cheaters. Uh, well, they're false cheaters, but they're kind of very similar

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.920
 And they're called mirror. See mirror synonyx

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:06.160
 They were known as but they died out and the only reason we know about them is because they have in

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.720
 Um north america they have pronghorn

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.200
 And pronghorn are really really fast and they move in lots of directions and stuff like that

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.640
 And the only way that they could have evolved to have run and dodge

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.520
 And kind of jump around is if there had been a predator that was chasing after them

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.560
 And so they realized that there must be this other thing and so they called it a mirror synonyx

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.200
 That's bizarre cheetah. Yeah

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.920
 And do we have evidence that this cheetah cheetah existed?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.880
 They haven't quite found the bones or anything yet, but they just have inferred that there must have been a predator

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.040
 That was faster than these pronghorn otherwise. Why would they evolve to a get so fast?

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.800
 Does it's fun? I think that's a big inference. It's fun

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.800
 It's fun going fast. Why do people buy lamborghini's?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.760
 Yeah, well there used to be a predator that had even faster cars than us

00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.800
 That used to come after us and that's why we evolved lamborghini's. I didn't know that

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:08.480
 Can I quickly tell you one thing? I don't think it'll go anywhere, but um, the first polish language

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.600
 Encyclopedia, I just read the other day. I was called noe atene

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:21.040
 Which meant new Athens and their definition of the word horse is everyone knows what a horse is

00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.480
 [Laughter]

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:32.640
 That's it feels like that was the last article they had to write and they just didn't have the will to do it properly anymore

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.040
 It's such a good thing, but apparently and I don't know any Polish obviously, but um, apparently

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:46.560
 Everyone knows what a horse is has become kind of a phrase to mean something that is more obvious than it seems

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.400
 Like it looks like a really technical thing, but actually it's really simple

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.600
 So, but you still know encyclopedia entry it became a sort of in-joke in Poland. Exactly. That is so good

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:04.000
 There was a um website um movies from men it's called that did a list they went through

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.160
 350 films and they did a death count compiling the deadliest actor list

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.400
 And this was a few years ago. So it might have changed. I don't know if the expendable movies have been used in this, but um

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.800
 So, you know aliens

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:25.040
 We've driven to go into all these incel websites

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:34.400
 There's a top 10 list and who do you think has more kills? Is it Schwarzenegger or Stallone?

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.440
 Well, I would have said Schwarzenegger personally

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:43.200
 I think so too. There are a couple of unbelievably silly sort of commando films where so I'll say Schwarzenegger too

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.240
 I know you're not allowed to guess on this because

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:56.560
 So it is Schwarzenegger who has as far as I can tell 842 kills

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.120
 He ranks number four on the list number six on the list. Can we guess?

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:08.000
 Yeah, yeah go for it. Okay. We heard of number one. Oh and Stallone, by the way has 786 so

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:15.760
 It's um, it's not a huge difference between the two of them. Is it but yeah, who's in at number one with 1296 kills

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:23.040
 I would say it's Moff Tarkin in Star Wars who blows up the planet of Alderaan of course, which I'm guessing now has a very much lower

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.360
 population than previously imagined

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:31.680
 Um, okay killing an entire planet. That's good. What about Thanos? Oh, yeah

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.280
 um

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.000
 I don't know. I can't imagine who'd get it's a dan. You're someone in a war someone in war films, right?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.920
 It can't you can't be including pressing a button on a bomb, right? Otherwise. Yeah, I think this is I think gotta be hand-to-hand

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:47.760
 Hand-to-hand almost so I'll give you who's a bunch. I'll give you three and two

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.120
 Number two is Dolph Lundgren with 919

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.600
 Two is jet lee with 1076. Is it that guy you like? I know he'll be yeah bruce lee

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.320
 Bruce lee must be one. He does not appear on the list. Oh someone like someone who played a famous. Oh jackie chan

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.440
 I mean jackie chan. Yeah. No jackie chan doesn't appear on the list either

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.120
 Is it someone who pacifists jackie chan likes to keep people alive? Yeah, okay?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.280
 Um, is it picochoo from detective?

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:20.560
 Yeah, there was a bloodbath at movie. I really regret taking my three-year-old to that

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:26.320
 Is it forever? I mean how surprising are we going? Let me give the answer the answer is

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.960
 Mila Djokovic

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.000
 The only woman to appear on the list of the top 10 in the man list

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.960
 With 1290. Oh that's sticking one to the incels, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, are we talking about evil?

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.720
 Resident evil yeah, six resident evil films all of which I've seen

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:50.640
 Have you they're great. They're so good. You're the one who tallied up the kills for the site

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.200
 Well, a lot of them are zombies in that those films so but I guess I guess that counts. That's it. I don't know

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.840
 Yeah, I don't know what criteria movies for men use

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:09.440
 Regresses there are a search, do you think?

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:15.440
 I had pineapple last night for dinner by sheer coincidence with and the reason I I had it actually with um

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.760
 Caramel sauce poured on top that we received as a Christmas present from some people that we work with Anna. Are you okay?

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:27.040
 Sorry, that just sounds like a meal of last resort is what I'm trying to say

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.720
 Like we'll use the Christmas caramel sauce and pour it on top of the pineapple

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.280
 I mean, it does feel like you had a certain amount of food at Christmas two months ago

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.040
 And you're getting to the really last bits of the Christmas buffet

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.640
 It definitely has been there for a while. It was the beginning of December

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.680
 They sent it I because I hate waste, you know and the pineapple was just going off because no one wants to eat a pineapple

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.480
 Um, that's been sitting in our fruit bowl for two weeks because it gets delivered with the fruit delivery

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.200
 And this is why you know, there's this thing where um in the 1700s

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.440
 People didn't eat pineapples because they were so treasured. They just used them for decoration

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.240
 But I think it's just because there's such an ass to break into you can't be bothered. Yes

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.240
 They are a bit of a pain

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:14.640
 I always I uh, this is not going to go in but I always make um like a green curry and put it inside the pineapple

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.960
 Right, so you scoop out all the pineapple stuff and then you put the green curry inside

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:24.320
 But it is unbelievably difficult to scoop out. It's all right if you slice it up

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.760
 It's not that hard, but if you're trying to scoop out the inside, it's completely impossible

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.000
 Do eat the pineapple on the side pineapple goes in the curry as well very nice very nice

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.640
 And then I save some of it and usually have it with like meats the next day when I use sweet meat

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.800
 Because like it goes well with gammon and stuff, doesn't it? Hmm. Yeah classic

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.680
 anyway

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.480
 Join us join us next week for cooking with harkin

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.120
 Yeah

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.200
 That's funny. Um

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.680
 Who who takes the most uh naps on the planet national in national terms?

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.880
 Well, I would have thought like the spaniards maybe yes

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.760
 Spain has such a

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:06.720
 Reputation for their siesta's and it's not born out almost 60 never have a siesta

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:12.080
 um Spanish working hours are longer and they tend to sleep a bit less than the rest of europe

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:18.080
 And do you know whose fault it is? Uh, was it like the nazis they're usually supplied for everything, aren't they?

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.040
 Yeah, it was it was the nazis

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.880
 It's the fascists, but it's the spanish fascists presumably

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:30.640
 Actually, no, it's the german fascists in cahoots with the spanish fascists. So in 1942

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.120
 general franco

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.160
 Fascist yeah changed the country's clocks in spain to match berlin's time zone in solidarity with hitler

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:46.560
 And uh, no one ever changed them back and so the spain is on central european time or european central time

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:54.080
 Which is the same as warsaw 1200 miles east of there and this is a mad time zone for the country of spain to be in

00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:00.400
 Um, it's part of the reason that spanish people work. I mean also the weather and so on but um, you know

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.760
 Spanish people tend not to eat until 9 p.m. They don't go to bed before midnight

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.640
 There is a whole campaign to get spain back onto gmt

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.880
 because spain is just

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.480
 Not in the right time zone for the circadian rhythms of the people who live there. Wow

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.240
 We would have thought there's a real too strong arguments a it really doesn't work for them in terms of their circadian rhythms and b

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.000
 It's got a strong association with fascists. I know ditch it guys

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.160
 Can I say one more thing about um soap detergents seeing as this was about dad's house? Oh, yeah

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:35.200
 There is a thing at the moment in, um, europe called the cern axion solar telescope

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.360
 And it's that cern and they're trying to find these tiny particles called axions

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.400
 Uh, and axions are particles that are a little bit related to the higgs

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.920
 Bozan and things like that. They're going to help us explain what dark matter is if we find them

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.040
 They were named by a guy called frank will check

00:24:55.040 --> 00:25:01.360
 Uh, and the reason that he called them axions is because that was his favorite soap powder that he used

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.520
 And he said that it sounded a bit like a subatomic particle, doesn't it an axion kind of sounds like it

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.840
 But he said if they find them it will clean up a problem with particle physics

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.520
 Lovely

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.800
 Nice

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.960
 He's also got the best interns name ever, you know, who's going to sort this out? Oh frank will check

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:27.520
 Do the boons you have sex for pleasure or do they just have it for procreation? I don't know

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.400
 I don't know pleasure. They seem like fun loving

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.680
 Criminals well bonobos do yeah

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:40.160
 Like kind of an in between i don't know bonobo is nearly a nanogram of baboon. Well, that's why I was thinking actually

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.320
 Yeah, yeah, I think if any animal is an anagram of another animal

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.880
 I'm always disappointed when melons and lemons don't taste the same. I think they kind of should

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.280
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.120
 And they've both got boobs and knobs if you sort of break their names down they do yeah, so it's quite sexy

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.240
 Yeah, well, we've revealed a lot

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:06.960
 This is this is why lexicographers and zoologists are very different

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.240
 It's so nice to leave knowledge out there for the experts

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.600
 Any baboon expert is listening won't feel threatened by this podcast, I think

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.560
 Um, I think my favorite thing that I found out about air force one is that there was a room temperature

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:27.520
 Button a little dial that was added onto the plane and this was because president johnson when he was vice president

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:32.560
 He kept uh arguing with the crew about lowering and raising the temperature of the cabin

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.240
 He was always too cold or it's too hot

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.440
 And so they eventually got tired of this and they installed a temperature control in the conference room

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.680
 But it was fake didn't work at all

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.200
 And so he could go up and change it on his own never changed anything

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.160
 But he'd go that's better and sit down and uh think that he'd controlled the weather inside

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.800
 Yeah, okay. That's what we call gas lighting and this

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:59.760
 There was a haunted rocking chair in the 50s. Did anyone read about that?

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.040
 I read about this devils. No, it was in a blog called strange company, which I can highly recommend

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.040
 It's an unbelievably good blog

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.800
 And this was an article from the boltermos son of the april the 29th 1950 about a rocking chair with the mind of its own

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.120
 and what it was

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.800
 Is there was a family called the floyd holidays and they had a rocking chair

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:25.440
 And it just wouldn't stop rocking all the time and it just had rocked nonstop for 37 days

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.960
 And it became really really famous and was on tv in america

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:34.560
 We'd go on chat shows and these people would go on chat shows and they'd be like, yeah, we've got a rocking chair

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.080
 That won't stop rocking

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.960
 And a lot of people kind of went to visit the house

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.880
 They almost got rid of it because so many people were coming to visit this haunted rocking chair

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:49.440
 And and some people said that maybe it was um vibrations from the refrigeration motor that was

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.000
 Going off right next to it

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
 But when they moved it to another house it carried on rocking as well

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.440
 And then eventually they took it to be on tv this rocking chair and it had to go through an airport

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:08.960
 And some vandals hearing about it ripped it up and kind of looked inside it to see if there was some motors or something like that

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.600
 And it was insured for a thousand dollars

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.760
 So um, they the insurance company said well, I would give you a thousand dollars

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.800
 Or you can have seven hundred dollars and you can keep the chair and that's what they went for but it kind of stopped

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.360
 continually rocking at that point

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.320
 Uh, and we don't know why it was rocking all the time

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.800
 But most people think that perhaps it was you know

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.120
 The the legs were in a way that they never quite got in

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.320
 You know, but hang on isn't that a perpetual motion machine? Isn't that the thing we're told can't happen?

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.400
 Exactly, that's why it's mysterious. That's why it's in the newspapers. I know

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.480
 I can't believe all the world's scientists all the brilliant minds have not yet figured out this rocking chair

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.400
 I I imagine probably they they had other things to figure out but

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.680
 Basically what happened was whenever it started moving

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.360
 I assume it just took ages to stop and then other things would get it moving again

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:04.240
 And it just would carry on rocking for ages. I bet I bet they when people came to see it

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.120
 They they said right don't go in don't go into the room just yet

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.080
 Then as soon as anyone went in the chair was rocking, but also grandpa was just shuffling away from it

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.080
 Right, look there. You've seen it's rocking and no one's sitting at it, right? You better leave come on get out

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.160
 Get out. You're probably right

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.680
 Donald trump obsessed with badges apparently. Sorry. I know we all thought we'd never have to talk about him again

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.000
 And I'm bringing it back

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.920
 But there was a report near the start of his term that he from within the white house among his staff

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:38.800
 Uh, that said he would constantly be asking ryance prebruss who was his chief of staff at the time about badgers

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.600
 And was interrogating him because ryance was from wisconsin, which is the home of the american badger

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:48.080
 I think it's their state animal and he'd say things like do they have personality? Are they boring?

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:53.040
 How do they work? Are they mean to people? He was desperate to know about badgers

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.120
 Wow

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.680
 There was a badger in the white house wasn't there. I think it was roosevelt had one called josh

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.240
 I'm going from memory here

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.080
 I think yeah, right?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.600
 Teddy roosevelt. Yeah, because he had almost all animals didn't he collect he was and he had a lot of crazy pets

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.560
 I think he might have this is again also from memory

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.200
 But was he in wisconsin and like a little girl said do you want a badger?

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.400
 And he said yeah, sure and then she went away and ten minutes later came back with a badger

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.320
 And then he had to keep her or something awkward. Yeah

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.640
 Maybe trump read about that and thought if teddy gets one I want one

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:37.120
 Um, I mentioned it mainly because did you know that um the nickname that scaramucci had for ryance prebus was rancid penis?

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:44.240
 It's amazing that scaramucci only lasted 10 days in a job with his back of making friends

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:52.480
 Oh, I've got a this isn't a gross butterfly. Actually, it's just a weird sex butterfly thing

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.480
 Um, which is and it's another american one actually it's in the sierra nevada mountains

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.840
 There's a butterfly which has been discovered to be a hybrid of two completely separate species of butterfly

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.640
 which at some point shagged each other

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:12.960
 And produced fertile offspring. Oh, that's that's completely counter to the way the tree of life normally works where species split, you know

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.760
 Yeah, so this is one of a handful of cases of branches merging

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:24.000
 Wow, is this the beginning of the end? Is this when we all start contracting back down into one single?

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.560
 No

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.800
 So we're all you know

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:36.560
 This theory is from about four years ago, which is well that we're all going to evolve back into amoebas

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.480
 Oh, wow, I forgot and I'd had it before

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.160
 I'm consistent

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.960
 If not good that I forget what I've said as soon as I say it

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:53.120
 Okay, here's the thing about changing from black and white to color and back again. Yeah, this is mad

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.760
 And it's kind of I guess so james's fact is about the

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.040
 Israel removing color

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.880
 And that was done again in the uk in 1970 by itv who where the staff went on strike

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.360
 They went on a three month color strike

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:13.520
 Where they were objecting over their pay rates and so they just started making shows black and white again

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.480
 And because these are quite technical shows to be filmed they just refused to work with the color tv equipment

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:24.880
 They switched off the color tubes on the cameras. They were working with and for three months itv just had to go back to black and white because the staff were

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.520
 I know so funny. Yeah

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.880
 Wow, and then eventually they resolved the strike and they turned they were willing to make color tv shows again

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.360
 I wonder if they lost a lot of viewers in that time

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.240
 Don't know if they like you know last year when the archers

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.280
 Couldn't have covid because it seems to be run by 120 year old persons

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:49.600
 So it was just monologues for about six months and I think you know a lot of people said they would leave the show

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.400
 But their listenership has sustained and recovered. So maybe the same

00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.080
 Great news. Yeah, but it's similar right? Is neither black or white nor color actually the archers obviously

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.760
 That's what your imagination is like for me. It's just like the tv's turned off

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:11.440
 But that is true, isn't it some people is that right that some people imagine things in black and white

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.840
 I think yeah or dreaming. Yeah dreaming black and white when they grew up with black and white tv, isn't it?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.640
 James, you know that condition that you have the a-fantasia. Yeah, where you can't imagine

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.680
 What is it you can't imagine anything that are not images

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:28.640
 Images that are not there. Yeah, I can't imagine. I can't close my eyes and imagine anything

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:34.160
 I was thinking the other day it's very weird that it's called a-fantasia because disney's fantasia is one of the most

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.960
 Extravagant colorful imaginative things. Do you know what the prefix a means?

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.240
 No

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:49.360
 So absolutely not weird at all when you yeah, when you when you really break it down

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:59.440
 Hey, there was another musical knife that I found

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.600
 Which was from switzerland in the early 19th century. It's really gorgeous. It's like an early very basic swiss army knife

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.520
 Um, but it's got two blades one for fruit and one for flowers. And if you could imagine a tiny swiss army knife

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:18.480
 What's the difference between those two things? It's like you've got your fruit knife and you're trying to cut a top off the flower

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.840
 And you're like this is not working at all. I will tell you I know

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:29.840
 What it's for because the fruit one the fruit blade is guilt and that's so the fruit juice won't corrode it when you slice your lemon

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.400
 Fine. I suppose that does make sense

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.440
 Exactly. And then the flower one I guess that does there's no problem

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:41.840
 But it's got a musical mechanism inside and this is I think it's from about 1800 and it's got a little clockwork

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.720
 Barrel inside and it plays music and this was on the antique shoulder a few years ago

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.320
 Sounds incredibly annoying at the dinner table, doesn't it? And it's going to ruin the vibe if you are trying to murder someone

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.840
 If you have someone in the heart and it starts playing twinkle twinkle

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:05.360
 Is that what happens at most of your dinner parties? I know it is. Yeah, we've got a very big seller

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:15.200
 There are some industry legends of naming drugs, which I like as well

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:21.040
 Arlene tech is very famous in the biz as the woman who named Viagra

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:27.600
 That was her huge innovation. Yeah, and she did it by speaking to so Viagra is a brand name not a

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.160
 Generic name. Yeah

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.600
 And she did it by asking a group of urologists what it's like

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.960
 What it feels like for men when you've had erectile dysfunction and then it's cured

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.160
 And that one of the doctors said imagine a strong stream

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.880
 And she combined the word vigorous and the word niagra and came up with Viagra. Ah

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.800
 Yeah, really good. Yeah

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:55.280
 The u.s. Can be strict on its rules about like even brand naming, right?

00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.880
 You've got quite the strong rules of brand naming and the us seems to the us rules seem to basically say

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.040
 You're not allowed to suggest that the medicine works

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:09.840
 So there are a few things like there's a hair regrowth treatment called regain

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.720
 It's called regain in europe and the rest of the world in america

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.080
 It's called row game because you're not allowed to suggest that it's always going to cause your hair to regrow

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.200
 I think hair growth stuff is generally

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:28.640
 Oh, it's gorgeous. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, absolutely. They're done. Right. There's another one called which is a stop smoking tablet that you take

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.960
 Which is called champics

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.520
 And in america is chantix or chantix because champics is a little bit too triumphant. They're like champion

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:43.200
 Exactly, and what if we're not a champion? What if you take them and then you're back on 40 a day by the end of the week?

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.560
 It's misleading

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:50.800
 I guess it's a bit like that thing about how digestive biscuits weren't allowed to be called that in america because they don't help your

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.960
 Digestion is that right? Yeah

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.240
 It's very literal but the champion thing you should be allowed to call your

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:03.200
 Thing like awesome pill even if it's not right like you should just in theory you would have been a quack in the 18th century

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.840
 Roll up roll up come and see daniel schreiber's pills of mystery

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.240
 Stick them up your bum. It'll make you flow like diagra

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.960
 You know the song wap by cardi b. Um, I've read reports about it in the daily telegraph

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.520
 There was a republican who was going for congress this time called james p brady

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.560
 Who said that every time you heard the song it made him want to pour holy water into his ears

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:39.520
 What's wrong with this song wap? Was it it sounds so wet-ass pussy and it's about um, wow

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:47.120
 Yeah, it's it's about holy water right now. It's an extremely feminist song about women taking charge

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.120
 of their sexuality

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.680
 That's disgusting james. So that's gonna sound really bad now

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:55.680
 And holy water will only make things wetter. What you need is a holy towel

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.640
 Some holy kitchen roll perhaps

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:06.000
 Um, she credits poppie with saving her life who olive oil

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.440
 Yes, I'm not who we're talking about

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.680
 Oh down ron dolly parton. No, she credits poppie the dog with saving her life

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.320
 Oh poppie the dog, of course

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.320
 You know the second most famous poppie

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.600
 This was she was in the 1980s where she fell in love with someone

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.440
 I think didn't have any physical relationship, but she kind of you know, she was married

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.520
 But it's a long time. She fancied someone else

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:33.040
 Was upset when he didn't fancy her and she looked at her revolver and it's weird

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.520
 She's dolly part such a bubbly cheerful person

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.840
 But for a moment she looked at the little gun

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.480
 She keeps in her bedside table for when she gets burgled and she thought about

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:49.520
 She thought about killing herself and then she said she heard the little tap tap tap of poppie the dog's feet coming up the stairs

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.080
 And she took it as a message from god

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:57.280
 In fact, she told the Times in an interview. Well, you know god is dog backwards

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.520
 So I took it as a message from him

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.080
 dog's god's little

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.560
 Little pockets of friendship. He sends our way

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.480
 And it snapped her out of it. Wow. There's one thing

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.280
 Physically that we don't know about dolly

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.600
 Which is

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:15.600
 What her arms are like

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:22.480
 So she always despite wearing spending, you know, 50 years wearing very tight or very revealing costumes in lots of ways

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.920
 She's always got sleeves

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:30.320
 She's got very long sleeves on and there is a there is a conspiracy theory and even saying that I've talked about way too much

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:36.960
 There is a slight small tiny subsection of fan belief that she's absolutely covered in crazy tattoos

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.760
 you know from wrist to shoulder and

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.640
 Uh, it's possible, but she has she's been asked about it and she's denied

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:50.960
 Um, in fact, she she's quite a clever denial where she she only actually denied that she has snake tattoos

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:57.040
 So we know her arms are not covered in snake tattoos, but um, they might be there might be all sorts of other tattoos on her

00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.720
 We don't know there are other types of tattoo. Yeah, so many others

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:06.080
 I've just googled dolly parton. Yeah images. Yeah, I can see her arms

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.840
 Her arms are here. She's handy. Come on, for example

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.640
 She may have got the tattoos after she did the playboy cover recently. She was that's what I'm saying possible

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:18.800
 I'm I have to say I've now done what dan's done and maybe it's our different search preferences

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.680
 But I can't see any naked arms in any of these pictures

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.480
 All his naked arms. There we go

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:30.560
 Put in dolly parton playboy because that's a famous thing that she did and she's asked to do again for her 75th birthday

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.400
 Which has now happened and I don't think it's happened for her that she's back on the cover

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.560
 but she was a playboy model and

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.120
 And yeah her arms

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.960
 I've just googled dolly parton's arms

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:49.120
 Uh, and there are a few definitely a few images relatively recent. All right guys

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:55.520
 We don't have to just you know, she there is such a thing as arm makeup. Can I remind you? Yeah tattoos

00:40:55.520 --> 00:41:01.920
 Yeah, and I don't like us just google image searching my admittedly quite weak fact about dolly parton's arms

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.920
 I'm amazed by the fact that there's such a thing as arm makeup

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.160
 Again, please please don't google whether or not arm makeup. So I'm just gonna do that

00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:13.920
 Is there a such thing as is there a such thing as arm makeup?

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.320
 We are definitely is they do it for movies, don't they they do it for movies all the time

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.160
 Yeah, but you wouldn't sell arm makeup in a separate section of the shop to leg makeup

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.400
 Is leg makeup a thing

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.480
 I'm not saying leg makeup is a thing. I'm being just in oh no, I'm being

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.040
 I'm being corrected in real time and dan it feels horrible. I don't know how you

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.080
 It's not nice. It's long. You get used to it though. You do you eventually learn to love it

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.560
 300 more episodes of it Andy and you look tough

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:48.960
 Here's a fun thing

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.200
 About sunglasses and tanning. Oh, yeah

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.240
 There is a theory that if you don't wear sunglasses

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:59.280
 You can get a tan even though you're wearing suntan lotion and you you know wearing clothes

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.120
 so

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:03.760
 There's a theory that just exposing your eyes to light

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:08.960
 That will help you tan and this is really this is based on an experiment in mice

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:14.400
 So I don't think an equivalence has been done on humans as far as I know. Basically, I can tell if a mouse is tanned

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:22.000
 Well, you just shave it. I guess you shave it. Yeah, thanks. Sorry. So this was an experiment in 2000

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.880
 And the scientists involved they they dressed mice in tiny suits of aluminium foil

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.760
 Adorable middle little mini mouse armour and they gave them holes for the eyes

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.800
 Okay

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.720
 So they had your armour mice and then they had normal mice and they exposed both sets of mice to UV light for a year

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.160
 And then they looked at their skin and it turned out that both sets of mice

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.360
 Even the ones which had been wearing suits of armour all year

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:52.640
 Had similar amounts of melanin in their skin implying that it was the exposure of the eyes

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.360
 That was the thing which was giving them the melanin

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.120
 Does that also if you take that in the other direction, if you go sunbathing with your eyes closed, then you won't get a tan

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.800
 Yeah

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:07.280
 People have suggested that no people think and it's it's well because it's online

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.200
 I think probably off the back of this experiment people think that if you wear sunglasses

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:17.520
 Then your body will be tricked into thinking that it's not sunny and so it will not produce melanin and so you'll get burned really badly

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.800
 And I so and it's weird. No one's properly debunked this yet

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.080
 But there was a molecular biologist who has asked this who said that it is not your eyes

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:34.560
 At least in humans that trigger the hormone response in the pineal gland which make you produce melanin is your skin

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:41.360
 So it definitely doesn't happen in humans. I don't in mice clearly different different setup going on

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:48.320
 But don't worry wearing sunglasses is not a substitute or a counteraction of sun tan green

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.240
 I love just jumping back to andy's description quickly of the mice. It's such a fine line, isn't it between

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.640
 What you would say is animal cruelty in the kind of way you tell a story

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.200
 A lot of people would be like and for a year they dress them up in tin foil these poor mice

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.480
 But andy's sort of going it's a they look like cool little knights. They look they had a fun time

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.400
 You're the kind of guy andy they would hire

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.000
 For movies just so they can say no animals were hard during the making of this movie

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.680
 All the animals had a whale of a time in the making of this movie except the whales

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:23.760
 It was terribly mistreated

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:30.960
 I like this one. I found one drug that's called um anakinra

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.200
 Which is a balm that you put on your neck if you've just had it knocked off by a train

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.880
 It's actually for arthritis. Yeah. Oh, it's a real thing. Oh, yeah

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.720
 You never of course never lived to experience arthritis

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.400
 I found out a nice term

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.200
 This is just a bit of drug industry slang and it's when a drug is no more effective than a placebo

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.520
 And with the term for that is crossing the futility boundary

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.360
 Because literally the drug is completely pointless. It doesn't do any better than a placebo drug. So yeah

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:10.720
 You've crossed the futility boundary. So you can use that in day-to-day life now

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.760
 Hopefully we're not we can't buy many of these drugs, right? Surely they're not being approved

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.800
 Uh, oh, I just mean in day-to-day life. You can say in your own activities

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.880
 I've really crossed the futility boundary on this

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.120
 Whatever activity

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.120
 Broaden out like if you're watching a tv series in your three seasons in you're still not enjoying it

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:35.440
 Do you think we've crossed the futility boundary of this section of the podcast? I think the podcast in general some years ago

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:45.920
 The texas theme reached number six in the uk charts in 1992 and andrew lewis webber was the man behind it

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:50.160
 I bought it. I remember. Did you really? Yeah. Yeah, andrew lewis webber

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:57.760
 Composed the tune. No, he remixed it didn't he? It's a russian folks on. Yeah. Yeah, is it? It's by nicolai necrosof

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:04.160
 You speak russian james. Can you can you give us a little excerpt possibly just because I did it because I did it

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.560
 off my curly rod

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.160
 I'll try i'll try so he goes

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:27.120
 Nice one

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.440
 So angeloid webber then took that very well known traditional tune and passed it off as his own sounds very unlike him

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.040
 Oh, my goodness. Yeah, musical industry. That's just a little just a little slam from having listened to too many

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.120
 Lloyd Webber soundtracks over the years. Wow

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.280
 It's also rendering this podcast completely legally unstable

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:57.840
 Okay, that's all of our facts apologies for my singing

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:04.400
 Um, if you would like to get in contact with me and tell me how terrible my voice is you can get in touch with me

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:09.680
 On at james harkin you can get in touch with andy on at andrew hunter m

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:15.840
 You can get in touch with dan on at schreiberland and if you want to speak to ana you can email her on

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:21.120
 Podcast at qi.com. Of course, there is a group account on twitter

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:26.560
 Which is at no such thing and if you'd like to learn anything more about the show get some merchandise

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:34.160
 Maybe get some tickets to come and see us live then you can get all that information at no such thing as a fish dot com

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:37.300
 Okay, we'll see you next week. Good. Bye

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.300
 You

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.300
 You

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.300
 You

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.880
