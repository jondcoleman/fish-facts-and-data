00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hey there club fish members, Dan here. Welcome to your secret bonus bit of content. We've

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 got a compilation episode for you this week, all the outtakes from various episodes over

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.840
 the last few months. The show mainly features us four fishers, me, Andy, James and Anna,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.840
 but you will be hearing right at the end of the episode, Melanie Bracewell, who joined

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.680
 us while Anna was away for an episode. So, hope you enjoy it. Just one bit of context

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.200
 for one specific clip. When you hear me going into a fact about Napoleon, that was in reference

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.480
 to a fact that Andy did, which was thousands of soldiers who died at Waterloo were all

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.580
 turned into sugar. So that's just going to help to ease that little clip in there. Otherwise,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.000
 if you've got any questions about things we've said on this week's episode, you can always

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.880
 get us on our various social media accounts or you can email podcast@qi.com. That gets

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 sent to Andy and we can bring stuff up on a future Drop Us a Line episode. So, here we

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.000
 go. Hope you enjoy the episode and we'll see you in a couple of weeks with another club

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:22.240
 fish bonus. On with the show.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.800
 When they expand, they expand so much that if an average human man did it, their waist

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.760
 would be inflated to a circumference of three metres. Wow. That's a conference. Not diameter,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.680
 not radius. Not as impressive. It is impressive when you know that the holder of the Guinness

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.920
 World Record for the largest waist had a waist that was 302 centimetres. So, two centimetres

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.800
 much. So, pretty much that guy, he was called Walter Hudson. He was exactly as Andy would

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.400
 be if he was a puffer fish and puffed himself up. You might turn into Walter Hudson. Wow.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.560
 And you'll often see this Walter Hudson. If you go to like Ripley's Believe It or Not

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.120
 or the Skinner's Records thing, there's often going to be a statue of him. That's amazing.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.960
 Did you see that thing? It was a great thing online the other day. I think it was on Twitter.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.160
 It was a hotel bathroom and it had one of the tiles in the wall, had a hole in the middle

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.920
 of it and above was embossed in ceramic razor blades. And if you finished with your razor

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200
 blade, you just put it through that hot little slot in the tile and it just went into the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 wall. Oh, yeah. I have seen those before, but I always thought that that was a collection

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.400
 point. So, they just live in the wall. It just goes into the wall of the building and

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.680
 you never see it again. So, if they find this in 200 years, they'll say they were doing

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.560
 this for good luck. Maybe that was just cats. It was like, here's where to put your dead

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 cats when you're done with them. Shop it in the cat slot. It used to be a rule in some

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.360
 parts of France that if you had a dead cat, you had to throw it in the nearest chasm.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.160
 What? The chasm? Yeah, yeah. How many people have access to a chasm? There were a few in

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.000
 the south, but then it turned out years later that they realised that's where they were

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.520
 getting a lot of their fresh water from. Right, yeah. And so, whenever they threw the animals

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.800
 in, they were basically polluting their water supply. Nice. That's crazy. Anthony Trollup

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.240
 had a son who moved out to Australia to become a sheep farmer. So, Anthony Trollup went to

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.360
 visit him and apparently, this was the first time a major celebrity had gone to Australia

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.600
 according to a guy who's written a whole book about this. He said, "Prior to that, you only

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.160
 had people like, Darwin was there on the Beagle trip, but that was 20 years before he published

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.400
 'Origin of the Species'. So, Trollup got there and was known. He was received by Australia.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.480
 He wrote a sort of nice little poem when he arrived. He went in, he lived on the farm

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.040
 where his son was shearing sheep and managing them. And he went down mines. So, when he then

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.920
 got back to the UK, he wrote a book about Australia in which he basically just knocked

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.840
 it. He would just say, "Oh, they think their food is, they're always going on about how

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.120
 good their food is, how good all this stuff is." And Australia went completely against

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.640
 him. All the newspapers were going, "Actually, do you know what? Now that I think about it,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.960
 when he went down the mine, he was drunk." And they just absolutely, yeah, ripped him

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.920
 apart and he, yeah, just, it went from love to hate immediately.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.800
 He had an impact because I don't know what Australians working on about how good their

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.240
 food is anymore.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.680
 Did you guys read about, in the course of your research, Jonathan Sumption?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680
 No.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.920
 So, he's a very, very eminent guy. He's a lawyer. He, I think, was a Supreme Court justice,

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.800
 you know. He's really, really top British lawyer now. He has been writing a history

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.360
 of the Hundred Years War since 1979. He published the final volume last year. It took 45 years.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.000
 More than a third of the duration of the actual Hundred Years War, Jonathan Sumption spent

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.600
 writing a history of the Hundred Years War.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.280
 That's all right. It's like playing a podcast at 2.5 times the speed, isn't it?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.040
 I've worked out an interesting thing about this whole sugar thing, just to jump back

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.480
 to that quickly, which is, there's a theory that the reason Waterloo didn't go Napoleon's

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.640
 way is because he was suffering from major hemorrhoids. That's something that's often

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.440
 put out there. They say he couldn't sit on his horse. He couldn't get high enough to

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.440
 see.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.600
 No, that's what they say. They say he couldn't see. He was famously a tiny man. He'd sit

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.600
 on someone's shoulders.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.200
 I think I know where you're going with this. You're going to go to the, what they call

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.560
 those candies that you really like, the Sour Patch Kid theory.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.960
 Oh, well, no, what I was going to say was that if you put sugar on hemorrhoids, it makes

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
 them go down.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.680
 Exactly. So I was thinking as a tribute to the wind, you could take the sugar, apply

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 it to Uranus if you have hemorrhoids and really stick it to Napoleon because the fallen soldiers

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.600
 are now getting rid of the one thing that ended the war in his favor.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600
 Do you remember?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520
 I was actually good. I was even going to correct ourselves about 10 years ago when I think we

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.720
 first mentioned that fact. And I think when we were loose, we were fast and loose with

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.400
 the truth back in our glory days.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400
 What the piles think.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400
 The piles think.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 It's not true, is it?

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400
 It's true.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400
 It's very unlikely.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.960
 It's not true that necessarily it works, but it's definitely true that people do it

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960
 and that it's called that.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960
 So that's all true.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960
 Yeah.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.960
 I just mean that the polytheism.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
 The polytheism.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.640
 James, very upset at the amount of sugar you shoved on his arms.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.720
 It's definitely true, OK?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 James is recording this episode on a horse.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.520
 Just to prove it.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.720
 They might have created the original zombies with their poison.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.720
 Oh, yes.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
 I think.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.400
 Yeah, I feel like this is in Downs area because you're a fan of Wade Davis.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.400
 Yeah, Wade Davis.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.320
 He wrote a book about this serpent in the something.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320
 Wade Davis.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.320
 Who's that?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320
 Yeah.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320
 Well, so this is about zombies.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:43.120
 So the origin of our zombies comes from Haiti and they had a tradition where if you put

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.320
 a voodoo curse on someone, then they'll die and then they'll come back as undead.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.880
 But there were theories that what actually caused it was someone eating puffer fish toxin

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.760
 seeming to die and then being revitalized.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.640
 So they weren't actually dead.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.440
 They were kind of in a bit of a coma and then they came back and they were like a zombie.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.880
 A bit like a zombie, yes.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.720
 And then they were enslaved, according to this.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.320
 And Wade Davis did an investigation.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.600
 He said he'd found the formula that turned people into zombies and based it on a real

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.000
 life case that he investigated.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.920
 This was the big battle of the day was between tinfoil and wax cylinder discs and shellac

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.800
 discs, which, as James says, they're flat and they're round and they're much, they're

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.160
 like the discs we have today.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.080
 And it sounds like the wrong side one.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.080
 Oh.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.080
 I don't want to.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080
 Interesting.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.920
 Much like the Napoleonic Wars, actually.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.920
 No, no, no.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.920
 Okay.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.440
 Well, Edison was convinced that his discs were better and they did have a better sound

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440
 quality.

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.600
 So is Edison on the shellac side?

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600
 Sorry.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600
 Edison is cylinders.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600
 Wax cylinders.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600
 Wax cylinders.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.600
 And they do seem genuinely better.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.120
 There were a couple of disadvantages.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.680
 One, they couldn't have a B side.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.040
 Obviously, you could turn a vinyl, so down you put a B side on.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.840
 And secondly, the storage is more difficult because you can store discs flat.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.360
 You can't store cylinders flat.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360
 Yeah.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.360
 However, supposedly the sound quality is better on a wax cylinder than these early shellac

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360
 discs.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.600
 God, I'd love to meet the pretentious person when you're saying, you know, vinyl is such

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600
 high quality.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600
 Person in the corner.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600
 Absolutely.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.680
 Yeah, you go to your Doulston vinyl shop and the next door, the wax cylinder shop are looking

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.400
 at you going, oh, Phil and Stine.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.680
 I don't want to be rude, but I feel like we are talking to that person right now who's

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680
 giving us this fact.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.800
 I feel like you're making a case for it.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800
 Wax cylinders.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:32.120
 I'm saying maybe at the time they sounded a bit better, but just the market broke in

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 the other direction.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.320
 You know, like video and Betamax or all of those things.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.720
 You still have a lot of Betamax at home, don't you?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.800
 It's coming back.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.160
 Two other things that kind of got introduced during this period, and this is to do with

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.160
 Edward III.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.760
 So I mentioned before that the sort of the nobles and the aristocracy were speaking

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.240
 French while peasants and so on speaking English.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.600
 It was in that period that basically English became the language of England, that the French

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.240
 slowly started dipping out.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.960
 So that's the period where that happened.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.480
 And also, Edward III, it was in his reign that now that we have commons and lords with

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.320
 our parliament, that is him.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.400
 That's part of his reign.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.000
 There was the separation at that point.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 Thank God for that.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
 Two big institutions.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.040
 There was a very, really interesting study done, and I might not remember the details

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.480
 of this, but basically about names and how they dictate your success in life.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.480
 And it looked at if people's names were Norman or not.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.000
 And it basically found that today there is a direct correlation and as much as there

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.640
 ever was since 1066 in England between whether your name is Norman.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.640
 So a French origin.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.440
 So you're from the ruling classes because.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440
 Oh, right.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440
 Sorry.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.840
 I was going to say I don't really know anyone called Norman.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.840
 Sorry.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.840
 Norman Wisdom.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.840
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.840
 Yeah.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.400
 He was the prime minister for a while.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400
 Yeah.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400
 Yeah.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.400
 Very powerful.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400
 Yeah.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.400
 Sorry.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.080
 Of French origin, of French Norman origin.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080
 Right.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.200
 Anyway, and so they were the ruling classes at 1066, obviously, when France invaded and

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200
 conquered England.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.360
 And a thousand years later, people who are descended from those people are still the

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.360
 ruling classes.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360
 It's not interesting.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:16.120
 Did you guys know Buzz Aldrin, I don't think we've said this before, he has lived on a

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.120
 yellow submarine.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.120
 Didn't know that.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.600
 That's amazing.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:26.400
 He has been to the Titanic in a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine, a yellow submarine.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400
 I don't know.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400
 I don't know.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.360
 Maybe lived as a massive stretch, but he was part of a mission to raise a bit of the

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.360
 hull.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.600
 He raised up a section of the hull, which was all a bit controversial.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.880
 It was in the 90s, and it was sort of, should we leave it there, or could we raise a bit

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880
 of it up for money?

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.000
 Are they excited on the latter course?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
 Yeah.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.560
 If you were a submarine maker in the 1970s, and you would say, OK, I've got this submarine.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560
 What colour am I?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560
 Fired yellow.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560
 Fine.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.560
 Fine.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560
 Get some more yellow paint.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.120
 No one's told you we had a blue submarine in the 1970s, are they?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.120
 No.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.400
 No, that was deep camouflage as well.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.520
 Just to put context, because you have heard Wade Davis before on the show, Andy, he's

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.920
 an ethno-botanist and sort of anthropologist.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:06.920
 Mr. Poo Knife.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.920
 He's Poo Knife.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920
 He's Poo Knife.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920
 He's Mr. Poo Knife.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.720
 Should we say for newer listeners who Mr. Poo Knife is, or is there?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720
 Yeah.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.320
 He claimed that someone pooed when they were out in a very cold tundra area, shaped it

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.280
 into the knife shape.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.560
 It froze as a knife, and he cut through a dog, made a sled and rode off into the distance.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.920
 Why did he cut through a dog?

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.720
 He needed to get a sled, so he used the rib cage as a sled.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.720
 Yeah.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.300
 He needed to explain that in the story.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.300
 Yeah.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.000
 He tried to poo out enough poo to make a sled, but that wasn't going to work.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 Who pulled the sled if the dog was a sled?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.920
 I mean, one more dog.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920
 Oh.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920
 As if you're that dog.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:41.920
 It's a high pressure work day, isn't it?

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.920
 Yeah.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.920
 It's a high pressure work day, isn't it?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.480
 Well, Tony's not coming off a dinner on Friday anymore.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480
 Sorry.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.960
 He's got two live dogs.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.760
 Oh, a few live dogs, I heard that.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.900
 He's got two live dogs and a poo brewing, and he poos, shapes the poo into the knife.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:00.900
 Yeah.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.900
 Kills the dog.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.900
 Kills the dog.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:03.900
 With the poo knife.

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:04.900
 With the poo.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.900
 It feels like there's a, but it feels like there's a shorter way of doing all of this.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.900
 I don't know.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.680
 We should probably question the veracity of this story a little bit, right?

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680
 Taskmaster, isn't it?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.440
 It's like extreme taskmaster.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.640
 I would love Taskmaster.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.080
 I'm sure we might have said this before, but Dan on Taskmaster is the one who's fashioning

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.280
 out a poo for every task.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.880
 I am available, Alex Horne, whatever you need me.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.520
 This fact has altered my understanding of what neighborhood animals are in relation

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.000
 to my life now in terms of it's exactly magpies know your face and remember your face and

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.200
 they're there in your neighborhood.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.200
 They are neighbors, right?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.200
 Yeah.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.040
 And I've just never considered, I've always thought if I saw a magpie in an area, it's

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.040
 probably another magpie.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.080
 Yeah, but that, I just didn't, like.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.480
 That's not true of all animals.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.600
 Like the foxes might not remember you all day.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.240
 But cats probably would, and dogs, and so on.

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:57.440
 It's more that when I go out and I see a magpie, I always think must be a new magpie.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:58.440
 You know, like that Steve.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.440
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.240
 Instead, Steve's going, it's Dan.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.120
 Yeah, but the other thing on the other side of that is people often think that if there's

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.360
 a robin who comes to the garden every year, they're like, oh, I friend the robins back

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.080
 this year, but actually they only live for about one year a robin and they're also quite

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:18.720
 violent and tend to kill each other quite a lot over territorial arguments.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:23.600
 So usually, if you see a magpie, if you see a robin the next year, it's probably a different

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600
 one.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.680
 It might have even murdered to your previous friend.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:27.680
 Interesting.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.680
 Oh.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.680
 Merry Christmas, everyone.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:36.280
 Do you know how the puffer fish closes its eyes?

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.240
 Can fish close their eyes with an eyelid?

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.880
 It's got no eyelid, right?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.880
 But it can.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880
 Oh.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.880
 Yeah.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880
 So this is pretty amazing.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.840
 It's the opposite of a cartoon, sort of, where the eyes pop out.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:53.640
 Oh, so the puffer fish looks at an unattractive puffer fish and sucks the eyes back in.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:14:00.320
 Sucks its eyes 70% back of the depth into its head and uses the available skin to just

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.320
 squeeze shut.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.480
 Oh, what a creepy wing that would be.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.480
 Yeah.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.480
 That's really good.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.360
 70% of the size of the eye, do you mean?

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360
 Yeah.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360
 Diameter, is it?

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.360
 Yeah.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
 Diameter.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.360
 That is it.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360
 That's really, I do wish we could do some of this stuff.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.360
 Well, you can.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.360
 I've known a few people.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:22.120
 Close to me, I've had one eye and the skin does that a bit, sucks in.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.120
 You run with scissors a lot, don't you, Anna?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.560
 And, of course, she's served for a while on the Black Pearl pirate ship and you can't

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.840
 run with scissors on a pirate ship.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.520
 That's why they all got eye patches.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.200
 They're not my friends anymore.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.040
 But I think the puffer fish does break records.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.800
 I read that the 70% thing is among the greatest eye-sinking depths ever recorded in an animal.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.320
 And you know, when you read that, you just think, how many of those have they actually

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
 measured?

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.320
 When they say that, I think they've just gone, I bet this is like, who else is doing it?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.320
 He's going to fact-check this.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320
 Yeah.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.080
 Let's just say among the greatest, just in case.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.960
 A lot of people say that the Napoleon hemorrhoids couldn't sit on his horse, then came around

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.600
 from the pro-Napoleon propaganda campaign, which said he couldn't possibly have lost

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600
 the war.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.440
 He must have had a serious complaint.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.800
 And it's like, you'd think of something a bit less embarrassing than you.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.960
 Oh, he was attacked by a spurned lover, and they stabbed his thigh.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960
 Exactly.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960
 You wouldn't say he's got piles.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.960
 I'm actually very plausible for Napoleon.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.600
 There were certainly a lot of lovers in his backstory.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.600
 Is that true?

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600
 Yeah, he had a lot of mischievousness.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.440
 So all of the lovers in his backstory is actually how he got the hemorrhoids.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.920
 What are you for a son of a...

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:42.080
 Another thing that came from the Hundred Years' War, I find this really interesting, there's

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.240
 a historian called Remy Ambul who's been looking into his loads, is the Prisoners of War.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.040
 This is the first war where the phrase "prisoner of war" was ever used.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:55.560
 It was in French that it was used, and ransoming was mega, and there was a mega financial incentive

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.440
 to capture soldiers from the other side.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:02.320
 And obviously, everyone benefits in a way because it means that you are likely to sign

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.600
 up and join the army if you think that when you're captured, you're not going to be killed,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600
 you know?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.320
 There is some risk of being killed in a battle, but if you're captured, fine, you'll just

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.800
 be ransomed and you survive.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.480
 And there were big cash prizes available if you could capture someone senior from the

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.480
 other side.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.280
 Genuinely, so one archer, an English archer, captured a valuable French prisoner, and he

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.000
 earned £100 personally from that ransom.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.440
 Now the rate of earnings at the time was six pence a day, and the old system, it would

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.040
 take you 40 days to earn a quid.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.480
 So that's about ten years of earnings just by capturing one person.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.880
 On baiters, Dan.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880
 Yeah.

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.880
 Great.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.880
 Have you heard of Robin Ficker?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:41.880
 No.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.880
 Is he related to Robin Ficker?

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.880
 Who is it?

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880
 Who calls it?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.040
 Just for Bell's understanding of it.

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040
 Who calls it?

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040
 Robin Ficker.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040
 What's it?

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.040
 Anna or you?

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:53.040
 Just me?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040
 Oh, it's just it.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.040
 You know the singer, Robin Ficker.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040
 Yes.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040
 Robin Ficker is...

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.040
 He's no relation to Robin Ficker.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.040
 Sorry, it's something else.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.000
 Because it's only his first name that's the same.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
 But it sounded so...

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
 It sounded...

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
 What is it called?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Ficker.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
 Ficker.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.800
 I mean, we can also wear a red robe.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.320
 He was a fan of the Washington Bullets basketball team in the 90s.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.280
 And he was a famous Hecler or a barrack, you might say, in Australia, I guess.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.000
 He would sit behind the opposition's coaching bench with a megaphone to distract them in

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.720
 every game.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.480
 When they played the Chicago Bulls, he read aloud raunchy passages from the coach's sex-filled

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
 autobiography.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480
 That's incredible.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480
 Wow.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480
 That's good.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480
 Really good.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480
 Isn't that good?

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.880
 Don't put it in an autobiography if you don't want it to be read out with a megaphone.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.680
 Sounds like this guy really blurred the lines of what was acceptable.

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.680
 Oh, my God.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.680
 Yeah.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.680
 I'm with you.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680
 Okay.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.680
 And so, yeah.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:47.680
 They're red linneas.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.760
 Yeah, they flew him out to an NBA finals game so that he could distract the opponents.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.200
 But he was ejected from the game within the first quarter.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.840
 That's very interesting.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.360
 Because that happens, I watch a lot of basketball and more and more these days, you notice that

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.720
 this is NBA.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.480
 If there's someone close to the court and the player can identify, he was saying, "Screw

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.480
 you."

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.480
 They just go, "Get them out of here."

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.480
 And they're out.

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.480
 They're ejected.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.480
 The player has the power to eject.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.480
 Yes, it's astonishing.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.560
 I would think the megaphone seems, I feel like a better thing to bring would be a whistle.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.360
 So then you would be able to blow the whistle subtly, and then it would go off, and then

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.880
 the person with the ball would go, "Oh, there's been a call.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.880
 I'll just stop playing."

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.880
 Yeah.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880
 And then, you know, you get the advantage.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.880
 Yeah, that's good.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.040
 It will fit nicely into my wily coat again, so we're going to have.

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.840
 I didn't know that there are other things that swell up as well.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.600
 I thought it was just puffer fish, and actually the bearded goby, the pygmy leather jacket,

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.040
 amazing, the sargassum fish, and the swell shark.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.040
 Did you read that?

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.040
 It sounds like a good guy.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.040
 It's a great guy.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.560
 We're going to have a party tonight, going to invite all the sharks, but definitely the

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.560
 swell shark.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.000
 The swell shark is so cool.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.840
 I think the swell shark, they're cat sharks, right, and they're about a meter long, and

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.440
 when they're threatened, they go into a crevice, a nearby crevice, and they do their swelling

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.440
 up thing.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440
 Yeah.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440
 So they double in size, so they cannot be dragged out.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440
 That's clever.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440
 It's brilliant.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.480
 And then, if they're in open water, there's no crevice nearby, but they're threatened,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.920
 they will grab their tail in their mouth and then swell up, so they become a donor.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:17.920
 No!

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.920
 They become a donor.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.920
 What?

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:20.920
 Impossible to grab hold of.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.920
 You can still grab hold, can't you?

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.160
 I think it's much harder to grab, like grabbing a rubber ring or something.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.480
 They have this massive mouth relative to their body, right?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.480
 Yeah.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.000
 The reason that they can swell up so fast is because they open their mouth and all this

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 water comes in.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 Yeah.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 And the other clever thing is that's how they eat, right?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 They don't hunt for prey.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.800
 They just wait for something to swim in front of its mouth, open their mouth, and everything

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.000
 in the nearby area just gets hoovered into their mouth.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
 That's extraordinary.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
 And they've got a meal.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Wow.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
 So cool.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 The donut thing's amazing.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 I've never heard of that.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 I know.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
 Swell shark.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Swell shark.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Like a dog chasing its tail.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 It might be an evolutionary hangover from when dogs were in the oceans.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 Yes.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
 Dog shark.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 Yeah.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
 Yeah.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
 There you go.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.600
 It's a lot quicker than any other is a type of moss.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.600
 Is it?

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600
 Yes.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:12.640
 This is a moss called Takakia, and it was already a hundred million years through its life,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.560
 as in it had been around the species for all that time when the Himalayas rose underneath

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560
 it.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.560
 Wow.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.560
 And it thought, "What's going on?"

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.880
 So the Himalayas is a relatively new mountain system when two tectonic plates hit each other.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.640
 These mountains rose.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:37.360
 This moss was around for it, and it has found that because it's now in such a weird new place

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.480
 on top of the world's biggest mountains, it's had to do quite a lot of evolving because

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.040
 it lives half of its life in like the ice and the other half in very high up sort of

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:54.840
 lots of ultraviolet rays, very close, low oxygen, a very difficult environment to live

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.080
 in.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.560
 And so it's just had to evolve like hell.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.720
 It's like what an amazing forced evolution moment where you're just like, "Fuck, we're

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.720
 still going up?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720
 Are you kidding me?

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.720
 We just sorted it out at this level."

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:10.280
 Have you heard about Neo-Tantra?

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.280
 No.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.440
 It's when Tantra was introduced to the West for the first time, and it wasn't really

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.440
 done properly.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:20.320
 It was by a guy called Pierre Bernard, who was an occultist and businessman, which is

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.080
 always a bit of a red flag.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.240
 He also referred to himself as "Oom the Omnipotent".

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.320
 He's got fraud written all over it like a stick of rock, but he marketed Sanskrit and

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:34.680
 Tantra and yoga to America in the early 20th century, and he made millions of dollars doing

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.680
 it.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680
 It was very, very successful.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.400
 It wasn't really clear who he was, but he founded this thing called the Tantric Order

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.440
 of America, and he claimed he'd travelled to India and learned Sanskrit.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.040
 It wasn't clear that he had done that.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.680
 Yeah, there was a bit of that happening around that time, wasn't there?

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680
 A lot of it.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.040
 And he had a hypnosis clinic.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.520
 He and his wife developed a Tantric health system, and he was in fact a guy called Perry

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.360
 Baker from Leon, Iowa.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.240
 He loved reading about spiritualism and the occult, and he had a Syrian Indian teacher,

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.520
 and he did start following him, but he basically introduced yoga.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520
 That was his thing.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.640
 The first ever yoga class with Matz and Tites was in 1910, and he hosted it.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640
 He and his wife.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.640
 What?

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640
 1910?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.800
 Yeah, he also had a crystal ball, so that has been dropped out of the modern

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800
 yogic practice.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800
 Interesting.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.440
 But anyway, I just want to distract us all briefly, because he had this colleague called

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:20.440
 Bernard McFadden.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.440
 Bernard was originally called Bernard, who changed his name to sound more like a lion.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.440
 Bernard.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:27.440
 Hold on.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440
 Two Rs.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.040
 Sounds like a noise the lion makes.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.040
 Yeah.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040
 Bernard.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040
 Yeah.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040
 Sounds like a pirate.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.040
 It does.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.040
 Yeah.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040
 It's got a weedy one.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040
 The pirate accountant.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040
 Bernard.

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.040
 Bernard.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040
 Crypto numbers.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.640
 That taxier would be upon us.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.560
 How many pieces of aid do we need to pay?

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.240
 Okay, I'm just reading this from a paper I read.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.880
 Bernard McFadden has been blamed for America's fixation with both large

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.560
 rebreasts and large penises as symbols of power and vitality.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.040
 Which did he have?

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.040
 I don't know of you.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.920
 Well, he did invent the penoscope, which was the world's first penis extender.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:00.920
 Oh.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.400
 Okay, well, that does explain why.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.840
 That's not why I thought a penoscope was going to be.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.840
 I thought it was something you would need to use to see.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.840
 Yeah.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:09.840
 Right.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840
 Yeah.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:11.840
 This, I think, was more of an extendable.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840
 An extendable penis.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:13.840
 No, it's like a celloscope.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.840
 Right.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.840
 It's like a pump.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.840
 It's like a penis extending stretch.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.840
 It's like a versatile penis pump, really.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.840
 That was Bernard McFadden.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840
 Wow.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.840
 Good on him.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840
 I know.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.840
 What a great contribution.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.840
 Sorry, and he was mate with the tantra guy who introduced yoga.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840
 With the omnipotent.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840
 Yeah.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.840
 There you sound like a great pair.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.840
 I know it's a bit of a stretch to get out of where.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.840
 It's like in a really Terry Pratchett book this late.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840
 It's crazy.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.840
 And he toured around with Mary Williamson, who was Great Britain's perfect woman, 1913.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.840
 Ah.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.840
 Okay.

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.760
 And every night, their show Climax, when she jumped onto his stomach from a seven-foot

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 platform.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.760
 Yeah.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.760
 They were the most physically perfect.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.560
 They toured as the world's healthiest man and woman.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560
 That was their act.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560
 Yeah.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560
 We are both really, really, really fit.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560
 Yeah.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560
 You know.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:56.560
 I miss those.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560
 I've never seen an act do that.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560
 And I know there's a huge period of that.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560
 I would have loved to.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560
 Yeah.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.560
 You know, like Eugene Sandoe picking up a piano and walking off the stage and stuff like that.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560
 Yeah.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560
 I've never seen anything like that.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.560
 I think that's like what Britain's got talent should have been really, like just weirdo things

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560
 that people can do.

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560
 Yeah.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.560
 They ended up just being dogs and singers.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560
 Yeah.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:14.560
 It's like someone turns up with the peniscope.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560
 That's what I want to say.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:25.560
 I want to see a peniscope and then a guy multiplying two, six, because they're together.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.560
 We've all heard of Tuvalu.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.560
 Yes.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.560
 The island in the Pacific.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.560
 That's right.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:35.000
 So they, I think we might have even said before, Tuvalu earns about a 12th of its national

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.560
 income from licensing out the dot TV, which is its domain name.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560
 Yes.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560
 Yeah.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.860
 They were issued it, I think 25 or 30 years ago, and I read this piece about it.

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:49.460
 They actually got faxed to let them know you've got dot TV.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.460
 Great news.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.460
 And everyone there was saying, what is this?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.460
 What is the internet?

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.720
 Basically, it was not popular at the time.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.800
 But this is the cool thing.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.360
 A lot of that money comes from licensing its name to places like Twitch, the streaming

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.360
 site.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.360
 And yet on Tuvalu, there are no streams.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.960
 And there's no water?

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.960
 Yeah.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.960
 Yeah.

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.840
 It's a tiny atoll of only a few thousand people in the Pacific, and there are no streams.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.840
 Isn't that, that's sort of richly ironic, isn't it?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:19.880
 So when it rains, where does the water go?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.000
 Just runs off, I mentioned.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
 In what?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000
 Stream?

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
 In a random direction.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.920
 I don't know what happens when it rains on this.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.920
 Is it like when it rains?

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.040
 You know when you put water on a hob and it just sort of like goes into little balls and

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040
 she's right.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040
 I bet it does that.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.040
 I bet it does that.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.040
 I'll say anything to stop these questions.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040
 That's so funny.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:43.520
 And if you're in Tuvalu and you know what happens when it rains, drop us a line.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:49.360
 I think, is it Anguilla that has .ai, and that's about to make a lot of money for that.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.360
 Oh, brilliant.

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.360
 Yeah.

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360
 Why is it Anguilla?

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360
 It's an island in the Caribbean.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.360
 Nice.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.360
 I think.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360
 We don't even have .nz.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360
 We've got .co.nz.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360
 Yeah.

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.040
 So even if something amazing happened with those two digits, I feel like it would lose

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040
 its value.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.040
 Who's got .nz?

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:05.040
 I don't know.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040
 It just is.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.040
 It's the same with Australia.com.au.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040
 .co.nz.

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.040
 It's just not as simple.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.040
 .co.nz.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.040
 OK.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.040
 Oh yeah, we don't have it either.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.040
 Oh yeah.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.040
 Nuts.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.040
 Yeah.

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.040
 OK.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:16.560
 It's a sad note to end on.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.560

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:24.560

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.140
