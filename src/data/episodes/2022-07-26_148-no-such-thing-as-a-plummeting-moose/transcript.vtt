 Hello and welcome back to another episode of "No Such Thing"

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.120
 as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.320
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.160
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.240
 with Anna Tajinsky, James Harkin and Alex Bell.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240
 And we have gathered our favorite facts

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
 from the last seven days, so in no particular order,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
 here we go, starting with you, Anna.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.400
 - My fact this week is that the second president

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.600
 of the United States of America used to inspect London's Dung.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 [laughing]

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 - Why did John Adams go around inspecting Dung?

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 - The reason he did it, he obviously was a farmer

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 and he was inspecting--

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760
 - Obviously, this little manufacturer was also

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.160
 the president of the United States.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.280
 - He's most famous for his farming days.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920
 No, sorry, he's obvious from his diaries

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.960
 that he's a farmer because he--

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.880
 - He's a farmer from his diaries, yeah.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.720
 [laughing]

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.800
 - Well, look at all that.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.560
 - Was it sort of 25th March, did some more farming today?

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.920
 Is that what gives it away?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.160
 - That was my first clue, yeah.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.040
 25th March, milk to cow.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.400
 - When all the people of America let me get back to my farm.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.640
 [laughing]

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.880
 - He was a farmer and so he was inspecting it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 to compare it to his own Dung and he pointed out--

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.440
 - So his own Dung?

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.680
 [laughing]

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.960
 - This is not normal behavior in a person.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.440
 - Well, and he's questioning.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.120
 - He's an absolute fruit loop, let's try.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.640
 - It's amazing that they let him mentally unstable

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 with the president of America.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 - That will never happen again.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 [laughing]

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.920
 - He was a very stable man and had many stables of his own.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.720
 [laughing]

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.320
 He inspected the Dung in order to compare it to the manure

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.760
 he kept on his own farm and in fact he concluded

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.160
 that the manure on the edgeware road, he wrote of it,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.320
 "This may be good manure, but it is not equal to mine."

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.480
 - Wow.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.760
 - Yeah, so he had better manure.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.080
 He had some manure from the Boston marshes

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.040
 which he considered superior.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.440
 - And yeah, this fact was sent in actually

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.760
 by a guy called Mark David who sent me

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.520
 some of John Adams diaries.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.400
 And he said in his diary, "In one of my common walks

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.920
 along the edgeware road, there are fine meadows

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.000
 belonging to a noted cowkeeper, plentifully manured.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.440
 I have carefully examined the manure

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.360
 and found it to be composed of straw

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.320
 and Dung from the stables of streets of London

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.360
 and then he goes through all the stuff

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.880
 that's in the manure, so he's really gone through it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.560
 with his hands, properly getting in there,

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.720
 to live up edgeware road in that direction,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.320
 and it's not like that anymore."

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.320
 - Do you ever find any of John Adams's Dung

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320
 lying around your house?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
 - I don't know, who's it?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.440
 - It's on your doorstep, though, and it was on fire in the back.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.560
 That's the main thing.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.920
 - I wasn't John Adams's own Dung just to be clear.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.560
 He didn't take a poo by the side of the road

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.040
 and then expect guys.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.560
 - Well, what if he'd accidentally swallowed a tooth

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.320
 or something and he wanted it for his collection?

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.240
 - As hypothetical situations go, Andy?

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.000
 - I don't know, I think you're most likely

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.160
 to swallow a tooth if you get pushed in the face.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.000
 - And if you were wandering around inspecting poo

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.440
 on the streets of London, you might.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.280
 (laughing)

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.480
 - And if I got punched in the face,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.840
 I'd be likely to poo myself.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.080
 (laughing)

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.920
 - This is why I never got to boxy bites.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.000
 (laughing)

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.840
 Gets very messy.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.440
 - That was absolutely stinks in there.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.640
 - He was a lawyer originally.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520
 Before he was a president, and I'm not sure

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.080
 if he was a farmer at the same time as he was a lawyer,

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.600
 but he was a really bad lawyer.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.920
 So in his first year, he had one client,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.080
 and it took him three years before he won a case

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.080
 in front of a jury.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 - Wow.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.400
 - Yeah, I don't think it was a really long trial either.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.520
 I think it was just, it took him a very long time.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.200
 - One thing he was a liar for was the Boston Massacre,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 wasn't it?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.400
 I think quite famously that.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.400
 - What was that?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.240
 - I think it was something like there was a crowd of people,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.640
 and there was some British soldiers,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.320
 and the crowd started throwing snowballs at the soldiers.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.320
 - Was it snowballs?

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.160
 - I think so.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.440
 - And then other stuff as well, like the animals and stuff.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.920
 And then the soldiers, when snowball fights get out of hand,

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.760
 (laughing)

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.600
 is that a reindeer come towards me?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.320
 (laughing)

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.200
 And then the British soldiers got angry and shot them,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 which is obviously worse than snowballs or reindeer's,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.400
 and they were arrested,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.480
 and I think Adams got them off.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.320
 - He did get them off.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.160
 - Yeah.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.560
 - Not one of them went to prison thanks to his defense of them.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.960
 Are we saying that he was kind of partly responsible

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.920
 for the American Revolution starting?

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.440
 - I think he was certainly a player.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.280
 - Wow.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.760
 - And he was pro-revolution as well, wasn't he?

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.000
 He just defended the Brits because he wanted to uphold

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.560
 the rule of law, so he thought they had a right

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.200
 to equal representation.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.040
 - Yeah, true.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.880
 - Good man.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.920
 - When he was in Boston, he also wrote political theory essays

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.640
 for the Boston newspapers under the nom de bloom,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.280
 Humphrey Plough Jogger.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.440
 (laughing)

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.280
 - Wow.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.920
 - Humphrey Turd Sifter was the first draft name.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920
 (laughing)

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.080
 - So Jefferson was his main rival and he fought Jefferson

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.240
 for the title of second president of the US,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.160
 and he won, and then Jefferson beat him at the next election.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.840
 And then when they both retired,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.360
 they spent the rest of their lives writing letters

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.520
 to each other.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.880
 - It should have been me.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.320
 (laughing)

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.360
 - But didn't they, during one of the elections,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.800
 didn't they really fight, like really badly?

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.640
 - Yeah.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.320
 - I thought Jefferson called him a hermaphrodite or something.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.160
 - Yes, he did.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.400
 Yeah, they had a really, really vicious campaign.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.800
 And he, so Jefferson accused Adams of being a hideous,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400
 hermaphroditical character who smuggled prostitutes

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.480
 into the country, so he said he was smuggling prostitutes

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.920
 in from England, into America.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.960
 And he said that he was planning to marry one of the sons

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.240
 of King George and that he was a royalist.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.920
 Which actually, there could be some foundation to that

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.640
 because one of the things that Adams got mocked for

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.880
 when he was president was that he thought the president

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.640
 should be referred to as his royal highness or your majesty

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.080
 was something like that, 'cause he pointed out

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.240
 the presidents, you get presidents of golf clubs

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.680
 and other really tedious things.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.440
 And it wasn't a nobel enough title.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.280
 - Yeah, one of his suggestions was his highness,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.080
 the president of the United States of America

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 and protector of the rights of the same.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.320
 - There you go.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.760
 - Yeah.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.160
 - So we were talking about Adams and Jefferson being friends,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.640
 even though they called each other homaphrodites

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.480
 and said there were English prostitutes, a foot.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.960
 They died on the same day and they died on the 50th anniversary

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.240
 of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.440
 4th of July, what would it be, 1826?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.040
 And they were both absolutely determined

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.680
 to stay alive until then.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.000
 And Jefferson died just after noon.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
 And Adams awoke soon after Jefferson had died

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.440
 and he was in a separate place at the time.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.080
 And he said, with great effort,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.120
 Thomas Jefferson survives as though at least one of the architects

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.000
 of the revolution is still alive,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.040
 even though he didn't know that Jefferson had already died.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.640
 And then he died a few hours later.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.840
 - And then, do you think anyone,

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840
 do you think there was a really awkward pause

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.960
 around his bedside when he said Jefferson survives?

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.200
 - Actually, no.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.400
 - Should we tell him, is it cruel?

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.520
 - Yeah, I don't think he ever knew, which is nice.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.040
 - He died thinking that Jefferson still survives today.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.880
 - Really?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.840
 (all laughing)

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.080
 - On his diary writing and his prolific letter writing

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.120
 and diary keeping, apparently Congress made fun of him

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.800
 because he went to Paris at one point

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.960
 and wrote a lot in his diary about how,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.160
 - How great the done was.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.160
 - Oh yeah, how great.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.280
 How much he admired the French aristocracy,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.680
 all this kind of really a few stuff

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.760
 about how great Paris was.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.680
 And then he sent it along with his report

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.160
 of what was going on in Paris to Congress,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.600
 possibly accidentally.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.840
 I would not sure whether it was supposed to be part of the report

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.680
 or not.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.520
 - It's a diary.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.880
 - Just read it aloud and make fun of him in Congress.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.760
 - It's just like a 12 year old girl in a school.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.560
 - Wow, if anyone's mum's ever read their diary,

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.360
 they can take solace in this,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.960
 probably the worst moment of his life

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.200
 when he realised that had happened.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200
 - I bet he never got over that.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.880
 I bet that's why he had to become president

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.000
 was to erase the memory of his diary.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.440
 Oh god, that's embarrassing.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.560
 - Well, it was, okay, so there was nothing too humiliating.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.160
 It wasn't like, oh dad walked in on me masturbating

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.320
 this morning.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.480
 It must have learned to lock the door.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.880
 It was there was nothing too awful in it.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.560
 - No, he said that one of the French gentlemen...

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.560
 - What do you won't believe?

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.800
 The prostitutes they have here in France.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.240
 I think they complimented him a lot

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.120
 and one of the men called him the Washington negotiation.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.160
 Oh, and he wrote that down.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.280
 And he was like, oh, I really like him.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:54.120
 He's so nice.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.720
 And that's like retweeting praise of yourself, isn't it?

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.800
 And then posting the retweet to Congress.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.800
 - Yeah.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.680
 - Copying in Congress.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.320
 - We should move on, but just one quick,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.120
 anyone got anything on Dung or droppings?

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.160
 - Yes.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.360
 - Go on, drop it in.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.200
 - Bert Reynolds once dropped a helicopter full of horse manure

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.920
 on the national enquirer.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.760
 - Did he?

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.600
 - Yeah.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.440
 - Why did he do that?

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.600
 - They'd been writing a lot of stories about him

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.560
 and they weren't accurate.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.920
 So he decided, he said this.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.400
 I thought it was only fitting.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.080
 On Christmas Eve, my pilot and I loaded my helicopter

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.000
 with manure from my ranch, flew over the building

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.880
 and watched it cascade down their giant Christmas tree.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.800
 Isn't that amazing?

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.120
 - The children would have probably thought

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.280
 he was Santa Claus.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.360
 (laughing)

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.680
 - You know, there was a moose dropping festival

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.640
 in Tal Keetner in Alaska.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.840
 - So is this for dropping mooses or for--

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.240
 - Bert Reynolds flies over the town in a helicopter.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.960
 - No, that's, but that's such a good question, James.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.160
 And it's exactly the same question

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.600
 that confused Peter, the animal rights organization.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.640
 So it was a festival that was canceled in 2009,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.040
 but it was basically where people used to throw moose

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.480
 droppings out of helicopters flying over the top

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.520
 and people took bets on whereabouts they'd land

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:09.400
 and would bet how close they'd get to a target.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.040
 But Peter got confused and assumed that it did involve

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.760
 hurling moose, life moose, from helicopters.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.760
 - Loving them into helicopters, coaxing the moose

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.400
 into an aircraft.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.960
 - Every time they hear about animal droppings,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.000
 this is just what they usually do.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.600
 (upbeat music)

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.920
 - Okay, we should move on.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.720
 So it's time for fact number two now

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.920
 and that is James.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.440
 - Okay, my fact this week is that you can be blocked

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.960
 from getting a Swiss passport if your neighbours

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.680
 find you too annoying.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.080
 So this has come about, this is a news article

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.320
 that's been quite recent and it is in the canton

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.520
 of Argao in Switzerland and there was a lady

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:54.240
 who is a vegan and she has been complaining

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.080
 about the way that cows are treated

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.120
 and various different things in this area.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.400
 - Why does this weird man keep sifting through their menu?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.160
 - It's their own business.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.080
 - And the locals are not very happy with her

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.200
 because they think that she's invading their way of life

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.600
 and the rules say that when you apply for a passport,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.000
 your neighbours can give you a reference,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.840
 either good or bad and they've given her a bad reference

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.640
 and it's stopping her from getting a passport

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.360
 and so now it has to go to the next level

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.400
 so that she can apply elsewhere.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.240
 - She's lived there since she was eight.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.000
 - And all her children are Swiss.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.840
 - Yeah.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.760
 - But she's a really big campaigner.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.840
 One of the things she campaigns to get,

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.520
 she does campaign against putting bells

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.400
 around the cows next.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.520
 She also campaigns against piglet racing,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.360
 which is a thing that happens in Switzerland.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.440
 - I wonder if she campaigns about cow droppings.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.720
 (laughing)

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.640
 - That's a thing that happens.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.240
 Cowls just walk over cliffs in Switzerland all the time.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.480
 They walk off mountains and then the other cows think,

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.280
 oh, maybe Bessie found some better grass over there

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.920
 and then you get up to 40 cows at a time

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.640
 just plunging off cliffs to their death.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.400
 - You always thought the smart thing for neighbours

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.400
 to do would be to give her a really glowing reference

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.280
 and ensure that she does have the ability

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.920
 to leave the country, wouldn't it?

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.240
 - You're right.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.280
 Because having the passport means

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.120
 that you immediately are forced to emigrate, I think.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.800
 It does allow you to leave, though, doesn't it?

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.640
 That's the thing.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.480
 - Exactly.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.320
 - That's true.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320
 I think actually she does have a passport

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.400
 for another country.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.960
 - And nationality is Dutch as she must have

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960
 a Dutch passport and she's got children there,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.800
 so she can't remain.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.640
 - It's weird there.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.040
 The law in Switzerland is that in order to apply

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.920
 for a passport, you have to first become

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.080
 a resident of your local town, basically.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.080
 It's called Hematort.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.880
 Hematort, Hematort, Hematort, Hematort.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.720
 I would pick the right one.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.880
 Yeah, so all the foreign nationals

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.520
 have to become a citizen of the town they were living in

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.200
 and they have to live there for at least 12 years.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.480
 And then up until 2003, the whole town could vote

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.920
 on whether they would become new citizens or not.

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.760
 - Would vote on whether someone could become a new citizen?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.600
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.520
 So a whole town would vote on it.

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.200
 And so until 2003, it was everyone in the town.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.800
 Then they realised actually people were just being

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.240
 a bit racist because they didn't actually know

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.120
 these people, they would just make a judgment

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.440
 based on which country they came from.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.640
 So they changed the law so that it's then a sort of committee

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.520
 when you get references from people who know them

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.480
 and they're judged specifically on them as a person.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120
 But it still means that it's really difficult to get into.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.800
 There was a family in 2006, a family from Kosovo

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.320
 as a nice citizenship because one of the reasons

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.760
 was that they dressed inappropriately

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.360
 'cause they wore too many tracksuits around town.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.040
 And the other one is that they didn't systematically

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.600
 greet people passing them on the streets.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.760
 - Now that is a weird thing.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.760
 So if you go to a party in Switzerland,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.680
 when you arrive, you have to go around the room

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.840
 saying hello and shaking hands with everybody else

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.680
 at the party.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:26.400
 And then there's a huge incentive to arrive on time

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
 'cause if you get there on time,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.000
 everyone comes up to you and says hello

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.320
 and you don't have to go around saying hi.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.960
 - Actually, you want to go early, don't you, really?

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.800
 - Yeah.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800
 - So does this kind of game theory going on and off?

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.080
 What time do you arrive?

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920
 - Yeah.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.480
 - I would actually rather get their lace

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.920
 because if you arrive first, then that means

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.520
 all your conversations are going to be interrupted

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.320
 by the next arrival coming up and shaking your hand.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.640
 Whereas if you arrive last,

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.520
 you get all the handshakes out the way immediately

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.680
 and you can get on with your conversations in peace.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.520
 That's my top tip for Swiss people out there.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.360
 - It's very good.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.200
 - Yeah, thank you.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.480
 - This woman who's been rejected, she's writing a book

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.960
 and the title of it is "Selkie Annève"

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.800
 or "The Lady Who Annoyes".

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.680
 (laughing)

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.080
 - So she's embracing it, that's nice.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:04.920
 - Yeah.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.160
 - Yeah, grace.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.240
 - What about the cowbells though?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.200
 Like they do, they are incredibly loud, aren't they?

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.040
 - I think that is right.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.640
 It's like a hundred decibels, aren't they?

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.240
 And it's round your neck the whole time.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.360
 You can't get away with it.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.840
 I'd just jump off a cliff and I'd follow you.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.360
 (laughing)

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.920
 - Just on passports, there was a nine-year-old girl

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:29.480
 who recently got into Turkey on a toy passport.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.920
 This was in 2013 and she was from Wales

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.840
 and she had her own passport.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.840
 She was traveling with her parents

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.600
 but she also had the passport that belonged

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:42.520
 her teddy bear unicorn, her soft toy unicorn

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.200
 and her mum accidentally pulled that out

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.000
 instead handed over to the authorities

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.600
 who'd really stamped it and let her in.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.080
 - It must have been roughly the same size

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.560
 in shape and colour as a normal passport.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:52.560
 Which is quite a...

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.640
 - Well, they've got a unicorn on the front, anyway.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.480
 - British pastries.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.320
 - Yeah.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.960
 (laughing)

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.760
 - Oh my God, I didn't know we had royalty visiting

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.040
 your Highness, welcome to Turkey.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.560
 (laughing)

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.640
 - Can we quickly talk about how until recently

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.440
 so it's learned was rigged to explode

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.600
 if an army invaded.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.440
 - Yes, I think we can,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.720
 because that's going to need a lot of justification.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.200
 So since the Second World War,

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.040
 the Muslims have had a really stringent plan

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.440
 for what would happen if they were invaded

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.040
 because they're a famously neutral country.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.640
 The main kind of plan is for everyone in Switzerland

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.080
 to withdraw from the cities

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.120
 and fight a guerrilla war from the Alps

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.280
 if an army was to evade.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.120
 And all of the tunnels through the mountains

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.680
 and all of the bridges were all rigged with explosives

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.720
 so that they could be blown up

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.080
 and it would be very difficult to get around

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.600
 the country, very difficult to get into

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.880
 the country in the mountains.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.400
 And they have also some other plans

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.520
 like they have enough nuclear bunkers

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.840
 for every citizen of Switzerland.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.080
 So presumably this woman is going to be any person

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.120
 who doesn't know where to go.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.120
 - Last fall, please.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.120
 - I thought this unicorn was last fall.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.880
 (upbeat music)

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.000
 - Okay, we've got to move on.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.360
 It's time for fact number three

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.440
 and that is my fact.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.960
 My fact is that there are people

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.760
 in the houses of parliament constantly looking for fire.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.280
 - You phrase that like, they're smokers

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.200
 in the lights and have a light.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.920
 - There are 24 fire patrol officers

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.040
 who go around the house of parliament.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.520
 They do it in shifts, obviously.

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.720
 And the Palace of Westminster

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.600
 is basically only able to be used

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.880
 because they're working.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.360
 So if they weren't there,

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.640
 then the building would not comply

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.400
 with the 2005 fire safety order.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.600
 So they are easily the 24 most important people

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.680
 in the houses of parliament.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.600
 - So you say that the fire people have had to be installed

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.360
 because of this 2005 piece of health and safety regulation.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.200
 - I do say that.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.960
 - You do say that and yet I think that.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.240
 - No, here we go.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.320
 - Effectively, crown properties are exempt

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.720
 from health and safety regulations.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.840
 So they still have to abide by them.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.240
 But you can't prosecute the crown properties

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.280
 for not abiding by them.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.880
 The only thing you can do is censure them.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.400
 So if they don't abide by these rules,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.920
 you go to this incredibly long process

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.960
 that you would go through usually

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.640
 where someone else might go to prison at the end

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.960
 or be arrested or fined.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.400
 But with the crown, they just get a formal censure.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.080
 - Basically, this is about how

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.640
 Shonky the houses of parliament are.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.640
 - They're falling to bits, aren't they?

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.800
 - They really are, yeah.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.040
 - There was a report in 2012

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:11.960
 that said if it wasn't closed,

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.000
 they'd recommend demolishing it and starting again.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.840
 - Really?

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:16.680
 - Yeah.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.520
 - Wow.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.480
 - Do they often find fires in their hunt?

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.320
 - They do, yeah.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.160
 - Do they?

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.440
 - So there have been 60 incidents since 2008,

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.800
 which have had the potential to cause a serious fire.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.560
 - Yeah, so that is completely insane.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.840
 How incompetent are the people in the houses of parliament

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.680
 no need to answer that.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.520
 - That's right.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.480
 (all laughing)

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.960
 - Well, there's just a very old building

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.920
 and there are lots of bits which are kind of fire hazards

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.240
 and which, you know, it's a huge place as well.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.840
 - There's a lot of kind of it was built obviously before.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.680
 It's a bit of electricity,

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.680
 so the wires are all kind of budged in

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680
 to where all the items are.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.520
 - Yeah, really loose.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.360
 - And there's loads of,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.760
 basically nothing gets uninstalled,

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.240
 so anytime old wiring is replaced,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.520
 they don't take out the old wiring.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.840
 So there's tons of flammable material sitting there

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.240
 and there's loads of us bestos.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.080
 I mean, that's not flammable,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.280
 but there's tons of us bestos.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.120
 - It's sort of everywhere.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.960
 It's not just in the walls.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.680
 There's us bestos inside the lightswitches

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.520
 and things like that.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.360
 - They just shut it in.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.520
 - Absolutely everywhere.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.160
 - Of the 3,000 windows in the Palace of Westminster,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.560
 nearly all of them don't close properly.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.400
 - Nice.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.200
 - What's that for, I'm so badly built.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.040
 - I guess, does that mean if there's a fire,

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.080
 yeah, more air will get in,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.920
 I suppose, to make the fire worse.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.520
 - And I think the shutters don't open properly.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.840
 The windows don't close and the shutters don't open,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.680
 'cause I think they built radiators.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.640
 I was reading the report on why it needs redoing

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.440
 and one of the things in it

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.040
 said that they built radiators in the nooks

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.040
 that are supposed to house the shutters at some point.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.400
 So now when you try to open the shutters,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.520
 there's a radiator in the way.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.360
 - Wow.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.920
 Sometimes MPs misvotes

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.040
 because they get stuck in lifts.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.880
 - Really?

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.160
 - Well, it's happened at least once.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.320
 - Yeah, I don't know when I say sometimes,

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320
 I mean, one time.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.120
 - The legislation only passed by seven votes

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.640
 and so if there was like a chance of,

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.160
 if more people couldn't get that.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
 - I mean, if they'd all been in that lake.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.040
 - I used to work for an MSP in Scotland

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.520
 and he once pressed the wrong button on his voting thing

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.480
 and voted the wrong way

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.040
 in a vote that came down to one vote.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.360
 (gasps)

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.400
 - Man, that's a sheepish email to IT support.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.320
 (laughs)

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:07.320
 - And then what terrible law passed because of that?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.000
 - So Scottish independence upcoming, that's all him.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.200
 (laughs)

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.960
 No, it was about green energy, I think.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.160
 - I once worked in house apartment for a while

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.520
 and on my first day, someone came in

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.120
 and the office I was working in and took off his shoe

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.520
 and threw it at a mouse in the corner

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.960
 'cause they have a really bad mass problem.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.240
 - Really, yeah.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.080
 - Wow, what a...

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.080
 - It was like, oh, hi.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.520
 - I literally cartoon based way to deal with that.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.840
 (laughs)

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.160
 - According to MP Ben Bradshaw,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.840
 there is urine leaking in the house's apartment,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.680
 specifically into his office.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:40.400
 A couple of years ago, he tweeted that urine seems

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.760
 to be pouring through the ceiling

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:44.720
 into my commons office for the second day running.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.640
 There was some piping with holes in it

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.320
 in the room above him and the smell was only made bearable

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.800
 by his staff wearing strong perfume.

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200
 (laughs)

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.720
 - Apparently the roof of the Hall of Westminster

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.360
 there aren't really sure why it's still up

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.160
 because they thought that it was originally built

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.440
 with columns 'cause at the time during 13th and 14th century,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.760
 we didn't think that they had the technology

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.360
 to make a roof that was wider than the beams it was made of

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.680
 and it doesn't have columns anymore,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.320
 but they recently had a look at it

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.800
 and they think that there were never any columns

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.200
 so they're unsure as to why it's up there

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.320
 and how it's staying up.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.960
 - Is this gonna be like in a cartoon

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.920
 when the building real light is gonna be standing up?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.160
 - It's freewheeling in the air for a bit

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.360
 and then, yeah, that's so weird.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.200
 - I know.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.960
 - So just on fire safety,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.160
 has anyone seen the fire safety slide

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.240
 that's been installed in Shanghai?

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.440
 So it's basically like a slide you see in a playground

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.960
 and it goes around the stairwell

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.600
 and when it's not in use,

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.400
 then it's up vertically kind of attached to the banisters.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.040
 - Why is it not in use?

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:48.880
 - Who?

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.720
 - Yeah, who would have used it?

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.920
 - What a spiral slide in a massive building.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.040
 I think, oh, we won't bother using this.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.160
 - James, this is not for the purposes of recreation,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.080
 it's a health and safety issue.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.000
 The only time you would ever want to use the slide

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.160
 is in a case of a fire,

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.680
 in which case it takes 14 seconds to descend the five stories.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.160
 - Oh, that is so cool.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.680
 Is there a penalty for improper use?

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.520
 - I bet that happens to me.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.200
 - Almost, yeah.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.320
 - That is really 14 seconds for five stories.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.160
 - Well, I was trying to work out,

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.920
 I reckon I could run downstairs in that.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.640
 - Absolutely, you're not married.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.440
 You could, three seconds per story.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.240
 - Oh, I don't know.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.280
 - I take four stairs at a time, I can do it.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.280
 - I think you could fall that distance at that time.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.860
 (upbeat music)

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.600
 - Okay, it's time for a final fact for the show

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.960
 and that is Alex.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.960
 - My fact this week is that the cookie monster

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.840
 isn't allowed to eat cookies.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.760
 - Since his diabetes, diagnosis.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.960
 - No, why not?

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:46.040
 - Well, he cookies are actually bad for the fabric,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.080
 but he is made out of,

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.560
 so he actually eats rice cakes,

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.520
 disguised to look like cookies disguised, yeah.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.400
 I think he knows, but yeah.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.200
 - But it will be quite a powerful message

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.680
 about childhood healthy eating.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.240
 If he did eat cookies and slowly

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.000
 he's always skin degrading and rotting away

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.320
 over the next six months of the show, no?

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.280
 - What did teach children that if you eat too many cookies,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.280
 your fur will fall off.

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.200
 - I've never actually seen it,

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.880
 but obviously I was supposed to be educational, aren't they?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.360
 And they're good at dealing with the heart hitting issues.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.240
 I think they're covering the Trump election, as we speak.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.440
 - They did have a character called Donald Grump.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.160
 - So good, yeah.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.200
 - Based on Donald Trump,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.400
 and it was when the apprentice first became popular,

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.640
 and he was a Muppet with a bright orange quaffer,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.680
 who had the most trash of any grouch in the world,

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.400
 and he had his name on every piece of trash in town.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.520
 - He was played by Oscar the Grouch,

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.640
 and he's like, "I have more trash than you, get it?"

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.240
 - I don't know who Oscar the Grouch is.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.760
 - All right, he's the guy who lives in the bin,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.280
 he's really grumpy.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.800
 - Okay, you think you've never watched it?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.680
 - I bet everyone else knows Oscar the Grouch is.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.600
 - Yeah, it's true, actually Oscar the Grouch is quite,

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:50.840
 even if you'd never seen it,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:52.160
 I'm surprised you'd never come across him,

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.360
 but he'd come across Big Bird.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.360
 - Yeah, so I've heard of Big Bird,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:55.400
 and I've heard of Elmo,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.560
 and I've heard of Burton Ernie,

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.040
 but that's only because they're referenced in Friends,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.960
 which I have seen.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.480
 - And you must have the cooking monster as well?

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.200
 - I think I thought that was the same as Big Bird.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.400
 - He's appeared on every, like he's appeared on news night,

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.560
 he's appeared on BBC Breakfast,

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.320
 he's done more political shows than most people

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.160
 in this country.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.160
 - It's me Corbin.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.320
 (laughter)

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.120
 - Took a long time for us to get in the German Corbin giant.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.960
 Poppets don't have a sexual orientation,

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.120
 and Sesame Street had to make that clear,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.400
 because apparently there are lots of rumors

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.880
 that Burton Ernie or a gay couple.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.280
 - 'Cause they share a bed.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.440
 - Oh, right, okay, so I can see where those rumors came from.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.480
 - Okay, so there were rumors about that,

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.800
 and they said they're just friends,

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.200
 and poppets don't have a sexual orientation.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.240
 - They don't exist below the waist.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.080
 They only have a top half.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.720
 - Big Bird exists below the waist.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.560
 - Yeah, I've seen--

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.440
 - He's not poppets.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.160
 - And I guess, unless he belongs to the 3% of birds

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.200
 that do have a penis, Big Bird will have a cloaca,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.760
 which he will press against the cloaca

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.320
 or of other big birds.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.160
 - They are educational,

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.680
 presumably they've discussed the cloaca

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.120
 of Big Bird at some point in the show.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.560
 So Big Bird is flightless,

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.920
 and isn't it true?

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.520
 I read someone said this week that flightless birds

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.520
 have a bladder, is that right?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.880
 - Flightless, the only bird with a bladder is the ostrich.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.400
 - And that's because bladder's a heavy,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.120
 like birds can't normally have them

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.400
 because it would weigh them down.

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.240
 - Yes.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.400
 - But Big Bird could possibly have a bladder.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.400
 - He could have a bladder, is anyone ever seen him we?

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.800
 (laughing)

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.400
 - No, he's not a grumpass.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.800
 (laughing)

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.840
 - Is it Elmo the only non-human

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.920
 to testify in the course of law?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.400
 - Where did the defendant tickle you?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.960
 (laughing)

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.200
 - No, it was during a campaign

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.800
 for increased funding for music programs

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.240
 and he testified that there should be indeed that.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.320
 Does he sing, is he involved?

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.160
 Does he see musicals?

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.320
 - He's, yeah, he's sing, yeah, they all sing.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.840
 - I hope he'll sing.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.480
 - So there's a list of puppets

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.040
 that have been in Sesame Street and Muppets as well.

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.320
 But there's a list and there was one called Anna.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.160
 - Hey.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.640
 - This was in the Spanish version of Sesame Street

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.760
 and it says that Anna had a know it all attitude.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.440
 - Wow.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.680
 - Based on me, I'm not gonna lie.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.240
 But it's a justified attitude, isn't it?

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.920
 - Alex Bell, there was one called Bell

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.720
 who was in the Brazilian co-production of Sesame Street

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.680
 and Bell was an imaginative hot pink monster girl.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.840
 - Sounds better, right?

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.000
 That's my online profile.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.400
 (laughing)

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.400
 - And there was one called Murray Monster.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.240
 - What was that?

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.560
 - And he was the host of the word on the street segment

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.280
 and he was a boisterous red orange muppet.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.520
 (laughing)

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.960
 - In the Nigerian version of Sesame Street,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.760
 the star muppet is called Kami

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.600
 and Kami is HIV positive to remove the stigma

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.920
 of talking about dealing with the hardest issues, yeah.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.200
 - That's so good.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200
 - I know.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.600
 - Another responsible thing they do

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.280
 is they make a whole set program called Talk Listen Connect

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.040
 and it's for children with parents in the military

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.560
 and they broadcast that to them

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.040
 to teach them about how much they're gonna miss their parents

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.840
 and how it's okay and how, for instance,

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.000
 like amputees coming back from war zones,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.400
 their children might be a bit traumatized by seeing that.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.360
 And so there was a lovely story of a father

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.280
 who came back from Afghanistan, I think,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.760
 and he'd had three of his limbs amputated

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.680
 and he was really worried and they showed him

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.120
 the Sesame Street video that had been made

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.440
 to educate his children about his condition

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.960
 and he burst into tears apparently.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.000
 He was so happy that he had a good way

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.400
 of communicating it to his child.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.800
 - Oh my goodness.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.880
 - Some of the muppets are actually made

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.800
 of army surplus material.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.160
 I watched that until I came in three ages ago

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.240
 and I just remembered it.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.200
 - The Cookie Monster has a British cousin

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.000
 - Really? - Called the Biscuit Bastard.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.760
 (all laughing)

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.880
 - You are half right.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.720
 - Oh really?

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.560
 - It's the Biscuit Monster.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.120
 - Oh okay.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.120
 - Biscuit Bastard would be good.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.800
 That could educate children about how it's okay

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.160
 if your parents aren't mad.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.680
 (all laughing)

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.080
 - That's hilarious.

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.320
 - Does he actually feature on the American show then?

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.280
 - He was only in one episode where he came

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.080
 to visit the Cookie Monster.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.560
 - Okay. - Yeah.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.640
 He was on holiday.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.080
 - Tried to get himself a job as Donald Grumps

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.560
 representative in the year.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.320
 (all laughing)

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.480
 - We could talk about Biscuits,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.120
 but do you think I can I just say one thing

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:05.960
 about Biscuits then?

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.880
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.920
 - Dunking Biscuits was originally done in wine.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.040
 The first evidence we have of Biscuit Dunking

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:16.480
 was Wafers that the Romans softened in wine.

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.720
 - Oh. - Wow.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.560
 - And before dunking in tea even there was dunking in beer

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.480
 because in the Royal Navy you would have had hard

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.280
 Biscuits that were really, really hard

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:26.280
 and you couldn't eat them very well.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:28.800
 So people would dunk them in their beer to soften them up.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.880
 - Oh, that's very interesting.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.720
 - Wafers in wine.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.560
 - Wafers in wine.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.440
 Oh, you'll have to dunk your wafer in your wine at church.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.280
 Drink me.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.120
 - You're not, no.

00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:40.120
 The idea of putting wafers directly into people's mouths.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.960
 - Yeah.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.600
 - That came because they were worried

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.680
 that people would take them in their hands,

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.080
 hide them away and use them for magic pulsions.

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.280
 - I thought you were going to say use them

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.720
 slowly over time, build their own Christ at home.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.840
 (laughing)

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.960
 - I was reading about Simon Pope who's a Biscuit designer

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.960
 and tester.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.280
 - And that's the best job in the world.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.520
 (laughing)

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.440
 - Honestly, his job, so his job includes eating,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.800
 tasting biscuits from 472 packets of biscuits every year.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.720
 So he says he tastes 30 biscuits a day.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.560
 - Wow.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.720
 - He says he often doesn't swallow them

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.880
 because I guess for health reasons.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.160
 So he says he'll nibble on them

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.440
 to check for things like taste, texture and firmness.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.280
 - He says he sometimes does have biscuits at work

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.600
 because it's important to test them in situ.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.600
 - I need to test this batch in Las Vegas.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.600
 - I'm afraid.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.600
 (laughing)

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.160
 - Travel expenses are enormous.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.560
 (laughing)

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.400
 - He's in the plane.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.360
 He's got a seat next to him

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.240
 which just has a pack of biscuits on it.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.240
 (laughing)

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.080
 - He's always going around the world,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:41.920
 help not big news.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.520
 (laughing)

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.560
 - I think we might be done today.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.400
 - I think so too.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.680
 - Today's your return, guys.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.280
 (upbeat music)

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.400
 - Okay, that's it.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.280
 That's all of our facts.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.720
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.400
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.720
 We will be back again next week

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.080
 with another selection of our favorite facts.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.200
 So until then, it's goodbye from us

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.600
 and you can follow us on Twitter if you'd like.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.560
 We are on James at Egg Shaped.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.400
 Alex at Alex Bell Under School.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.200
 I'm on @AndrewHunterM

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.280
 and you can follow our group account

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.600
 which is @QiPodcast.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.680
 Anna, you can email podcast@Qi.com

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.440
 and I just quickly wanna say,

00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.920
 I got very behind on some emails towards the end of last year.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.640
 So I really apologize if you've done that.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.840
 I will try and get back to all emails, henceforth.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.240
 Sorry if you haven't heard of me.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.040
 - Okay, that'll end from hundreds more emails.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.680
 (laughing)

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.160
 You can also go to our website

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.000
 which is no such thing as a fish.com.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.120
 You can also watch our TV show,

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:44.960
 no such thing as the news if you go to the website

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.280
 which is no such thing as the news.com.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.640
 Okay, thanks again for listening and goodbye.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.220
 (upbeat music)

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.800
 (upbeat music)

00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:04.800
 (upbeat music)
