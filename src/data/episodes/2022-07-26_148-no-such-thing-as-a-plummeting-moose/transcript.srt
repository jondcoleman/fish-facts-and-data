00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,840
 Hello and welcome back to another episode of "No Such Thing"

12
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,120
 as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you

13
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,320
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

14
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,160
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here

15
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,240
 with Anna Tajinsky, James Harkin and Alex Bell.

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
 And we have gathered our favorite facts

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,200
 from the last seven days, so in no particular order,

18
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
 here we go, starting with you, Anna.

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,400
 - My fact this week is that the second president

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,600
 of the United States of America used to inspect London's Dung.

21
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,440
 [laughing]

22
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
 - Why did John Adams go around inspecting Dung?

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,200
 - The reason he did it, he obviously was a farmer

24
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,520
 and he was inspecting--

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,760
 - Obviously, this little manufacturer was also

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,160
 the president of the United States.

27
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,280
 - He's most famous for his farming days.

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,920
 No, sorry, he's obvious from his diaries

29
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960
 that he's a farmer because he--

30
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,880
 - He's a farmer from his diaries, yeah.

31
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,720
 [laughing]

32
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,800
 - Well, look at all that.

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,560
 - Was it sort of 25th March, did some more farming today?

34
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,920
 Is that what gives it away?

35
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,160
 - That was my first clue, yeah.

36
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,040
 25th March, milk to cow.

37
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,400
 - When all the people of America let me get back to my farm.

38
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,640
 [laughing]

39
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,880
 - He was a farmer and so he was inspecting it

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,200
 to compare it to his own Dung and he pointed out--

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,440
 - So his own Dung?

42
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,680
 [laughing]

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,960
 - This is not normal behavior in a person.

44
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,440
 - Well, and he's questioning.

45
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,120
 - He's an absolute fruit loop, let's try.

46
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,640
 - It's amazing that they let him mentally unstable

47
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,880
 with the president of America.

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 - That will never happen again.

49
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,880
 [laughing]

50
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,920
 - He was a very stable man and had many stables of his own.

51
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,720
 [laughing]

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,320
 He inspected the Dung in order to compare it to the manure

53
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,760
 he kept on his own farm and in fact he concluded

54
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,160
 that the manure on the edgeware road, he wrote of it,

55
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,320
 "This may be good manure, but it is not equal to mine."

56
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,480
 - Wow.

57
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,760
 - Yeah, so he had better manure.

58
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,080
 He had some manure from the Boston marshes

59
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,040
 which he considered superior.

60
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,440
 - And yeah, this fact was sent in actually

61
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,760
 by a guy called Mark David who sent me

62
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
 some of John Adams diaries.

63
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,400
 And he said in his diary, "In one of my common walks

64
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,920
 along the edgeware road, there are fine meadows

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,000
 belonging to a noted cowkeeper, plentifully manured.

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,440
 I have carefully examined the manure

67
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
 and found it to be composed of straw

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,320
 and Dung from the stables of streets of London

69
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,360
 and then he goes through all the stuff

70
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,880
 that's in the manure, so he's really gone through it

71
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,560
 with his hands, properly getting in there,

72
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,720
 to live up edgeware road in that direction,

73
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,320
 and it's not like that anymore."

74
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
 - Do you ever find any of John Adams's Dung

75
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
 lying around your house?

76
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,320
 - I don't know, who's it?

77
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,440
 - It's on your doorstep, though, and it was on fire in the back.

78
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,560
 That's the main thing.

79
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,920
 - I wasn't John Adams's own Dung just to be clear.

80
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,560
 He didn't take a poo by the side of the road

81
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,040
 and then expect guys.

82
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,560
 - Well, what if he'd accidentally swallowed a tooth

83
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,320
 or something and he wanted it for his collection?

84
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,240
 - As hypothetical situations go, Andy?

85
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,000
 - I don't know, I think you're most likely

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,160
 to swallow a tooth if you get pushed in the face.

87
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
 - And if you were wandering around inspecting poo

88
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,440
 on the streets of London, you might.

89
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,280
 (laughing)

90
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,480
 - And if I got punched in the face,

91
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,840
 I'd be likely to poo myself.

92
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,080
 (laughing)

93
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,920
 - This is why I never got to boxy bites.

94
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,000
 (laughing)

95
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,840
 Gets very messy.

96
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,440
 - That was absolutely stinks in there.

97
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,640
 - He was a lawyer originally.

98
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,520
 Before he was a president, and I'm not sure

99
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,080
 if he was a farmer at the same time as he was a lawyer,

100
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,600
 but he was a really bad lawyer.

101
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,920
 So in his first year, he had one client,

102
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
 and it took him three years before he won a case

103
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
 in front of a jury.

104
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
 - Wow.

105
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,400
 - Yeah, I don't think it was a really long trial either.

106
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,520
 I think it was just, it took him a very long time.

107
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,200
 - One thing he was a liar for was the Boston Massacre,

108
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,200
 wasn't it?

109
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
 I think quite famously that.

110
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
 - What was that?

111
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,240
 - I think it was something like there was a crowd of people,

112
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
 and there was some British soldiers,

113
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,320
 and the crowd started throwing snowballs at the soldiers.

114
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
 - Was it snowballs?

115
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
 - I think so.

116
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,440
 - And then other stuff as well, like the animals and stuff.

117
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,920
 And then the soldiers, when snowball fights get out of hand,

118
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,760
 (laughing)

119
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,600
 is that a reindeer come towards me?

120
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
 (laughing)

121
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,200
 And then the British soldiers got angry and shot them,

122
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,040
 which is obviously worse than snowballs or reindeer's,

123
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,400
 and they were arrested,

124
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,480
 and I think Adams got them off.

125
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
 - He did get them off.

126
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,160
 - Yeah.

127
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,560
 - Not one of them went to prison thanks to his defense of them.

128
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,960
 Are we saying that he was kind of partly responsible

129
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,920
 for the American Revolution starting?

130
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,440
 - I think he was certainly a player.

131
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,280
 - Wow.

132
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,760
 - And he was pro-revolution as well, wasn't he?

133
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,000
 He just defended the Brits because he wanted to uphold

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,560
 the rule of law, so he thought they had a right

135
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,200
 to equal representation.

136
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,040
 - Yeah, true.

137
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
 - Good man.

138
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,920
 - When he was in Boston, he also wrote political theory essays

139
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,640
 for the Boston newspapers under the nom de bloom,

140
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
 Humphrey Plough Jogger.

141
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,440
 (laughing)

142
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
 - Wow.

143
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,920
 - Humphrey Turd Sifter was the first draft name.

144
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,920
 (laughing)

145
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,080
 - So Jefferson was his main rival and he fought Jefferson

146
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,240
 for the title of second president of the US,

147
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,160
 and he won, and then Jefferson beat him at the next election.

148
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,840
 And then when they both retired,

149
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,360
 they spent the rest of their lives writing letters

150
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,520
 to each other.

151
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,880
 - It should have been me.

152
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,320
 (laughing)

153
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,360
 - But didn't they, during one of the elections,

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,800
 didn't they really fight, like really badly?

155
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,640
 - Yeah.

156
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,320
 - I thought Jefferson called him a hermaphrodite or something.

157
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,160
 - Yes, he did.

158
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,400
 Yeah, they had a really, really vicious campaign.

159
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,800
 And he, so Jefferson accused Adams of being a hideous,

160
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,400
 hermaphroditical character who smuggled prostitutes

161
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,480
 into the country, so he said he was smuggling prostitutes

162
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,920
 in from England, into America.

163
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,960
 And he said that he was planning to marry one of the sons

164
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,240
 of King George and that he was a royalist.

165
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,920
 Which actually, there could be some foundation to that

166
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,640
 because one of the things that Adams got mocked for

167
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,880
 when he was president was that he thought the president

168
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,640
 should be referred to as his royal highness or your majesty

169
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,080
 was something like that, 'cause he pointed out

170
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
 the presidents, you get presidents of golf clubs

171
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,680
 and other really tedious things.

172
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,440
 And it wasn't a nobel enough title.

173
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,280
 - Yeah, one of his suggestions was his highness,

174
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,080
 the president of the United States of America

175
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,480
 and protector of the rights of the same.

176
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,320
 - There you go.

177
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,760
 - Yeah.

178
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,160
 - So we were talking about Adams and Jefferson being friends,

179
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,640
 even though they called each other homaphrodites

180
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,480
 and said there were English prostitutes, a foot.

181
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,960
 They died on the same day and they died on the 50th anniversary

182
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,240
 of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,

183
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,440
 4th of July, what would it be, 1826?

184
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,040
 And they were both absolutely determined

185
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,680
 to stay alive until then.

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,000
 And Jefferson died just after noon.

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And Adams awoke soon after Jefferson had died

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
 and he was in a separate place at the time.

189
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,080
 And he said, with great effort,

190
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,120
 Thomas Jefferson survives as though at least one of the architects

191
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,000
 of the revolution is still alive,

192
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,040
 even though he didn't know that Jefferson had already died.

193
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,640
 And then he died a few hours later.

194
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
 - And then, do you think anyone,

195
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
 do you think there was a really awkward pause

196
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,960
 around his bedside when he said Jefferson survives?

197
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,200
 - Actually, no.

198
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,400
 - Should we tell him, is it cruel?

199
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,520
 - Yeah, I don't think he ever knew, which is nice.

200
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,040
 - He died thinking that Jefferson still survives today.

201
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,880
 - Really?

202
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
 (all laughing)

203
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,080
 - On his diary writing and his prolific letter writing

204
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,120
 and diary keeping, apparently Congress made fun of him

205
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,800
 because he went to Paris at one point

206
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,960
 and wrote a lot in his diary about how,

207
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,160
 - How great the done was.

208
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,160
 - Oh yeah, how great.

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
 How much he admired the French aristocracy,

210
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,680
 all this kind of really a few stuff

211
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,760
 about how great Paris was.

212
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,680
 And then he sent it along with his report

213
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,160
 of what was going on in Paris to Congress,

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,600
 possibly accidentally.

215
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,840
 I would not sure whether it was supposed to be part of the report

216
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,680
 or not.

217
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,520
 - It's a diary.

218
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,880
 - Just read it aloud and make fun of him in Congress.

219
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,760
 - It's just like a 12 year old girl in a school.

220
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,560
 - Wow, if anyone's mum's ever read their diary,

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,360
 they can take solace in this,

222
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,960
 probably the worst moment of his life

223
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,200
 when he realised that had happened.

224
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
 - I bet he never got over that.

225
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,880
 I bet that's why he had to become president

226
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,000
 was to erase the memory of his diary.

227
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,440
 Oh god, that's embarrassing.

228
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,560
 - Well, it was, okay, so there was nothing too humiliating.

229
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,160
 It wasn't like, oh dad walked in on me masturbating

230
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,320
 this morning.

231
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,480
 It must have learned to lock the door.

232
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
 It was there was nothing too awful in it.

233
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,560
 - No, he said that one of the French gentlemen...

234
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 - What do you won't believe?

235
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,800
 The prostitutes they have here in France.

236
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,240
 I think they complimented him a lot

237
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,120
 and one of the men called him the Washington negotiation.

238
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
 Oh, and he wrote that down.

239
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,280
 And he was like, oh, I really like him.

240
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,120
 He's so nice.

241
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,720
 And that's like retweeting praise of yourself, isn't it?

242
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
 And then posting the retweet to Congress.

243
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
 - Yeah.

244
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,680
 - Copying in Congress.

245
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,320
 - We should move on, but just one quick,

246
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,120
 anyone got anything on Dung or droppings?

247
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
 - Yes.

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,360
 - Go on, drop it in.

249
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,200
 - Bert Reynolds once dropped a helicopter full of horse manure

250
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,920
 on the national enquirer.

251
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,760
 - Did he?

252
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,600
 - Yeah.

253
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,440
 - Why did he do that?

254
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,600
 - They'd been writing a lot of stories about him

255
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,560
 and they weren't accurate.

256
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,920
 So he decided, he said this.

257
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,400
 I thought it was only fitting.

258
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,080
 On Christmas Eve, my pilot and I loaded my helicopter

259
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,000
 with manure from my ranch, flew over the building

260
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,880
 and watched it cascade down their giant Christmas tree.

261
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,800
 Isn't that amazing?

262
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,120
 - The children would have probably thought

263
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,280
 he was Santa Claus.

264
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,360
 (laughing)

265
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,680
 - You know, there was a moose dropping festival

266
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,640
 in Tal Keetner in Alaska.

267
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,840
 - So is this for dropping mooses or for--

268
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,240
 - Bert Reynolds flies over the town in a helicopter.

269
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,960
 - No, that's, but that's such a good question, James.

270
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,160
 And it's exactly the same question

271
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,600
 that confused Peter, the animal rights organization.

272
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,640
 So it was a festival that was canceled in 2009,

273
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,040
 but it was basically where people used to throw moose

274
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,480
 droppings out of helicopters flying over the top

275
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,520
 and people took bets on whereabouts they'd land

276
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,400
 and would bet how close they'd get to a target.

277
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,040
 But Peter got confused and assumed that it did involve

278
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,760
 hurling moose, life moose, from helicopters.

279
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,760
 - Loving them into helicopters, coaxing the moose

280
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,400
 into an aircraft.

281
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,960
 - Every time they hear about animal droppings,

282
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,000
 this is just what they usually do.

283
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,600
 (upbeat music)

284
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,920
 - Okay, we should move on.

285
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,720
 So it's time for fact number two now

286
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,920
 and that is James.

287
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,440
 - Okay, my fact this week is that you can be blocked

288
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,960
 from getting a Swiss passport if your neighbours

289
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,680
 find you too annoying.

290
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,080
 So this has come about, this is a news article

291
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,320
 that's been quite recent and it is in the canton

292
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,520
 of Argao in Switzerland and there was a lady

293
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,240
 who is a vegan and she has been complaining

294
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
 about the way that cows are treated

295
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
 and various different things in this area.

296
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,400
 - Why does this weird man keep sifting through their menu?

297
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,160
 - It's their own business.

298
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,080
 - And the locals are not very happy with her

299
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,200
 because they think that she's invading their way of life

300
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
 and the rules say that when you apply for a passport,

301
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,000
 your neighbours can give you a reference,

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,840
 either good or bad and they've given her a bad reference

303
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,640
 and it's stopping her from getting a passport

304
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,360
 and so now it has to go to the next level

305
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,400
 so that she can apply elsewhere.

306
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,240
 - She's lived there since she was eight.

307
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
 - And all her children are Swiss.

308
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,840
 - Yeah.

309
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,760
 - But she's a really big campaigner.

310
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,840
 One of the things she campaigns to get,

311
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,520
 she does campaign against putting bells

312
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,400
 around the cows next.

313
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,520
 She also campaigns against piglet racing,

314
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,360
 which is a thing that happens in Switzerland.

315
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,440
 - I wonder if she campaigns about cow droppings.

316
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,720
 (laughing)

317
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,640
 - That's a thing that happens.

318
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,240
 Cowls just walk over cliffs in Switzerland all the time.

319
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,480
 They walk off mountains and then the other cows think,

320
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,280
 oh, maybe Bessie found some better grass over there

321
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,920
 and then you get up to 40 cows at a time

322
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,640
 just plunging off cliffs to their death.

323
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
 - You always thought the smart thing for neighbours

324
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
 to do would be to give her a really glowing reference

325
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,280
 and ensure that she does have the ability

326
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,920
 to leave the country, wouldn't it?

327
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,240
 - You're right.

328
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,280
 Because having the passport means

329
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,120
 that you immediately are forced to emigrate, I think.

330
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,800
 It does allow you to leave, though, doesn't it?

331
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,640
 That's the thing.

332
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
 - Exactly.

333
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,320
 - That's true.

334
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
 I think actually she does have a passport

335
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,400
 for another country.

336
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,960
 - And nationality is Dutch as she must have

337
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,960
 a Dutch passport and she's got children there,

338
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,800
 so she can't remain.

339
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,640
 - It's weird there.

340
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,040
 The law in Switzerland is that in order to apply

341
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,920
 for a passport, you have to first become

342
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,080
 a resident of your local town, basically.

343
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
 It's called Hematort.

344
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,880
 Hematort, Hematort, Hematort, Hematort.

345
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,720
 I would pick the right one.

346
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,880
 Yeah, so all the foreign nationals

347
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,520
 have to become a citizen of the town they were living in

348
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,200
 and they have to live there for at least 12 years.

349
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
 And then up until 2003, the whole town could vote

350
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,920
 on whether they would become new citizens or not.

351
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,760
 - Would vote on whether someone could become a new citizen?

352
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,600
 - Yeah, absolutely.

353
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,520
 So a whole town would vote on it.

354
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,200
 And so until 2003, it was everyone in the town.

355
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
 Then they realised actually people were just being

356
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,240
 a bit racist because they didn't actually know

357
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,120
 these people, they would just make a judgment

358
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,440
 based on which country they came from.

359
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,640
 So they changed the law so that it's then a sort of committee

360
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,520
 when you get references from people who know them

361
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,480
 and they're judged specifically on them as a person.

362
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,120
 But it still means that it's really difficult to get into.

363
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,800
 There was a family in 2006, a family from Kosovo

364
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,320
 as a nice citizenship because one of the reasons

365
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,760
 was that they dressed inappropriately

366
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,360
 'cause they wore too many tracksuits around town.

367
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,040
 And the other one is that they didn't systematically

368
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,600
 greet people passing them on the streets.

369
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,760
 - Now that is a weird thing.

370
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
 So if you go to a party in Switzerland,

371
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
 when you arrive, you have to go around the room

372
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,840
 saying hello and shaking hands with everybody else

373
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
 at the party.

374
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,400
 And then there's a huge incentive to arrive on time

375
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
 'cause if you get there on time,

376
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
 everyone comes up to you and says hello

377
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,320
 and you don't have to go around saying hi.

378
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,960
 - Actually, you want to go early, don't you, really?

379
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
 - Yeah.

380
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,800
 - So does this kind of game theory going on and off?

381
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,080
 What time do you arrive?

382
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,920
 - Yeah.

383
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,480
 - I would actually rather get their lace

384
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,920
 because if you arrive first, then that means

385
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,520
 all your conversations are going to be interrupted

386
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,320
 by the next arrival coming up and shaking your hand.

387
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,640
 Whereas if you arrive last,

388
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,520
 you get all the handshakes out the way immediately

389
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,680
 and you can get on with your conversations in peace.

390
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,520
 That's my top tip for Swiss people out there.

391
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
 - It's very good.

392
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,200
 - Yeah, thank you.

393
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
 - This woman who's been rejected, she's writing a book

394
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,960
 and the title of it is "Selkie Annève"

395
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,800
 or "The Lady Who Annoyes".

396
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,680
 (laughing)

397
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,080
 - So she's embracing it, that's nice.

398
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,920
 - Yeah.

399
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,160
 - Yeah, grace.

400
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,240
 - What about the cowbells though?

401
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,200
 Like they do, they are incredibly loud, aren't they?

402
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,040
 - I think that is right.

403
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,640
 It's like a hundred decibels, aren't they?

404
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,240
 And it's round your neck the whole time.

405
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
 You can't get away with it.

406
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,840
 I'd just jump off a cliff and I'd follow you.

407
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,360
 (laughing)

408
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,920
 - Just on passports, there was a nine-year-old girl

409
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,480
 who recently got into Turkey on a toy passport.

410
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,920
 This was in 2013 and she was from Wales

411
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
 and she had her own passport.

412
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
 She was traveling with her parents

413
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,600
 but she also had the passport that belonged

414
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,520
 her teddy bear unicorn, her soft toy unicorn

415
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,200
 and her mum accidentally pulled that out

416
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,000
 instead handed over to the authorities

417
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,600
 who'd really stamped it and let her in.

418
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,080
 - It must have been roughly the same size

419
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,560
 in shape and colour as a normal passport.

420
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
 Which is quite a...

421
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,640
 - Well, they've got a unicorn on the front, anyway.

422
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,480
 - British pastries.

423
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,320
 - Yeah.

424
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,960
 (laughing)

425
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,760
 - Oh my God, I didn't know we had royalty visiting

426
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,040
 your Highness, welcome to Turkey.

427
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,560
 (laughing)

428
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,640
 - Can we quickly talk about how until recently

429
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,440
 so it's learned was rigged to explode

430
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,600
 if an army invaded.

431
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,440
 - Yes, I think we can,

432
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,720
 because that's going to need a lot of justification.

433
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,200
 So since the Second World War,

434
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,040
 the Muslims have had a really stringent plan

435
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,440
 for what would happen if they were invaded

436
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,040
 because they're a famously neutral country.

437
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,640
 The main kind of plan is for everyone in Switzerland

438
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,080
 to withdraw from the cities

439
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,120
 and fight a guerrilla war from the Alps

440
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,280
 if an army was to evade.

441
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,120
 And all of the tunnels through the mountains

442
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
 and all of the bridges were all rigged with explosives

443
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,720
 so that they could be blown up

444
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,080
 and it would be very difficult to get around

445
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,600
 the country, very difficult to get into

446
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
 the country in the mountains.

447
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,400
 And they have also some other plans

448
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,520
 like they have enough nuclear bunkers

449
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,840
 for every citizen of Switzerland.

450
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,080
 So presumably this woman is going to be any person

451
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,120
 who doesn't know where to go.

452
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
 - Last fall, please.

453
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
 - I thought this unicorn was last fall.

454
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,880
 (upbeat music)

455
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,000
 - Okay, we've got to move on.

456
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,360
 It's time for fact number three

457
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,440
 and that is my fact.

458
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,960
 My fact is that there are people

459
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,760
 in the houses of parliament constantly looking for fire.

460
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,280
 - You phrase that like, they're smokers

461
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,200
 in the lights and have a light.

462
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,920
 - There are 24 fire patrol officers

463
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,040
 who go around the house of parliament.

464
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
 They do it in shifts, obviously.

465
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,720
 And the Palace of Westminster

466
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,600
 is basically only able to be used

467
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
 because they're working.

468
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,360
 So if they weren't there,

469
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,640
 then the building would not comply

470
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,400
 with the 2005 fire safety order.

471
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,600
 So they are easily the 24 most important people

472
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
 in the houses of parliament.

473
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,600
 - So you say that the fire people have had to be installed

474
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,360
 because of this 2005 piece of health and safety regulation.

475
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,200
 - I do say that.

476
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,960
 - You do say that and yet I think that.

477
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,240
 - No, here we go.

478
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,320
 - Effectively, crown properties are exempt

479
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,720
 from health and safety regulations.

480
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,840
 So they still have to abide by them.

481
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,240
 But you can't prosecute the crown properties

482
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,280
 for not abiding by them.

483
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,880
 The only thing you can do is censure them.

484
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,400
 So if they don't abide by these rules,

485
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
 you go to this incredibly long process

486
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,960
 that you would go through usually

487
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,640
 where someone else might go to prison at the end

488
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,960
 or be arrested or fined.

489
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,400
 But with the crown, they just get a formal censure.

490
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,080
 - Basically, this is about how

491
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,640
 Shonky the houses of parliament are.

492
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
 - They're falling to bits, aren't they?

493
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,800
 - They really are, yeah.

494
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,040
 - There was a report in 2012

495
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,960
 that said if it wasn't closed,

496
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,000
 they'd recommend demolishing it and starting again.

497
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,840
 - Really?

498
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,680
 - Yeah.

499
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,520
 - Wow.

500
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,480
 - Do they often find fires in their hunt?

501
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,320
 - They do, yeah.

502
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,160
 - Do they?

503
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,440
 - So there have been 60 incidents since 2008,

504
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,800
 which have had the potential to cause a serious fire.

505
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,560
 - Yeah, so that is completely insane.

506
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,840
 How incompetent are the people in the houses of parliament

507
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,680
 no need to answer that.

508
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,520
 - That's right.

509
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,480
 (all laughing)

510
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
 - Well, there's just a very old building

511
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,920
 and there are lots of bits which are kind of fire hazards

512
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,240
 and which, you know, it's a huge place as well.

513
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,840
 - There's a lot of kind of it was built obviously before.

514
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,680
 It's a bit of electricity,

515
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,680
 so the wires are all kind of budged in

516
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,680
 to where all the items are.

517
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,520
 - Yeah, really loose.

518
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,360
 - And there's loads of,

519
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,760
 basically nothing gets uninstalled,

520
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
 so anytime old wiring is replaced,

521
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,520
 they don't take out the old wiring.

522
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,840
 So there's tons of flammable material sitting there

523
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,240
 and there's loads of us bestos.

524
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,080
 I mean, that's not flammable,

525
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,280
 but there's tons of us bestos.

526
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,120
 - It's sort of everywhere.

527
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
 It's not just in the walls.

528
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,680
 There's us bestos inside the lightswitches

529
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
 and things like that.

530
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,360
 - They just shut it in.

531
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,520
 - Absolutely everywhere.

532
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,160
 - Of the 3,000 windows in the Palace of Westminster,

533
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,560
 nearly all of them don't close properly.

534
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
 - Nice.

535
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,200
 - What's that for, I'm so badly built.

536
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,040
 - I guess, does that mean if there's a fire,

537
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,080
 yeah, more air will get in,

538
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,920
 I suppose, to make the fire worse.

539
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,520
 - And I think the shutters don't open properly.

540
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,840
 The windows don't close and the shutters don't open,

541
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,680
 'cause I think they built radiators.

542
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,640
 I was reading the report on why it needs redoing

543
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
 and one of the things in it

544
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
 said that they built radiators in the nooks

545
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
 that are supposed to house the shutters at some point.

546
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,400
 So now when you try to open the shutters,

547
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,520
 there's a radiator in the way.

548
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
 - Wow.

549
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,920
 Sometimes MPs misvotes

550
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,040
 because they get stuck in lifts.

551
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,880
 - Really?

552
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,160
 - Well, it's happened at least once.

553
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,320
 - Yeah, I don't know when I say sometimes,

554
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 I mean, one time.

555
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,120
 - The legislation only passed by seven votes

556
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,640
 and so if there was like a chance of,

557
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,160
 if more people couldn't get that.

558
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
 - I mean, if they'd all been in that lake.

559
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,040
 - I used to work for an MSP in Scotland

560
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,520
 and he once pressed the wrong button on his voting thing

561
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
 and voted the wrong way

562
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,040
 in a vote that came down to one vote.

563
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,360
 (gasps)

564
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,400
 - Man, that's a sheepish email to IT support.

565
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,320
 (laughs)

566
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,320
 - And then what terrible law passed because of that?

567
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,000
 - So Scottish independence upcoming, that's all him.

568
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,200
 (laughs)

569
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,960
 No, it was about green energy, I think.

570
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,160
 - I once worked in house apartment for a while

571
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,520
 and on my first day, someone came in

572
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,120
 and the office I was working in and took off his shoe

573
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,520
 and threw it at a mouse in the corner

574
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
 'cause they have a really bad mass problem.

575
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,240
 - Really, yeah.

576
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,080
 - Wow, what a...

577
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
 - It was like, oh, hi.

578
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,520
 - I literally cartoon based way to deal with that.

579
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,840
 (laughs)

580
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
 - According to MP Ben Bradshaw,

581
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,840
 there is urine leaking in the house's apartment,

582
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,680
 specifically into his office.

583
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,400
 A couple of years ago, he tweeted that urine seems

584
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
 to be pouring through the ceiling

585
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,720
 into my commons office for the second day running.

586
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
 There was some piping with holes in it

587
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,320
 in the room above him and the smell was only made bearable

588
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,800
 by his staff wearing strong perfume.

589
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,200
 (laughs)

590
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,720
 - Apparently the roof of the Hall of Westminster

591
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,360
 there aren't really sure why it's still up

592
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,160
 because they thought that it was originally built

593
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
 with columns 'cause at the time during 13th and 14th century,

594
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
 we didn't think that they had the technology

595
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,360
 to make a roof that was wider than the beams it was made of

596
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,680
 and it doesn't have columns anymore,

597
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,320
 but they recently had a look at it

598
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
 and they think that there were never any columns

599
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,200
 so they're unsure as to why it's up there

600
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,320
 and how it's staying up.

601
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,960
 - Is this gonna be like in a cartoon

602
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,920
 when the building real light is gonna be standing up?

603
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,160
 - It's freewheeling in the air for a bit

604
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,360
 and then, yeah, that's so weird.

605
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,200
 - I know.

606
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
 - So just on fire safety,

607
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,160
 has anyone seen the fire safety slide

608
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,240
 that's been installed in Shanghai?

609
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,440
 So it's basically like a slide you see in a playground

610
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
 and it goes around the stairwell

611
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,600
 and when it's not in use,

612
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,400
 then it's up vertically kind of attached to the banisters.

613
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,040
 - Why is it not in use?

614
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,880
 - Who?

615
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,720
 - Yeah, who would have used it?

616
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,920
 - What a spiral slide in a massive building.

617
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,040
 I think, oh, we won't bother using this.

618
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,160
 - James, this is not for the purposes of recreation,

619
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,080
 it's a health and safety issue.

620
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,000
 The only time you would ever want to use the slide

621
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,160
 is in a case of a fire,

622
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,680
 in which case it takes 14 seconds to descend the five stories.

623
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,160
 - Oh, that is so cool.

624
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,680
 Is there a penalty for improper use?

625
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
 - I bet that happens to me.

626
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,200
 - Almost, yeah.

627
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,320
 - That is really 14 seconds for five stories.

628
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,160
 - Well, I was trying to work out,

629
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,920
 I reckon I could run downstairs in that.

630
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,640
 - Absolutely, you're not married.

631
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
 You could, three seconds per story.

632
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,240
 - Oh, I don't know.

633
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,280
 - I take four stairs at a time, I can do it.

634
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,280
 - I think you could fall that distance at that time.

635
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,860
 (upbeat music)

636
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,600
 - Okay, it's time for a final fact for the show

637
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,960
 and that is Alex.

638
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
 - My fact this week is that the cookie monster

639
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,840
 isn't allowed to eat cookies.

640
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,760
 - Since his diabetes, diagnosis.

641
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
 - No, why not?

642
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,040
 - Well, he cookies are actually bad for the fabric,

643
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,080
 but he is made out of,

644
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,560
 so he actually eats rice cakes,

645
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,520
 disguised to look like cookies disguised, yeah.

646
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,400
 I think he knows, but yeah.

647
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
 - But it will be quite a powerful message

648
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,680
 about childhood healthy eating.

649
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,240
 If he did eat cookies and slowly

650
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,000
 he's always skin degrading and rotting away

651
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,320
 over the next six months of the show, no?

652
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,280
 - What did teach children that if you eat too many cookies,

653
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,280
 your fur will fall off.

654
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,200
 - I've never actually seen it,

655
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,880
 but obviously I was supposed to be educational, aren't they?

656
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,360
 And they're good at dealing with the heart hitting issues.

657
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,240
 I think they're covering the Trump election, as we speak.

658
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,440
 - They did have a character called Donald Grump.

659
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,160
 - So good, yeah.

660
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
 - Based on Donald Trump,

661
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,400
 and it was when the apprentice first became popular,

662
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,640
 and he was a Muppet with a bright orange quaffer,

663
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,680
 who had the most trash of any grouch in the world,

664
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,400
 and he had his name on every piece of trash in town.

665
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
 - He was played by Oscar the Grouch,

666
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,640
 and he's like, "I have more trash than you, get it?"

667
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,240
 - I don't know who Oscar the Grouch is.

668
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,760
 - All right, he's the guy who lives in the bin,

669
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,280
 he's really grumpy.

670
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,800
 - Okay, you think you've never watched it?

671
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,680
 - I bet everyone else knows Oscar the Grouch is.

672
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,600
 - Yeah, it's true, actually Oscar the Grouch is quite,

673
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,840
 even if you'd never seen it,

674
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,160
 I'm surprised you'd never come across him,

675
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,360
 but he'd come across Big Bird.

676
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
 - Yeah, so I've heard of Big Bird,

677
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,400
 and I've heard of Elmo,

678
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,560
 and I've heard of Burton Ernie,

679
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,040
 but that's only because they're referenced in Friends,

680
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,960
 which I have seen.

681
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
 - And you must have the cooking monster as well?

682
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,200
 - I think I thought that was the same as Big Bird.

683
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
 - He's appeared on every, like he's appeared on news night,

684
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,560
 he's appeared on BBC Breakfast,

685
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,320
 he's done more political shows than most people

686
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,160
 in this country.

687
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
 - It's me Corbin.

688
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,320
 (laughter)

689
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,120
 - Took a long time for us to get in the German Corbin giant.

690
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
 Poppets don't have a sexual orientation,

691
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,120
 and Sesame Street had to make that clear,

692
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
 because apparently there are lots of rumors

693
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,880
 that Burton Ernie or a gay couple.

694
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,280
 - 'Cause they share a bed.

695
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,440
 - Oh, right, okay, so I can see where those rumors came from.

696
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,480
 - Okay, so there were rumors about that,

697
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,800
 and they said they're just friends,

698
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,200
 and poppets don't have a sexual orientation.

699
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,240
 - They don't exist below the waist.

700
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
 They only have a top half.

701
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,720
 - Big Bird exists below the waist.

702
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,560
 - Yeah, I've seen--

703
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,440
 - He's not poppets.

704
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,160
 - And I guess, unless he belongs to the 3% of birds

705
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,200
 that do have a penis, Big Bird will have a cloaca,

706
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,760
 which he will press against the cloaca

707
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,320
 or of other big birds.

708
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
 - They are educational,

709
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,680
 presumably they've discussed the cloaca

710
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,120
 of Big Bird at some point in the show.

711
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,560
 So Big Bird is flightless,

712
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,920
 and isn't it true?

713
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,520
 I read someone said this week that flightless birds

714
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,520
 have a bladder, is that right?

715
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,880
 - Flightless, the only bird with a bladder is the ostrich.

716
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,400
 - And that's because bladder's a heavy,

717
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,120
 like birds can't normally have them

718
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,400
 because it would weigh them down.

719
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,240
 - Yes.

720
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
 - But Big Bird could possibly have a bladder.

721
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
 - He could have a bladder, is anyone ever seen him we?

722
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
 (laughing)

723
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
 - No, he's not a grumpass.

724
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,800
 (laughing)

725
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,840
 - Is it Elmo the only non-human

726
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,920
 to testify in the course of law?

727
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,400
 - Where did the defendant tickle you?

728
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,960
 (laughing)

729
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,200
 - No, it was during a campaign

730
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,800
 for increased funding for music programs

731
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,240
 and he testified that there should be indeed that.

732
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,320
 Does he sing, is he involved?

733
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,160
 Does he see musicals?

734
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,320
 - He's, yeah, he's sing, yeah, they all sing.

735
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,840
 - I hope he'll sing.

736
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,480
 - So there's a list of puppets

737
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,040
 that have been in Sesame Street and Muppets as well.

738
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,320
 But there's a list and there was one called Anna.

739
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,160
 - Hey.

740
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,640
 - This was in the Spanish version of Sesame Street

741
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,760
 and it says that Anna had a know it all attitude.

742
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,440
 - Wow.

743
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,680
 - Based on me, I'm not gonna lie.

744
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,240
 But it's a justified attitude, isn't it?

745
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,920
 - Alex Bell, there was one called Bell

746
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,720
 who was in the Brazilian co-production of Sesame Street

747
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,680
 and Bell was an imaginative hot pink monster girl.

748
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,840
 - Sounds better, right?

749
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,000
 That's my online profile.

750
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
 (laughing)

751
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
 - And there was one called Murray Monster.

752
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,240
 - What was that?

753
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,560
 - And he was the host of the word on the street segment

754
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,280
 and he was a boisterous red orange muppet.

755
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,520
 (laughing)

756
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,960
 - In the Nigerian version of Sesame Street,

757
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,760
 the star muppet is called Kami

758
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,600
 and Kami is HIV positive to remove the stigma

759
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,920
 of talking about dealing with the hardest issues, yeah.

760
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
 - That's so good.

761
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
 - I know.

762
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,600
 - Another responsible thing they do

763
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,280
 is they make a whole set program called Talk Listen Connect

764
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,040
 and it's for children with parents in the military

765
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,560
 and they broadcast that to them

766
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,040
 to teach them about how much they're gonna miss their parents

767
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,840
 and how it's okay and how, for instance,

768
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,000
 like amputees coming back from war zones,

769
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,400
 their children might be a bit traumatized by seeing that.

770
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,360
 And so there was a lovely story of a father

771
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,280
 who came back from Afghanistan, I think,

772
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,760
 and he'd had three of his limbs amputated

773
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,680
 and he was really worried and they showed him

774
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,120
 the Sesame Street video that had been made

775
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,440
 to educate his children about his condition

776
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,960
 and he burst into tears apparently.

777
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,000
 He was so happy that he had a good way

778
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,400
 of communicating it to his child.

779
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
 - Oh my goodness.

780
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,880
 - Some of the muppets are actually made

781
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,800
 of army surplus material.

782
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,160
 I watched that until I came in three ages ago

783
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,240
 and I just remembered it.

784
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,200
 - The Cookie Monster has a British cousin

785
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,000
 - Really? - Called the Biscuit Bastard.

786
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,760
 (all laughing)

787
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,880
 - You are half right.

788
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,720
 - Oh really?

789
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,560
 - It's the Biscuit Monster.

790
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,120
 - Oh okay.

791
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
 - Biscuit Bastard would be good.

792
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,800
 That could educate children about how it's okay

793
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,160
 if your parents aren't mad.

794
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,680
 (all laughing)

795
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,080
 - That's hilarious.

796
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,320
 - Does he actually feature on the American show then?

797
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,280
 - He was only in one episode where he came

798
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,080
 to visit the Cookie Monster.

799
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
 - Okay. - Yeah.

800
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,640
 He was on holiday.

801
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,080
 - Tried to get himself a job as Donald Grumps

802
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,560
 representative in the year.

803
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,320
 (all laughing)

804
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,480
 - We could talk about Biscuits,

805
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
 but do you think I can I just say one thing

806
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,960
 about Biscuits then?

807
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,880
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

808
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,920
 - Dunking Biscuits was originally done in wine.

809
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,040
 The first evidence we have of Biscuit Dunking

810
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,480
 was Wafers that the Romans softened in wine.

811
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,720
 - Oh. - Wow.

812
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,560
 - And before dunking in tea even there was dunking in beer

813
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,480
 because in the Royal Navy you would have had hard

814
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,280
 Biscuits that were really, really hard

815
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 and you couldn't eat them very well.

816
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:28,800
 So people would dunk them in their beer to soften them up.

817
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,880
 - Oh, that's very interesting.

818
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,720
 - Wafers in wine.

819
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,560
 - Wafers in wine.

820
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,440
 Oh, you'll have to dunk your wafer in your wine at church.

821
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,280
 Drink me.

822
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,120
 - You're not, no.

823
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,120
 The idea of putting wafers directly into people's mouths.

824
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,960
 - Yeah.

825
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,600
 - That came because they were worried

826
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,680
 that people would take them in their hands,

827
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,080
 hide them away and use them for magic pulsions.

828
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,280
 - I thought you were going to say use them

829
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,720
 slowly over time, build their own Christ at home.

830
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,840
 (laughing)

831
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,960
 - I was reading about Simon Pope who's a Biscuit designer

832
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
 and tester.

833
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,280
 - And that's the best job in the world.

834
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,520
 (laughing)

835
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,440
 - Honestly, his job, so his job includes eating,

836
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,800
 tasting biscuits from 472 packets of biscuits every year.

837
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,720
 So he says he tastes 30 biscuits a day.

838
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,560
 - Wow.

839
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,720
 - He says he often doesn't swallow them

840
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,880
 because I guess for health reasons.

841
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,160
 So he says he'll nibble on them

842
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,440
 to check for things like taste, texture and firmness.

843
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,280
 - He says he sometimes does have biscuits at work

844
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,600
 because it's important to test them in situ.

845
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,600
 - I need to test this batch in Las Vegas.

846
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
 - I'm afraid.

847
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
 (laughing)

848
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,160
 - Travel expenses are enormous.

849
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,560
 (laughing)

850
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,400
 - He's in the plane.

851
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,360
 He's got a seat next to him

852
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,240
 which just has a pack of biscuits on it.

853
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
 (laughing)

854
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,080
 - He's always going around the world,

855
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,920
 help not big news.

856
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,520
 (laughing)

857
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,560
 - I think we might be done today.

858
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,400
 - I think so too.

859
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,680
 - Today's your return, guys.

860
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,280
 (upbeat music)

861
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,400
 - Okay, that's it.

862
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,280
 That's all of our facts.

863
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,720
 Thank you so much for listening.

864
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,400
 We hope you've enjoyed it.

865
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,720
 We will be back again next week

866
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,080
 with another selection of our favorite facts.

867
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,200
 So until then, it's goodbye from us

868
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
 and you can follow us on Twitter if you'd like.

869
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,560
 We are on James at Egg Shaped.

870
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,400
 Alex at Alex Bell Under School.

871
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
 I'm on @AndrewHunterM

872
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,280
 and you can follow our group account

873
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,600
 which is @QiPodcast.

874
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,680
 Anna, you can email podcast@Qi.com

875
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,440
 and I just quickly wanna say,

876
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,920
 I got very behind on some emails towards the end of last year.

877
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
 So I really apologize if you've done that.

878
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
 I will try and get back to all emails, henceforth.

879
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,240
 Sorry if you haven't heard of me.

880
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,040
 - Okay, that'll end from hundreds more emails.

881
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,680
 (laughing)

882
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,160
 You can also go to our website

883
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,000
 which is no such thing as a fish.com.

884
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,120
 You can also watch our TV show,

885
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,960
 no such thing as the news if you go to the website

886
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,280
 which is no such thing as the news.com.

887
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,640
 Okay, thanks again for listening and goodbye.

888
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,220
 (upbeat music)

889
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,800
 (upbeat music)

890
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:04,800
 (upbeat music)
