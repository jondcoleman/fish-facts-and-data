00:00:14,00:00:16,"Hello and welcome back to another episode of ""No Such Thing"""
00:00:16,00:00:19,"as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you"
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:23,My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and I'm sitting here
00:00:23,00:00:26,"with Anna Tajinsky, James Harkin and Alex Bell."
00:00:26,00:00:28,And we have gathered our favorite facts
00:00:28,00:00:31,"from the last seven days, so in no particular order,"
00:00:31,00:00:34,"here we go, starting with you, Anna."
00:00:34,00:00:36,- My fact this week is that the second president
00:00:36,00:00:40,of the United States of America used to inspect London's Dung.
00:00:40,00:00:41,[laughing]
00:00:41,00:00:43,- Why did John Adams go around inspecting Dung?
00:00:43,00:00:46,"- The reason he did it, he obviously was a farmer"
00:00:46,00:00:47,and he was inspecting--
00:00:47,00:00:49,"- Obviously, this little manufacturer was also"
00:00:49,00:00:51,the president of the United States.
00:00:51,00:00:53,- He's most famous for his farming days.
00:00:53,00:00:54,"No, sorry, he's obvious from his diaries"
00:00:54,00:00:56,that he's a farmer because he--
00:00:56,00:00:58,"- He's a farmer from his diaries, yeah."
00:00:58,00:01:00,[laughing]
00:01:00,00:01:02,"- Well, look at all that."
00:01:02,00:01:05,"- Was it sort of 25th March, did some more farming today?"
00:01:05,00:01:06,Is that what gives it away?
00:01:06,00:01:09,"- That was my first clue, yeah."
00:01:09,00:01:11,"25th March, milk to cow."
00:01:11,00:01:13,- When all the people of America let me get back to my farm.
00:01:13,00:01:15,[laughing]
00:01:15,00:01:18,- He was a farmer and so he was inspecting it
00:01:18,00:01:21,to compare it to his own Dung and he pointed out--
00:01:21,00:01:22,- So his own Dung?
00:01:22,00:01:23,[laughing]
00:01:23,00:01:25,- This is not normal behavior in a person.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"- Well, and he's questioning."
00:01:27,00:01:30,"- He's an absolute fruit loop, let's try."
00:01:30,00:01:31,- It's amazing that they let him mentally unstable
00:01:31,00:01:32,with the president of America.
00:01:32,00:01:33,- That will never happen again.
00:01:33,00:01:35,[laughing]
00:01:35,00:01:38,- He was a very stable man and had many stables of his own.
00:01:38,00:01:40,[laughing]
00:01:40,00:01:43,He inspected the Dung in order to compare it to the manure
00:01:43,00:01:45,he kept on his own farm and in fact he concluded
00:01:45,00:01:49,"that the manure on the edgeware road, he wrote of it,"
00:01:49,00:01:52,"""This may be good manure, but it is not equal to mine."""
00:01:52,00:01:53,- Wow.
00:01:53,00:01:54,"- Yeah, so he had better manure."
00:01:54,00:01:58,He had some manure from the Boston marshes
00:01:58,00:02:00,which he considered superior.
00:02:00,00:02:02,"- And yeah, this fact was sent in actually"
00:02:02,00:02:04,by a guy called Mark David who sent me
00:02:04,00:02:06,some of John Adams diaries.
00:02:06,00:02:09,"And he said in his diary, ""In one of my common walks"
00:02:09,00:02:11,"along the edgeware road, there are fine meadows"
00:02:11,00:02:15,"belonging to a noted cowkeeper, plentifully manured."
00:02:15,00:02:17,I have carefully examined the manure
00:02:17,00:02:19,and found it to be composed of straw
00:02:19,00:02:21,and Dung from the stables of streets of London
00:02:21,00:02:22,and then he goes through all the stuff
00:02:22,00:02:23,"that's in the manure, so he's really gone through it"
00:02:23,00:02:25,"with his hands, properly getting in there,"
00:02:25,00:02:27,"to live up edgeware road in that direction,"
00:02:27,00:02:29,"and it's not like that anymore."""
00:02:29,00:02:31,- Do you ever find any of John Adams's Dung
00:02:31,00:02:32,lying around your house?
00:02:32,00:02:33,"- I don't know, who's it?"
00:02:33,00:02:35,"- It's on your doorstep, though, and it was on fire in the back."
00:02:35,00:02:37,That's the main thing.
00:02:37,00:02:39,- I wasn't John Adams's own Dung just to be clear.
00:02:39,00:02:41,He didn't take a poo by the side of the road
00:02:41,00:02:43,and then expect guys.
00:02:43,00:02:45,"- Well, what if he'd accidentally swallowed a tooth"
00:02:45,00:02:47,or something and he wanted it for his collection?
00:02:47,00:02:49,"- As hypothetical situations go, Andy?"
00:02:49,00:02:51,"- I don't know, I think you're most likely"
00:02:51,00:02:53,to swallow a tooth if you get pushed in the face.
00:02:53,00:02:55,- And if you were wandering around inspecting poo
00:02:55,00:02:56,"on the streets of London, you might."
00:02:56,00:02:58,(laughing)
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- And if I got punched in the face,"
00:02:59,00:03:00,I'd be likely to poo myself.
00:03:00,00:03:03,(laughing)
00:03:03,00:03:04,- This is why I never got to boxy bites.
00:03:04,00:03:07,(laughing)
00:03:07,00:03:08,Gets very messy.
00:03:08,00:03:10,- That was absolutely stinks in there.
00:03:10,00:03:11,- He was a lawyer originally.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"Before he was a president, and I'm not sure"
00:03:14,00:03:16,"if he was a farmer at the same time as he was a lawyer,"
00:03:16,00:03:17,but he was a really bad lawyer.
00:03:17,00:03:19,"So in his first year, he had one client,"
00:03:19,00:03:22,and it took him three years before he won a case
00:03:22,00:03:23,in front of a jury.
00:03:23,00:03:23,- Wow.
00:03:23,00:03:25,"- Yeah, I don't think it was a really long trial either."
00:03:25,00:03:27,"I think it was just, it took him a very long time."
00:03:27,00:03:30,"- One thing he was a liar for was the Boston Massacre,"
00:03:30,00:03:31,wasn't it?
00:03:31,00:03:32,I think quite famously that.
00:03:32,00:03:33,- What was that?
00:03:33,00:03:36,"- I think it was something like there was a crowd of people,"
00:03:36,00:03:37,"and there was some British soldiers,"
00:03:37,00:03:40,and the crowd started throwing snowballs at the soldiers.
00:03:40,00:03:41,- Was it snowballs?
00:03:41,00:03:42,- I think so.
00:03:42,00:03:44,"- And then other stuff as well, like the animals and stuff."
00:03:44,00:03:47,"And then the soldiers, when snowball fights get out of hand,"
00:03:47,00:03:48,(laughing)
00:03:48,00:03:50,is that a reindeer come towards me?
00:03:50,00:03:52,(laughing)
00:03:52,00:03:57,"And then the British soldiers got angry and shot them,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,"which is obviously worse than snowballs or reindeer's,"
00:04:00,00:04:01,"and they were arrested,"
00:04:01,00:04:03,and I think Adams got them off.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- He did get them off.
00:04:04,00:04:05,- Yeah.
00:04:05,00:04:08,- Not one of them went to prison thanks to his defense of them.
00:04:08,00:04:10,Are we saying that he was kind of partly responsible
00:04:10,00:04:12,for the American Revolution starting?
00:04:12,00:04:15,- I think he was certainly a player.
00:04:15,00:04:16,- Wow.
00:04:16,00:04:17,"- And he was pro-revolution as well, wasn't he?"
00:04:17,00:04:21,He just defended the Brits because he wanted to uphold
00:04:21,00:04:22,"the rule of law, so he thought they had a right"
00:04:22,00:04:24,to equal representation.
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- Yeah, true."
00:04:25,00:04:25,- Good man.
00:04:25,00:04:27,"- When he was in Boston, he also wrote political theory essays"
00:04:27,00:04:30,"for the Boston newspapers under the nom de bloom,"
00:04:30,00:04:32,Humphrey Plough Jogger.
00:04:32,00:04:33,(laughing)
00:04:33,00:04:34,- Wow.
00:04:34,00:04:37,- Humphrey Turd Sifter was the first draft name.
00:04:37,00:04:39,(laughing)
00:04:39,00:04:43,- So Jefferson was his main rival and he fought Jefferson
00:04:43,00:04:45,"for the title of second president of the US,"
00:04:45,00:04:48,"and he won, and then Jefferson beat him at the next election."
00:04:48,00:04:49,"And then when they both retired,"
00:04:49,00:04:51,they spent the rest of their lives writing letters
00:04:51,00:04:52,to each other.
00:04:52,00:04:53,- It should have been me.
00:04:53,00:04:55,(laughing)
00:04:55,00:04:57,"- But didn't they, during one of the elections,"
00:04:57,00:04:59,"didn't they really fight, like really badly?"
00:04:59,00:05:00,- Yeah.
00:05:00,00:05:02,- I thought Jefferson called him a hermaphrodite or something.
00:05:02,00:05:03,"- Yes, he did."
00:05:03,00:05:05,"Yeah, they had a really, really vicious campaign."
00:05:05,00:05:08,"And he, so Jefferson accused Adams of being a hideous,"
00:05:08,00:05:11,hermaphroditical character who smuggled prostitutes
00:05:11,00:05:13,"into the country, so he said he was smuggling prostitutes"
00:05:13,00:05:15,"in from England, into America."
00:05:15,00:05:18,And he said that he was planning to marry one of the sons
00:05:18,00:05:21,of King George and that he was a royalist.
00:05:21,00:05:23,"Which actually, there could be some foundation to that"
00:05:23,00:05:26,because one of the things that Adams got mocked for
00:05:26,00:05:28,when he was president was that he thought the president
00:05:28,00:05:32,should be referred to as his royal highness or your majesty
00:05:32,00:05:34,"was something like that, 'cause he pointed out"
00:05:34,00:05:36,"the presidents, you get presidents of golf clubs"
00:05:36,00:05:38,and other really tedious things.
00:05:38,00:05:40,And it wasn't a nobel enough title.
00:05:40,00:05:42,"- Yeah, one of his suggestions was his highness,"
00:05:42,00:05:44,the president of the United States of America
00:05:44,00:05:46,and protector of the rights of the same.
00:05:46,00:05:47,- There you go.
00:05:47,00:05:48,- Yeah.
00:05:48,00:05:51,"- So we were talking about Adams and Jefferson being friends,"
00:05:51,00:05:52,even though they called each other homaphrodites
00:05:52,00:05:56,"and said there were English prostitutes, a foot."
00:05:56,00:06:00,They died on the same day and they died on the 50th anniversary
00:06:00,00:06:03,"of the signing of the Declaration of Independence,"
00:06:03,00:06:06,"4th of July, what would it be, 1826?"
00:06:06,00:06:08,And they were both absolutely determined
00:06:08,00:06:09,to stay alive until then.
00:06:09,00:06:13,And Jefferson died just after noon.
00:06:13,00:06:18,And Adams awoke soon after Jefferson had died
00:06:18,00:06:21,and he was in a separate place at the time.
00:06:21,00:06:23,"And he said, with great effort,"
00:06:23,00:06:26,Thomas Jefferson survives as though at least one of the architects
00:06:26,00:06:27,"of the revolution is still alive,"
00:06:27,00:06:29,even though he didn't know that Jefferson had already died.
00:06:29,00:06:30,And then he died a few hours later.
00:06:30,00:06:31,"- And then, do you think anyone,"
00:06:31,00:06:32,do you think there was a really awkward pause
00:06:32,00:06:34,around his bedside when he said Jefferson survives?
00:06:34,00:06:36,"- Actually, no."
00:06:36,00:06:39,"- Should we tell him, is it cruel?"
00:06:39,00:06:41,"- Yeah, I don't think he ever knew, which is nice."
00:06:41,00:06:44,- He died thinking that Jefferson still survives today.
00:06:44,00:06:44,- Really?
00:06:44,00:06:47,(all laughing)
00:06:47,00:06:51,- On his diary writing and his prolific letter writing
00:06:51,00:06:53,"and diary keeping, apparently Congress made fun of him"
00:06:53,00:06:55,because he went to Paris at one point
00:06:55,00:06:57,"and wrote a lot in his diary about how,"
00:06:57,00:06:59,- How great the done was.
00:06:59,00:07:00,"- Oh yeah, how great."
00:07:00,00:07:02,"How much he admired the French aristocracy,"
00:07:02,00:07:03,all this kind of really a few stuff
00:07:03,00:07:04,about how great Paris was.
00:07:04,00:07:06,And then he sent it along with his report
00:07:06,00:07:08,"of what was going on in Paris to Congress,"
00:07:08,00:07:09,possibly accidentally.
00:07:09,00:07:11,I would not sure whether it was supposed to be part of the report
00:07:11,00:07:12,or not.
00:07:12,00:07:13,- It's a diary.
00:07:13,00:07:15,- Just read it aloud and make fun of him in Congress.
00:07:15,00:07:18,- It's just like a 12 year old girl in a school.
00:07:18,00:07:20,"- Wow, if anyone's mum's ever read their diary,"
00:07:20,00:07:22,"they can take solace in this,"
00:07:22,00:07:23,probably the worst moment of his life
00:07:23,00:07:25,when he realised that had happened.
00:07:25,00:07:26,- I bet he never got over that.
00:07:26,00:07:27,I bet that's why he had to become president
00:07:27,00:07:30,was to erase the memory of his diary.
00:07:30,00:07:31,"Oh god, that's embarrassing."
00:07:31,00:07:33,"- Well, it was, okay, so there was nothing too humiliating."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"It wasn't like, oh dad walked in on me masturbating"
00:07:36,00:07:37,this morning.
00:07:37,00:07:38,It must have learned to lock the door.
00:07:38,00:07:39,It was there was nothing too awful in it.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- No, he said that one of the French gentlemen..."
00:07:42,00:07:43,- What do you won't believe?
00:07:43,00:07:45,The prostitutes they have here in France.
00:07:45,00:07:48,I think they complimented him a lot
00:07:48,00:07:51,and one of the men called him the Washington negotiation.
00:07:51,00:07:52,"Oh, and he wrote that down."
00:07:52,00:07:53,"And he was like, oh, I really like him."
00:07:53,00:07:54,He's so nice.
00:07:54,00:07:56,"And that's like retweeting praise of yourself, isn't it?"
00:07:56,00:07:58,And then posting the retweet to Congress.
00:07:58,00:07:59,- Yeah.
00:07:59,00:08:01,- Copying in Congress.
00:08:01,00:08:03,"- We should move on, but just one quick,"
00:08:03,00:08:05,anyone got anything on Dung or droppings?
00:08:05,00:08:06,- Yes.
00:08:06,00:08:08,"- Go on, drop it in."
00:08:08,00:08:11,- Bert Reynolds once dropped a helicopter full of horse manure
00:08:11,00:08:12,on the national enquirer.
00:08:12,00:08:13,- Did he?
00:08:13,00:08:14,- Yeah.
00:08:14,00:08:15,- Why did he do that?
00:08:15,00:08:16,- They'd been writing a lot of stories about him
00:08:16,00:08:17,and they weren't accurate.
00:08:17,00:08:19,"So he decided, he said this."
00:08:19,00:08:21,I thought it was only fitting.
00:08:21,00:08:24,"On Christmas Eve, my pilot and I loaded my helicopter"
00:08:24,00:08:27,"with manure from my ranch, flew over the building"
00:08:27,00:08:29,and watched it cascade down their giant Christmas tree.
00:08:29,00:08:32,Isn't that amazing?
00:08:32,00:08:34,- The children would have probably thought
00:08:34,00:08:35,he was Santa Claus.
00:08:35,00:08:37,(laughing)
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- You know, there was a moose dropping festival"
00:08:39,00:08:41,in Tal Keetner in Alaska.
00:08:41,00:08:44,- So is this for dropping mooses or for--
00:08:44,00:08:48,- Bert Reynolds flies over the town in a helicopter.
00:08:48,00:08:52,"- No, that's, but that's such a good question, James."
00:08:52,00:08:54,And it's exactly the same question
00:08:54,00:08:57,"that confused Peter, the animal rights organization."
00:08:57,00:09:00,"So it was a festival that was canceled in 2009,"
00:09:00,00:09:03,but it was basically where people used to throw moose
00:09:03,00:09:05,droppings out of helicopters flying over the top
00:09:05,00:09:07,and people took bets on whereabouts they'd land
00:09:07,00:09:09,and would bet how close they'd get to a target.
00:09:09,00:09:12,But Peter got confused and assumed that it did involve
00:09:12,00:09:14,"hurling moose, life moose, from helicopters."
00:09:14,00:09:17,"- Loving them into helicopters, coaxing the moose"
00:09:17,00:09:19,into an aircraft.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"- Every time they hear about animal droppings,"
00:09:21,00:09:24,this is just what they usually do.
00:09:24,00:09:26,(upbeat music)
00:09:26,00:09:29,"- Okay, we should move on."
00:09:29,00:09:31,So it's time for fact number two now
00:09:31,00:09:33,and that is James.
00:09:33,00:09:36,"- Okay, my fact this week is that you can be blocked"
00:09:36,00:09:38,from getting a Swiss passport if your neighbours
00:09:38,00:09:40,find you too annoying.
00:09:40,00:09:44,"So this has come about, this is a news article"
00:09:44,00:09:47,that's been quite recent and it is in the canton
00:09:47,00:09:50,of Argao in Switzerland and there was a lady
00:09:50,00:09:54,who is a vegan and she has been complaining
00:09:54,00:09:56,about the way that cows are treated
00:09:56,00:09:58,and various different things in this area.
00:09:58,00:10:00,- Why does this weird man keep sifting through their menu?
00:10:00,00:10:02,- It's their own business.
00:10:02,00:10:06,- And the locals are not very happy with her
00:10:06,00:10:09,because they think that she's invading their way of life
00:10:09,00:10:11,"and the rules say that when you apply for a passport,"
00:10:11,00:10:14,"your neighbours can give you a reference,"
00:10:14,00:10:16,either good or bad and they've given her a bad reference
00:10:16,00:10:18,and it's stopping her from getting a passport
00:10:18,00:10:20,and so now it has to go to the next level
00:10:20,00:10:22,so that she can apply elsewhere.
00:10:22,00:10:24,- She's lived there since she was eight.
00:10:24,00:10:26,- And all her children are Swiss.
00:10:26,00:10:26,- Yeah.
00:10:26,00:10:28,- But she's a really big campaigner.
00:10:28,00:10:29,"One of the things she campaigns to get,"
00:10:29,00:10:31,she does campaign against putting bells
00:10:31,00:10:32,around the cows next.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"She also campaigns against piglet racing,"
00:10:34,00:10:36,which is a thing that happens in Switzerland.
00:10:36,00:10:38,- I wonder if she campaigns about cow droppings.
00:10:38,00:10:40,(laughing)
00:10:40,00:10:41,- That's a thing that happens.
00:10:41,00:10:44,Cowls just walk over cliffs in Switzerland all the time.
00:10:44,00:10:46,"They walk off mountains and then the other cows think,"
00:10:46,00:10:49,"oh, maybe Bessie found some better grass over there"
00:10:49,00:10:51,and then you get up to 40 cows at a time
00:10:51,00:10:53,just plunging off cliffs to their death.
00:10:53,00:10:55,- You always thought the smart thing for neighbours
00:10:55,00:10:57,to do would be to give her a really glowing reference
00:10:57,00:10:59,and ensure that she does have the ability
00:10:59,00:11:00,"to leave the country, wouldn't it?"
00:11:00,00:11:02,- You're right.
00:11:02,00:11:04,Because having the passport means
00:11:04,00:11:07,"that you immediately are forced to emigrate, I think."
00:11:07,00:11:08,"It does allow you to leave, though, doesn't it?"
00:11:08,00:11:09,That's the thing.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- Exactly.
00:11:10,00:11:11,- That's true.
00:11:11,00:11:12,I think actually she does have a passport
00:11:12,00:11:13,for another country.
00:11:13,00:11:14,- And nationality is Dutch as she must have
00:11:14,00:11:16,"a Dutch passport and she's got children there,"
00:11:16,00:11:17,so she can't remain.
00:11:17,00:11:18,- It's weird there.
00:11:18,00:11:21,The law in Switzerland is that in order to apply
00:11:21,00:11:22,"for a passport, you have to first become"
00:11:22,00:11:25,"a resident of your local town, basically."
00:11:25,00:11:27,It's called Hematort.
00:11:27,00:11:29,"Hematort, Hematort, Hematort, Hematort."
00:11:29,00:11:31,I would pick the right one.
00:11:31,00:11:32,"Yeah, so all the foreign nationals"
00:11:32,00:11:35,have to become a citizen of the town they were living in
00:11:35,00:11:37,and they have to live there for at least 12 years.
00:11:37,00:11:40,"And then up until 2003, the whole town could vote"
00:11:40,00:11:42,on whether they would become new citizens or not.
00:11:42,00:11:44,- Would vote on whether someone could become a new citizen?
00:11:44,00:11:45,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:11:45,00:11:46,So a whole town would vote on it.
00:11:46,00:11:49,"And so until 2003, it was everyone in the town."
00:11:49,00:11:50,Then they realised actually people were just being
00:11:50,00:11:52,a bit racist because they didn't actually know
00:11:52,00:11:54,"these people, they would just make a judgment"
00:11:54,00:11:55,based on which country they came from.
00:11:55,00:11:57,So they changed the law so that it's then a sort of committee
00:11:57,00:11:59,when you get references from people who know them
00:11:59,00:12:02,and they're judged specifically on them as a person.
00:12:02,00:12:04,But it still means that it's really difficult to get into.
00:12:04,00:12:06,"There was a family in 2006, a family from Kosovo"
00:12:06,00:12:09,as a nice citizenship because one of the reasons
00:12:09,00:12:10,was that they dressed inappropriately
00:12:10,00:12:12,'cause they wore too many tracksuits around town.
00:12:12,00:12:14,And the other one is that they didn't systematically
00:12:14,00:12:16,greet people passing them on the streets.
00:12:16,00:12:17,- Now that is a weird thing.
00:12:17,00:12:19,"So if you go to a party in Switzerland,"
00:12:19,00:12:21,"when you arrive, you have to go around the room"
00:12:21,00:12:23,saying hello and shaking hands with everybody else
00:12:23,00:12:24,at the party.
00:12:24,00:12:26,And then there's a huge incentive to arrive on time
00:12:26,00:12:27,"'cause if you get there on time,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,everyone comes up to you and says hello
00:12:29,00:12:30,and you don't have to go around saying hi.
00:12:30,00:12:31,"- Actually, you want to go early, don't you, really?"
00:12:31,00:12:32,- Yeah.
00:12:32,00:12:35,- So does this kind of game theory going on and off?
00:12:35,00:12:37,What time do you arrive?
00:12:37,00:12:37,- Yeah.
00:12:37,00:12:39,- I would actually rather get their lace
00:12:39,00:12:41,"because if you arrive first, then that means"
00:12:41,00:12:43,all your conversations are going to be interrupted
00:12:43,00:12:45,by the next arrival coming up and shaking your hand.
00:12:45,00:12:46,"Whereas if you arrive last,"
00:12:46,00:12:48,you get all the handshakes out the way immediately
00:12:48,00:12:50,and you can get on with your conversations in peace.
00:12:50,00:12:52,That's my top tip for Swiss people out there.
00:12:52,00:12:53,- It's very good.
00:12:53,00:12:54,"- Yeah, thank you."
00:12:54,00:12:56,"- This woman who's been rejected, she's writing a book"
00:12:56,00:12:58,"and the title of it is ""Selkie Annève"""
00:12:58,00:13:00,"or ""The Lady Who Annoyes""."
00:13:00,00:13:02,(laughing)
00:13:02,00:13:04,"- So she's embracing it, that's nice."
00:13:04,00:13:04,- Yeah.
00:13:04,00:13:06,"- Yeah, grace."
00:13:06,00:13:07,- What about the cowbells though?
00:13:07,00:13:09,"Like they do, they are incredibly loud, aren't they?"
00:13:09,00:13:10,- I think that is right.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"It's like a hundred decibels, aren't they?"
00:13:12,00:13:14,And it's round your neck the whole time.
00:13:14,00:13:15,You can't get away with it.
00:13:15,00:13:18,I'd just jump off a cliff and I'd follow you.
00:13:18,00:13:21,(laughing)
00:13:21,00:13:24,"- Just on passports, there was a nine-year-old girl"
00:13:24,00:13:29,who recently got into Turkey on a toy passport.
00:13:29,00:13:33,This was in 2013 and she was from Wales
00:13:33,00:13:35,and she had her own passport.
00:13:35,00:13:36,She was traveling with her parents
00:13:36,00:13:38,but she also had the passport that belonged
00:13:38,00:13:42,"her teddy bear unicorn, her soft toy unicorn"
00:13:42,00:13:44,and her mum accidentally pulled that out
00:13:44,00:13:46,instead handed over to the authorities
00:13:46,00:13:47,who'd really stamped it and let her in.
00:13:47,00:13:49,- It must have been roughly the same size
00:13:49,00:13:51,in shape and colour as a normal passport.
00:13:51,00:13:52,Which is quite a...
00:13:52,00:13:54,"- Well, they've got a unicorn on the front, anyway."
00:13:54,00:13:55,- British pastries.
00:13:55,00:13:56,- Yeah.
00:13:56,00:13:58,(laughing)
00:13:58,00:14:00,"- Oh my God, I didn't know we had royalty visiting"
00:14:00,00:14:03,"your Highness, welcome to Turkey."
00:14:03,00:14:05,(laughing)
00:14:05,00:14:07,- Can we quickly talk about how until recently
00:14:07,00:14:09,so it's learned was rigged to explode
00:14:09,00:14:10,if an army invaded.
00:14:10,00:14:11,"- Yes, I think we can,"
00:14:11,00:14:13,because that's going to need a lot of justification.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"So since the Second World War,"
00:14:16,00:14:19,the Muslims have had a really stringent plan
00:14:19,00:14:20,for what would happen if they were invaded
00:14:20,00:14:22,because they're a famously neutral country.
00:14:22,00:14:24,The main kind of plan is for everyone in Switzerland
00:14:24,00:14:26,to withdraw from the cities
00:14:26,00:14:28,and fight a guerrilla war from the Alps
00:14:28,00:14:29,if an army was to evade.
00:14:29,00:14:31,And all of the tunnels through the mountains
00:14:31,00:14:33,and all of the bridges were all rigged with explosives
00:14:33,00:14:34,so that they could be blown up
00:14:34,00:14:36,and it would be very difficult to get around
00:14:36,00:14:37,"the country, very difficult to get into"
00:14:37,00:14:38,the country in the mountains.
00:14:38,00:14:40,And they have also some other plans
00:14:40,00:14:42,like they have enough nuclear bunkers
00:14:42,00:14:44,for every citizen of Switzerland.
00:14:44,00:14:47,So presumably this woman is going to be any person
00:14:47,00:14:49,who doesn't know where to go.
00:14:49,00:14:50,"- Last fall, please."
00:14:50,00:14:52,- I thought this unicorn was last fall.
00:14:52,00:14:54,(upbeat music)
00:14:54,00:14:59,"- Okay, we've got to move on."
00:14:59,00:15:00,It's time for fact number three
00:15:00,00:15:01,and that is my fact.
00:15:01,00:15:02,My fact is that there are people
00:15:02,00:15:06,in the houses of parliament constantly looking for fire.
00:15:06,00:15:08,"- You phrase that like, they're smokers"
00:15:08,00:15:10,in the lights and have a light.
00:15:10,00:15:11,- There are 24 fire patrol officers
00:15:11,00:15:13,who go around the house of parliament.
00:15:13,00:15:14,"They do it in shifts, obviously."
00:15:14,00:15:15,And the Palace of Westminster
00:15:15,00:15:17,is basically only able to be used
00:15:17,00:15:18,because they're working.
00:15:18,00:15:20,"So if they weren't there,"
00:15:20,00:15:21,then the building would not comply
00:15:21,00:15:24,with the 2005 fire safety order.
00:15:24,00:15:26,So they are easily the 24 most important people
00:15:26,00:15:27,in the houses of parliament.
00:15:27,00:15:30,- So you say that the fire people have had to be installed
00:15:30,00:15:33,because of this 2005 piece of health and safety regulation.
00:15:33,00:15:34,- I do say that.
00:15:34,00:15:37,- You do say that and yet I think that.
00:15:37,00:15:39,"- No, here we go."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"- Effectively, crown properties are exempt"
00:15:42,00:15:43,from health and safety regulations.
00:15:43,00:15:45,So they still have to abide by them.
00:15:45,00:15:49,But you can't prosecute the crown properties
00:15:49,00:15:50,for not abiding by them.
00:15:50,00:15:52,The only thing you can do is censure them.
00:15:52,00:15:55,"So if they don't abide by these rules,"
00:15:55,00:15:56,you go to this incredibly long process
00:15:56,00:15:57,that you would go through usually
00:15:57,00:15:59,where someone else might go to prison at the end
00:15:59,00:16:00,or be arrested or fined.
00:16:00,00:16:03,"But with the crown, they just get a formal censure."
00:16:03,00:16:06,"- Basically, this is about how"
00:16:06,00:16:07,Shonky the houses of parliament are.
00:16:07,00:16:08,"- They're falling to bits, aren't they?"
00:16:08,00:16:09,"- They really are, yeah."
00:16:09,00:16:11,- There was a report in 2012
00:16:11,00:16:11,"that said if it wasn't closed,"
00:16:11,00:16:15,they'd recommend demolishing it and starting again.
00:16:15,00:16:15,- Really?
00:16:15,00:16:16,- Yeah.
00:16:16,00:16:17,- Wow.
00:16:17,00:16:19,- Do they often find fires in their hunt?
00:16:19,00:16:20,"- They do, yeah."
00:16:20,00:16:21,- Do they?
00:16:21,00:16:23,"- So there have been 60 incidents since 2008,"
00:16:23,00:16:25,which have had the potential to cause a serious fire.
00:16:25,00:16:27,"- Yeah, so that is completely insane."
00:16:27,00:16:29,How incompetent are the people in the houses of parliament
00:16:29,00:16:30,no need to answer that.
00:16:30,00:16:31,- That's right.
00:16:31,00:16:33,(all laughing)
00:16:33,00:16:34,"- Well, there's just a very old building"
00:16:34,00:16:36,and there are lots of bits which are kind of fire hazards
00:16:36,00:16:39,"and which, you know, it's a huge place as well."
00:16:39,00:16:41,- There's a lot of kind of it was built obviously before.
00:16:41,00:16:42,"It's a bit of electricity,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,so the wires are all kind of budged in
00:16:44,00:16:45,to where all the items are.
00:16:45,00:16:46,"- Yeah, really loose."
00:16:46,00:16:47,"- And there's loads of,"
00:16:47,00:16:48,"basically nothing gets uninstalled,"
00:16:48,00:16:51,"so anytime old wiring is replaced,"
00:16:51,00:16:52,they don't take out the old wiring.
00:16:52,00:16:54,So there's tons of flammable material sitting there
00:16:54,00:16:56,and there's loads of us bestos.
00:16:56,00:16:57,"I mean, that's not flammable,"
00:16:57,00:16:58,but there's tons of us bestos.
00:16:58,00:16:59,- It's sort of everywhere.
00:16:59,00:16:59,It's not just in the walls.
00:16:59,00:17:01,There's us bestos inside the lightswitches
00:17:01,00:17:02,and things like that.
00:17:02,00:17:03,- They just shut it in.
00:17:03,00:17:04,- Absolutely everywhere.
00:17:04,00:17:07,"- Of the 3,000 windows in the Palace of Westminster,"
00:17:07,00:17:09,nearly all of them don't close properly.
00:17:09,00:17:10,- Nice.
00:17:10,00:17:13,"- What's that for, I'm so badly built."
00:17:13,00:17:15,"- I guess, does that mean if there's a fire,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,"yeah, more air will get in,"
00:17:16,00:17:17,"I suppose, to make the fire worse."
00:17:17,00:17:19,- And I think the shutters don't open properly.
00:17:19,00:17:21,"The windows don't close and the shutters don't open,"
00:17:21,00:17:23,'cause I think they built radiators.
00:17:23,00:17:25,I was reading the report on why it needs redoing
00:17:25,00:17:26,and one of the things in it
00:17:26,00:17:28,said that they built radiators in the nooks
00:17:28,00:17:30,that are supposed to house the shutters at some point.
00:17:30,00:17:31,"So now when you try to open the shutters,"
00:17:31,00:17:32,there's a radiator in the way.
00:17:32,00:17:33,- Wow.
00:17:33,00:17:34,Sometimes MPs misvotes
00:17:34,00:17:37,because they get stuck in lifts.
00:17:37,00:17:37,- Really?
00:17:37,00:17:39,"- Well, it's happened at least once."
00:17:39,00:17:41,"- Yeah, I don't know when I say sometimes,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,"I mean, one time."
00:17:42,00:17:44,- The legislation only passed by seven votes
00:17:44,00:17:46,"and so if there was like a chance of,"
00:17:46,00:17:48,if more people couldn't get that.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"- I mean, if they'd all been in that lake."
00:17:50,00:17:53,- I used to work for an MSP in Scotland
00:17:53,00:17:55,and he once pressed the wrong button on his voting thing
00:17:55,00:17:56,and voted the wrong way
00:17:56,00:17:58,in a vote that came down to one vote.
00:17:58,00:17:59,(gasps)
00:17:59,00:18:01,"- Man, that's a sheepish email to IT support."
00:18:01,00:18:03,(laughs)
00:18:03,00:18:07,- And then what terrible law passed because of that?
00:18:07,00:18:11,"- So Scottish independence upcoming, that's all him."
00:18:11,00:18:12,(laughs)
00:18:12,00:18:13,"No, it was about green energy, I think."
00:18:13,00:18:16,- I once worked in house apartment for a while
00:18:16,00:18:18,"and on my first day, someone came in"
00:18:18,00:18:20,and the office I was working in and took off his shoe
00:18:20,00:18:21,and threw it at a mouse in the corner
00:18:21,00:18:22,'cause they have a really bad mass problem.
00:18:22,00:18:24,"- Really, yeah."
00:18:24,00:18:25,"- Wow, what a..."
00:18:25,00:18:26,"- It was like, oh, hi."
00:18:26,00:18:28,- I literally cartoon based way to deal with that.
00:18:28,00:18:29,(laughs)
00:18:29,00:18:32,"- According to MP Ben Bradshaw,"
00:18:32,00:18:35,"there is urine leaking in the house's apartment,"
00:18:35,00:18:37,specifically into his office.
00:18:37,00:18:40,"A couple of years ago, he tweeted that urine seems"
00:18:40,00:18:41,to be pouring through the ceiling
00:18:41,00:18:44,into my commons office for the second day running.
00:18:44,00:18:46,There was some piping with holes in it
00:18:46,00:18:51,in the room above him and the smell was only made bearable
00:18:51,00:18:53,by his staff wearing strong perfume.
00:18:53,00:18:56,(laughs)
00:18:56,00:19:00,- Apparently the roof of the Hall of Westminster
00:19:00,00:19:04,there aren't really sure why it's still up
00:19:04,00:19:06,because they thought that it was originally built
00:19:06,00:19:09,"with columns 'cause at the time during 13th and 14th century,"
00:19:09,00:19:10,we didn't think that they had the technology
00:19:10,00:19:14,to make a roof that was wider than the beams it was made of
00:19:14,00:19:15,"and it doesn't have columns anymore,"
00:19:15,00:19:17,but they recently had a look at it
00:19:17,00:19:18,and they think that there were never any columns
00:19:18,00:19:21,so they're unsure as to why it's up there
00:19:21,00:19:22,and how it's staying up.
00:19:22,00:19:23,- Is this gonna be like in a cartoon
00:19:23,00:19:26,when the building real light is gonna be standing up?
00:19:26,00:19:28,- It's freewheeling in the air for a bit
00:19:28,00:19:30,"and then, yeah, that's so weird."
00:19:30,00:19:31,- I know.
00:19:31,00:19:32,"- So just on fire safety,"
00:19:32,00:19:35,has anyone seen the fire safety slide
00:19:35,00:19:37,that's been installed in Shanghai?
00:19:37,00:19:39,So it's basically like a slide you see in a playground
00:19:39,00:19:40,and it goes around the stairwell
00:19:40,00:19:42,"and when it's not in use,"
00:19:42,00:19:46,then it's up vertically kind of attached to the banisters.
00:19:46,00:19:48,- Why is it not in use?
00:19:48,00:19:48,- Who?
00:19:48,00:19:49,"- Yeah, who would have used it?"
00:19:49,00:19:51,- What a spiral slide in a massive building.
00:19:51,00:19:54,"I think, oh, we won't bother using this."
00:19:54,00:19:56,"- James, this is not for the purposes of recreation,"
00:19:56,00:19:58,it's a health and safety issue.
00:19:58,00:20:00,The only time you would ever want to use the slide
00:20:00,00:20:01,"is in a case of a fire,"
00:20:01,00:20:03,in which case it takes 14 seconds to descend the five stories.
00:20:03,00:20:05,"- Oh, that is so cool."
00:20:05,00:20:06,Is there a penalty for improper use?
00:20:06,00:20:07,- I bet that happens to me.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"- Almost, yeah."
00:20:09,00:20:12,- That is really 14 seconds for five stories.
00:20:12,00:20:13,"- Well, I was trying to work out,"
00:20:13,00:20:14,I reckon I could run downstairs in that.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"- Absolutely, you're not married."
00:20:16,00:20:19,"You could, three seconds per story."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"- Oh, I don't know."
00:20:21,00:20:23,"- I take four stairs at a time, I can do it."
00:20:23,00:20:26,- I think you could fall that distance at that time.
00:20:26,00:20:28,(upbeat music)
00:20:31,00:20:32,"- Okay, it's time for a final fact for the show"
00:20:32,00:20:33,and that is Alex.
00:20:33,00:20:35,- My fact this week is that the cookie monster
00:20:35,00:20:37,isn't allowed to eat cookies.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"- Since his diabetes, diagnosis."
00:20:41,00:20:42,"- No, why not?"
00:20:42,00:20:46,"- Well, he cookies are actually bad for the fabric,"
00:20:46,00:20:47,"but he is made out of,"
00:20:47,00:20:48,"so he actually eats rice cakes,"
00:20:48,00:20:51,"disguised to look like cookies disguised, yeah."
00:20:51,00:20:53,"I think he knows, but yeah."
00:20:53,00:20:55,- But it will be quite a powerful message
00:20:55,00:20:56,about childhood healthy eating.
00:20:56,00:20:58,If he did eat cookies and slowly
00:20:58,00:21:01,he's always skin degrading and rotting away
00:21:01,00:21:03,"over the next six months of the show, no?"
00:21:03,00:21:05,"- What did teach children that if you eat too many cookies,"
00:21:05,00:21:07,your fur will fall off.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"- I've never actually seen it,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"but obviously I was supposed to be educational, aren't they?"
00:21:10,00:21:13,And they're good at dealing with the heart hitting issues.
00:21:13,00:21:16,"I think they're covering the Trump election, as we speak."
00:21:16,00:21:18,- They did have a character called Donald Grump.
00:21:18,00:21:20,"- So good, yeah."
00:21:20,00:21:21,"- Based on Donald Trump,"
00:21:21,00:21:24,"and it was when the apprentice first became popular,"
00:21:24,00:21:28,"and he was a Muppet with a bright orange quaffer,"
00:21:28,00:21:31,"who had the most trash of any grouch in the world,"
00:21:31,00:21:34,and he had his name on every piece of trash in town.
00:21:34,00:21:37,"- He was played by Oscar the Grouch,"
00:21:37,00:21:39,"and he's like, ""I have more trash than you, get it?"""
00:21:39,00:21:41,- I don't know who Oscar the Grouch is.
00:21:41,00:21:42,"- All right, he's the guy who lives in the bin,"
00:21:42,00:21:44,he's really grumpy.
00:21:44,00:21:45,"- Okay, you think you've never watched it?"
00:21:45,00:21:47,- I bet everyone else knows Oscar the Grouch is.
00:21:47,00:21:49,"- Yeah, it's true, actually Oscar the Grouch is quite,"
00:21:49,00:21:50,"even if you'd never seen it,"
00:21:50,00:21:52,"I'm surprised you'd never come across him,"
00:21:52,00:21:53,but he'd come across Big Bird.
00:21:53,00:21:54,"- Yeah, so I've heard of Big Bird,"
00:21:54,00:21:55,"and I've heard of Elmo,"
00:21:55,00:21:56,"and I've heard of Burton Ernie,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"but that's only because they're referenced in Friends,"
00:21:58,00:21:58,which I have seen.
00:21:58,00:22:00,- And you must have the cooking monster as well?
00:22:00,00:22:02,- I think I thought that was the same as Big Bird.
00:22:02,00:22:04,"- He's appeared on every, like he's appeared on news night,"
00:22:04,00:22:05,"he's appeared on BBC Breakfast,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,he's done more political shows than most people
00:22:07,00:22:08,in this country.
00:22:08,00:22:09,- It's me Corbin.
00:22:09,00:22:10,(laughter)
00:22:10,00:22:13,- Took a long time for us to get in the German Corbin giant.
00:22:13,00:22:14,"Poppets don't have a sexual orientation,"
00:22:14,00:22:17,"and Sesame Street had to make that clear,"
00:22:17,00:22:18,because apparently there are lots of rumors
00:22:18,00:22:19,that Burton Ernie or a gay couple.
00:22:19,00:22:21,- 'Cause they share a bed.
00:22:21,00:22:23,"- Oh, right, okay, so I can see where those rumors came from."
00:22:23,00:22:25,"- Okay, so there were rumors about that,"
00:22:25,00:22:26,"and they said they're just friends,"
00:22:26,00:22:29,and poppets don't have a sexual orientation.
00:22:29,00:22:31,- They don't exist below the waist.
00:22:31,00:22:32,They only have a top half.
00:22:32,00:22:33,- Big Bird exists below the waist.
00:22:33,00:22:34,"- Yeah, I've seen--"
00:22:34,00:22:35,- He's not poppets.
00:22:35,00:22:38,"- And I guess, unless he belongs to the 3% of birds"
00:22:38,00:22:42,"that do have a penis, Big Bird will have a cloaca,"
00:22:42,00:22:43,which he will press against the cloaca
00:22:43,00:22:45,or of other big birds.
00:22:45,00:22:46,"- They are educational,"
00:22:46,00:22:47,presumably they've discussed the cloaca
00:22:47,00:22:49,of Big Bird at some point in the show.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"So Big Bird is flightless,"
00:22:50,00:22:51,and isn't it true?
00:22:51,00:22:55,I read someone said this week that flightless birds
00:22:55,00:22:57,"have a bladder, is that right?"
00:22:57,00:23:01,"- Flightless, the only bird with a bladder is the ostrich."
00:23:01,00:23:04,"- And that's because bladder's a heavy,"
00:23:04,00:23:06,like birds can't normally have them
00:23:06,00:23:07,because it would weigh them down.
00:23:07,00:23:08,- Yes.
00:23:08,00:23:10,- But Big Bird could possibly have a bladder.
00:23:10,00:23:12,"- He could have a bladder, is anyone ever seen him we?"
00:23:12,00:23:13,(laughing)
00:23:13,00:23:15,"- No, he's not a grumpass."
00:23:15,00:23:17,(laughing)
00:23:20,00:23:22,- Is it Elmo the only non-human
00:23:22,00:23:24,to testify in the course of law?
00:23:24,00:23:26,- Where did the defendant tickle you?
00:23:26,00:23:27,(laughing)
00:23:27,00:23:29,"- No, it was during a campaign"
00:23:29,00:23:30,for increased funding for music programs
00:23:30,00:23:34,and he testified that there should be indeed that.
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Does he sing, is he involved?"
00:23:35,00:23:36,Does he see musicals?
00:23:36,00:23:38,"- He's, yeah, he's sing, yeah, they all sing."
00:23:38,00:23:39,- I hope he'll sing.
00:23:39,00:23:42,- So there's a list of puppets
00:23:42,00:23:45,that have been in Sesame Street and Muppets as well.
00:23:45,00:23:48,But there's a list and there was one called Anna.
00:23:48,00:23:49,- Hey.
00:23:49,00:23:51,- This was in the Spanish version of Sesame Street
00:23:51,00:23:54,and it says that Anna had a know it all attitude.
00:23:54,00:23:56,- Wow.
00:23:56,00:23:58,"- Based on me, I'm not gonna lie."
00:23:58,00:24:01,"But it's a justified attitude, isn't it?"
00:24:01,00:24:03,"- Alex Bell, there was one called Bell"
00:24:03,00:24:07,who was in the Brazilian co-production of Sesame Street
00:24:07,00:24:11,and Bell was an imaginative hot pink monster girl.
00:24:11,00:24:12,"- Sounds better, right?"
00:24:12,00:24:14,That's my online profile.
00:24:14,00:24:15,(laughing)
00:24:15,00:24:17,- And there was one called Murray Monster.
00:24:17,00:24:18,- What was that?
00:24:18,00:24:21,- And he was the host of the word on the street segment
00:24:21,00:24:24,and he was a boisterous red orange muppet.
00:24:24,00:24:25,(laughing)
00:24:25,00:24:26,"- In the Nigerian version of Sesame Street,"
00:24:26,00:24:28,the star muppet is called Kami
00:24:28,00:24:31,and Kami is HIV positive to remove the stigma
00:24:31,00:24:35,"of talking about dealing with the hardest issues, yeah."
00:24:35,00:24:37,- That's so good.
00:24:37,00:24:38,- I know.
00:24:38,00:24:39,- Another responsible thing they do
00:24:39,00:24:42,is they make a whole set program called Talk Listen Connect
00:24:42,00:24:44,and it's for children with parents in the military
00:24:44,00:24:46,and they broadcast that to them
00:24:46,00:24:49,to teach them about how much they're gonna miss their parents
00:24:49,00:24:50,"and how it's okay and how, for instance,"
00:24:50,00:24:53,"like amputees coming back from war zones,"
00:24:53,00:24:55,their children might be a bit traumatized by seeing that.
00:24:55,00:24:57,And so there was a lovely story of a father
00:24:57,00:24:59,"who came back from Afghanistan, I think,"
00:24:59,00:25:00,and he'd had three of his limbs amputated
00:25:00,00:25:02,and he was really worried and they showed him
00:25:02,00:25:05,the Sesame Street video that had been made
00:25:05,00:25:07,to educate his children about his condition
00:25:07,00:25:08,and he burst into tears apparently.
00:25:08,00:25:11,He was so happy that he had a good way
00:25:11,00:25:12,of communicating it to his child.
00:25:12,00:25:13,- Oh my goodness.
00:25:13,00:25:14,- Some of the muppets are actually made
00:25:14,00:25:16,of army surplus material.
00:25:16,00:25:18,I watched that until I came in three ages ago
00:25:18,00:25:19,and I just remembered it.
00:25:19,00:25:21,- The Cookie Monster has a British cousin
00:25:21,00:25:25,- Really? - Called the Biscuit Bastard.
00:25:25,00:25:27,(all laughing)
00:25:27,00:25:29,- You are half right.
00:25:29,00:25:30,- Oh really?
00:25:30,00:25:31,- It's the Biscuit Monster.
00:25:31,00:25:33,- Oh okay.
00:25:33,00:25:34,- Biscuit Bastard would be good.
00:25:34,00:25:35,That could educate children about how it's okay
00:25:35,00:25:37,if your parents aren't mad.
00:25:37,00:25:39,(all laughing)
00:25:39,00:25:44,- That's hilarious.
00:25:44,00:25:46,- Does he actually feature on the American show then?
00:25:46,00:25:48,- He was only in one episode where he came
00:25:48,00:25:50,to visit the Cookie Monster.
00:25:50,00:25:51,- Okay. - Yeah.
00:25:51,00:25:52,He was on holiday.
00:25:52,00:25:55,- Tried to get himself a job as Donald Grumps
00:25:55,00:25:56,representative in the year.
00:25:56,00:25:59,(all laughing)
00:25:59,00:26:02,"- We could talk about Biscuits,"
00:26:02,00:26:05,but do you think I can I just say one thing
00:26:05,00:26:05,about Biscuits then?
00:26:05,00:26:06,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:26:06,00:26:10,- Dunking Biscuits was originally done in wine.
00:26:10,00:26:13,The first evidence we have of Biscuit Dunking
00:26:13,00:26:16,was Wafers that the Romans softened in wine.
00:26:16,00:26:17,- Oh. - Wow.
00:26:17,00:26:21,- And before dunking in tea even there was dunking in beer
00:26:21,00:26:23,because in the Royal Navy you would have had hard
00:26:23,00:26:25,"Biscuits that were really, really hard"
00:26:25,00:26:26,and you couldn't eat them very well.
00:26:26,00:26:28,So people would dunk them in their beer to soften them up.
00:26:28,00:26:30,"- Oh, that's very interesting."
00:26:30,00:26:31,- Wafers in wine.
00:26:31,00:26:32,- Wafers in wine.
00:26:32,00:26:34,"Oh, you'll have to dunk your wafer in your wine at church."
00:26:34,00:26:35,Drink me.
00:26:35,00:26:36,"- You're not, no."
00:26:36,00:26:40,The idea of putting wafers directly into people's mouths.
00:26:40,00:26:40,- Yeah.
00:26:40,00:26:42,- That came because they were worried
00:26:42,00:26:44,"that people would take them in their hands,"
00:26:44,00:26:47,hide them away and use them for magic pulsions.
00:26:47,00:26:48,- I thought you were going to say use them
00:26:48,00:26:50,"slowly over time, build their own Christ at home."
00:26:50,00:26:52,(laughing)
00:26:52,00:26:57,- I was reading about Simon Pope who's a Biscuit designer
00:26:57,00:26:58,and tester.
00:26:58,00:27:01,- And that's the best job in the world.
00:27:01,00:27:02,(laughing)
00:27:02,00:27:05,"- Honestly, his job, so his job includes eating,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,tasting biscuits from 472 packets of biscuits every year.
00:27:08,00:27:10,So he says he tastes 30 biscuits a day.
00:27:10,00:27:11,- Wow.
00:27:11,00:27:13,- He says he often doesn't swallow them
00:27:13,00:27:15,because I guess for health reasons.
00:27:15,00:27:17,So he says he'll nibble on them
00:27:17,00:27:19,"to check for things like taste, texture and firmness."
00:27:19,00:27:21,- He says he sometimes does have biscuits at work
00:27:21,00:27:23,because it's important to test them in situ.
00:27:23,00:27:26,- I need to test this batch in Las Vegas.
00:27:26,00:27:27,- I'm afraid.
00:27:27,00:27:29,(laughing)
00:27:29,00:27:33,- Travel expenses are enormous.
00:27:33,00:27:35,(laughing)
00:27:35,00:27:36,- He's in the plane.
00:27:36,00:27:37,He's got a seat next to him
00:27:37,00:27:39,which just has a pack of biscuits on it.
00:27:39,00:27:40,(laughing)
00:27:40,00:27:41,"- He's always going around the world,"
00:27:41,00:27:41,help not big news.
00:27:41,00:27:44,(laughing)
00:27:44,00:27:48,- I think we might be done today.
00:27:48,00:27:49,- I think so too.
00:27:49,00:27:50,"- Today's your return, guys."
