00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
 (phone ringing)

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.780
 (indistinct chatter)

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.360
 (upbeat music)

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.760
 - Hi. - Hello.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.580
 - Hi, Andy.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.060
 - Andy here, joined by my three chums.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.900
 - James. - Hey, what's up?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.600
 - Anna. - Come on, Anna.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.200
 Please stand up, come on.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 James, Anna, and Dan are here as well.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.240
 And this is Drop as a Line.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.800
 - I've got a mouth full of strutwaffle,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.360
 otherwise I would have said high as well.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.520
 - Yeah. - Oh, yum.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.360
 - The standards of professionals--

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.200
 - You should like banana.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.040
 - Do you have any?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.880
 - What is this, strutwaffle?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.720
 - We're gonna start us again.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 Guys, this is-- - Start us again.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.760
 - It's too unprofessional. - Yeah.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.200
 - Hi. - Hello.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.040
 - Oh my God.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.880
 - Right. - Anna, would you like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.720
 a strutwaffle?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.960
 (laughing)

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.680
 - I get no respect.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.400
 Welcome to Drop as a Line, everybody.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.440
 This is the bit of the show where we are--

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.200
 No, James, open your bottle of carbonated water.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.120
 - It's Evian.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360
 (laughing)

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.200
 - Anyone got anything else?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.800
 They'd like to get off their chest or out of their bags.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
 - No, no, no. - Right, okay.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 Welcome to Drop as a Line.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.720
 This is where we are going through your words.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:59.760
 I'm reading them out to these guys.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.240
 These guys will say something funny

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.720
 and we'll end after about a little while.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.720
 That fair summation?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.560
 - Yeah, that's excellent.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.600
 Why don't we get on with it?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.440
 - Yeah, okay.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.400
 - Maybe we should start again.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.880
 - No, look, we've had some cracking correspondence.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.720
 - Great.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.880
 - Here is Ian Dunne with an um, actually--

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.680
 - Hello. - An old friend.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.520
 - Great friend of the show.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.360
 - Hi, Ian.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 - Just a quick note regarding Rutland,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.240
 which came up in episode 511.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 In it, you, Andy, said that Rutland

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.280
 was the smallest county in England.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.480
 - Oh, he's from T-side, Ian.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.320
 Is that-- - Who is he?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.920
 - Yeah, is that, you're going to say that's small?

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.760
 No, it's not small.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.720
 - No, he just says, as was mentioned

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.200
 in the QI episode, England, Rutrow,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.480
 a general ignorance question said that the smallest county

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.320
 was actually the Isle of Wight at High Tide.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.160
 - That's right.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.440
 - When the tide is out, indeed, Rutland is smaller.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.280
 - That's great.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120
 - I know. - That's a good fact.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.200
 - And I've also heard from Hattie Hodgson-Krome,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.040
 brilliant name on Twitter.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.120
 The population of Rutland are crying out

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.000
 in the latest episode of--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.720
 - Just imagine flying over Rutland

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.640
 in a small aircraft and just hearing the people.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.000
 - Absolutely wailing and gnashing of teeth

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.840
 coming from Rutland.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.520
 In the latest episode of No Such Thing, Andy,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.000
 you said it had become, I think,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.040
 a unitary authority instead of a county.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.080
 - Right. - Actually,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.760
 it became an independent county again in 1997.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.240
 As a primary school there, at the time,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.960
 I received a mug to mark the occasion.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.400
 I'm sorry, Hattie, and I'm sorry, Ian.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.240
 - I would say, of all the things,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.600
 having worked at QI for 20 years, more, in fact,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.920
 the thing that gets people hot under the collar

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.640
 more than almost anything else is the 1971

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.000
 Unitary Authorities Act,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 which made all of the counties of England the new counties.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.120
 - Well, it's your chat-up line, isn't it?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.320
 You ask people in bars what they think about it.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.280
 - I just stand on the corner of Cumbria and Northumberland.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.880
 - Do you remember a thing where we spoke about people

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.440
 not being called BJ in the UK?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.280
 - Yeah, that was me.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 - Yeah, I just said, I feel like Americans are called BJ.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.080
 A few people have messaged me saying, "I know an Aussie BJ."

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.920
 Yeah.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.800
 - Well, Chris Blundle-Drois writes.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.040
 (laughing)

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.000
 - Since we amalgamated, hyphenated our names

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.600
 when we got married, we are now the Blundle-Droisers,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.960
 AKA the BJs.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.560
 We live in York.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.040
 And now our family and friends knows as the BJs,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.320
 God help our two-year-old daughter

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.920
 when she goes to school in the future.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.760
 (laughing)

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.080
 There we go, thank you, Chris.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.480
 - I think it's one of the few instances where being BJ

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.800
 is going to be less embarrassing for her

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.320
 than being called Blundle-Drois.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.560
 - It's a lovely name.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.600
 - It is a lovely name.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.520
 The word Blundle, I wish meant something

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.360
 because I'd love to be saying it on a regular basis.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.200
 - Blundle-Bus, if they have a car,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.640
 they should call it the Blundle-Bus.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.480
 - Yes.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.720
 - It sounds a bit like Blunder-Bus.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.560
 - And what's that?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.400
 - It's a large gum.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.760
 - Yeah, just a cool word.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.600
 - Cool.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720
 - Andrew Morth writes.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.280
 - You know the bit where you say something

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.600
 and then we're funny after it?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.440
 - Oh yeah.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.280
 - When do we get to that bit?

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.720
 (laughing)

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.000
 - We'll keep going until we've got something.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.040
 - Okay.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.160
 - Andrew Morth writes.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.300
 (humming)

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.560
 (laughing)

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.860
 - How dare you, Andrew?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.600
 (laughing)

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.200
 - Oh, lovely.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.040
 Another Andy M, as he points out.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.480
 I recently joined Clubfish to see

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.280
 if you guys ever mentioned my amazing fact

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.760
 about the Hoover Dam back in November, 2022.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.600
 Brackets?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.420
 No.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.960
 (laughing)

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.120
 - Do we have the fact?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.280
 - I did look at it, it's fine.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 - Can I tell you the fact, okay?

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.240
 See if it's the same one.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.480
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.480
 - They used to, if you had a mental illness,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.800
 they used to prescribe you to go to the Hoover Dam

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.920
 and listen to the water going down the Hoover Dam

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.520
 and that was supposed to make you feel better.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.360
 - Love it.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.200
 - That is a good fact.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.040
 - Was that his fact?

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.480
 - No, his fact, it was a really good one actually.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.080
 It was about the construction of the dam

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.120
 and it was really tragic.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.240
 It was about the first person and the last person to die

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.360
 and I think the first person was someone like the architect

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.480
 or the last person was his son.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.320
 - Right.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.320
 - And it was a great fact, but it was quite sad.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.280
 So I thought it might be a bit gloomy for us.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.320
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.720
 - Anyway, I joined, to see if you mentioned my fact,

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.800
 with every intention of unsubscribing before I had to pay

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.840
 because I'm cheap and have very little money at the moment.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.980
 - That's fair, that's fair.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.960
 - However, around a year ago on the Bonus Podcast,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.840
 Andy admitted to peeing in the shower,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.120
 which was a shocking revelation

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.600
 from such a private and conservative man.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.480
 I have hence committed to peeing for at least one month

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.080
 for the privilege of hearing you all open up.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.800
 - It's the first and last time Andy ever opened up.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.960
 - I know, and I closed right back down.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.680
 It was such an unpleasant time for me

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.720
 that I've just, I've never said anything.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.120
 No one ever gets anything out of me now.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.280
 - There's months of therapy, wasn't it,

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.400
 after you've missed that?

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.640
 Which I know you don't want us to say, of course, but.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.720
 - Yeah, Jesus.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.560
 Here's a fact about Dan's teeth.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.920
 - Oh, yeah, so he doesn't have canines.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.880
 - Right, and this is from Jessamy Gloor.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.200
 - Please.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.280
 - This is a brilliant name.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.640
 - Stunning name, stunning.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.000
 - I know, as an American who lived in Britain,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.480
 I noticed that many white British people

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.000
 have really long canines,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.440
 compared to what seems normal in the USA.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.880
 So much so that it gets distracting,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.560
 wondering if the British person you're talking to

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.780
 is actually a vampire.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.720
 (laughing)

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.720
 - This is just the thing we said.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.040
 - Well, we were talking about canine teeth, and.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.200
 - We just noticed that you don't have any.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.120
 - Yeah, everyone said, "Look at your mouth,"

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.400
 and Anna, I think it was you who said, "Dan, where are yours?"

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.160
 People have since gone through my Instagram,

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.160
 finding photos of me with a smile, going, "Yeah, you don't."

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.480
 Like, just pointing out specific photos to me.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.560
 - So she says, "Despite having listened to fish for years,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.920
 "I still get the names mixed up,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.280
 "but when Anna pointed out that Dan had no canines,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.360
 "I easily guessed he was the least British of the four."

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.400
 - Right, I think that's a coincidence.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.640
 I like the theory, but we need more data.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.480
 - I like it.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.320
 - She says, "No clue if it's genetic or environmental,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.840
 "but I've never seen an American try to open a bag of crisps

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.840
 "with their teeth."

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.760
 (laughing)

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.680
 - I actually think that that is a thing that Americans

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.520
 and non-English people find very unusual about the British,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.080
 that if you go to a pub, people will go to the bar

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.280
 buy a pack of crisps, bite it open,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.240
 and then just open it and leave it on a table.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.080
 - Yeah.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.400
 - How are they opening their crisps to share?

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.320
 - I don't think they share.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.240
 - Well, they don't share.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.760
 - There was someone on Twitter who was--

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.600
 - People share.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.440
 - No other country shares.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.280
 (laughing)

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.160
 - It honestly was a revelation

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.600
 when I came here and I saw that happen.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.360
 And then as my Aussie mates came over

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.800
 and other international friends,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.680
 I would do it knowing each time

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.040
 that I was introducing them to something incredible.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.880
 - Oh, wow.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:22.960
 - It's funny, it's sort of inoculated

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.200
 Britain against true socialism.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.760
 Like, that's what we do to share.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.600
 (laughing)

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.440
 - That's all we need.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.600
 - And we've never had a proper redistributive--

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.280
 - Anyway, thank you.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.200
 - 'Cause we redistribute crisps round and table

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.040
 in a pub.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.880
 - Yeah.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.000
 - I actually don't like doing it.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.840
 - Don't you?

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.680
 - Because--

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.520
 - You don't like sharing.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.880
 - Yeah, 'cause I hate sharing for yourself-ish

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.840
 and very greedy.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.960
 But also, I feel like you know this about me

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.400
 on my favorite thing about crisps.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.840
 My favorite thing to do with crisps.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.360
 - You lick the bag?

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.680
 - No.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.600
 You've gotta pop the crisp bag.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.000
 So as soon as you ruin the crisp bag.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.160
 So I just overturn all the crisps onto the table

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.040
 and then I bang the bag.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.880
 - Yeah.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.720
 - Bang the bag.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.560
 (laughing)

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.880
 This is that opening up stuff

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.320
 that this guy wanted us to do.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.160
 - Yeah, happy now.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.640
 - That's good stuff.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.320
 - Simon Graham writes,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.680
 this is about when Dan's fact was about the wall

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.080
 crashing into air to the center.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.920
 - Oh yeah.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.960
 - Which is such a good fact.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.040
 - Yeah, brilliant.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.240
 - So in the following discussion,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.440
 you all lamented the demise of the lollipop man

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.280
 in the pit crew, right?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.840
 In 2009, this, I love this email.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.520
 Formula One introduced hybrid engines

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.720
 with kinetic energy recovery systems

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.760
 which harvested energy when you're braking.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.720
 - Yeah, it's the same stuff

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.280
 as you get in electric cars today.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.480
 - Right, and they store it in batteries

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.400
 and then when you're overtaking,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.120
 you sort of, you use that.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.400
 The technology was a bit unknown

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.360
 and somewhat unreliable at the time.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.520
 During this early period of the KERS,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.400
 there was always a pit crew member standing by

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.360
 with what looks like a shepherd's crook

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.400
 in case one of the crew was electrocuted.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.560
 - Oh, what, they'd pull him off stage

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.440
 like someone who's terrible comedian?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.120
 - That's it, no.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.080
 - There was always a crew member

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.120
 holding one during the pit stops

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.720
 in case of electrocution.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.560
 - Wow.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.000
 - He attached a photo showing a pit member

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.160
 wearing extra heavy rubber gloves.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.680
 And yeah, since the technology has moved on,

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.000
 it has become more reliable and safe

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.800
 and the shepherd has gone the way of the lollipop man.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.840
 - Wow, I wonder if it did ever happen

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.360
 'cause we'd have it on camera presumably

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.800
 if it was a F1 kind of thing.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.520
 - I don't know, maybe it would have.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.360
 - Isn't that lovely?

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.080
 - It is quite nice, I imagine you being sacked

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.760
 as a lollipop man and going home

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.680
 and then you get the phone call going darling,

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.160
 don't worry, I've got a new gig.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.160
 - I've got an upsetting email to read.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.920
 It's from Alex Stroh, subject Dan was right.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.060
 - I'm upset already.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.600
 - We'll cut this, so what's the point?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.480
 - And he's quoting from I think a piece,

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.800
 maybe a Wikipedia, but it's,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.560
 "As water monsters, Kappa have been blamed for drownings

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.560
 and are often said to try and lure people into water."

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.400
 - I just thought I really thought you meant

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.720
 the tracksuit trouser brand.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.320
 (laughing)

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.920
 And they would, they'd weigh you down

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.120
 if you jump in the sea.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.320
 Sorry, Kappa, what?

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.280
 - They lure people into water

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.200
 and pull them in with their great skill at wrestling.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.160
 - This is like a fictional beast with Kappa, right?

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.640
 - Yeah, mythical beast in Japan, I believe.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.160
 - They're sometimes said to take their victims

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.520
 for the purpose of drinking their blood,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.280
 eating their livers, or gaining power

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.560
 by taking their shirokodama,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.520
 a mythical ball said to contain the soul

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.280
 which is located inside the anus.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.800
 - So sorry, Dan was right about something.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.840
 - We were, we were--

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.680
 (laughing)

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.240
 - This was from before my time.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.560
 - No, no, no, we were on stage together.

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.200
 This was-- - Soho Theatre.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.400
 - Yeah, Soho Theatre,

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400
 and we were talking about the bong ball.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.360
 - Bong ball that Aussies have.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.200
 - Was I in this one?

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.040
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.680
 - I was asking what the word bong ball meant,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.480
 and it was actually a party thrown by a publican

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.960
 because bong is part of a barrel.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.440
 And Dan thought that the bong ball

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.400
 was a thing found in an anus.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.920
 - I was asking if it was the anus soul ball,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.920
 which these Japanese mythological creatures would--

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:46.760
 - Yeah, you were right.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.320
 - Yeah, I'm still not getting the respect

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.720
 from having an anus. - No, weird, isn't it?

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.920
 - Well done.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.000
 - Never questioned down on cryptozoology.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.840
 I can't believe we even did.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.560
 - It's mythological, it's mythological stuff.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.480
 - Was it, 'cause it's in Japan,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.200
 was it believed by the anus,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.640
 which is a large group of Japanese people?

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.680
 - And they're the Ainu.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.360
 - Yeah, but we have to be getting trouble every time

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.920
 we mention them, 'cause James and his sixth uncle

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.200
 in the eighties tried.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.880
 - Dan, can you read out that word?

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.720
 That one word?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.320
 - Manitowak?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.640
 - Okay, this is an email from Alex.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.640
 "Andy, just wanted to say that Dan pronounced it

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.680
 completely correctly.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.480
 It was like he was from Wisconsin.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.760
 I'm as shocked as you are."

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.000
 (all laughing)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.520
 - P.S., if you use this on Drop as a Line,

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.440
 please make Dan read my last name.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.840
 'Cause that's from Alex Tiebsky."

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.880
 There we go.

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.560
 - That sounded like it plausibly could be corrected.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.400
 - Yeah.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.440
 - Quite good actually as well.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.760
 - Just so people can play along at home.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.840
 - T-I-E-V-S-K-Y.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.680
 - Okay.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.600
 - I'd have maybe gone with Tiebsky,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.920
 but Tiebsky sounds very, very likely.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.760
 - Okay, Alex's right in.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.600
 Who was correct?

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.920
 Andy or Dan?

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.400
 - And did I pronounce the place right again?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.240
 - Oh, good.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.720
 Maybe Dan, 'cause I don't know what I said.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720
 - It was a sheer chance.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.560
 You've gotta, you know, throw one dart right once.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.400
 - Yeah.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.240
 - Do it randomly.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.880
 - Can I give you a piece of correspondence

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.880
 that someone sent in?

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:08.720
 - Yeah.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.360
 - This was sent on my Instagram,

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.800
 no such thing as James Harkin,

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.880
 by someone called Katie Collinson.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.880
 And it was about an episode that I wasn't in.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.080
 And she said, "Tell Dan that liquid soap

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.640
 "is normally full of preservatives

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.280
 "because it is made with water."

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.520
 And apparently you were talking about the difference between,

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.880
 apparently I did listen to the show.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.760
 He's very good with Reese James.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.360
 Are you talking about the difference between block soap

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.400
 and liquid soap?

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.240
 - Yeah.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.400
 - And what I found really interesting is,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.480
 I think in the show, you guys mentioned that liquid soap

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.240
 is worse for the environment because it contains water

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.240
 and you need to ship that around the world.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.080
 - I think I said that.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.920
 - I think that's true.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.720
 But what's really interesting, I think,

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.880
 is what Katie said, which she worked for Lush, by the way.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.640
 She says that the water causes it to go off.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.400
 Because you've got water in there,

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.160
 it can collect bacteria and stuff like that,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.160
 whereas solid soap can't do that.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.520
 So, solid soap is cleaner than liquid soap.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.160
 - Nice.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.680
 - You don't think of off water, do you?

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.200
 You rarely take a sip of water and go, "Oh, that's been--"

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.640
 - But if bacteria need to live, they need water, don't they?

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.480
 - Well, there we go.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.320
 Glad that we've got more anti-liquid soap propaganda.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.720
 - That's brilliant.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.560
 Here's one.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.600
 This is a bit of a controversial one.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.240
 This is a spicy meat.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.760
 It's from Ben Lidgate.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.520
 I just listened to your most recent Christmas episode,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.160
 in which Dan mentions the fact

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.960
 that Chuck Norris edits out all the fight scenes

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.040
 from his movies in order to show them to his kids.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.120
 And the rest of you all sounded interested and entertained

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.160
 as if this was new information for you.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.760
 However, I am also currently relistening

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.840
 to all your old episodes.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.400
 And I've just listened to episode 29

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.600
 from the 3rd of October, 2014,

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.600
 in which Dan mentions this fact.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.680
 And episode 30 from the 11th of October, 2014,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.960
 in which Dan mentions it again.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.080
 And each time, you all sounded at least slightly surprised.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.000
 - Well, two things here.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.080
 I think Dan did say this is a fact

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.800
 I've been trying to prove for a long time.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.160
 So he did reference that.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.160
 And secondly, that's just being polite, isn't it?

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.920
 It'd be terrible if every time one of you said a fact,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.320
 I didn't find it interesting.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.320
 I commented, I don't find that interesting.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.480
 - Ben says, I'm beginning to suspect

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.880
 that the hilarious banter that sounds spontaneous each week

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.560
 is in fact entirely infected.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.440
 How much of what we hear is real.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:31.800
 Are all your interactions entirely scripted?

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.720
 Or is it simply the case that none of you pay attention

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.320
 to Dan and he can come up with the same fact every week

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.160
 and none of you would know this?

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.960
 - Bingo, there we go.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.080
 - By the way, I did have a listener write in to me

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.480
 having tracked down the interview that I was talking about.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.040
 And it is the case that he re-edits the movies.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.400
 - Sorry, Chuck Norris re-edits movies.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.240
 Why would he do that?

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.960
 - So basically he doesn't want his kids to talk about it.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.160
 - I can only fake it three times.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.760
 - However, in that specific interview,

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.120
 he says he takes it from an R-rated movie

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.080
 to a movie that they can watch.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.840
 He doesn't specifically say, takes out all the fight scenes.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.800
 - Which is something I feel I definitely read somewhere else.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.640
 - So he might take out some beswearing as well.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.040
 - Yeah, or the love scenes or whatever that is.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.560
 - Here's hoping that you track down the truth

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.600
 and we'll end up hearing that fact a fifth time.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.440
 - We're getting closer.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:16.280
 - Oh yeah. - See?

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280
 - Absolutely. - Over a 10 year period,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.360
 you keep mentioning it.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.400
 - Someone will help.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.840
 - Gene Montarastelli writes, with a sport fact actually,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.160
 says that he really enjoyed everything to play for, by the way.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.360
 - Thank you. - The QI book of sports.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.400
 - Oh, thank you, Gene.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.120
 Or John, I'm gonna say.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.440
 - Gene.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.280
 - Okay, or Gene.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.760
 Oh, is it G-E-N-E? - Yeah.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.720
 - Sorry, I thought it was J-E-A-N.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.240
 - No, no, no, I'm sure you know how to pronounce the word

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.720
 that I've got written in front of me better than I do.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.120
 - Hannah, you're distracting from the fact

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.360
 that we've got a plug chance here.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.520
 - Oh, one reader and I don't get it.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.360
 - No, we're moving on.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.160
 Actually, he hated it.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.640
 (laughing)

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640
 - No, what was it he enjoyed?

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.040
 - We talked about-- - Look everything to play for.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:55.720
 - He talked about, you know, we talked about the name change

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.640
 for the British basketball league.

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.160
 - Became the BBL.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.000
 - Yeah.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.360
 - It was originally the BBL, I should say,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.200
 which is also Brazilian but left.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.760
 - And their logo looks a bit like a bum.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:05.600
 - Yeah.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.440
 - And he says, "When you were talking about this,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.120
 "there was a discussion of how a large rump

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.040
 "might be helpful in basketball.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.320
 "Basketball Hall, basketball Hall of Famer, Charles Barkley."

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.160
 (laughing)

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.000
 - Sorry.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.240
 (laughing)

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.800
 - He doesn't speak to a lad who doesn't know much

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.640
 about sports.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.880
 (laughing)

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.400
 - I thought you were capable of reading the words

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.240
 right in front of you.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.040
 (laughing)

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:25.880
 - Yeah, okay.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.720
 - That's a fair cop.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:27.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
 All right, whatever.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.840
 Basketball Hall of Famer, Charles Barkley.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.200
 - Yes. - Easy, easy.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.080
 Was known for his ample butt.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.120
 And--

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.480
 - Yeah, he used to use it to bounce off people a little bit,

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.320
 didn't he?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.440
 He would like stuff, you know,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.640
 if people are running towards him,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.400
 he'd move his bum in the way and they'd kind of--

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.240
 - Exactly that.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.400
 He was very effective at using his generous posterior

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.720
 to move taller players out of the way.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.560
 (laughing)

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.400
 Incredible.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.240
 - What was the name?

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.400
 - Can you smell my ass?

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.400
 (laughing)

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.520
 Can you smell my ass?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.360
 That's it.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.160
 - Oh, brilliant.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.600
 Ross McGuire writes,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.160
 this is a, what is it called,

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.480
 when we get something wrong?

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.880
 - I'm unusual. - I'm actually,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.040
 I'm actually is what it is.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.840
 This week's episode said that Bethany England

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.320
 was the first person to play for a country

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.640
 that shares her name.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.000
 I think it was one of you, Dan or Anna, you said that.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.960
 - The first person to play for the,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.000
 oh yeah, the country that shares her name.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.920
 Sorry, yes, that's right.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.760
 I did claim that.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.600
 - Well, it's not right, Anna.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.160
 Because of a man called Steven Ireland.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.080
 - Oh, yes. - Played for Ireland.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.640
 Six caps and four goals.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.240
 - We don't really, when we talk about football,

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.080
 we are usually thinking about women's football.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.440
 So sometimes we don't always

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.440
 immediately bring the men's game to mind.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.280
 - Absolutely.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.120
 - I think that's what happened there.

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.320
 - Yeah, it's very sexist of us and I do apologise.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.480
 Yeah.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.400
 That's a great question, well done.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.240
 - No, it's a brilliant.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.640
 - You know what, when we were sat on stage,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.040
 I was going through all the countries

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.280
 trying to think of any other ones.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.960
 And I never got to put anything down.

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.560
 - We were talking about Alan Brazil, weren't we?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.000
 - Actually, mostly the Alan Brazil stuff got cut out

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.680
 because we didn't know that he'd recently died.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.440
 - Oh, I'm so dead though.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.640
 - I mean, it was sad, but we spoke about him

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.840
 as if he was still alive.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.160
 - Yeah, right.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.320
 - Yeah.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.320
 - I've got something, I've got a bad one here.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.120
 This is a good one, but it's bad for me.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:16.040
 Matt Shaw writes.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.240
 - Your novels are shit.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.320
 (all laughing)

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.760
 - James, I've asked you to stay out of the inbox,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.200
 it's important that you hear these for the first time, fresh.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.120
 - It's rather that than on the Amazon review.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.400
 (all laughing)

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.240
 - Matt Shaw writes.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.920
 I'm a sommelier and a wine importer

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.120
 with a specialization in fortified wine,

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.320
 and I love the section you did on Sherry,

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.360
 but I was compelled to write in

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.640
 as Andy has unfortunately fallen foul

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.360
 of one of the classic misunderstandings

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.800
 of the Solera system.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.640
 - Oh yeah.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.920
 - Yeah, that pyramid.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.960
 - Can you just quickly remind us of the Solera system?

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.200
 - Basically, the thing I said that was wrong

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.160
 is that you move most of the Sherry

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.320
 from one barrel to another,

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.240
 and the new Sherry's at the top of the pyramid,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.720
 and the old Sherry's at the bottom of the pyramid,

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.280
 and you move it down and down and down,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.360
 so it all gets mixed up,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.640
 and the older Sherry helps

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.360
 the newer Sherry develop and blah, blah, blah.

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.560
 He says it's always represented as a pyramid,

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.440
 because it's a very useful representation,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.120
 but the consistent and persistent side effect

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.520
 is that every single wine student

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.560
 gets tricked into thinking

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.280
 these are physical barrels of pyramids,

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.120
 which they're not.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.560
 - So they just move it with cups running to and from?

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.040
 - Well, it's like eggs in buckets,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.720
 he says if there's a fire or an accident,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.280
 you will only lose some of it,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.560
 whereas if it's in a pyramid, you lose all of it.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.880
 And some of the wine storage warehouses

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.200
 have their own micro climates,

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.720
 which influence how the wine ages,

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:32.200
 so they have to move around between.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.040
 - Oh wow. - Anyway,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.920
 the wine doesn't physically flow between the barrels,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.880
 it's blended in a separate larger tank.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.640
 This is a small point,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.080
 and an otherwise well-explained and very interesting section,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.160
 but given it's one of the most persistent myths,

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.440
 I have spent a decade battling

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.560
 the one I felt it was worth being a pedant for.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:49.480
 - That study is well spent, I must say.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:52.400
 - No, I think that's a good, that's a good, you know.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.880
 - Yeah, yeah, really good.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.720
 - Here's a question.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.560
 - All right, cool.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:56.840
 - Michael Cattle writes,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.960
 "Hello from 2019, sort of."

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.000
 - Oh, time traveler.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.080
 - "Playful, off to a playful start with Michael."

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.360
 I've listened to the entirety of The Fisher

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.200
 for probably five times or so at this point.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.040
 - Right.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.240
 - Wow, I'm passing through the end of 2019 again,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.840
 and James just mentioned that Polina, his wife,

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.600
 had booked a flight on a parabolic flight

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.560
 next year. - Oh yeah.

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.760
 - Did she ever go on that flight?

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.640
 And if so, what did she think?

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.680
 I don't recall hearing an update,

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.200
 and I'm hoping Polina comes up enough

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.520
 that the question isn't too personal.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.520
 - Okay, well, spoiler alert for the guy living in 2019,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.480
 by 2020, there weren't many trips to France

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.200
 to do parabolic flights.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.000
 I don't really want to explain exactly why,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.840
 'cause it will spoil everything for you.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.520
 - But there was enough vomiting going on in 2020

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.400
 without parabolic flying.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.640
 - Unfortunately, we had to cancel it because of COVID.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.160
 And then we had a baby, and we will have to take

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.120
 medical again before we get a chance to do it,

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.440
 'cause you need to take a medical.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.760
 - That was fair enough.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.600
 - You're crying, Shane.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.600
 - That's a sad ending to that, Aimee, for Michael,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.960
 but thank you.

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.240
 Oh, here's a really good one.

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.880
 Dave in sale, credit, Manchester.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.080
 Firstly, when are you gonna do a new book of the year?

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.720
 We'll get back to you.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.280
 Secondly, and more importantly,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:08.520
 I thought it would bring to draw your attention

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.160
 to a possibility of a trademark infringement.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.840
 In the audio book of Everything to Play for,

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.120
 the QI Book of Sports by James Harkin and Anterjinsky,

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.800
 they both sign off the end of the audio book

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.560
 by just using the word buy.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.680
 (laughing)

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.720
 - I can't believe someone's listened all the way to the end.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:24.560
 - Do we do that?

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.360
 - I assume this has already been trademarked by you,

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.320
 hence my worry.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.960
 Civil remedies for trademark infringement

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.800
 include injunctions, damages, or accounted profits.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.440
 Criminal penalties are also available, good luck.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.600
 - Does Dave from sale say that, for instance,

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.840
 you might need to actually trademark something

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.320
 before it could be infringed?

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.680
 - No, he doesn't say that.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.240
 Just as he assumes I've got it.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.960
 - Actually, we've trademarked it.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.800
 - Stop.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.880
 - And now you are infringing on our trademark

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.240
 every time you say it.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.720
 - How you gonna end this up?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.120
 (laughing)

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.960
 - Very abruptly.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.440
 (laughing)

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.720
 Unlike my normal slow language.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.480
 (laughing)

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.360
 - How interesting, I remember us recording it,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.440
 but I didn't recall that we'd done the buy thing.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.280
 - So what do you do?

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.280
 You guys at the end just have a kind of like,

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.480
 well, that's it everyone.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.920
 - Yeah, well, we read the book

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.200
 and then we did a special extra bonus chapter

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.600
 where we just chatted like a podcast,

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.040
 but without the two dead weights.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.280
 (laughing)

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.680
 At the end of that, I presume we just said bye.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.400
 - I do remember that, it's the only bit I remember is the buy.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.000
 - Deeming, I'm so cross, I'm so furious.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.400
 All right, well, we'll thrash that out.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.280
 Thank you very much for that.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.120
 Thank you, Dave.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:33.960
 - Can't believe you spilled the beans.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.560
 - One final thing, sorry.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.600
 Tom Rist Smith writes,

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.760
 "I'm in the toilet of a shuffleboard bar called Meen Doses

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.520
 - Really?

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.120
 - And a friend of mine wrote to me saying,

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.520

 "and they are playing fish in the toilet."

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.440
 - That's so cool.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.280
 - In Wellington.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.360
 - That's so exciting.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.200
 - So is he just spending lots of time in the toilet now?

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.040
 - I guess.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.560
 - He does spend like 55 minutes in the toilet.

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.080
 And like, what have you been doing in that toilet

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.920
 for all that time?

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.400
 Well, Rist is my middle name.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.720
 - Anyway, that's cool, isn't it?

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.560
 - That's pretty exciting.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.400
 - We've made it.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.960
 And that's probably the furthest toilet we've been played in.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.760
 - It won't doubt the toilet.

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.080
 - That will turn.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:36.920
 - Yeah.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.520
 - We should acknowledge it secretly in an upcoming episode.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.360
 - Oh, that's great.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.200
 - Just something.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.000
 Just something to get a mention of shuffleboard.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.480
 - We could make a special 15-minute episode,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.040
 send it to this bar.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.760
 If you want to be a completist,

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.680
 not just seeing as a fish,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.360
 you have to go to this bar toilet to listen to it.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.200
 - That's such a good idea.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.040
 Let's do that.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:54.880
 Let's do that.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.720
 Great, let's definitely do that.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.000
 - That's gonna be very bad for people's carbon footprint.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.640
 Oh, I feel very guilty about encouraging everyone

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.080
 to flock to the toilet.

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080
 - That's true.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.160
 A shuffleboard bar called Mean Doses in Wellington.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.000
 - Imagine if--

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.840
 - It's a long way.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.760
 - It's a hundred thousand people time now.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:15.920
 - Oh, God, I've got anxiety about how you're gonna end this.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.760
 Toodle-oo.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.260
 (all laughing)

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.840
 (upbeat music)

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.460
 - I think I covered it.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.300
 That was fun, wasn't it?

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:26.140
 - Nailed it.

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.960
 - It was great.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:27.800
 - It was a loo, yeah.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.340
 - Pip, pip.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.420
 No, thanks everybody for listening.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.260
 That was really fun.

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.080
 I hope you enjoyed it.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.920
 If you want to say anything,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.840
 just email podcast@qi.com.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.440
 We love hearing from you with your spin-off stories

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.280
 and your bonus facts.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.560
 We'll be back again next month with another one of these.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:42.720
 See you next time.

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.560
 Bye.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.560
 Yeah.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.720
 - Wow, see you for that.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.580
 (upbeat music)

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.160
