1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
 (phone ringing)

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,780
 (indistinct chatter)

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,360
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,760
 - Hi. - Hello.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,580
 - Hi, Andy.

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,060
 - Andy here, joined by my three chums.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:15,900
 - James. - Hey, what's up?

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,600
 - Anna. - Come on, Anna.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,200
 Please stand up, come on.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,320
 James, Anna, and Dan are here as well.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,240
 And this is Drop as a Line.

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,800
 - I've got a mouth full of strutwaffle,

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,360
 otherwise I would have said high as well.

14
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,520
 - Yeah. - Oh, yum.

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,360
 - The standards of professionals--

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,200
 - You should like banana.

17
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,040
 - Do you have any?

18
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,880
 - What is this, strutwaffle?

19
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,720
 - We're gonna start us again.

20
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,560
 Guys, this is-- - Start us again.

21
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,760
 - It's too unprofessional. - Yeah.

22
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,200
 - Hi. - Hello.

23
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,040
 - Oh my God.

24
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,880
 - Right. - Anna, would you like

25
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,720
 a strutwaffle?

26
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,960
 (laughing)

27
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,680
 - I get no respect.

28
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,400
 Welcome to Drop as a Line, everybody.

29
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,440
 This is the bit of the show where we are--

30
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,200
 No, James, open your bottle of carbonated water.

31
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,120
 - It's Evian.

32
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,360
 (laughing)

33
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
 - Anyone got anything else?

34
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,800
 They'd like to get off their chest or out of their bags.

35
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
 - No, no, no. - Right, okay.

36
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,640
 Welcome to Drop as a Line.

37
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,720
 This is where we are going through your words.

38
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
 I'm reading them out to these guys.

39
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,240
 These guys will say something funny

40
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,720
 and we'll end after about a little while.

41
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,720
 That fair summation?

42
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,560
 - Yeah, that's excellent.

43
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,600
 Why don't we get on with it?

44
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,440
 - Yeah, okay.

45
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,400
 - Maybe we should start again.

46
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,880
 - No, look, we've had some cracking correspondence.

47
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,720
 - Great.

48
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,880
 - Here is Ian Dunne with an um, actually--

49
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,680
 - Hello. - An old friend.

50
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,520
 - Great friend of the show.

51
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,360
 - Hi, Ian.

52
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,200
 - Just a quick note regarding Rutland,

53
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,240
 which came up in episode 511.

54
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,920
 In it, you, Andy, said that Rutland

55
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,280
 was the smallest county in England.

56
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,480
 - Oh, he's from T-side, Ian.

57
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
 Is that-- - Who is he?

58
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,920
 - Yeah, is that, you're going to say that's small?

59
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,760
 No, it's not small.

60
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
 - No, he just says, as was mentioned

61
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,200
 in the QI episode, England, Rutrow,

62
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,480
 a general ignorance question said that the smallest county

63
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,320
 was actually the Isle of Wight at High Tide.

64
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,160
 - That's right.

65
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,440
 - When the tide is out, indeed, Rutland is smaller.

66
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
 - That's great.

67
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,120
 - I know. - That's a good fact.

68
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,200
 - And I've also heard from Hattie Hodgson-Krome,

69
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,040
 brilliant name on Twitter.

70
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,120
 The population of Rutland are crying out

71
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,000
 in the latest episode of--

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,720
 - Just imagine flying over Rutland

73
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,640
 in a small aircraft and just hearing the people.

74
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,000
 - Absolutely wailing and gnashing of teeth

75
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
 coming from Rutland.

76
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,520
 In the latest episode of No Such Thing, Andy,

77
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,000
 you said it had become, I think,

78
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,040
 a unitary authority instead of a county.

79
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,080
 - Right. - Actually,

80
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,760
 it became an independent county again in 1997.

81
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,240
 As a primary school there, at the time,

82
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,960
 I received a mug to mark the occasion.

83
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
 I'm sorry, Hattie, and I'm sorry, Ian.

84
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,240
 - I would say, of all the things,

85
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,600
 having worked at QI for 20 years, more, in fact,

86
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,920
 the thing that gets people hot under the collar

87
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,640
 more than almost anything else is the 1971

88
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,000
 Unitary Authorities Act,

89
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 which made all of the counties of England the new counties.

90
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,120
 - Well, it's your chat-up line, isn't it?

91
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,320
 You ask people in bars what they think about it.

92
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,280
 - I just stand on the corner of Cumbria and Northumberland.

93
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,880
 - Do you remember a thing where we spoke about people

94
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,440
 not being called BJ in the UK?

95
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
 - Yeah, that was me.

96
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,760
 - Yeah, I just said, I feel like Americans are called BJ.

97
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,080
 A few people have messaged me saying, "I know an Aussie BJ."

98
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
 Yeah.

99
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,800
 - Well, Chris Blundle-Drois writes.

100
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,040
 (laughing)

101
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:14,000
 - Since we amalgamated, hyphenated our names

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
 when we got married, we are now the Blundle-Droisers,

103
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,960
 AKA the BJs.

104
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,560
 We live in York.

105
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,040
 And now our family and friends knows as the BJs,

106
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,320
 God help our two-year-old daughter

107
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,920
 when she goes to school in the future.

108
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,760
 (laughing)

109
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,080
 There we go, thank you, Chris.

110
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,480
 - I think it's one of the few instances where being BJ

111
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,800
 is going to be less embarrassing for her

112
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
 than being called Blundle-Drois.

113
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
 - It's a lovely name.

114
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,600
 - It is a lovely name.

115
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,520
 The word Blundle, I wish meant something

116
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
 because I'd love to be saying it on a regular basis.

117
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,200
 - Blundle-Bus, if they have a car,

118
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,640
 they should call it the Blundle-Bus.

119
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,480
 - Yes.

120
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,720
 - It sounds a bit like Blunder-Bus.

121
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
 - And what's that?

122
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,400
 - It's a large gum.

123
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,760
 - Yeah, just a cool word.

124
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,600
 - Cool.

125
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,720
 - Andrew Morth writes.

126
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,280
 - You know the bit where you say something

127
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
 and then we're funny after it?

128
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,440
 - Oh yeah.

129
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,280
 - When do we get to that bit?

130
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,720
 (laughing)

131
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,000
 - We'll keep going until we've got something.

132
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,040
 - Okay.

133
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,160
 - Andrew Morth writes.

134
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,300
 (humming)

135
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,560
 (laughing)

136
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,860
 - How dare you, Andrew?

137
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,600
 (laughing)

138
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
 - Oh, lovely.

139
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,040
 Another Andy M, as he points out.

140
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,480
 I recently joined Clubfish to see

141
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,280
 if you guys ever mentioned my amazing fact

142
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,760
 about the Hoover Dam back in November, 2022.

143
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
 Brackets?

144
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,420
 No.

145
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,960
 (laughing)

146
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,120
 - Do we have the fact?

147
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,280
 - I did look at it, it's fine.

148
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,080
 - Can I tell you the fact, okay?

149
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,240
 See if it's the same one.

150
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,480
 - Oh yeah.

151
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,480
 - They used to, if you had a mental illness,

152
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,800
 they used to prescribe you to go to the Hoover Dam

153
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,920
 and listen to the water going down the Hoover Dam

154
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
 and that was supposed to make you feel better.

155
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,360
 - Love it.

156
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
 - That is a good fact.

157
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
 - Was that his fact?

158
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,480
 - No, his fact, it was a really good one actually.

159
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,080
 It was about the construction of the dam

160
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
 and it was really tragic.

161
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,240
 It was about the first person and the last person to die

162
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,360
 and I think the first person was someone like the architect

163
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,480
 or the last person was his son.

164
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
 - Right.

165
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
 - And it was a great fact, but it was quite sad.

166
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,280
 So I thought it might be a bit gloomy for us.

167
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
 - Yeah, yeah.

168
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,720
 - Anyway, I joined, to see if you mentioned my fact,

169
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,800
 with every intention of unsubscribing before I had to pay

170
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,840
 because I'm cheap and have very little money at the moment.

171
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,980
 - That's fair, that's fair.

172
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,960
 - However, around a year ago on the Bonus Podcast,

173
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,840
 Andy admitted to peeing in the shower,

174
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,120
 which was a shocking revelation

175
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,600
 from such a private and conservative man.

176
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,480
 I have hence committed to peeing for at least one month

177
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,080
 for the privilege of hearing you all open up.

178
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,800
 - It's the first and last time Andy ever opened up.

179
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
 - I know, and I closed right back down.

180
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,680
 It was such an unpleasant time for me

181
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
 that I've just, I've never said anything.

182
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,120
 No one ever gets anything out of me now.

183
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,280
 - There's months of therapy, wasn't it,

184
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,400
 after you've missed that?

185
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,640
 Which I know you don't want us to say, of course, but.

186
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,720
 - Yeah, Jesus.

187
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,560
 Here's a fact about Dan's teeth.

188
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,920
 - Oh, yeah, so he doesn't have canines.

189
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,880
 - Right, and this is from Jessamy Gloor.

190
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,200
 - Please.

191
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,280
 - This is a brilliant name.

192
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,640
 - Stunning name, stunning.

193
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,000
 - I know, as an American who lived in Britain,

194
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,480
 I noticed that many white British people

195
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
 have really long canines,

196
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,440
 compared to what seems normal in the USA.

197
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,880
 So much so that it gets distracting,

198
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,560
 wondering if the British person you're talking to

199
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,780
 is actually a vampire.

200
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,720
 (laughing)

201
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 - This is just the thing we said.

202
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,040
 - Well, we were talking about canine teeth, and.

203
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,200
 - We just noticed that you don't have any.

204
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,120
 - Yeah, everyone said, "Look at your mouth,"

205
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,400
 and Anna, I think it was you who said, "Dan, where are yours?"

206
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,160
 People have since gone through my Instagram,

207
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,160
 finding photos of me with a smile, going, "Yeah, you don't."

208
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,480
 Like, just pointing out specific photos to me.

209
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,560
 - So she says, "Despite having listened to fish for years,

210
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
 "I still get the names mixed up,

211
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,280
 "but when Anna pointed out that Dan had no canines,

212
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,360
 "I easily guessed he was the least British of the four."

213
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,400
 - Right, I think that's a coincidence.

214
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,640
 I like the theory, but we need more data.

215
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,480
 - I like it.

216
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,320
 - She says, "No clue if it's genetic or environmental,

217
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,840
 "but I've never seen an American try to open a bag of crisps

218
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
 "with their teeth."

219
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,760
 (laughing)

220
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,680
 - I actually think that that is a thing that Americans

221
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,520
 and non-English people find very unusual about the British,

222
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,080
 that if you go to a pub, people will go to the bar

223
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,280
 buy a pack of crisps, bite it open,

224
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,240
 and then just open it and leave it on a table.

225
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,080
 - Yeah.

226
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,400
 - How are they opening their crisps to share?

227
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,320
 - I don't think they share.

228
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
 - Well, they don't share.

229
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,760
 - There was someone on Twitter who was--

230
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,600
 - People share.

231
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,440
 - No other country shares.

232
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,280
 (laughing)

233
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,160
 - It honestly was a revelation

234
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,600
 when I came here and I saw that happen.

235
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
 And then as my Aussie mates came over

236
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
 and other international friends,

237
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
 I would do it knowing each time

238
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,040
 that I was introducing them to something incredible.

239
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,880
 - Oh, wow.

240
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,960
 - It's funny, it's sort of inoculated

241
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,200
 Britain against true socialism.

242
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,760
 Like, that's what we do to share.

243
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,600
 (laughing)

244
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,440
 - That's all we need.

245
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
 - And we've never had a proper redistributive--

246
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,280
 - Anyway, thank you.

248
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,200
 - 'Cause we redistribute crisps round and table

249
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,040
 in a pub.

250
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,880
 - Yeah.

251
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,000
 - I actually don't like doing it.

252
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
 - Don't you?

253
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,680
 - Because--

254
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,520
 - You don't like sharing.

255
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,880
 - Yeah, 'cause I hate sharing for yourself-ish

256
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,840
 and very greedy.

257
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,960
 But also, I feel like you know this about me

258
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,400
 on my favorite thing about crisps.

259
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,840
 My favorite thing to do with crisps.

260
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
 - You lick the bag?

261
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,680
 - No.

262
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,600
 You've gotta pop the crisp bag.

263
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,000
 So as soon as you ruin the crisp bag.

264
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,160
 So I just overturn all the crisps onto the table

265
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,040
 and then I bang the bag.

266
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,880
 - Yeah.

267
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
 - Bang the bag.

268
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,560
 (laughing)

269
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,880
 This is that opening up stuff

270
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,320
 that this guy wanted us to do.

271
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
 - Yeah, happy now.

272
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,640
 - That's good stuff.

273
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
 - Simon Graham writes,

274
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,680
 this is about when Dan's fact was about the wall

275
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
 crashing into air to the center.

276
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,920
 - Oh yeah.

277
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
 - Which is such a good fact.

278
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,040
 - Yeah, brilliant.

279
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
 - So in the following discussion,

280
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,440
 you all lamented the demise of the lollipop man

281
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,280
 in the pit crew, right?

282
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
 In 2009, this, I love this email.

283
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,520
 Formula One introduced hybrid engines

284
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,720
 with kinetic energy recovery systems

285
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,760
 which harvested energy when you're braking.

286
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
 - Yeah, it's the same stuff

287
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,280
 as you get in electric cars today.

288
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,480
 - Right, and they store it in batteries

289
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,400
 and then when you're overtaking,

290
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,120
 you sort of, you use that.

291
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,400
 The technology was a bit unknown

292
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,360
 and somewhat unreliable at the time.

293
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,520
 During this early period of the KERS,

294
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,400
 there was always a pit crew member standing by

295
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,360
 with what looks like a shepherd's crook

296
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,400
 in case one of the crew was electrocuted.

297
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,560
 - Oh, what, they'd pull him off stage

298
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,440
 like someone who's terrible comedian?

299
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
 - That's it, no.

300
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
 - There was always a crew member

301
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
 holding one during the pit stops

302
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
 in case of electrocution.

303
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,560
 - Wow.

304
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,000
 - He attached a photo showing a pit member

305
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,160
 wearing extra heavy rubber gloves.

306
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,680
 And yeah, since the technology has moved on,

307
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,000
 it has become more reliable and safe

308
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,800
 and the shepherd has gone the way of the lollipop man.

309
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,840
 - Wow, I wonder if it did ever happen

310
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,360
 'cause we'd have it on camera presumably

311
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,800
 if it was a F1 kind of thing.

312
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,520
 - I don't know, maybe it would have.

313
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,360
 - Isn't that lovely?

314
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,080
 - It is quite nice, I imagine you being sacked

315
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,760
 as a lollipop man and going home

316
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,680
 and then you get the phone call going darling,

317
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,160
 don't worry, I've got a new gig.

318
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,160
 - I've got an upsetting email to read.

319
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,920
 It's from Alex Stroh, subject Dan was right.

320
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,060
 - I'm upset already.

321
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,600
 - We'll cut this, so what's the point?

322
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
 - And he's quoting from I think a piece,

323
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,800
 maybe a Wikipedia, but it's,

324
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,560
 "As water monsters, Kappa have been blamed for drownings

325
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
 and are often said to try and lure people into water."

326
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,400
 - I just thought I really thought you meant

327
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
 the tracksuit trouser brand.

328
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
 (laughing)

329
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,920
 And they would, they'd weigh you down

330
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,120
 if you jump in the sea.

331
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,320
 Sorry, Kappa, what?

332
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,280
 - They lure people into water

333
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,200
 and pull them in with their great skill at wrestling.

334
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,160
 - This is like a fictional beast with Kappa, right?

335
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,640
 - Yeah, mythical beast in Japan, I believe.

336
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,160
 - They're sometimes said to take their victims

337
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,520
 for the purpose of drinking their blood,

338
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,280
 eating their livers, or gaining power

339
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,560
 by taking their shirokodama,

340
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,520
 a mythical ball said to contain the soul

341
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,280
 which is located inside the anus.

342
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,800
 - So sorry, Dan was right about something.

343
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,840
 - We were, we were--

344
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
 (laughing)

345
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,240
 - This was from before my time.

346
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,560
 - No, no, no, we were on stage together.

347
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,200
 This was-- - Soho Theatre.

348
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
 - Yeah, Soho Theatre,

349
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
 and we were talking about the bong ball.

350
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,360
 - Bong ball that Aussies have.

351
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,200
 - Was I in this one?

352
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,040
 - Yeah, yeah.

353
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,680
 - I was asking what the word bong ball meant,

354
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,480
 and it was actually a party thrown by a publican

355
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,960
 because bong is part of a barrel.

356
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
 And Dan thought that the bong ball

357
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,400
 was a thing found in an anus.

358
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,920
 - I was asking if it was the anus soul ball,

359
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 which these Japanese mythological creatures would--

360
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,760
 - Yeah, you were right.

361
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,320
 - Yeah, I'm still not getting the respect

362
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
 from having an anus. - No, weird, isn't it?

363
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,920
 - Well done.

364
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,000
 - Never questioned down on cryptozoology.

365
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:53,840
 I can't believe we even did.

366
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,560
 - It's mythological, it's mythological stuff.

367
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,480
 - Was it, 'cause it's in Japan,

368
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,200
 was it believed by the anus,

369
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,640
 which is a large group of Japanese people?

370
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,680
 - And they're the Ainu.

371
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,360
 - Yeah, but we have to be getting trouble every time

372
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,920
 we mention them, 'cause James and his sixth uncle

373
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
 in the eighties tried.

374
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,880
 - Dan, can you read out that word?

375
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,720
 That one word?

376
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,320
 - Manitowak?

377
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,640
 - Okay, this is an email from Alex.

378
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
 "Andy, just wanted to say that Dan pronounced it

379
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,680
 completely correctly.

380
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,480
 It was like he was from Wisconsin.

381
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,760
 I'm as shocked as you are."

382
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,000
 (all laughing)

383
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,520
 - P.S., if you use this on Drop as a Line,

384
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,440
 please make Dan read my last name.

385
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,840
 'Cause that's from Alex Tiebsky."

386
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,880
 There we go.

387
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,560
 - That sounded like it plausibly could be corrected.

388
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,400
 - Yeah.

389
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,440
 - Quite good actually as well.

390
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,760
 - Just so people can play along at home.

391
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,840
 - T-I-E-V-S-K-Y.

392
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,680
 - Okay.

393
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
 - I'd have maybe gone with Tiebsky,

394
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,920
 but Tiebsky sounds very, very likely.

395
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,760
 - Okay, Alex's right in.

396
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,600
 Who was correct?

397
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,920
 Andy or Dan?

398
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,400
 - And did I pronounce the place right again?

399
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,240
 - Oh, good.

400
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,720
 Maybe Dan, 'cause I don't know what I said.

401
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 - It was a sheer chance.

402
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,560
 You've gotta, you know, throw one dart right once.

403
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,400
 - Yeah.

404
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,240
 - Do it randomly.

405
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,880
 - Can I give you a piece of correspondence

406
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,880
 that someone sent in?

407
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,720
 - Yeah.

408
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,360
 - This was sent on my Instagram,

409
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,800
 no such thing as James Harkin,

410
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,880
 by someone called Katie Collinson.

411
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
 And it was about an episode that I wasn't in.

412
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,080
 And she said, "Tell Dan that liquid soap

413
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,640
 "is normally full of preservatives

414
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,280
 "because it is made with water."

415
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,520
 And apparently you were talking about the difference between,

416
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,880
 apparently I did listen to the show.

417
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,760
 He's very good with Reese James.

418
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,360
 Are you talking about the difference between block soap

419
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,400
 and liquid soap?

420
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,240
 - Yeah.

421
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,400
 - And what I found really interesting is,

422
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,480
 I think in the show, you guys mentioned that liquid soap

423
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,240
 is worse for the environment because it contains water

424
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 and you need to ship that around the world.

425
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
 - I think I said that.

426
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
 - I think that's true.

427
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,720
 But what's really interesting, I think,

428
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,880
 is what Katie said, which she worked for Lush, by the way.

429
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,640
 She says that the water causes it to go off.

430
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,400
 Because you've got water in there,

431
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,160
 it can collect bacteria and stuff like that,

432
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,160
 whereas solid soap can't do that.

433
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,520
 So, solid soap is cleaner than liquid soap.

434
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,160
 - Nice.

435
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,680
 - You don't think of off water, do you?

436
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:14,200
 You rarely take a sip of water and go, "Oh, that's been--"

437
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,640
 - But if bacteria need to live, they need water, don't they?

438
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
 - Well, there we go.

439
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,320
 Glad that we've got more anti-liquid soap propaganda.

440
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,720
 - That's brilliant.

441
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,560
 Here's one.

442
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,600
 This is a bit of a controversial one.

443
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,240
 This is a spicy meat.

444
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
 It's from Ben Lidgate.

445
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,520
 I just listened to your most recent Christmas episode,

446
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,160
 in which Dan mentions the fact

447
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,960
 that Chuck Norris edits out all the fight scenes

448
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,040
 from his movies in order to show them to his kids.

449
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
 And the rest of you all sounded interested and entertained

450
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,160
 as if this was new information for you.

451
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,760
 However, I am also currently relistening

452
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,840
 to all your old episodes.

453
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,400
 And I've just listened to episode 29

454
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,600
 from the 3rd of October, 2014,

455
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
 in which Dan mentions this fact.

456
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,680
 And episode 30 from the 11th of October, 2014,

457
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,960
 in which Dan mentions it again.

458
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,080
 And each time, you all sounded at least slightly surprised.

459
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,000
 - Well, two things here.

460
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,080
 I think Dan did say this is a fact

461
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,800
 I've been trying to prove for a long time.

462
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,160
 So he did reference that.

463
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,160
 And secondly, that's just being polite, isn't it?

464
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,920
 It'd be terrible if every time one of you said a fact,

465
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,320
 I didn't find it interesting.

466
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
 I commented, I don't find that interesting.

467
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,480
 - Ben says, I'm beginning to suspect

468
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,880
 that the hilarious banter that sounds spontaneous each week

469
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,560
 is in fact entirely infected.

470
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,440
 How much of what we hear is real.

471
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,800
 Are all your interactions entirely scripted?

472
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,720
 Or is it simply the case that none of you pay attention

473
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,320
 to Dan and he can come up with the same fact every week

474
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,160
 and none of you would know this?

475
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
 - Bingo, there we go.

476
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,080
 - By the way, I did have a listener write in to me

477
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,480
 having tracked down the interview that I was talking about.

478
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,040
 And it is the case that he re-edits the movies.

479
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,400
 - Sorry, Chuck Norris re-edits movies.

480
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,240
 Why would he do that?

481
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,960
 - So basically he doesn't want his kids to talk about it.

482
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,160
 - I can only fake it three times.

483
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,760
 - However, in that specific interview,

484
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,120
 he says he takes it from an R-rated movie

485
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,080
 to a movie that they can watch.

486
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,840
 He doesn't specifically say, takes out all the fight scenes.

487
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,800
 - Which is something I feel I definitely read somewhere else.

488
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,640
 - So he might take out some beswearing as well.

489
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
 - Yeah, or the love scenes or whatever that is.

490
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
 - Here's hoping that you track down the truth

491
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,600
 and we'll end up hearing that fact a fifth time.

492
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,440
 - We're getting closer.

493
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,280
 - Oh yeah. - See?

494
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
 - Absolutely. - Over a 10 year period,

495
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,360
 you keep mentioning it.

496
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,400
 - Someone will help.

497
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,840
 - Gene Montarastelli writes, with a sport fact actually,

498
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,160
 says that he really enjoyed everything to play for, by the way.

499
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,360
 - Thank you. - The QI book of sports.

500
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,400
 - Oh, thank you, Gene.

501
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,120
 Or John, I'm gonna say.

502
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,440
 - Gene.

503
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,280
 - Okay, or Gene.

504
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,760
 Oh, is it G-E-N-E? - Yeah.

505
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,720
 - Sorry, I thought it was J-E-A-N.

506
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,240
 - No, no, no, I'm sure you know how to pronounce the word

507
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,720
 that I've got written in front of me better than I do.

508
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,120
 - Hannah, you're distracting from the fact

509
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,360
 that we've got a plug chance here.

510
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,520
 - Oh, one reader and I don't get it.

511
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,360
 - No, we're moving on.

512
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,160
 Actually, he hated it.

513
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
 (laughing)

514
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 - No, what was it he enjoyed?

515
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,040
 - We talked about-- - Look everything to play for.

516
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,720
 - He talked about, you know, we talked about the name change

517
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,640
 for the British basketball league.

518
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,160
 - Became the BBL.

519
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,000
 - Yeah.

520
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,360
 - It was originally the BBL, I should say,

521
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,200
 which is also Brazilian but left.

522
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,760
 - And their logo looks a bit like a bum.

523
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,600
 - Yeah.

524
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,440
 - And he says, "When you were talking about this,

525
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,120
 "there was a discussion of how a large rump

526
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,040
 "might be helpful in basketball.

527
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,320
 "Basketball Hall, basketball Hall of Famer, Charles Barkley."

528
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,160
 (laughing)

529
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,000
 - Sorry.

530
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,240
 (laughing)

531
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,800
 - He doesn't speak to a lad who doesn't know much

532
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,640
 about sports.

533
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,880
 (laughing)

534
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,400
 - I thought you were capable of reading the words

535
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
 right in front of you.

536
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,040
 (laughing)

537
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,880
 - Yeah, okay.

538
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,720
 - That's a fair cop.

539
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
 All right, whatever.

541
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,840
 Basketball Hall of Famer, Charles Barkley.

542
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,200
 - Yes. - Easy, easy.

543
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,080
 Was known for his ample butt.

544
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,120
 And--

545
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,480
 - Yeah, he used to use it to bounce off people a little bit,

546
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
 didn't he?

547
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,440
 He would like stuff, you know,

548
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,640
 if people are running towards him,

549
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,400
 he'd move his bum in the way and they'd kind of--

550
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,240
 - Exactly that.

551
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,400
 He was very effective at using his generous posterior

552
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,720
 to move taller players out of the way.

553
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,560
 (laughing)

554
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,400
 Incredible.

555
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,240
 - What was the name?

556
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,400
 - Can you smell my ass?

557
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
 (laughing)

558
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,520
 Can you smell my ass?

559
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,360
 That's it.

560
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,160
 - Oh, brilliant.

562
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,160
 this is a, what is it called,

563
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,480
 when we get something wrong?

564
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
 - I'm unusual. - I'm actually,

565
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,040
 I'm actually is what it is.

566
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,840
 This week's episode said that Bethany England

567
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,320
 was the first person to play for a country

568
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,640
 that shares her name.

569
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,000
 I think it was one of you, Dan or Anna, you said that.

570
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,960
 - The first person to play for the,

571
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
 oh yeah, the country that shares her name.

572
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,920
 Sorry, yes, that's right.

573
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,760
 I did claim that.

574
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
 - Well, it's not right, Anna.

575
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,160
 Because of a man called Steven Ireland.

576
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,080
 - Oh, yes. - Played for Ireland.

577
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,640
 Six caps and four goals.

578
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,240
 - We don't really, when we talk about football,

579
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,080
 we are usually thinking about women's football.

580
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,440
 So sometimes we don't always

581
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,440
 immediately bring the men's game to mind.

582
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
 - Absolutely.

583
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,120
 - I think that's what happened there.

584
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,320
 - Yeah, it's very sexist of us and I do apologise.

585
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,480
 Yeah.

586
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,400
 That's a great question, well done.

587
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,240
 - No, it's a brilliant.

588
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,640
 - You know what, when we were sat on stage,

589
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,040
 I was going through all the countries

590
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,280
 trying to think of any other ones.

591
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,960
 And I never got to put anything down.

592
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
 - We were talking about Alan Brazil, weren't we?

593
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,000
 - Actually, mostly the Alan Brazil stuff got cut out

594
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,680
 because we didn't know that he'd recently died.

595
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,440
 - Oh, I'm so dead though.

596
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,640
 - I mean, it was sad, but we spoke about him

597
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
 as if he was still alive.

598
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,160
 - Yeah, right.

599
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,320
 - Yeah.

600
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
 - I've got something, I've got a bad one here.

601
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,120
 This is a good one, but it's bad for me.

602
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,040
 Matt Shaw writes.

603
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,240
 - Your novels are shit.

604
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,320
 (all laughing)

605
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,760
 - James, I've asked you to stay out of the inbox,

606
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,200
 it's important that you hear these for the first time, fresh.

607
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
 - It's rather that than on the Amazon review.

608
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,400
 (all laughing)

609
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,240
 - Matt Shaw writes.

610
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,920
 I'm a sommelier and a wine importer

611
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,120
 with a specialization in fortified wine,

612
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,320
 and I love the section you did on Sherry,

613
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,360
 but I was compelled to write in

614
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,640
 as Andy has unfortunately fallen foul

615
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,360
 of one of the classic misunderstandings

616
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,800
 of the Solera system.

617
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,640
 - Oh yeah.

618
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,920
 - Yeah, that pyramid.

619
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
 - Can you just quickly remind us of the Solera system?

620
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,200
 - Basically, the thing I said that was wrong

621
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
 is that you move most of the Sherry

622
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,320
 from one barrel to another,

623
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
 and the new Sherry's at the top of the pyramid,

624
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
 and the old Sherry's at the bottom of the pyramid,

625
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,280
 and you move it down and down and down,

626
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,360
 so it all gets mixed up,

627
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
 and the older Sherry helps

628
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,360
 the newer Sherry develop and blah, blah, blah.

629
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,560
 He says it's always represented as a pyramid,

630
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,440
 because it's a very useful representation,

631
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,120
 but the consistent and persistent side effect

632
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,520
 is that every single wine student

633
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,560
 gets tricked into thinking

634
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,280
 these are physical barrels of pyramids,

635
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,120
 which they're not.

636
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,560
 - So they just move it with cups running to and from?

637
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,040
 - Well, it's like eggs in buckets,

638
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,720
 he says if there's a fire or an accident,

639
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,280
 you will only lose some of it,

640
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,560
 whereas if it's in a pyramid, you lose all of it.

641
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,880
 And some of the wine storage warehouses

642
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
 have their own micro climates,

643
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
 which influence how the wine ages,

644
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,200
 so they have to move around between.

645
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,040
 - Oh wow. - Anyway,

646
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,920
 the wine doesn't physically flow between the barrels,

647
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,880
 it's blended in a separate larger tank.

648
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,640
 This is a small point,

649
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,080
 and an otherwise well-explained and very interesting section,

650
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,160
 but given it's one of the most persistent myths,

651
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,440
 I have spent a decade battling

652
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,560
 the one I felt it was worth being a pedant for.

653
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,480
 - That study is well spent, I must say.

654
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,400
 - No, I think that's a good, that's a good, you know.

655
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,880
 - Yeah, yeah, really good.

656
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,720
 - Here's a question.

657
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,560
 - All right, cool.

658
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
 - Michael Cattle writes,

659
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,960
 "Hello from 2019, sort of."

660
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,000
 - Oh, time traveler.

661
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,080
 - "Playful, off to a playful start with Michael."

662
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,360
 I've listened to the entirety of The Fisher

663
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,200
 for probably five times or so at this point.

664
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,040
 - Right.

665
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,240
 - Wow, I'm passing through the end of 2019 again,

666
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,840
 and James just mentioned that Polina, his wife,

667
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,600
 had booked a flight on a parabolic flight

668
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,560
 next year. - Oh yeah.

669
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,760
 - Did she ever go on that flight?

670
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,640
 And if so, what did she think?

671
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
 I don't recall hearing an update,

672
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,200
 and I'm hoping Polina comes up enough

673
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,520
 that the question isn't too personal.

674
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,520
 - Okay, well, spoiler alert for the guy living in 2019,

675
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,480
 by 2020, there weren't many trips to France

676
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,200
 to do parabolic flights.

677
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,000
 I don't really want to explain exactly why,

678
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,840
 'cause it will spoil everything for you.

679
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,520
 - But there was enough vomiting going on in 2020

680
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,400
 without parabolic flying.

681
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,640
 - Unfortunately, we had to cancel it because of COVID.

682
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,160
 And then we had a baby, and we will have to take

683
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,120
 medical again before we get a chance to do it,

684
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,440
 'cause you need to take a medical.

685
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,760
 - That was fair enough.

686
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,600
 - You're crying, Shane.

687
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 - That's a sad ending to that, Aimee, for Michael,

688
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,960
 but thank you.

689
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,240
 Oh, here's a really good one.

690
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,880
 Dave in sale, credit, Manchester.

691
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,080
 Firstly, when are you gonna do a new book of the year?

692
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,720
 We'll get back to you.

693
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,280
 Secondly, and more importantly,

694
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
 I thought it would bring to draw your attention

695
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,160
 to a possibility of a trademark infringement.

696
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,840
 In the audio book of Everything to Play for,

697
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,120
 the QI Book of Sports by James Harkin and Anterjinsky,

698
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,800
 they both sign off the end of the audio book

699
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,560
 by just using the word buy.

700
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,680
 (laughing)

701
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,720
 - I can't believe someone's listened all the way to the end.

702
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,560
 - Do we do that?

703
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,360
 - I assume this has already been trademarked by you,

704
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,320
 hence my worry.

705
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,960
 Civil remedies for trademark infringement

706
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,800
 include injunctions, damages, or accounted profits.

707
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,440
 Criminal penalties are also available, good luck.

708
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,600
 - Does Dave from sale say that, for instance,

709
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,840
 you might need to actually trademark something

710
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,320
 before it could be infringed?

711
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,680
 - No, he doesn't say that.

712
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
 Just as he assumes I've got it.

713
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,960
 - Actually, we've trademarked it.

714
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,800
 - Stop.

715
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,880
 - And now you are infringing on our trademark

716
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,240
 every time you say it.

717
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,720
 - How you gonna end this up?

718
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,120
 (laughing)

719
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,960
 - Very abruptly.

720
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,440
 (laughing)

721
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,720
 Unlike my normal slow language.

722
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,480
 (laughing)

723
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,360
 - How interesting, I remember us recording it,

724
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,440
 but I didn't recall that we'd done the buy thing.

725
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,280
 - So what do you do?

726
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
 You guys at the end just have a kind of like,

727
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,480
 well, that's it everyone.

728
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,920
 - Yeah, well, we read the book

729
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,200
 and then we did a special extra bonus chapter

730
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
 where we just chatted like a podcast,

731
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,040
 but without the two dead weights.

732
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,280
 (laughing)

733
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,680
 At the end of that, I presume we just said bye.

734
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,400
 - I do remember that, it's the only bit I remember is the buy.

735
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,000
 - Deeming, I'm so cross, I'm so furious.

736
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,400
 All right, well, we'll thrash that out.

737
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,280
 Thank you very much for that.

738
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,120
 Thank you, Dave.

739
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,960
 - Can't believe you spilled the beans.

740
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,560
 - One final thing, sorry.

741
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,600
 Tom Rist Smith writes,

742
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,760
 "I'm in the toilet of a shuffleboard bar called Meen Doses

743
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,240
 "in Wellington, New Zealand,

744
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080

745
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,600
 "but only in the bathroom, not in the bar."

746
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,920
 And a friend of mine wrote to me saying,

747
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,160
 "I was in a bar the other day,

748
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,600

 "but only in the bathroom, not in the bar."

752
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
 - Really?

753
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,120
 - And a friend of mine wrote to me saying,

754
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,520
 "I was in a bar the other day,

755
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,480
 "and I'm in the toilet of a shuffleboard bar

756
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,600
 "and they are playing fish in the toilet."

757
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,440
 - That's so cool.

758
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,280
 - In Wellington.

759
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,360
 - That's so exciting.

760
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,200
 - So is he just spending lots of time in the toilet now?

761
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,040
 - I guess.

762
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,560
 - He does spend like 55 minutes in the toilet.

763
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,080
 And like, what have you been doing in that toilet

764
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,920
 for all that time?

765
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,400
 Well, Rist is my middle name.

766
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,720
 - Anyway, that's cool, isn't it?

767
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,560
 - That's pretty exciting.

768
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,400
 - We've made it.

769
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,960
 And that's probably the furthest toilet we've been played in.

770
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,760
 - It won't doubt the toilet.

771
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,080
 - That will turn.

772
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
 - Yeah.

773
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,520
 - We should acknowledge it secretly in an upcoming episode.

774
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,360
 - Oh, that's great.

775
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,200
 - Just something.

776
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
 Just something to get a mention of shuffleboard.

777
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,480
 - We could make a special 15-minute episode,

778
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,040
 send it to this bar.

779
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,760
 If you want to be a completist,

780
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,680
 not just seeing as a fish,

781
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,360
 you have to go to this bar toilet to listen to it.

782
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,200
 - That's such a good idea.

783
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,040
 Let's do that.

784
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:54,880
 Let's do that.

785
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,720
 Great, let's definitely do that.

786
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,000
 - That's gonna be very bad for people's carbon footprint.

787
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,640
 Oh, I feel very guilty about encouraging everyone

788
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,080
 to flock to the toilet.

789
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,080
 - That's true.

790
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,160
 A shuffleboard bar called Mean Doses in Wellington.

791
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
 - Imagine if--

792
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,840
 - It's a long way.

793
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,760
 - It's a hundred thousand people time now.

794
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,920
 - Oh, God, I've got anxiety about how you're gonna end this.

795
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,760
 Toodle-oo.

796
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,260
 (all laughing)

797
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,840
 (upbeat music)

798
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,460
 - I think I covered it.

799
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,300
 That was fun, wasn't it?

800
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,140
 - Nailed it.

801
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,960
 - It was great.

802
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,800
 - It was a loo, yeah.

803
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,340
 - Pip, pip.

804
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,420
 No, thanks everybody for listening.

805
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,260
 That was really fun.

806
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,080
 I hope you enjoyed it.

807
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,920

809
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,440
 We love hearing from you with your spin-off stories

810
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
 and your bonus facts.

811
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,560
 We'll be back again next month with another one of these.

812
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,720
 See you next time.

813
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,560
 Bye.

814
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
 Yeah.

815
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,720
 - Wow, see you for that.

816
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,580
 (upbeat music)

817
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,160
 (upbeat music)
