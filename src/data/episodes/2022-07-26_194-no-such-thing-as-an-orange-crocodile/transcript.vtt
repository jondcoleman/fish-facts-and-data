00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
 (ding, ding, ding, ding)

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.660
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.500
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.320
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.120
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Mottagon!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.680
 - My name is Dan Schreiber

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.680
 Drew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.400
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.560
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.920
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1766,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.320
 there was a cheese riot in Nottingham,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 where the mayor of Nottingham was knocked over by a large cheese.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.880
 (audience laughing)

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.200
 - So was the cheese rioting?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.440
 (laughing)

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.400
 How did that work?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.840
 - So what it was is, I mean, I'm preaching to people

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.440
 who know all about this in Nottingham, I'm sure.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.200
 But this was a goosefair, you all know what the goosefair is, right?

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000
 (audience cheering)

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.440
 And basically, things became tense when some rude lads

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.040
 engage several Lincolnshire traders

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 who had purchased up to 60 hundred of cheese.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.840
 These aren't my words, by the way, I'm reading.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 (audience laughing)

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 And basically, what they didn't want to happen

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.160
 is that those nasty people from Lincolnshire

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.240
 come and get all the cheese

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.880
 and then there's no cheese for people from Nottingham.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.920
 So then that kind of started a bit of a riot

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.160
 and then suddenly there were crowds running around,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.440
 they were grabbing cheeses and rolling them down the streets.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.360
 So they're not like little baby bells

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.120
 or slices of cheese like you get now.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.160
 They're big wheels of cheese, right?

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
 - Although if you released a lot of baby bells,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.920
 that could knock someone over underfoot

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.000
 by making the ground slippery on the likes.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.840
 - Sure, yeah.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.720
 - I haven't thought about this before, but I feel as if I have.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.600
 (audience laughing)

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.920
 - And basically, after that, everything kind of kicked off.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.760
 So a lot of people went down the river trends

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 to search for warehouses looking for more cheese.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.400
 (audience laughing)

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.440
 The next day, a guy was shot by a soldier.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.560
 He was trying to defend his cheese.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.200
 I still think too soon, actually, for that.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.440
 (audience laughing)

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.160
 But actually, the soldiers were on his side.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 It was like a friendly fire thing.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 And then the whole thing came to an end

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.640
 when the mob tried and failed to burn down a windmill.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.640
 - Ah.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 - And the mayor himself, a cheese what rolled towards him.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.960
 - Well, he was coming to try and calm things down

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.280
 and basically someone chucked a cheese at him.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.120
 - All right.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.960
 - Oh, chucked a cheese, okay, cool.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.400
 - But then it knocked him over.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
 - Knocked him over, mate.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.400
 - Was he quite a small man?

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 - Sounds like he was a small man.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.360
 - I don't know how big he was.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.200
 It was the olden days.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.040
 They were all small.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.360
 - They were all small, yeah.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.320
 - So maybe baby bells were massive to them.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.120
 (audience laughing)

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.720
 - It is an amazing bit of history,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.280
 which I had never heard of before.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.120
 - Yeah.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.960
 - Yeah.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.920
 - Did you guys already know about the cheese riot?

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.760
 - Yeah.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.440
 - Wait, wait, did anyone not know about the cheese riot?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.360
 - Ah, you see.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.840
 - Wow.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.800
 - And the cheese riot guys were lying, I think.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
 (audience laughing)

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.880
 Nottingham's got some cool food history.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.840
 So did you know that you guys have

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.240
 the Bramely Apple, great grandfather?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.400
 And a bunch of Japanese tourists, I think,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.760
 came to Nottingham about five years ago to visit it, didn't they?

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.840
 Because so this is the one Bramely Apple tree

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.520
 in Nottingham from which every single Bramely Apple comes.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.120
 And it's so popular now, that variety of Apple in Japan,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.480
 that the mayor of a town in Japan

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.720
 and all the people from his town flew over and visited it.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.560
 - Oh, look at you.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.560
 - He flew from his town.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.560
 (audience laughing)

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.080
 - They chartered 60 planes.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.520
 (audience laughing)

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.080
 A percentage of the people.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.600
 (audience laughing)

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.880
 - I have a couple of cheese facts.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.720
 - Oh yeah.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.960
 - His historical cheese facts.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.120
 - Go on, so the first Eurovision

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.800
 was a cheese competition in a sense.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.920
 And the phrase in a sense is doing a lot of work

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.280
 in that sentence, but there was a massive,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.200
 after Napoleon was defeated in 1815,

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 there was a massive, you know, Congress.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.560
 It was called the Congress of Vienna.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.800
 And it was working out the terms

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.600
 for all the nations in Europe and the terms of France's surrender.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.080
 And Talleyrand, one of the ministers there,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.120
 he said, why don't we lighten things up a bit

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.600
 with a cheese competition.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.760
 And every nation submitted their own cheeses.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.600
 - Who won?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.400
 - They all voted for their own cheeses.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640
 (audience laughing)

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.440
 So that's how it was like Eurovision, right?

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.840
 - They think you're France's special award for the Brie,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.640
 but they basically all said, "We think our cheese is best."

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.480
 - I don't know.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.480
 - I think you're not even sort of anything

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.120
 is that cheese contest don't lighten things up.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.600
 - They actually, my thing's turned pretty ugly.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.720
 I always, there's a sort of famous fact

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.800
 that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.240
 in a riot.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920
 So this is my favorite riot, I think.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.720
 - This is, sorry, this famous fact is famous

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.520
 amongst people like us, isn't it?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.040
 - Yeah, Masha, maybe it's not a famous outside of this stage.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.880
 Yeah, there's a fact that my favorite riot

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.640
 is that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.800
 And this isn't the 1600s, wasn't it?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.480
 And I always like that they ate their prime minister

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.240
 in order to replace him with an orange.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.480
 So this is when the orange dynasty came in.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.320
 - What?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.120
 - And so, not an actual orange, yes, sorry.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.000
 - Because that would've been so crazy

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.400
 because they should've just eaten the orange.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.800
 - Exactly, but that's kind of what it implies.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.200
 Anyway, eat William of Orange,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.640
 and leave Paul Johan de Wit,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.840
 who doesn't even have a name who sounds like food,

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.160
 to rule the country.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680
 - Just quickly, this is the first time I've been to nodding him.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.120
 I was unbelievably excited to discover

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.920
 that you guys have a sheriff's still.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.560
 I mean, that is...

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.560
 - That's so cool.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560
 And I didn't know this, looking into him.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.800
 He was born on Robin Hood Street.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.840
 The current sheriff on Nottingham

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.120
 was born on Robin Hood Street.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.480
 - Another Nottingham fact, you have a lot of caves here.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.080
 (audience cheering)

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.920
 We have...

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.240
 (laughing)

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.080
 - Yeah.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.400
 - It's the Truggler Dite Surin!

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.840
 (laughing)

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.840
 - There are over 700 caves under the streets of Nottingham,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.360
 and the man who's in charge of cataloging them,

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.440
 he had to have confined space training

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.800
 before he could do his job.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.160
 And his name is Mr. Dave Strange Walker.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.040
 (audience cheering)

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.480
 I have another fact about cheese and caves.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.320
 - No.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.240
 - Yes, genuinely.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.360
 So, in the 1980s, America had a 30 million pound

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.840
 stockpile of cheese in a cave.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.120
 There was a massive cheese surplus in America,

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.400
 'cause they had over-produced it,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.320
 and they stored it all in caves in Missouri.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.080
 It was worth, by 1983, it was worth $4 billion.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.520
 And the thing is, it's still happening.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 It's still a massive dairy surplus in America.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.920
 And there's this shadowy body called dairy management,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.520
 which is desperate to get.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.360
 It's not bad.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.200
 - And a big cheese.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.040
 - A big cheese!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.040
 (audience laughing)

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.720
 (audience applauding)

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.360
 They're genuinely other, 'cause, for example,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.600
 they're constantly trying to push more cheese onto people.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.120
 So, for example, they help dominoes,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.320
 the pizza company, develop a line of pizzas

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.160
 which had 40% more cheese.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.440
 And then they lobbied McDonald's,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.720
 and they said, "Why don't you put some more cheese

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.400
 "on the cheeseburgers, go on."

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.600
 - Wow, that's amazing.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.040
 The first time the word mammoth was used

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.800
 to describe something big was about a cheese.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.640
 - Really?

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.480
 - Yeah.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.560
 - Prior to the actual mammoth,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.880
 it was a description of a cheese.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.160
 - Well, actually, they called the mammoth's mammoths

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.000
 whether they were big or not.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.320
 So, even if you had a small mammoth,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.240
 it was still called the mammoth.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.920
 - But you were--

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.880
 - They never before had referred to a mammoth mammoth

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.760
 until they referred to a mammoth cheese,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.840
 is what James is saying.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.000
 - So, the word mammoth meaning this is massive.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.840
 - Yeah.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.880
 - That was a cheese first.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:44.720
 - That was a cheese first?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.880
 - Yeah, and then they saw a mammoth,

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.920
 and they're like, "That's like that cheese we saw."

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.320
 (audience laughing)

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.720
 - You still don't have got the idea.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.400
 (laughing)

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.920
 - It was a famous cheese, you know about it,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.760
 and I don't know you.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.600
 - Yeah, I think we talked about it.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.080
 - It was a presidential cheese, right?

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.760
 Which president was it that it was given to?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.600
 - Jefferson.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.440
 - It was Jefferson that it was given to.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.280
 - Yeah, and what it was is at the time,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.880
 they just found mastodon skeletons in America

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.960
 in the far west.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.920
 And they didn't know, they thought maybe

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.600
 there were massive mammoths living over there,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.600
 so it was a big kind of mammoth frenzy

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.920
 in America at the time.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.400
 And then they also gave him this cheese

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.280
 and thought, "What does that remind us of?"

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.960
 Those things that don't exist.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.800
 (audience laughing)

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.920
 - Of course.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.520
 I have a favorite animal-related riot.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.120
 - Okay, thank you.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.280
 - Do you guys know about the eel-pulling riot?

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.560
 - No. - No.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.920
 - This was in 1886 in Amsterdam,

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.000
 and there used to be this tradition where you'd hang an eel.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.080
 I don't even know what it was suspended of above,

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.240
 but you'd hang an eel above the canals in Amsterdam,

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.120
 and there would be a live eel and it'd be riding around.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.840
 And the point was you had to sail under it on your boat,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.520
 or not motor on it,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.480
 under it probably, but go under it on your boat.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.080
 And you had to jump up and try and catch the eel,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.080
 and most people fell in the water.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.560
 And it was quite comical, and it sounds quite fun.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.360
 And it was banned 'cause it was deemed cruel to animals,

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.440
 which is very forward-thinking

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.520
 for the 1886 people.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.520
 And people were so angry about the crackdown,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.400
 'cause they loved eel-pulling so much that they completely rioted,

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.440
 and 26 people were killed in 1886 in Amsterdam,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.520
 because they demanded to have the eel-pulling,

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.000
 but the eel survived apparently.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
 - That's incredible.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.080
 Have you guys heard about the police riots?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.080
 This is the thing that happened in New York in the 1850s.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.120
 These are so cool.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.400
 There was a time in the 1850s in New York,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.160
 where there were two rival police forces in New York.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.520
 What could go wrong?

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.120
 Everything went wrong.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.640
 The state had created a police force,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.600
 and that was an official one,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.840
 but the mayor, who was from the other political party,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.440
 had his own police force already established,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.840
 and the state was trying to take over it.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.560
 And what they started doing, the two forces,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.840
 they started stealing criminals from each other.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.080
 (laughing)

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.880
 So they would arrest someone,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.480
 and then the other police would turn up and say,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.320
 "We're having him."

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.040
 And then the police would start beating each other up

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.840
 to try and arrest the criminal.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.640
 - But then presumably they have to arrest each other

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.120
 for beating each other up.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.960
 - They would.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.280
 And then the whole thing eventually ended up

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.920
 in a massive brawl between 850 police officers.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.760
 - Wow.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.800
 - All the way through the city hall.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:07.640
 - Wow.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.480
 - Yeah.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.960
 - You know, Toronto was shaped,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.640
 but sort of Toronto policing was shaped

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.840
 by a riot between clowns and firemen.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.360
 So, well, there was this riot in 1855

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.400
 when clowns were a bit more hardcore,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.200
 and it took place in a brothel,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.800
 as I think quite a lot of riots did.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.600
 - What were the clowns in the brothel?

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.800
 - They were all in the brothel.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800
 - They were all in the brothel.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.640
 - They were all in the brothel.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640
 - They'd taken their noses off.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.040
 It was, they weren't on the job at the time.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.240
 - They were on a job, but they weren't on the job.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.440
 (audience laughing)

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440
 - And the, yeah.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.440
 - I'm afraid it will be extra to smell your flour, so.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.440
 (audience laughing)

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.000
 - Ooh, big feet, you know what they say?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 (audience laughing)

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.240
 - So, that happened and then the firefighters turned up,

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.920
 and then this fight broke out.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.880
 I don't know what was arriving over,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.760
 but the firefighters just started on the clowns.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.320
 The clowns had just come to town,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.240
 so they were using their prostitutes, maybe.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.040
 And this huge fight broke out,

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:10.880
 and a policeman came to break up the whole Malay,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.960
 and it ended up with a lot of people

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.360
 being really badly injured.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.680
 And I think actually they went and met again

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.160
 a couple of days later, so they established this rivalry,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.600
 like the Jets and the Sharks and West Side Story,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.120
 and so they agreed to meet a couple of days later,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.480
 and the clowns and the firemen met again,

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.760
 and then a fight started because of firemen

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.920
 knocked a hat off a clown's head,

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.600
 and everyone got wounded.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.120
 And because of that, the police force was regulated,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.840
 and rules were introduced as to how you put down a riot,

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.000
 and how you don't let things get out of hand.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.640
 And those rules still remain today.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.480
 - Do you know what the good thing

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.240
 about arresting a bunch of clowns is?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.000
 You don't need as many police cars,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
 because you can at least 20 into each.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.880
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.960
 - My fact is that Baby Robbins sometimes eats

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.680
 so many caterpillars they turn green.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.000
 This happens.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.320
 There's a new book out called The Robin Abography.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.320
 It's by a guy called Stephen Moss, a pro-priot.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.960
 - Oh. - Isch.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.360
 - They turn green. - Oh, yeah.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.720
 - You know what I'm saying? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.720
 - Moss is green.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.680
 - It can be like brown sometimes.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.520
 - Yeah.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.400
 - Well, they turn green, because they eat a lot of caterpillars,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.840
 and the caterpillars are green,

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.200
 and so they just change colour.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.680
 - Not all caterpillars are green.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.320
 Do they turn whatever colour the caterpillar is?

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.880
 - This fact has been pedanted.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.360
 - I'll give you a good fact about Robbins turning green.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.040
 - Is it just the breast that goes green,

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.960
 or is it the whole Robin? - I don't know.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.600
 - Wait, you didn't even look at a photo of your fact.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.840
 - It's very hard to find a photo of a green Robin.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.840
 - So spacious. - Very suspicious.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.240
 - Although Baby Robbins don't have red breasts today.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.720
 - I don't know. - So red breasts are the sign

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.000
 that you're ready to fight.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.320
 So I think Robbins are really famous

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.120
 for being very pugnacious, aren't they?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.160
 They, you know, anyone comes near their territory,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.040
 they sing that beautiful song, which means get the fuck out of here,

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.480
 and they have that big red breast,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.000
 which means get the fuck out of here.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.880
 And so Baby Robbins for their first sort of year,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.000
 they don't have red breasts,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.360
 because that's sort of an invitation to fight.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.040
 It's something you display when you're ready

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.640
 to, you know, get in the boxing ring.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.560
 - Yeah, it's true, because Robbins will attack anything

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.640
 that's red, won't they?

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.360
 If you just give them a little bit of red cloth

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.400
 or something, like a tiger's bullfight.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.560
 - It's so cool. (laughing)

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.840
 - Do they really?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.120
 - Yeah, they do.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.960
 - I'll leave!

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.400
 - They do, they do die so much.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.400
 They murder each other a lot.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.080
 They'll pack each other at the base of the skull

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.800
 to break each other's spinal cords.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.200
 - They're vicious bastards.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200
 - Yeah, they are.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.600
 - I didn't notice.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.960
 Red breast, Robyn red breast, red breast,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.200
 is their surname.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.040
 - Well...

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.880
 (laughing)

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880
 - Explain yourself.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.880
 - Okay, in the 15th century, they used to give human names

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.440
 to familiar species.

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.840
 So it was a red breast, but then there would be like,

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840
 Robyn, how you do it?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.280
 It's a Robyn red breast, so red breast is a surname.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.440
 And red breast, it shouldn't be red breast,

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.240
 it should be Robyn orange breast

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.680
 because they have orange breast.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.560
 - Well, you haven't, sorry.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:18.880
 You just, the fiddled us with changing red to orange

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.000
 and going down that line.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.840
 - Yeah.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.160
 - So are you saying that they used to call birds?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.000
 - Yeah.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.840
 - That's true, actually.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.960
 Like, I think one of them's Mavis, isn't it?

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.520
 Like, is it a thrush or something?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.360
 They call Mavis in no place.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.200
 - Really?

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.200
 And Robyn is the only Christian human name

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.120
 that stuck around in the species name.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.880
 - I think that's right, Robyn red breast.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.760
 Mavis thrush, that was how...

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.240
 (laughing)

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.840
 But then what you're saying, actually,

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.080
 the other bit is quite true as well,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.520
 which is that they don't have red breasts.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.080
 They have orange breasts, but back then in the 15th century,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.480
 we didn't have the word red amazingly.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.480
 We just didn't have the word.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.640
 So they said that's orange

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.440
 'cause that's what they associated as they lumped in to...

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.240
 - We didn't have the word orange.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.720
 That's why we called them red.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.120
 (laughing)

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.640
 'Cause we did have the word red.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.200
 - Usually, I can save that in the edit,

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.320
 but I think it might work.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.840
 (laughing)

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.680
 - Yeah, no.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.280
 So the opposite of what I said is true.

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.640
 (laughing)

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.800
 - You know, they measure the size of the red/orange part

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.160
 of Robin's breast, 'cause scientists wanted to know

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.840
 whether they grow or shrink,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.880
 or whether they're particularly big when they're trying to mate.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.720
 And you know how they do this?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.120
 It's kind of sweet.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.040
 So this is a study in Spain that was done a couple of years ago.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.240
 And they catch the robins.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.120
 And in the study report, it said,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.480
 "We placed it gently on its back on a table."

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.520
 And I imagine then tied it down,

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.600
 'cause I don't think your Robin lies

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.480
 on its back on a table unless you do.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.880
 And then they get a bit of tracing paper,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.920
 and they just put it around the front of the Robin,

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.640
 and they trace around the red bit through it.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.120
 And then they measured all the bits,

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.240
 and they deduce the male red breast

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.840
 get bigger with age and females, don't.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.680
 So that's basic science.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.880
 You could do that in science class.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.840
 - That's really cool.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840
 - Yeah.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.480
 - Do you know robins go through puberty every year?

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.320
 - Every year.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.200
 - Every year, imagine that.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.040
 - Wow.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.520
 - So towards the summer when the days get longer,

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.960
 their brains get flooded with hormones,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.480
 their gonads grow,

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.040
 and the males start learning songs to kind of attract women,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.040
 not women.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.000
 (audience laughs)

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.320
 Sorry, I was going back to my old papers and I was like,

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.480
 (audience laughs)

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.000
 And then in the winter, they go back down again,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.960
 the gonads shrink, and their hormones flush out the system,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.640
 and then every summer they get this puberty.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.480
 - God.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.320
 - It's amazing, isn't it?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.680
 - I mean, women get that once a month,

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.760
 so I might still be able to make some sense too,

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.320
 but I'm still most anywhere, apparently.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:51.240
 So they'll pick any nesting site,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.920
 and I was reading a review of a book

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.040
 in the telegraph about robins that listed

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.000
 a series of nesting sites that they'd made.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.080
 So plant pots, a pigeonhole, and a desk,

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.080
 the engine of a World War II plane,

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.200
 in the body of a dead cat.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.160
 - Well, that took a real turn, Anna.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.320
 (audience laughs)

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:13.320
 That was really sweet.

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:14.800
 Right till the end.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.440
 - That was a sweet revenge, I think.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.640
 And then there was one that made its nest on an unmade bed,

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.120
 while the bed's owner was downstairs having breakfast,

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.040
 and the owner came upstairs again and thought,

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.040
 "That's sweet," and allowed it to nest there,

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.520
 and incubate its eggs.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.400
 And it didn't tell me this article,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.360
 what the owner slept on for the subsequent however long it takes.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.120
 - I think he slept in a dead cat.

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:38.680
 (audience laughs)

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.000
 - I was looking at what would happen,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.040
 whether caterpillars can change color for meeting things.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.080
 Okay, I just thought there might be something out there.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.480
 And I found the paper on the internet called,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.080
 "The Effects of Blue Die in the Food of Caterpillar Species

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.840
 "of Vanessa Caduay."

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.960
 I couldn't quite find out which paper this was from,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.240
 but it's genuinely there.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.760
 And they said, "Our experiment had lots of problems."

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.480
 First, we did not record all our results correctly.

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.480
 (audience laughs)

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.200
 So what they wanted to do, they wanted to check

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.200
 whether the caterpillars, when they had the blue die,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.520
 whether they'd be blue when they became butterflies.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.560
 So first, they did not record all of those results correctly.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.160
 Next, we miscalculated the number of dead butterflies

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.440
 at each group.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.400
 Then we mixed up all the labels.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.400
 (audience laughs)

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:33.280
 Next, some of our butterflies fell off their cups,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.080
 and then one of our group members knocked over the bin

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.400
 for the control group.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.840
 (audience laughs)

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.600
 And then it said, "All of these mistakes affected our results

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.440
 in some way."

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.520
 (audience laughs)

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.920
 I read about a animal.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.680
 It's a really odd thing.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.600
 It's a cave dwelling crocodile,

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.960
 which crocodiles don't dwell in caves.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:55.520
 So this was quite a big finding,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.920
 and they were studying them for ages

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.720
 'cause they couldn't work out why they were doing it.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.480
 And the thing that really stuck out about them

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.360
 was that they were bright orange,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.880
 and crocodiles are not bright orange.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.560
 So they were like, "Oh, that's two things we need to look at now."

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.160
 And the orange thing that they couldn't work out for ages,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.280
 it turns out that there were bats living inside the cave,

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.920
 and they would poo into the cave water

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.280
 where the crocodiles were,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.880
 and these crocodiles were being dyed orange by bat poo.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:22.920
 But it was like in the water,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.040
 and then the water was dying.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.120
 It was like going into like one of those T-shirt tie dye things,

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.440
 and it was just, yeah, it just dyed them.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.040
 And so for a while, we had this mysterious orange crocodile,

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.760
 but it turns out they're just covered in shit.

00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.280
 (audience laughs)

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.520
 Have you guys seen waxwing birds, like cedar wax wings?

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.040
 So they're these birds that they have

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:45.440
 really brightly colored yellow tips on their tails

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.240
 and on some of their feathers.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.480
 And so they've had this forever and ever as long as we know.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.480
 And then there's a cedar waxwing that lives in North America,

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:56.480
 which has this really bright yellow tip of its tail.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.400
 And in the last 50 years, it's suddenly been turning red.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.080
 And this is because a bunch of Asian honey suckle

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.600
 has been brought into North America,

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.560
 and it has these bright red berries,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.680
 and they eat these really, really red berries.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.080
 And it's changing the color of them.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.320
 So the cedar waxwing is changing color as a species

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.920
 because it's eating all these red berries.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.520
 That is amazing.

00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:19.600
 Imagine.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.600
 Well, the orange crocodile didn't do anything for you.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.520
 No, it was good.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.920
 I was just imagine they've humans all started

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.520
 drinking sunny delight or something.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.760
 Yes, exactly.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:29.960
 And that happens. It does happen.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.160
 So babies sometimes turn orange if they have too much,

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.480
 is it keratin in the system?

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.320
 Yeah, too many keratin, too much orange juice,

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.720
 and your baby will turn orange.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.560
 Yeah.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.960
 I've just had a baby.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.960
 I don't believe that.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.400
 I feel an experiment coming on.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.800
 I just know what the report's going to read like afterwards.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800
 Firstly, we mixed up all the babies.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:55.640
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.240
 And that is my fact.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.640
 My fact this week is that the Russian Communist leader,

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:06.080
 Vladimir Lenin, spoke with an Irish accent.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.120
 OK.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.920
 Oh, the Russian Communist leader, Vladimir Lenin.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.840
 So I think we need to specify that this

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.880
 is not him speaking Russian in an Irish accent.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.560
 No, no.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.800
 It's when he spoke English.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.520
 He was taught by an Irish tutor and the way that he spoke.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:22.240
 He just carried.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.600
 So whenever people spoke to him--

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.440
 How do we know that this is true?

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:30.160
 Like, is there a recording of him by singing "Danny Boy" or something?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.840
 The Russians have admitted to it.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.960
 They said that this was--

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.840
 It's not a crime to speak with an Irish accent, Dan.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.800
 It's weird, because the Russians admit to so little.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.040
 Yeah, they were willing to give this away.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:42.520
 Yeah, I was a terrible investigative journalist

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.880
 when I was going-- Did you do the hacking?

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.480
 No, OK.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.360
 The accent thing?

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.720
 Yes, great.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.880
 I'm out of here.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.640
 No, he was taught-- we also know it because H.G. Wells met him.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.160
 And they had a conversation.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.680
 And he came away going, that was the weirdest conversation,

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.400
 because I was talking to an Irishman,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.400
 but it was Russian Communist leader.

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.160
 Vladimir was his name--

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:05.360
 Lenin.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.600
 Well, apparently Lenin spoke with what's

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.440
 called a "Rathmines" accent.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.120
 And "Rathmines", apparently, I've never heard of it,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.520
 is in particular area of Dublin.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.640
 And he had an accent from this area.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:17.680
 And it meant that not only would people in England

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.920
 have struggled to understand him, but people in Ireland

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.800
 would have struggled to understand him.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.240
 Did you guys know that the posh--

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.480
 you know the posh American accent that's

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.840
 in all the Hollywood films of the '20s and '30s

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.000
 at the Catherine Hepburn classic icon impersonated,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.120
 but imagine Catherine Hepburn in a film

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.160
 or Bet Davis or someone?

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.240
 That posh American accent is not an accent.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.640
 So no one real had that accent.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.120
 That was an accent that was created for Hollywood.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:52.280
 So that kind of American English hybrid of the '20s, '30s, '40s.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.480
 And then it was suddenly phased out in the '50s

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.200
 when they thought it was a bit weird.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.960
 Was they got accent coaches in to train people

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.960
 to speak like that?

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.120
 And they thought it would make them sound more educated,

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.760
 because it had that English vibe.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.800
 And the only people who spoke with that voice

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.920
 were Hollywood actresses and actresses.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.920
 That is amazing.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920
 It's weird, isn't it?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.760
 It's really weird.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.760
 Yeah.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.600
 Is that-- so as in, when you then heard

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.840
 their real voice in real life, it was completely different?

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.680
 Yeah.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.240
 I mean, I think they got voice coaches

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.600
 to teach them how to just speak like that, really.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.520
 But yeah.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.880
 So I read Eva Green.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.920
 Do you remember she was the--

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.240
 she was in the Casina Royal reboot with Daniel Craig, James Bond.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.400
 She's French.

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.960
 And when she did all the interview--

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.480
 and I didn't know that when I saw the movie,

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.520
 because she did it with a British accent.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.280
 But in the interviews, she thought

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.440
 that people are just going to be so bothered by the fact

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.840
 that I have a French accent.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.440
 She did all her publicity in the English accent

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:46.960
 that she did with the movie.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.520
 And it was really, really convincing.

00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.160
 Yeah.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.760
 You wouldn't know.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.560
 Or did you notice in--

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.440
 Well, no, I was the same with Dick Van Dyke, actually.

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:57.200
 Yeah.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.720
 Poor Dick Van Dyke.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.840
 Last year, he apologized for the accent

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:01.960
 for the first time ever.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.920
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry, though.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.120
 He, by the way, he was in the news a few years ago,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.800
 because he loved Dick Van Dyke, and he fell asleep on his surfboard,

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.520
 and he got carried out into the ocean.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.200
 What is surfboard?

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.880
 Yeah, that is a relaxed surfer.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.760
 Yeah, and he woke up, and he was in the middle of the ocean,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.120
 and he was being carried by currency.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.120
 He didn't know where he was.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.320
 And he said a bunch of porpoises came up,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.400
 and they guided him back to shore.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.840
 And otherwise, we would have no more Dick Van Dyke.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.360
 He would have gone off into the ocean.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.720
 Guys, on accents.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.600
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.000
 Do you know Paddy Ashtown, former Lib Dem leader?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
 Yes.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.840
 Do you know what his name was?

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.600
 Patrick Ashtown?

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.440
 Yeah, so his name-- it's not a funny name.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.840
 His name's Jeremy.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:48.880
 But he was Irish, and the reason we call him Paddy Ashtown

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.240
 is that he went to boarding school in England,

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.920
 and everyone called him Paddy, because he had an Irish accent.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920
 No.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.240
 And he said, I just feel comfortable with Paddy now.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.680
 Isn't that bizarre?

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.960
 And he openly embraced it.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.280
 And I suppose it was a different time,

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.840
 but Paddy Ashtown is Jeremy Ashtown,

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.680
 where it not for xenophobia.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.800
 Wow.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.120
 Well, on that, so there was a study in 2015

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.200
 on the way people perceive different accents,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.280
 because obviously there are dozens of accents all over the UK,

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.280
 and they have different perceptions that come with them.

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.720
 There was a study that perceived intelligence

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.000
 that found that the Birmingham accent--

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.040
 this is very unfair, but it found that the Birmingham accent

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.720
 was so low-rated in the study that it ranked worse

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.320
 than staying completely silent.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:47.040
 Do you remember how this fact was about Lenin?

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040
 Yeah.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.440
 Did you know Lenin's body is still hanging around and barmed,

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.360
 looking exactly like he does.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.720
 So Lenin's body is there, but he was sort of the first instance

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.240
 of that kind of embalming to make bodies look exactly

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.400
 like they have look for a friend of them.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.400
 So pre-Malsytong.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.400
 Yes, yeah, pre-all of those.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.400
 And so now, all other countries who

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.320
 want to embalm their great leaders,

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.680
 like Ho Chi Minh, for instance, and in North Korea,

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.360
 Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, they've all been embalmed,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.440
 and they get sent to Russia periodically

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.240
 in order to be professionally maintained.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.760
 You're kidding.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.760
 Is that so good at it?

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 They don't bring the people there.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.520
 They physically quit.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.240
 No, apparently they get sent to Russia.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.560
 So I certainly know that Ho Chi Minh is sent to Russia

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.400
 every few years to get maintained,

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.720
 because they're so good at keeping them.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.960
 Imagine the Christmas party at that place.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.080
 When you've got Ho Chi Minh there, Lenin here.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.960
 There's a lot of good Instagram photos out there.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.680
 That's all I'm saying.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.120
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the evening.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.160
 And that is Anachasensky.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.760
 Yes, my fact is that in Japan, if you make a mistake at work,

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.480
 you can hire someone to get told off by your boss

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.160
 so you don't have to.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.640
 This is so weird.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.760
 I read this incredible article in the Atlantic,

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:08.000
 and it was interviewing someone who,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.560
 what's their company called, Family Romance.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.960
 And the idea is that you fill the gaps in people's lives.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.720
 People's personal lives, people's lives, generally,

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.960
 that need filling.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.280
 And so in this instance, he said he sometimes

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.320
 gets hired out to people who salary men.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.240
 And in Japan, that's quite a big thing.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.000
 People work for big corporations.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.200
 It's quite faceless.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.280
 Sometimes they don't necessarily know their bosses.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.920
 And then they make a massive mistake,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.480
 and they're sent to the boss to get told off.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.040
 And the boss doesn't know who they are.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.480
 And at this point, this man gets hired.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.440
 And he has to go into the boss instead

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.680
 and say, I'm so sorry.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.360
 I did that.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.240
 How embarrassing.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.360
 And he says in this article, he says,

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.800
 do you know how we apologize?

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.400
 We have to get down on our hands and knees on the floor.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.240
 And really say, I'm so, so sorry.

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.200
 Well, the boss holds abuse of us.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.040
 And he's paid to do this, so the other boss doesn't have to.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.040
 Is there ever a scenario where like five people are being told off,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.640
 but that one guy's been hired for every single hour?

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.160
 And so he's like, you're crap.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.280
 Get out of here, send the next guy in.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.080
 Same guy comes back in here.

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.320
 A series of novelty hats.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.960
 Send in the guy with a sombrero outside.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.640
 I'm furious.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.240
 That interview is unbelievable.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.360
 There's firm family romance.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.880
 So the man who founded the company,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.440
 his name is Ishi Yuichi.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.040
 And he is acting.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.080
 His first success was playing a father

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.800
 for a girl who had a single mother,

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.640
 and the mother wanted the girl to grow up

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.320
 with a father figure in her life.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.720
 So he has been playing the father of this girl for eight years.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.560
 She doesn't know it.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:40.000
 She doesn't know that this man is not her father.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.080
 And he says, if the client never reveals the truth,

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.840
 I must continue the role indefinitely.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:44.920
 If the daughter gets married,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.240
 I have to be a father in the wedding.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:48.000
 And then I have to be the grandfather.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.680
 And he, this is, it's a gig for life he's got now.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.920
 He's committed to the job.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.960
 You've got to say that for him.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.000
 It is amazing.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.960
 Like, yeah, Andy and I have read it and do read it.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.080
 But one other thing he does that I think is quite funny

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.520
 is that he is hired by wives to apologize to their husbands

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.080
 for having an affair with the wife.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.440
 When the real person who had an affair with the wife

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.120
 has run away.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.720
 So when the husband finds out that the wife's having an affair,

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.920
 quite often, the other guy says, OK, well, I'm out of here.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.880
 And so she'll hire someone to go and apologize to him.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.360
 And he says his tactic there is that he

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.680
 goes pretending to be this man who's been shagging the wife.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.480
 And he goes and he meets the husband.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:33.400
 And he bows very deeply.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.200
 And he apologizes very profusely.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.440
 But also, he dresses and acts like a yakuza,

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.880
 as in a Japanese gangster.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.800
 And so he says the husband accepts the apology quite quickly,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.840
 because otherwise, he may kill him.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.480
 That's the technique there.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.600
 That's-- but don't yakuza only have four fingers?

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.400
 He's a good actor.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.320
 He can act only having four fingers.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.080
 So there's another thing.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.520
 Christian weddings are really popular,

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.680
 as in white weddings, as we know them in Britain.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.200
 And 99% of the Christian weddings that they have there are fake.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.360
 So if you're a Westerner in Japan,

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.440
 it's often an easy acting gig to pretend

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.240
 to be a priest for a couple of hours,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240
 conduct a wedding ceremony.

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.800
 You're not a priest.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.360
 You don't know any clerical rituals or anything like that.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.840
 They happen in a fake chapel.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.240
 And it's often just English teachers from the West

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.760
 making a bit of money on the side.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.680
 Everyone kind of knows his fate, but everyone goes along with it,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.000
 because they like the ritual.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.400
 Wait, so people aren't getting married in the ceremony?

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.000
 It's not legally binding, it's, but it

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
 is what people do for their wedding.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.640
 So you would also have the kind of registry office thing.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.800
 I think they have a registry office thing.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.640
 But the actual-- yeah, they're sort of big ceremony

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:42.160
 a bit.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.480
 One account from one of these guys who conducted--

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.440
 I think he said he conducted about 900 weddings over the decade.

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.800
 I know.

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.160
 He recorded his first-ever wedding rehearsal that he'd done.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.640
 And he showed it to his wife, who I think was Japanese.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.760
 And she looked at him conducting a ceremony

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.280
 and speaking in Japanese to the couple.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.080
 And she said, well, it was good.

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.840
 But you made one big mistake.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.400
 Instead of saying, you may now exchange rings.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.640
 You said, put the ring in her crotch.

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:17.160
 So if you can't afford this guy to--

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.320
 when you're at work, to be told off for you.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.880
 And there's a cheaper version.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.720
 For about $65 equivalent, you can hire in Japan

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.120
 an attractive man to come to your workplace

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.600
 and gently brush away your tears while you weep.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:36.640
 The company's called Hanson Weeping Boys.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.720
 And also, in China, there's a big thing at the moment

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.520
 with the Uber economy kind of thing.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.840
 So you can kind of get part-time use of washing machines,

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.600
 basket bowls, umbrellas.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.280
 There was an umbrella sharing company.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.800
 In fact, that's in our book, isn't it?

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.320
 Yeah.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.320
 They lost all 300,000 umbrellas straight away

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.840
 when they rented them out and forgot

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.360
 to put a tracking system on them and no one returned.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.960
 Actually, in China, there was the case

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.200
 this year of a man who got married, had his wedding.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.840
 And then was arrested because it turned out

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.960
 he'd hired 200 guests to pretend to be his friends at his wedding.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.440
 And apparently, the bride and her family

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.160
 became suspicious when none of them could explain how they knew him.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.960
 So they were obviously on a very low wage.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.640
 I think they were being paid the equivalent of nine pounds each.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.440
 So they hadn't been given a backstory or anything.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.320
 So the bride just came up and said, "How do you know this guy?"

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.960
 And they said, "I don't know, I'm being paid to do this."

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.120
 But yeah, that one, he was arrested.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.280
 And the happy ending to that story

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.120
 is that he claimed he was 27.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.120
 And it turned out he was 20.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.800
 And in China, I didn't realize this.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.360
 The minimum age at which you can legally marry as a man is 22.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.000
 - Really? - And yeah, I know.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.440
 I have no idea.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.440
 So yeah, not valid.

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.720
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.400
 So anything before we do?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.240
 A Japanese thing.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.840
 There's Japanese word called new hara, which

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.200
 means noodle harassment.

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.200
 And that refers to the hassle that some people

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.800
 get for slurping their noodles too loudly.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.280
 This is a big thing in Japan at the moment.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.360
 Apparently, I'll call into the internet.

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:17.320
 And someone has managed to deal with it

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.600
 by inventing a musical spoon.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.480
 So basically, you have a musical spoon.

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.720
 It plays loads of music, and no one can hear you slurping

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.880
 your noodles.

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.240
 Oh, no, that's not much more annoying.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.640
 Yeah, what does it sing?

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.520
 [CHEERING]

00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.320
 Nice.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.800
 Well, OK, speaking of our theme tune, we must wrap up.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:40.960
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.760
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.400

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.880
 of this podcast, you can find me on @Sriberland.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.720

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.400
 Andrew Hunter M. James.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.400
 James Harkin.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.400
 And Anna.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.520
 You can email podcast@ky.com.

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.240
 Yep, or you can go to our group account at no such thing

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:57.680
 on Twitter.

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.080
 You can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.560
 where we have links to our book, The Book of the Year.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.320
 It's out now, and we're going to give a copy away

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.000
 in a second to someone from our audience.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.240
 We've picked out our favorite fact that you guys sent.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.040
 Andy, what was the best fact?

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.920
 This one is from Sam Ward.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.480
 And it's that the Lichtenstein Football team's national stadium

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.600
 is only half in Lichtenstein.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.680
 The other half is in Switzerland.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.880
 So for 45 minutes every match, the Lichtenstein goalie

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.920
 invades Switzerland.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:31.040
 And who is that from?

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.400
 That's from Sam Ward.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.760
 Cool, come and collect your book at the end.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.640
 Guys, thank you so much for having us.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.480
 We're going to be out the back, as I said before.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.720
 We're going to be signing our book.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.440
 So they're on sale.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.800
 If you want to come say hi, please do anyway.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.920
 Thank you so much, guys.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.960
 We'll see you again.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.200
 Goodbye.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.960
