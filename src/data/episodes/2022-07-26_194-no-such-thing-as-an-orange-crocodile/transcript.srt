1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 (ding, ding, ding, ding)

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,500
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:14,320
 (ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,440
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,120
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish"

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,920
 a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Mottagon!

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,920
 (audience cheering)

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,680
 - My name is Dan Schreiber

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,360
 and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,680
 Drew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,400
 and once again, we have gathered around the microphones

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,200
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,560
 and in no particular order, here we go.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,920
 Starting with you, James Harkin.

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,000
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1766,

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
 there was a cheese riot in Nottingham,

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,960
 where the mayor of Nottingham was knocked over by a large cheese.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,880
 (audience laughing)

20
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,200
 - So was the cheese rioting?

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,440
 (laughing)

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
 How did that work?

23
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,840
 - So what it was is, I mean, I'm preaching to people

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,440
 who know all about this in Nottingham, I'm sure.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,200
 But this was a goosefair, you all know what the goosefair is, right?

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,000
 (audience cheering)

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,440
 And basically, things became tense when some rude lads

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,040
 engage several Lincolnshire traders

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,840
 who had purchased up to 60 hundred of cheese.

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
 These aren't my words, by the way, I'm reading.

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,320
 (audience laughing)

32
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,880
 And basically, what they didn't want to happen

33
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,160
 is that those nasty people from Lincolnshire

34
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,240
 come and get all the cheese

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
 and then there's no cheese for people from Nottingham.

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,920
 So then that kind of started a bit of a riot

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,160
 and then suddenly there were crowds running around,

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,440
 they were grabbing cheeses and rolling them down the streets.

39
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,360
 So they're not like little baby bells

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,120
 or slices of cheese like you get now.

41
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,160
 They're big wheels of cheese, right?

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,200
 - Although if you released a lot of baby bells,

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,920
 that could knock someone over underfoot

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,000
 by making the ground slippery on the likes.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,840
 - Sure, yeah.

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,720
 - I haven't thought about this before, but I feel as if I have.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,600
 (audience laughing)

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,920
 - And basically, after that, everything kind of kicked off.

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,760
 So a lot of people went down the river trends

50
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,480
 to search for warehouses looking for more cheese.

51
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,400
 (audience laughing)

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,440
 The next day, a guy was shot by a soldier.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,560
 He was trying to defend his cheese.

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,200
 I still think too soon, actually, for that.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,440
 (audience laughing)

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,160
 But actually, the soldiers were on his side.

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 It was like a friendly fire thing.

58
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,120
 And then the whole thing came to an end

59
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
 when the mob tried and failed to burn down a windmill.

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
 - Ah.

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,640
 - And the mayor himself, a cheese what rolled towards him.

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,960
 - Well, he was coming to try and calm things down

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,280
 and basically someone chucked a cheese at him.

64
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
 - All right.

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,960
 - Oh, chucked a cheese, okay, cool.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,400
 - But then it knocked him over.

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
 - Knocked him over, mate.

68
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
 - Was he quite a small man?

69
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
 - Sounds like he was a small man.

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
 - I don't know how big he was.

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
 It was the olden days.

72
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,040
 They were all small.

73
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,360
 - They were all small, yeah.

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,320
 - So maybe baby bells were massive to them.

75
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,120
 (audience laughing)

76
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,720
 - It is an amazing bit of history,

77
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,280
 which I had never heard of before.

78
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,120
 - Yeah.

79
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
 - Yeah.

80
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,920
 - Did you guys already know about the cheese riot?

81
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
 - Yeah.

82
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,440
 - Wait, wait, did anyone not know about the cheese riot?

83
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,360
 - Ah, you see.

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
 - Wow.

85
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,800
 - And the cheese riot guys were lying, I think.

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 (audience laughing)

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,880
 Nottingham's got some cool food history.

88
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,840
 So did you know that you guys have

89
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,240
 the Bramely Apple, great grandfather?

90
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
 And a bunch of Japanese tourists, I think,

91
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,760
 came to Nottingham about five years ago to visit it, didn't they?

92
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,840
 Because so this is the one Bramely Apple tree

93
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,520
 in Nottingham from which every single Bramely Apple comes.

94
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,120
 And it's so popular now, that variety of Apple in Japan,

95
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,480
 that the mayor of a town in Japan

96
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,720
 and all the people from his town flew over and visited it.

97
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,560
 - Oh, look at you.

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
 - He flew from his town.

99
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
 (audience laughing)

100
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,080
 - They chartered 60 planes.

101
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,520
 (audience laughing)

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,080
 A percentage of the people.

103
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,600
 (audience laughing)

104
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,880
 - I have a couple of cheese facts.

105
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,720
 - Oh yeah.

106
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,960
 - His historical cheese facts.

107
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,120
 - Go on, so the first Eurovision

108
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,800
 was a cheese competition in a sense.

109
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,920
 And the phrase in a sense is doing a lot of work

110
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,280
 in that sentence, but there was a massive,

111
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,200
 after Napoleon was defeated in 1815,

112
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
 there was a massive, you know, Congress.

113
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,560
 It was called the Congress of Vienna.

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,800
 And it was working out the terms

115
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,600
 for all the nations in Europe and the terms of France's surrender.

116
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,080
 And Talleyrand, one of the ministers there,

117
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,120
 he said, why don't we lighten things up a bit

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
 with a cheese competition.

119
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,760
 And every nation submitted their own cheeses.

120
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
 - Who won?

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,400
 - They all voted for their own cheeses.

122
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,640
 (audience laughing)

123
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,440
 So that's how it was like Eurovision, right?

124
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,840
 - They think you're France's special award for the Brie,

125
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,640
 but they basically all said, "We think our cheese is best."

126
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,480
 - I don't know.

127
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
 - I think you're not even sort of anything

128
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
 is that cheese contest don't lighten things up.

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,600
 - They actually, my thing's turned pretty ugly.

130
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
 I always, there's a sort of famous fact

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,800
 that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,240
 in a riot.

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
 So this is my favorite riot, I think.

134
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,720
 - This is, sorry, this famous fact is famous

135
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,520
 amongst people like us, isn't it?

136
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,040
 - Yeah, Masha, maybe it's not a famous outside of this stage.

137
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,880
 Yeah, there's a fact that my favorite riot

138
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,640
 is that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister.

139
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,800
 And this isn't the 1600s, wasn't it?

140
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
 And I always like that they ate their prime minister

141
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,240
 in order to replace him with an orange.

142
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,480
 So this is when the orange dynasty came in.

143
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
 - What?

144
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
 - And so, not an actual orange, yes, sorry.

145
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,000
 - Because that would've been so crazy

146
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
 because they should've just eaten the orange.

147
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
 - Exactly, but that's kind of what it implies.

148
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,200
 Anyway, eat William of Orange,

149
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,640
 and leave Paul Johan de Wit,

150
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,840
 who doesn't even have a name who sounds like food,

151
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,160
 to rule the country.

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,680
 - Just quickly, this is the first time I've been to nodding him.

153
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,120
 I was unbelievably excited to discover

154
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
 that you guys have a sheriff's still.

155
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,560
 I mean, that is...

156
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
 - That's so cool.

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
 And I didn't know this, looking into him.

158
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
 He was born on Robin Hood Street.

159
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,840
 The current sheriff on Nottingham

160
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,120
 was born on Robin Hood Street.

161
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,480
 - Another Nottingham fact, you have a lot of caves here.

162
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
 (audience cheering)

163
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,920
 We have...

164
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,240
 (laughing)

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,080
 - Yeah.

166
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,400
 - It's the Truggler Dite Surin!

167
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,840
 (laughing)

168
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,840
 - There are over 700 caves under the streets of Nottingham,

169
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,360
 and the man who's in charge of cataloging them,

170
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,440
 he had to have confined space training

171
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
 before he could do his job.

172
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,160
 And his name is Mr. Dave Strange Walker.

173
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,040
 (audience cheering)

174
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,480
 I have another fact about cheese and caves.

175
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,320
 - No.

176
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,240
 - Yes, genuinely.

177
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,360
 So, in the 1980s, America had a 30 million pound

178
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,840
 stockpile of cheese in a cave.

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,120
 There was a massive cheese surplus in America,

180
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
 'cause they had over-produced it,

181
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,320
 and they stored it all in caves in Missouri.

182
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,080
 It was worth, by 1983, it was worth $4 billion.

183
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,520
 And the thing is, it's still happening.

184
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
 It's still a massive dairy surplus in America.

185
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,920
 And there's this shadowy body called dairy management,

186
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,520
 which is desperate to get.

187
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,360
 It's not bad.

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
 - And a big cheese.

189
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,040
 - A big cheese!

190
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,040
 (audience laughing)

191
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
 (audience applauding)

192
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
 They're genuinely other, 'cause, for example,

193
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,600
 they're constantly trying to push more cheese onto people.

194
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,120
 So, for example, they help dominoes,

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,320
 the pizza company, develop a line of pizzas

196
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,160
 which had 40% more cheese.

197
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
 And then they lobbied McDonald's,

198
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,720
 and they said, "Why don't you put some more cheese

199
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,400
 "on the cheeseburgers, go on."

200
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,600
 - Wow, that's amazing.

201
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,040
 The first time the word mammoth was used

202
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,800
 to describe something big was about a cheese.

203
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,640
 - Really?

204
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,480
 - Yeah.

205
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,560
 - Prior to the actual mammoth,

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,880
 it was a description of a cheese.

207
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,160
 - Well, actually, they called the mammoth's mammoths

208
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
 whether they were big or not.

209
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,320
 So, even if you had a small mammoth,

210
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,240
 it was still called the mammoth.

211
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

212
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
 - But you were--

213
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,880
 - They never before had referred to a mammoth mammoth

214
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,760
 until they referred to a mammoth cheese,

215
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,840
 is what James is saying.

216
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,000
 - So, the word mammoth meaning this is massive.

217
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,840
 - Yeah.

218
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,880
 - That was a cheese first.

219
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,720
 - That was a cheese first?

220
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,880
 - Yeah, and then they saw a mammoth,

221
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,920
 and they're like, "That's like that cheese we saw."

222
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,320
 (audience laughing)

223
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,720
 - You still don't have got the idea.

224
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,400
 (laughing)

225
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,920
 - It was a famous cheese, you know about it,

226
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
 and I don't know you.

227
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,600
 - Yeah, I think we talked about it.

228
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,080
 - It was a presidential cheese, right?

229
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,760
 Which president was it that it was given to?

230
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,600
 - Jefferson.

231
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,440
 - It was Jefferson that it was given to.

232
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
 - Yeah, and what it was is at the time,

233
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,880
 they just found mastodon skeletons in America

234
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,960
 in the far west.

235
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,920
 And they didn't know, they thought maybe

236
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,600
 there were massive mammoths living over there,

237
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
 so it was a big kind of mammoth frenzy

238
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
 in America at the time.

239
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,400
 And then they also gave him this cheese

240
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
 and thought, "What does that remind us of?"

241
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
 Those things that don't exist.

242
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,800
 (audience laughing)

243
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
 - Of course.

244
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,520
 I have a favorite animal-related riot.

245
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,120
 - Okay, thank you.

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,280
 - Do you guys know about the eel-pulling riot?

247
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,560
 - No. - No.

248
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,920
 - This was in 1886 in Amsterdam,

249
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,000
 and there used to be this tradition where you'd hang an eel.

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,080
 I don't even know what it was suspended of above,

251
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,240
 but you'd hang an eel above the canals in Amsterdam,

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,120
 and there would be a live eel and it'd be riding around.

253
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,840
 And the point was you had to sail under it on your boat,

254
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,520
 or not motor on it,

255
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,480
 under it probably, but go under it on your boat.

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,080
 And you had to jump up and try and catch the eel,

257
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
 and most people fell in the water.

258
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,560
 And it was quite comical, and it sounds quite fun.

259
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,360
 And it was banned 'cause it was deemed cruel to animals,

260
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,440
 which is very forward-thinking

261
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,520
 for the 1886 people.

262
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,520
 And people were so angry about the crackdown,

263
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,400
 'cause they loved eel-pulling so much that they completely rioted,

264
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,440
 and 26 people were killed in 1886 in Amsterdam,

265
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,520
 because they demanded to have the eel-pulling,

266
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,000
 but the eel survived apparently.

267
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,840
 - That's incredible.

268
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,080
 Have you guys heard about the police riots?

269
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
 This is the thing that happened in New York in the 1850s.

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,120
 These are so cool.

271
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
 There was a time in the 1850s in New York,

272
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,160
 where there were two rival police forces in New York.

273
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,520
 What could go wrong?

274
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,120
 Everything went wrong.

275
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
 The state had created a police force,

276
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,600
 and that was an official one,

277
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,840
 but the mayor, who was from the other political party,

278
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,440
 had his own police force already established,

279
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,840
 and the state was trying to take over it.

280
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,560
 And what they started doing, the two forces,

281
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,840
 they started stealing criminals from each other.

282
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,080
 (laughing)

283
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,880
 So they would arrest someone,

284
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,480
 and then the other police would turn up and say,

285
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,320
 "We're having him."

286
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,040
 And then the police would start beating each other up

287
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,840
 to try and arrest the criminal.

288
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,640
 - But then presumably they have to arrest each other

289
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,120
 for beating each other up.

290
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,960
 - They would.

291
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,280
 And then the whole thing eventually ended up

292
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,920
 in a massive brawl between 850 police officers.

293
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,760
 - Wow.

294
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,800
 - All the way through the city hall.

295
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,640
 - Wow.

296
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,480
 - Yeah.

297
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,960
 - You know, Toronto was shaped,

298
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,640
 but sort of Toronto policing was shaped

299
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,840
 by a riot between clowns and firemen.

300
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,360
 So, well, there was this riot in 1855

301
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
 when clowns were a bit more hardcore,

302
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,200
 and it took place in a brothel,

303
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,800
 as I think quite a lot of riots did.

304
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
 - What were the clowns in the brothel?

305
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
 - They were all in the brothel.

306
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 - They were all in the brothel.

307
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,640
 - They were all in the brothel.

308
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,640
 - They'd taken their noses off.

309
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
 It was, they weren't on the job at the time.

310
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,240
 - They were on a job, but they weren't on the job.

311
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,440
 (audience laughing)

312
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
 - And the, yeah.

313
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
 - I'm afraid it will be extra to smell your flour, so.

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
 (audience laughing)

315
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,000
 - Ooh, big feet, you know what they say?

316
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 (audience laughing)

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,240
 - So, that happened and then the firefighters turned up,

318
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,920
 and then this fight broke out.

319
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,880
 I don't know what was arriving over,

320
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
 but the firefighters just started on the clowns.

321
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,320
 The clowns had just come to town,

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
 so they were using their prostitutes, maybe.

323
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,040
 And this huge fight broke out,

324
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,880
 and a policeman came to break up the whole Malay,

325
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,960
 and it ended up with a lot of people

326
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,360
 being really badly injured.

327
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,680
 And I think actually they went and met again

328
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,160
 a couple of days later, so they established this rivalry,

329
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,600
 like the Jets and the Sharks and West Side Story,

330
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,120
 and so they agreed to meet a couple of days later,

331
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,480
 and the clowns and the firemen met again,

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,760
 and then a fight started because of firemen

333
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,920
 knocked a hat off a clown's head,

334
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,600
 and everyone got wounded.

335
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,120
 And because of that, the police force was regulated,

336
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,840
 and rules were introduced as to how you put down a riot,

337
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,000
 and how you don't let things get out of hand.

338
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
 And those rules still remain today.

339
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,480
 - Do you know what the good thing

340
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
 about arresting a bunch of clowns is?

341
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
 You don't need as many police cars,

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 because you can at least 20 into each.

343
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,880
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

344
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,960
 - My fact is that Baby Robbins sometimes eats

345
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,680
 so many caterpillars they turn green.

346
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
 This happens.

347
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,320
 There's a new book out called The Robin Abography.

348
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
 It's by a guy called Stephen Moss, a pro-priot.

349
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,960
 - Oh. - Isch.

350
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,360
 - They turn green. - Oh, yeah.

351
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
 - You know what I'm saying? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

352
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 - Moss is green.

353
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,680
 - It can be like brown sometimes.

354
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,520
 - Yeah.

355
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,400
 - Well, they turn green, because they eat a lot of caterpillars,

356
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,840
 and the caterpillars are green,

357
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,200
 and so they just change colour.

358
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,680
 - Not all caterpillars are green.

359
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,320
 Do they turn whatever colour the caterpillar is?

360
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,880
 - This fact has been pedanted.

361
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,360
 - I'll give you a good fact about Robbins turning green.

362
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,040
 - Is it just the breast that goes green,

363
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,960
 or is it the whole Robin? - I don't know.

364
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,600
 - Wait, you didn't even look at a photo of your fact.

365
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,840
 - It's very hard to find a photo of a green Robin.

366
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,840
 - So spacious. - Very suspicious.

367
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,240
 - Although Baby Robbins don't have red breasts today.

368
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,720
 - I don't know. - So red breasts are the sign

369
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,000
 that you're ready to fight.

370
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
 So I think Robbins are really famous

371
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,120
 for being very pugnacious, aren't they?

372
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,160
 They, you know, anyone comes near their territory,

373
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,040
 they sing that beautiful song, which means get the fuck out of here,

374
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,480
 and they have that big red breast,

375
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
 which means get the fuck out of here.

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,880
 And so Baby Robbins for their first sort of year,

377
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,000
 they don't have red breasts,

378
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,360
 because that's sort of an invitation to fight.

379
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,040
 It's something you display when you're ready

380
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,640
 to, you know, get in the boxing ring.

381
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,560
 - Yeah, it's true, because Robbins will attack anything

382
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,640
 that's red, won't they?

383
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,360
 If you just give them a little bit of red cloth

384
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,400
 or something, like a tiger's bullfight.

385
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,560
 - It's so cool. (laughing)

386
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,840
 - Do they really?

387
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,120
 - Yeah, they do.

388
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,960
 - I'll leave!

389
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,400
 - They do, they do die so much.

390
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
 They murder each other a lot.

391
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,080
 They'll pack each other at the base of the skull

392
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,800
 to break each other's spinal cords.

393
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
 - They're vicious bastards.

394
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 - Yeah, they are.

395
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
 - I didn't notice.

396
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,960
 Red breast, Robyn red breast, red breast,

397
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,200
 is their surname.

398
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,040
 - Well...

399
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,880
 (laughing)

400
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
 - Explain yourself.

401
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,880
 - Okay, in the 15th century, they used to give human names

402
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,440
 to familiar species.

403
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,840
 So it was a red breast, but then there would be like,

404
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 Robyn, how you do it?

405
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,280
 It's a Robyn red breast, so red breast is a surname.

406
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,440
 And red breast, it shouldn't be red breast,

407
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,240
 it should be Robyn orange breast

408
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
 because they have orange breast.

409
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,560
 - Well, you haven't, sorry.

410
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,880
 You just, the fiddled us with changing red to orange

411
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,000
 and going down that line.

412
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,840
 - Yeah.

413
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,160
 - So are you saying that they used to call birds?

414
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
 - Yeah.

415
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
 - That's true, actually.

416
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,960
 Like, I think one of them's Mavis, isn't it?

417
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
 Like, is it a thrush or something?

418
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,360
 They call Mavis in no place.

419
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,200
 - Really?

420
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,200
 And Robyn is the only Christian human name

421
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,120
 that stuck around in the species name.

422
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
 - I think that's right, Robyn red breast.

423
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,760
 Mavis thrush, that was how...

424
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,240
 (laughing)

425
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,840
 But then what you're saying, actually,

426
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,080
 the other bit is quite true as well,

427
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,520
 which is that they don't have red breasts.

428
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,080
 They have orange breasts, but back then in the 15th century,

429
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,480
 we didn't have the word red amazingly.

430
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,480
 We just didn't have the word.

431
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,640
 So they said that's orange

432
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,440
 'cause that's what they associated as they lumped in to...

433
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,240
 - We didn't have the word orange.

434
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,720
 That's why we called them red.

435
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,120
 (laughing)

436
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,640
 'Cause we did have the word red.

437
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,200
 - Usually, I can save that in the edit,

438
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
 but I think it might work.

439
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,840
 (laughing)

440
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
 - Yeah, no.

441
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,280
 So the opposite of what I said is true.

442
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,640
 (laughing)

443
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,800
 - You know, they measure the size of the red/orange part

444
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,160
 of Robin's breast, 'cause scientists wanted to know

445
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,840
 whether they grow or shrink,

446
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,880
 or whether they're particularly big when they're trying to mate.

447
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
 And you know how they do this?

448
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
 It's kind of sweet.

449
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,040
 So this is a study in Spain that was done a couple of years ago.

450
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
 And they catch the robins.

451
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
 And in the study report, it said,

452
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,480
 "We placed it gently on its back on a table."

453
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,520
 And I imagine then tied it down,

454
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,600
 'cause I don't think your Robin lies

455
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,480
 on its back on a table unless you do.

456
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,880
 And then they get a bit of tracing paper,

457
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,920
 and they just put it around the front of the Robin,

458
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,640
 and they trace around the red bit through it.

459
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,120
 And then they measured all the bits,

460
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,240
 and they deduce the male red breast

461
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,840
 get bigger with age and females, don't.

462
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,680
 So that's basic science.

463
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,880
 You could do that in science class.

464
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,840
 - That's really cool.

465
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
 - Yeah.

466
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,480
 - Do you know robins go through puberty every year?

467
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,320
 - Every year.

468
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
 - Every year, imagine that.

469
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
 - Wow.

470
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,520
 - So towards the summer when the days get longer,

471
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,960
 their brains get flooded with hormones,

472
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
 their gonads grow,

473
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,040
 and the males start learning songs to kind of attract women,

474
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
 not women.

475
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,000
 (audience laughs)

476
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,320
 Sorry, I was going back to my old papers and I was like,

477
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,480
 (audience laughs)

478
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,000
 And then in the winter, they go back down again,

479
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,960
 the gonads shrink, and their hormones flush out the system,

480
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,640
 and then every summer they get this puberty.

481
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,480
 - God.

482
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,320
 - It's amazing, isn't it?

483
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,680
 - I mean, women get that once a month,

484
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,760
 so I might still be able to make some sense too,

485
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,320
 but I'm still most anywhere, apparently.

486
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,240
 So they'll pick any nesting site,

487
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,920
 and I was reading a review of a book

488
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,040
 in the telegraph about robins that listed

489
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,000
 a series of nesting sites that they'd made.

490
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,080
 So plant pots, a pigeonhole, and a desk,

491
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,080
 the engine of a World War II plane,

492
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,200
 in the body of a dead cat.

493
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,160
 - Well, that took a real turn, Anna.

494
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,320
 (audience laughs)

495
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,320
 That was really sweet.

496
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,800
 Right till the end.

497
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,440
 - That was a sweet revenge, I think.

498
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,640
 And then there was one that made its nest on an unmade bed,

499
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,120
 while the bed's owner was downstairs having breakfast,

500
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,040
 and the owner came upstairs again and thought,

501
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
 "That's sweet," and allowed it to nest there,

502
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,520
 and incubate its eggs.

503
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,400
 And it didn't tell me this article,

504
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,360
 what the owner slept on for the subsequent however long it takes.

505
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,120
 - I think he slept in a dead cat.

506
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,680
 (audience laughs)

507
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,000
 - I was looking at what would happen,

508
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,040
 whether caterpillars can change color for meeting things.

509
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,080
 Okay, I just thought there might be something out there.

510
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,480
 And I found the paper on the internet called,

511
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
 "The Effects of Blue Die in the Food of Caterpillar Species

512
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,840
 "of Vanessa Caduay."

513
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,960
 I couldn't quite find out which paper this was from,

514
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,240
 but it's genuinely there.

515
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,760
 And they said, "Our experiment had lots of problems."

516
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,480
 First, we did not record all our results correctly.

517
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,480
 (audience laughs)

518
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,200
 So what they wanted to do, they wanted to check

519
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
 whether the caterpillars, when they had the blue die,

520
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,520
 whether they'd be blue when they became butterflies.

521
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,560
 So first, they did not record all of those results correctly.

522
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,160
 Next, we miscalculated the number of dead butterflies

523
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,440
 at each group.

524
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,400
 Then we mixed up all the labels.

525
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,400
 (audience laughs)

526
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,280
 Next, some of our butterflies fell off their cups,

527
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,080
 and then one of our group members knocked over the bin

528
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,400
 for the control group.

529
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,840
 (audience laughs)

530
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,600
 And then it said, "All of these mistakes affected our results

531
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,440
 in some way."

532
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,520
 (audience laughs)

533
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,920
 I read about a animal.

534
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,680
 It's a really odd thing.

535
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,600
 It's a cave dwelling crocodile,

536
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,960
 which crocodiles don't dwell in caves.

537
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,520
 So this was quite a big finding,

538
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,920
 and they were studying them for ages

539
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
 'cause they couldn't work out why they were doing it.

540
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,480
 And the thing that really stuck out about them

541
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,360
 was that they were bright orange,

542
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,880
 and crocodiles are not bright orange.

543
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,560
 So they were like, "Oh, that's two things we need to look at now."

544
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,160
 And the orange thing that they couldn't work out for ages,

545
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,280
 it turns out that there were bats living inside the cave,

546
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,920
 and they would poo into the cave water

547
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
 where the crocodiles were,

548
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,880
 and these crocodiles were being dyed orange by bat poo.

549
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,920
 But it was like in the water,

550
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
 and then the water was dying.

551
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,120
 It was like going into like one of those T-shirt tie dye things,

552
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
 and it was just, yeah, it just dyed them.

553
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,040
 And so for a while, we had this mysterious orange crocodile,

554
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,760
 but it turns out they're just covered in shit.

555
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,280
 (audience laughs)

556
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,520
 Have you guys seen waxwing birds, like cedar wax wings?

557
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,040
 So they're these birds that they have

558
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,440
 really brightly colored yellow tips on their tails

559
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,240
 and on some of their feathers.

560
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,480
 And so they've had this forever and ever as long as we know.

561
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,480
 And then there's a cedar waxwing that lives in North America,

562
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,480
 which has this really bright yellow tip of its tail.

563
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
 And in the last 50 years, it's suddenly been turning red.

564
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
 And this is because a bunch of Asian honey suckle

565
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,600
 has been brought into North America,

566
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,560
 and it has these bright red berries,

567
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,680
 and they eat these really, really red berries.

568
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,080
 And it's changing the color of them.

569
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,320
 So the cedar waxwing is changing color as a species

570
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,920
 because it's eating all these red berries.

571
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
 That is amazing.

572
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,600
 Imagine.

573
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
 Well, the orange crocodile didn't do anything for you.

574
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,520
 No, it was good.

575
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,920
 I was just imagine they've humans all started

576
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,520
 drinking sunny delight or something.

577
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,760
 Yes, exactly.

578
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,960
 And that happens. It does happen.

579
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,160
 So babies sometimes turn orange if they have too much,

580
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,480
 is it keratin in the system?

581
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,320
 Yeah, too many keratin, too much orange juice,

582
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
 and your baby will turn orange.

583
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,560
 Yeah.

584
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,960
 I've just had a baby.

585
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,960
 I don't believe that.

586
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,400
 I feel an experiment coming on.

587
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,800
 I just know what the report's going to read like afterwards.

588
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 Firstly, we mixed up all the babies.

589
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,640
 OK, it is time for fact number three.

590
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,240
 And that is my fact.

591
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,640
 My fact this week is that the Russian Communist leader,

592
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,080
 Vladimir Lenin, spoke with an Irish accent.

593
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
 OK.

594
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,920
 Oh, the Russian Communist leader, Vladimir Lenin.

595
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,840
 So I think we need to specify that this

596
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,880
 is not him speaking Russian in an Irish accent.

597
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,560
 No, no.

598
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,800
 It's when he spoke English.

599
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,520
 He was taught by an Irish tutor and the way that he spoke.

600
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
 He just carried.

601
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
 So whenever people spoke to him--

602
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
 How do we know that this is true?

603
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,160
 Like, is there a recording of him by singing "Danny Boy" or something?

604
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,840
 The Russians have admitted to it.

605
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,960
 They said that this was--

606
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,840
 It's not a crime to speak with an Irish accent, Dan.

607
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,800
 It's weird, because the Russians admit to so little.

608
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,040
 Yeah, they were willing to give this away.

609
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,520
 Yeah, I was a terrible investigative journalist

610
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,880
 when I was going-- Did you do the hacking?

611
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,480
 No, OK.

612
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,360
 The accent thing?

613
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
 Yes, great.

614
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
 I'm out of here.

615
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,640
 No, he was taught-- we also know it because H.G. Wells met him.

616
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
 And they had a conversation.

617
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,680
 And he came away going, that was the weirdest conversation,

618
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,400
 because I was talking to an Irishman,

619
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
 but it was Russian Communist leader.

620
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,160
 Vladimir was his name--

621
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,360
 Lenin.

622
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
 Well, apparently Lenin spoke with what's

623
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,440
 called a "Rathmines" accent.

624
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,120
 And "Rathmines", apparently, I've never heard of it,

625
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,520
 is in particular area of Dublin.

626
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,640
 And he had an accent from this area.

627
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,680
 And it meant that not only would people in England

628
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,920
 have struggled to understand him, but people in Ireland

629
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,800
 would have struggled to understand him.

630
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,240
 Did you guys know that the posh--

631
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,480
 you know the posh American accent that's

632
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,840
 in all the Hollywood films of the '20s and '30s

633
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,000
 at the Catherine Hepburn classic icon impersonated,

634
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,120
 but imagine Catherine Hepburn in a film

635
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,160
 or Bet Davis or someone?

636
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,240
 That posh American accent is not an accent.

637
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
 So no one real had that accent.

638
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,120
 That was an accent that was created for Hollywood.

639
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,280
 So that kind of American English hybrid of the '20s, '30s, '40s.

640
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,480
 And then it was suddenly phased out in the '50s

641
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,200
 when they thought it was a bit weird.

642
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,960
 Was they got accent coaches in to train people

643
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
 to speak like that?

644
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,120
 And they thought it would make them sound more educated,

645
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,760
 because it had that English vibe.

646
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,800
 And the only people who spoke with that voice

647
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,920
 were Hollywood actresses and actresses.

648
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
 That is amazing.

649
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
 It's weird, isn't it?

650
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
 It's really weird.

651
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
 Yeah.

652
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,600
 Is that-- so as in, when you then heard

653
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,840
 their real voice in real life, it was completely different?

654
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,680
 Yeah.

655
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,240
 I mean, I think they got voice coaches

656
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,600
 to teach them how to just speak like that, really.

657
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,520
 But yeah.

658
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,880
 So I read Eva Green.

659
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,920
 Do you remember she was the--

660
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,240
 she was in the Casina Royal reboot with Daniel Craig, James Bond.

661
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,400
 She's French.

662
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,960
 And when she did all the interview--

663
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,480
 and I didn't know that when I saw the movie,

664
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,520
 because she did it with a British accent.

665
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,280
 But in the interviews, she thought

666
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,440
 that people are just going to be so bothered by the fact

667
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,840
 that I have a French accent.

668
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,440
 She did all her publicity in the English accent

669
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:46,960
 that she did with the movie.

670
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,520
 And it was really, really convincing.

671
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,160
 Yeah.

672
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,760
 You wouldn't know.

673
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,560
 Or did you notice in--

674
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,440
 Well, no, I was the same with Dick Van Dyke, actually.

675
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,720
 [LAUGHTER]

676
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,200
 Yeah.

677
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,720
 Poor Dick Van Dyke.

678
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,840
 Last year, he apologized for the accent

679
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,960
 for the first time ever.

680
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,920
 Oh, I'm terribly sorry, though.

681
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,160
 [LAUGHTER]

682
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,120
 He, by the way, he was in the news a few years ago,

683
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,800
 because he loved Dick Van Dyke, and he fell asleep on his surfboard,

684
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,520
 and he got carried out into the ocean.

685
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,200
 What is surfboard?

686
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,880
 Yeah, that is a relaxed surfer.

687
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,240
 [LAUGHTER]

688
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,760
 Yeah, and he woke up, and he was in the middle of the ocean,

689
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,120
 and he was being carried by currency.

690
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
 He didn't know where he was.

691
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,320
 And he said a bunch of porpoises came up,

692
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,400
 and they guided him back to shore.

693
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,840
 And otherwise, we would have no more Dick Van Dyke.

694
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,360
 He would have gone off into the ocean.

695
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,720
 Guys, on accents.

696
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
 Oh, yeah.

697
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,000
 Do you know Paddy Ashtown, former Lib Dem leader?

698
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 Yes.

699
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,840
 Do you know what his name was?

700
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,600
 Patrick Ashtown?

701
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,440
 Yeah, so his name-- it's not a funny name.

702
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,840
 His name's Jeremy.

703
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,880
 But he was Irish, and the reason we call him Paddy Ashtown

704
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,240
 is that he went to boarding school in England,

705
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,920
 and everyone called him Paddy, because he had an Irish accent.

706
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,920
 No.

707
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,240
 And he said, I just feel comfortable with Paddy now.

708
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
 Isn't that bizarre?

709
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,960
 And he openly embraced it.

710
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,280
 And I suppose it was a different time,

711
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
 but Paddy Ashtown is Jeremy Ashtown,

712
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,680
 where it not for xenophobia.

713
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,800
 Wow.

714
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,120
 Well, on that, so there was a study in 2015

715
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
 on the way people perceive different accents,

716
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,280
 because obviously there are dozens of accents all over the UK,

717
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,280
 and they have different perceptions that come with them.

718
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,720
 There was a study that perceived intelligence

719
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,000
 that found that the Birmingham accent--

720
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,040
 this is very unfair, but it found that the Birmingham accent

721
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,720
 was so low-rated in the study that it ranked worse

722
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,320
 than staying completely silent.

723
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,040
 [LAUGHTER]

724
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:47,040
 Do you remember how this fact was about Lenin?

725
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
 Yeah.

726
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,440
 Did you know Lenin's body is still hanging around and barmed,

727
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,360
 looking exactly like he does.

728
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,720
 So Lenin's body is there, but he was sort of the first instance

729
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,240
 of that kind of embalming to make bodies look exactly

730
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,400
 like they have look for a friend of them.

731
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
 So pre-Malsytong.

732
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
 Yes, yeah, pre-all of those.

733
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,400
 And so now, all other countries who

734
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,320
 want to embalm their great leaders,

735
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,680
 like Ho Chi Minh, for instance, and in North Korea,

736
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,360
 Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, they've all been embalmed,

737
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,440
 and they get sent to Russia periodically

738
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,240
 in order to be professionally maintained.

739
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,760
 You're kidding.

740
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,760
 Is that so good at it?

741
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
 They don't bring the people there.

742
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,520
 They physically quit.

743
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,240
 No, apparently they get sent to Russia.

744
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,560
 So I certainly know that Ho Chi Minh is sent to Russia

745
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,400
 every few years to get maintained,

746
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,720
 because they're so good at keeping them.

747
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,960
 Imagine the Christmas party at that place.

748
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,080
 When you've got Ho Chi Minh there, Lenin here.

749
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,960
 There's a lot of good Instagram photos out there.

750
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,680
 That's all I'm saying.

751
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,120
 It's time to move on to our final fact of the evening.

752
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,160
 And that is Anachasensky.

753
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,760
 Yes, my fact is that in Japan, if you make a mistake at work,

754
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,480
 you can hire someone to get told off by your boss

755
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,160
 so you don't have to.

756
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,640
 This is so weird.

757
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
 I read this incredible article in the Atlantic,

758
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
 and it was interviewing someone who,

759
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,560
 what's their company called, Family Romance.

760
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,960
 And the idea is that you fill the gaps in people's lives.

761
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,720
 People's personal lives, people's lives, generally,

762
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,960
 that need filling.

763
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,280
 And so in this instance, he said he sometimes

764
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,320
 gets hired out to people who salary men.

765
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,240
 And in Japan, that's quite a big thing.

766
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,000
 People work for big corporations.

767
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,200
 It's quite faceless.

768
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,280
 Sometimes they don't necessarily know their bosses.

769
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,920
 And then they make a massive mistake,

770
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,480
 and they're sent to the boss to get told off.

771
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,040
 And the boss doesn't know who they are.

772
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,480
 And at this point, this man gets hired.

773
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,440
 And he has to go into the boss instead

774
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,680
 and say, I'm so sorry.

775
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,360
 I did that.

776
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,240
 How embarrassing.

777
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,360
 And he says in this article, he says,

778
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,800
 do you know how we apologize?

779
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
 We have to get down on our hands and knees on the floor.

780
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
 And really say, I'm so, so sorry.

781
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,200
 Well, the boss holds abuse of us.

782
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,040
 And he's paid to do this, so the other boss doesn't have to.

783
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,040
 Is there ever a scenario where like five people are being told off,

784
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,640
 but that one guy's been hired for every single hour?

785
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,160
 And so he's like, you're crap.

786
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,280
 Get out of here, send the next guy in.

787
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,080
 Same guy comes back in here.

788
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,320
 A series of novelty hats.

789
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,960
 Send in the guy with a sombrero outside.

790
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,640
 I'm furious.

791
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,240
 That interview is unbelievable.

792
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,360
 There's firm family romance.

793
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,880
 So the man who founded the company,

794
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,440
 his name is Ishi Yuichi.

795
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,040
 And he is acting.

796
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,080
 His first success was playing a father

797
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
 for a girl who had a single mother,

798
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,640
 and the mother wanted the girl to grow up

799
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,320
 with a father figure in her life.

800
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,720
 So he has been playing the father of this girl for eight years.

801
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,560
 She doesn't know it.

802
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,000
 She doesn't know that this man is not her father.

803
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,080
 And he says, if the client never reveals the truth,

804
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,840
 I must continue the role indefinitely.

805
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,920
 If the daughter gets married,

806
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,240
 I have to be a father in the wedding.

807
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
 And then I have to be the grandfather.

808
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,680
 And he, this is, it's a gig for life he's got now.

809
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,920
 He's committed to the job.

810
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,960
 You've got to say that for him.

811
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,000
 It is amazing.

812
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,960
 Like, yeah, Andy and I have read it and do read it.

813
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,080
 But one other thing he does that I think is quite funny

814
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,520
 is that he is hired by wives to apologize to their husbands

815
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,080
 for having an affair with the wife.

816
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,440
 When the real person who had an affair with the wife

817
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,120
 has run away.

818
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,720
 So when the husband finds out that the wife's having an affair,

819
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,920
 quite often, the other guy says, OK, well, I'm out of here.

820
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,880
 And so she'll hire someone to go and apologize to him.

821
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,360
 And he says his tactic there is that he

822
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,680
 goes pretending to be this man who's been shagging the wife.

823
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,480
 And he goes and he meets the husband.

824
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,400
 And he bows very deeply.

825
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,200
 And he apologizes very profusely.

826
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,440
 But also, he dresses and acts like a yakuza,

827
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,880
 as in a Japanese gangster.

828
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,800
 And so he says the husband accepts the apology quite quickly,

829
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,840
 because otherwise, he may kill him.

830
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,480
 That's the technique there.

831
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,600
 That's-- but don't yakuza only have four fingers?

832
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
 He's a good actor.

833
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,320
 He can act only having four fingers.

834
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,080
 So there's another thing.

835
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,520
 Christian weddings are really popular,

836
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,680
 as in white weddings, as we know them in Britain.

837
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,200
 And 99% of the Christian weddings that they have there are fake.

838
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,360
 So if you're a Westerner in Japan,

839
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,440
 it's often an easy acting gig to pretend

840
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,240
 to be a priest for a couple of hours,

841
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
 conduct a wedding ceremony.

842
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,800
 You're not a priest.

843
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,360
 You don't know any clerical rituals or anything like that.

844
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,840
 They happen in a fake chapel.

845
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,240
 And it's often just English teachers from the West

846
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,760
 making a bit of money on the side.

847
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,680
 Everyone kind of knows his fate, but everyone goes along with it,

848
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,000
 because they like the ritual.

849
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,400
 Wait, so people aren't getting married in the ceremony?

850
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,000
 It's not legally binding, it's, but it

851
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 is what people do for their wedding.

852
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,640
 So you would also have the kind of registry office thing.

853
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,800
 I think they have a registry office thing.

854
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,640
 But the actual-- yeah, they're sort of big ceremony

855
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,160
 a bit.

856
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,480
 One account from one of these guys who conducted--

857
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,440
 I think he said he conducted about 900 weddings over the decade.

858
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,800
 I know.

859
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,160
 He recorded his first-ever wedding rehearsal that he'd done.

860
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,640
 And he showed it to his wife, who I think was Japanese.

861
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,760
 And she looked at him conducting a ceremony

862
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,280
 and speaking in Japanese to the couple.

863
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,080
 And she said, well, it was good.

864
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,840
 But you made one big mistake.

865
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,400
 Instead of saying, you may now exchange rings.

866
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,640
 You said, put the ring in her crotch.

867
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:17,160
 So if you can't afford this guy to--

868
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,320
 when you're at work, to be told off for you.

869
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,880
 And there's a cheaper version.

870
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
 For about $65 equivalent, you can hire in Japan

871
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
 an attractive man to come to your workplace

872
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,600
 and gently brush away your tears while you weep.

873
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,320
 [LAUGHTER]

874
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,640
 The company's called Hanson Weeping Boys.

875
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,720
 And also, in China, there's a big thing at the moment

876
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,520
 with the Uber economy kind of thing.

877
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,840
 So you can kind of get part-time use of washing machines,

878
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,600
 basket bowls, umbrellas.

879
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,280
 There was an umbrella sharing company.

880
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,800
 In fact, that's in our book, isn't it?

881
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,320
 Yeah.

882
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,320
 They lost all 300,000 umbrellas straight away

883
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,840
 when they rented them out and forgot

884
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,360
 to put a tracking system on them and no one returned.

885
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,960
 Actually, in China, there was the case

886
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,200
 this year of a man who got married, had his wedding.

887
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,840
 And then was arrested because it turned out

888
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,960
 he'd hired 200 guests to pretend to be his friends at his wedding.

889
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,440
 And apparently, the bride and her family

890
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,160
 became suspicious when none of them could explain how they knew him.

891
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,960
 So they were obviously on a very low wage.

892
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,640
 I think they were being paid the equivalent of nine pounds each.

893
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,440
 So they hadn't been given a backstory or anything.

894
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,320
 So the bride just came up and said, "How do you know this guy?"

895
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,960
 And they said, "I don't know, I'm being paid to do this."

896
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,120
 But yeah, that one, he was arrested.

897
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,280
 And the happy ending to that story

898
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,120
 is that he claimed he was 27.

899
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,120
 And it turned out he was 20.

900
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,800
 And in China, I didn't realize this.

901
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,360
 The minimum age at which you can legally marry as a man is 22.

902
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,000
 - Really? - And yeah, I know.

903
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,440
 I have no idea.

904
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
 So yeah, not valid.

905
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,720
 We're going to have to wrap up in a second.

906
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,400
 So anything before we do?

907
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,240
 A Japanese thing.

908
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,840
 There's Japanese word called new hara, which

909
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,200
 means noodle harassment.

910
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
 And that refers to the hassle that some people

911
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,800
 get for slurping their noodles too loudly.

912
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,280
 This is a big thing in Japan at the moment.

913
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,360
 Apparently, I'll call into the internet.

914
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,320
 And someone has managed to deal with it

915
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,600
 by inventing a musical spoon.

916
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,480
 So basically, you have a musical spoon.

917
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,720
 It plays loads of music, and no one can hear you slurping

918
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,880
 your noodles.

919
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,240
 Oh, no, that's not much more annoying.

920
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,640
 Yeah, what does it sing?

921
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,520
 [CHEERING]

922
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,320
 Nice.

923
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,800
 Well, OK, speaking of our theme tune, we must wrap up.

924
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,960
 Thank you so much for listening.

925
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,760
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

926
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,400
 about the things that we've said over the course

927
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,880
 of this podcast, you can find me on @Sriberland.

928
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,720
 Andy?

929
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,400
 Andrew Hunter M. James.

930
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
 James Harkin.

931
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,400
 And Anna.

932
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,520
 You can email podcast@ky.com.

933
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,240
 Yep, or you can go to our group account at no such thing

934
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,680
 on Twitter.

935
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,080
 You can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com,

936
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,560
 where we have links to our book, The Book of the Year.

937
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,320
 It's out now, and we're going to give a copy away

938
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,000
 in a second to someone from our audience.

939
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,240
 We've picked out our favorite fact that you guys sent.

940
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,040
 Andy, what was the best fact?

941
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,920
 This one is from Sam Ward.

942
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,480
 And it's that the Lichtenstein Football team's national stadium

943
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,600
 is only half in Lichtenstein.

944
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,680
 The other half is in Switzerland.

945
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,880
 So for 45 minutes every match, the Lichtenstein goalie

946
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,920
 invades Switzerland.

947
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,720
 [LAUGHTER]

948
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,040
 And who is that from?

949
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,400
 That's from Sam Ward.

950
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,760
 Cool, come and collect your book at the end.

951
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,640
 Guys, thank you so much for having us.

952
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,480
 We're going to be out the back, as I said before.

953
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,720
 We're going to be signing our book.

954
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,440
 So they're on sale.

955
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,800
 If you want to come say hi, please do anyway.

956
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,920
 Thank you so much, guys.

957
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,960
 We'll see you again.

958
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,200
 Goodbye.

959
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,960
 [APPLAUSE]

960
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,440

961
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,800

962

963
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,400
