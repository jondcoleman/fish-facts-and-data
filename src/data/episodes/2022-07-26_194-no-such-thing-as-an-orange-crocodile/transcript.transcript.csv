00:00:02,00:00:04,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:04,00:00:07,"(ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)"
00:00:07,00:00:14,"(ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding)"
00:00:14,00:00:17,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:17,00:00:19,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"""
00:00:19,00:00:22,a weekly podcast this week coming to you from Mottagon!
00:00:22,00:00:25,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:30,- My name is Dan Schreiber
00:00:30,00:00:33,"and I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:33,00:00:36,"Drew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin,"
00:00:36,00:00:39,"and once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:39,00:00:42,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:42,00:00:45,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"Starting with you, James Harkin."
00:00:47,00:00:52,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1766,"
00:00:52,00:00:54,"there was a cheese riot in Nottingham,"
00:00:55,00:00:59,where the mayor of Nottingham was knocked over by a large cheese.
00:00:59,00:01:02,(audience laughing)
00:01:02,00:01:06,- So was the cheese rioting?
00:01:06,00:01:08,(laughing)
00:01:08,00:01:09,How did that work?
00:01:09,00:01:11,"- So what it was is, I mean, I'm preaching to people"
00:01:11,00:01:14,"who know all about this in Nottingham, I'm sure."
00:01:14,00:01:17,"But this was a goosefair, you all know what the goosefair is, right?"
00:01:17,00:01:19,(audience cheering)
00:01:19,00:01:23,"And basically, things became tense when some rude lads"
00:01:24,00:01:27,engage several Lincolnshire traders
00:01:27,00:01:30,who had purchased up to 60 hundred of cheese.
00:01:30,00:01:32,"These aren't my words, by the way, I'm reading."
00:01:32,00:01:34,(audience laughing)
00:01:34,00:01:36,"And basically, what they didn't want to happen"
00:01:36,00:01:39,is that those nasty people from Lincolnshire
00:01:39,00:01:40,come and get all the cheese
00:01:40,00:01:42,and then there's no cheese for people from Nottingham.
00:01:42,00:01:44,So then that kind of started a bit of a riot
00:01:44,00:01:47,"and then suddenly there were crowds running around,"
00:01:47,00:01:50,they were grabbing cheeses and rolling them down the streets.
00:01:50,00:01:52,So they're not like little baby bells
00:01:52,00:01:54,or slices of cheese like you get now.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"They're big wheels of cheese, right?"
00:01:56,00:01:58,"- Although if you released a lot of baby bells,"
00:01:58,00:01:59,that could knock someone over underfoot
00:01:59,00:02:02,by making the ground slippery on the likes.
00:02:02,00:02:02,"- Sure, yeah."
00:02:02,00:02:05,"- I haven't thought about this before, but I feel as if I have."
00:02:05,00:02:07,(audience laughing)
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- And basically, after that, everything kind of kicked off."
00:02:09,00:02:12,So a lot of people went down the river trends
00:02:12,00:02:15,to search for warehouses looking for more cheese.
00:02:15,00:02:17,(audience laughing)
00:02:17,00:02:20,"The next day, a guy was shot by a soldier."
00:02:20,00:02:22,He was trying to defend his cheese.
00:02:23,00:02:26,"I still think too soon, actually, for that."
00:02:26,00:02:27,(audience laughing)
00:02:27,00:02:29,"But actually, the soldiers were on his side."
00:02:29,00:02:31,It was like a friendly fire thing.
00:02:31,00:02:33,And then the whole thing came to an end
00:02:33,00:02:36,when the mob tried and failed to burn down a windmill.
00:02:36,00:02:37,- Ah.
00:02:37,00:02:41,"- And the mayor himself, a cheese what rolled towards him."
00:02:41,00:02:43,"- Well, he was coming to try and calm things down"
00:02:43,00:02:46,and basically someone chucked a cheese at him.
00:02:46,00:02:47,- All right.
00:02:47,00:02:48,"- Oh, chucked a cheese, okay, cool."
00:02:48,00:02:50,- But then it knocked him over.
00:02:50,00:02:51,"- Knocked him over, mate."
00:02:51,00:02:53,- Was he quite a small man?
00:02:53,00:02:54,- Sounds like he was a small man.
00:02:54,00:02:56,- I don't know how big he was.
00:02:56,00:02:57,It was the olden days.
00:02:57,00:02:58,They were all small.
00:02:58,00:02:59,"- They were all small, yeah."
00:02:59,00:03:01,- So maybe baby bells were massive to them.
00:03:01,00:03:04,(audience laughing)
00:03:04,00:03:05,"- It is an amazing bit of history,"
00:03:05,00:03:07,which I had never heard of before.
00:03:07,00:03:08,- Yeah.
00:03:08,00:03:08,- Yeah.
00:03:08,00:03:10,- Did you guys already know about the cheese riot?
00:03:10,00:03:11,- Yeah.
00:03:11,00:03:14,"- Wait, wait, did anyone not know about the cheese riot?"
00:03:14,00:03:15,"- Ah, you see."
00:03:15,00:03:16,- Wow.
00:03:16,00:03:18,"- And the cheese riot guys were lying, I think."
00:03:18,00:03:19,(audience laughing)
00:03:19,00:03:21,Nottingham's got some cool food history.
00:03:21,00:03:23,So did you know that you guys have
00:03:23,00:03:27,"the Bramely Apple, great grandfather?"
00:03:27,00:03:29,"And a bunch of Japanese tourists, I think,"
00:03:29,00:03:32,"came to Nottingham about five years ago to visit it, didn't they?"
00:03:32,00:03:34,Because so this is the one Bramely Apple tree
00:03:34,00:03:38,in Nottingham from which every single Bramely Apple comes.
00:03:38,00:03:42,"And it's so popular now, that variety of Apple in Japan,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,that the mayor of a town in Japan
00:03:44,00:03:47,and all the people from his town flew over and visited it.
00:03:47,00:03:48,"- Oh, look at you."
00:03:48,00:03:49,- He flew from his town.
00:03:49,00:03:50,(audience laughing)
00:03:50,00:03:53,- They chartered 60 planes.
00:03:53,00:03:55,(audience laughing)
00:03:55,00:03:57,A percentage of the people.
00:03:57,00:03:58,(audience laughing)
00:03:58,00:03:59,- I have a couple of cheese facts.
00:03:59,00:04:00,- Oh yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- His historical cheese facts.
00:04:01,00:04:04,"- Go on, so the first Eurovision"
00:04:04,00:04:06,was a cheese competition in a sense.
00:04:06,00:04:09,And the phrase in a sense is doing a lot of work
00:04:09,00:04:12,"in that sentence, but there was a massive,"
00:04:12,00:04:14,"after Napoleon was defeated in 1815,"
00:04:14,00:04:17,"there was a massive, you know, Congress."
00:04:17,00:04:18,It was called the Congress of Vienna.
00:04:18,00:04:19,And it was working out the terms
00:04:19,00:04:22,for all the nations in Europe and the terms of France's surrender.
00:04:22,00:04:25,"And Talleyrand, one of the ministers there,"
00:04:25,00:04:27,"he said, why don't we lighten things up a bit"
00:04:27,00:04:28,with a cheese competition.
00:04:28,00:04:30,And every nation submitted their own cheeses.
00:04:30,00:04:31,- Who won?
00:04:31,00:04:33,- They all voted for their own cheeses.
00:04:33,00:04:35,(audience laughing)
00:04:35,00:04:38,"So that's how it was like Eurovision, right?"
00:04:38,00:04:40,"- They think you're France's special award for the Brie,"
00:04:40,00:04:43,"but they basically all said, ""We think our cheese is best."""
00:04:43,00:04:44,- I don't know.
00:04:44,00:04:45,- I think you're not even sort of anything
00:04:45,00:04:47,is that cheese contest don't lighten things up.
00:04:47,00:04:50,"- They actually, my thing's turned pretty ugly."
00:04:50,00:04:52,"I always, there's a sort of famous fact"
00:04:52,00:04:55,that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister
00:04:55,00:04:57,in a riot.
00:04:57,00:04:58,"So this is my favorite riot, I think."
00:04:58,00:05:00,"- This is, sorry, this famous fact is famous"
00:05:00,00:05:02,"amongst people like us, isn't it?"
00:05:02,00:05:05,"- Yeah, Masha, maybe it's not a famous outside of this stage."
00:05:05,00:05:07,"Yeah, there's a fact that my favorite riot"
00:05:07,00:05:10,is that the Dutch once killed an eight-year prime minister.
00:05:10,00:05:12,"And this isn't the 1600s, wasn't it?"
00:05:12,00:05:16,And I always like that they ate their prime minister
00:05:16,00:05:19,in order to replace him with an orange.
00:05:19,00:05:21,So this is when the orange dynasty came in.
00:05:21,00:05:22,- What?
00:05:22,00:05:25,"- And so, not an actual orange, yes, sorry."
00:05:25,00:05:26,- Because that would've been so crazy
00:05:26,00:05:27,because they should've just eaten the orange.
00:05:27,00:05:29,"- Exactly, but that's kind of what it implies."
00:05:29,00:05:31,"Anyway, eat William of Orange,"
00:05:31,00:05:32,"and leave Paul Johan de Wit,"
00:05:32,00:05:34,"who doesn't even have a name who sounds like food,"
00:05:34,00:05:36,to rule the country.
00:05:36,00:05:38,"- Just quickly, this is the first time I've been to nodding him."
00:05:38,00:05:42,I was unbelievably excited to discover
00:05:42,00:05:43,that you guys have a sheriff's still.
00:05:43,00:05:45,"I mean, that is..."
00:05:45,00:05:46,- That's so cool.
00:05:46,00:05:48,"And I didn't know this, looking into him."
00:05:48,00:05:50,He was born on Robin Hood Street.
00:05:50,00:05:53,The current sheriff on Nottingham
00:05:53,00:05:56,was born on Robin Hood Street.
00:05:56,00:05:58,"- Another Nottingham fact, you have a lot of caves here."
00:05:58,00:06:00,(audience cheering)
00:06:00,00:06:00,We have...
00:06:00,00:06:02,(laughing)
00:06:02,00:06:03,- Yeah.
00:06:03,00:06:04,- It's the Truggler Dite Surin!
00:06:04,00:06:06,(laughing)
00:06:06,00:06:09,"- There are over 700 caves under the streets of Nottingham,"
00:06:09,00:06:12,"and the man who's in charge of cataloging them,"
00:06:12,00:06:14,he had to have confined space training
00:06:14,00:06:15,before he could do his job.
00:06:15,00:06:19,And his name is Mr. Dave Strange Walker.
00:06:19,00:06:21,(audience cheering)
00:06:21,00:06:23,I have another fact about cheese and caves.
00:06:23,00:06:24,- No.
00:06:24,00:06:25,"- Yes, genuinely."
00:06:25,00:06:30,"So, in the 1980s, America had a 30 million pound"
00:06:30,00:06:32,stockpile of cheese in a cave.
00:06:32,00:06:35,"There was a massive cheese surplus in America,"
00:06:35,00:06:37,"'cause they had over-produced it,"
00:06:37,00:06:39,and they stored it all in caves in Missouri.
00:06:39,00:06:43,"It was worth, by 1983, it was worth $4 billion."
00:06:43,00:06:45,"And the thing is, it's still happening."
00:06:45,00:06:47,It's still a massive dairy surplus in America.
00:06:47,00:06:50,"And there's this shadowy body called dairy management,"
00:06:50,00:06:52,which is desperate to get.
00:06:52,00:06:53,It's not bad.
00:06:53,00:06:54,- And a big cheese.
00:06:54,00:06:55,- A big cheese!
00:06:55,00:06:58,(audience laughing)
00:06:58,00:06:59,(audience applauding)
00:06:59,00:07:01,"They're genuinely other, 'cause, for example,"
00:07:01,00:07:04,they're constantly trying to push more cheese onto people.
00:07:04,00:07:07,"So, for example, they help dominoes,"
00:07:07,00:07:09,"the pizza company, develop a line of pizzas"
00:07:09,00:07:11,which had 40% more cheese.
00:07:11,00:07:12,"And then they lobbied McDonald's,"
00:07:12,00:07:13,"and they said, ""Why don't you put some more cheese"
00:07:13,00:07:15,"""on the cheeseburgers, go on."""
00:07:15,00:07:16,"- Wow, that's amazing."
00:07:16,00:07:19,The first time the word mammoth was used
00:07:19,00:07:21,to describe something big was about a cheese.
00:07:21,00:07:22,- Really?
00:07:22,00:07:23,- Yeah.
00:07:23,00:07:24,"- Prior to the actual mammoth,"
00:07:24,00:07:26,it was a description of a cheese.
00:07:26,00:07:29,"- Well, actually, they called the mammoth's mammoths"
00:07:29,00:07:31,whether they were big or not.
00:07:31,00:07:32,"So, even if you had a small mammoth,"
00:07:32,00:07:33,it was still called the mammoth.
00:07:33,00:07:34,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:07:34,00:07:34,- But you were--
00:07:34,00:07:36,- They never before had referred to a mammoth mammoth
00:07:36,00:07:38,"until they referred to a mammoth cheese,"
00:07:38,00:07:39,is what James is saying.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- So, the word mammoth meaning this is massive."
00:07:42,00:07:42,- Yeah.
00:07:42,00:07:43,- That was a cheese first.
00:07:43,00:07:44,- That was a cheese first?
00:07:44,00:07:45,"- Yeah, and then they saw a mammoth,"
00:07:45,00:07:47,"and they're like, ""That's like that cheese we saw."""
00:07:47,00:07:51,(audience laughing)
00:07:51,00:07:52,- You still don't have got the idea.
00:07:52,00:07:55,(laughing)
00:07:55,00:07:56,"- It was a famous cheese, you know about it,"
00:07:56,00:07:57,and I don't know you.
00:07:57,00:07:58,"- Yeah, I think we talked about it."
00:07:58,00:08:00,"- It was a presidential cheese, right?"
00:08:00,00:08:01,Which president was it that it was given to?
00:08:01,00:08:02,- Jefferson.
00:08:02,00:08:03,- It was Jefferson that it was given to.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"- Yeah, and what it was is at the time,"
00:08:05,00:08:08,they just found mastodon skeletons in America
00:08:08,00:08:10,in the far west.
00:08:10,00:08:12,"And they didn't know, they thought maybe"
00:08:12,00:08:14,"there were massive mammoths living over there,"
00:08:14,00:08:16,so it was a big kind of mammoth frenzy
00:08:16,00:08:17,in America at the time.
00:08:17,00:08:19,And then they also gave him this cheese
00:08:19,00:08:21,"and thought, ""What does that remind us of?"""
00:08:21,00:08:22,Those things that don't exist.
00:08:22,00:08:23,(audience laughing)
00:08:23,00:08:24,- Of course.
00:08:24,00:08:27,I have a favorite animal-related riot.
00:08:27,00:08:29,"- Okay, thank you."
00:08:29,00:08:31,- Do you guys know about the eel-pulling riot?
00:08:31,00:08:32,- No. - No.
00:08:32,00:08:34,"- This was in 1886 in Amsterdam,"
00:08:34,00:08:40,and there used to be this tradition where you'd hang an eel.
00:08:40,00:08:42,"I don't even know what it was suspended of above,"
00:08:42,00:08:44,"but you'd hang an eel above the canals in Amsterdam,"
00:08:44,00:08:46,and there would be a live eel and it'd be riding around.
00:08:46,00:08:48,"And the point was you had to sail under it on your boat,"
00:08:48,00:08:50,"or not motor on it,"
00:08:50,00:08:52,"under it probably, but go under it on your boat."
00:08:52,00:08:55,"And you had to jump up and try and catch the eel,"
00:08:55,00:08:57,and most people fell in the water.
00:08:57,00:08:59,"And it was quite comical, and it sounds quite fun."
00:08:59,00:09:02,"And it was banned 'cause it was deemed cruel to animals,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,which is very forward-thinking
00:09:03,00:09:05,for the 1886 people.
00:09:05,00:09:08,"And people were so angry about the crackdown,"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"'cause they loved eel-pulling so much that they completely rioted,"
00:09:11,00:09:15,"and 26 people were killed in 1886 in Amsterdam,"
00:09:15,00:09:17,"because they demanded to have the eel-pulling,"
00:09:17,00:09:19,but the eel survived apparently.
00:09:19,00:09:19,- That's incredible.
00:09:19,00:09:22,Have you guys heard about the police riots?
00:09:22,00:09:24,This is the thing that happened in New York in the 1850s.
00:09:24,00:09:25,These are so cool.
00:09:25,00:09:27,"There was a time in the 1850s in New York,"
00:09:27,00:09:31,where there were two rival police forces in New York.
00:09:31,00:09:32,What could go wrong?
00:09:32,00:09:34,Everything went wrong.
00:09:34,00:09:35,"The state had created a police force,"
00:09:35,00:09:36,"and that was an official one,"
00:09:36,00:09:38,"but the mayor, who was from the other political party,"
00:09:38,00:09:41,"had his own police force already established,"
00:09:41,00:09:42,and the state was trying to take over it.
00:09:42,00:09:44,"And what they started doing, the two forces,"
00:09:44,00:09:46,they started stealing criminals from each other.
00:09:46,00:09:48,(laughing)
00:09:48,00:09:49,"So they would arrest someone,"
00:09:49,00:09:51,"and then the other police would turn up and say,"
00:09:51,00:09:52,"""We're having him."""
00:09:52,00:09:54,And then the police would start beating each other up
00:09:54,00:09:55,to try and arrest the criminal.
00:09:55,00:09:57,- But then presumably they have to arrest each other
00:09:57,00:09:59,for beating each other up.
00:09:59,00:09:59,- They would.
00:09:59,00:10:01,And then the whole thing eventually ended up
00:10:01,00:10:03,in a massive brawl between 850 police officers.
00:10:03,00:10:04,- Wow.
00:10:04,00:10:06,- All the way through the city hall.
00:10:06,00:10:07,- Wow.
00:10:07,00:10:08,- Yeah.
00:10:08,00:10:09,"- You know, Toronto was shaped,"
00:10:09,00:10:12,but sort of Toronto policing was shaped
00:10:12,00:10:15,by a riot between clowns and firemen.
00:10:15,00:10:19,"So, well, there was this riot in 1855"
00:10:19,00:10:21,"when clowns were a bit more hardcore,"
00:10:21,00:10:24,"and it took place in a brothel,"
00:10:24,00:10:25,as I think quite a lot of riots did.
00:10:25,00:10:27,- What were the clowns in the brothel?
00:10:27,00:10:28,- They were all in the brothel.
00:10:28,00:10:29,- They were all in the brothel.
00:10:29,00:10:30,- They were all in the brothel.
00:10:30,00:10:31,- They'd taken their noses off.
00:10:31,00:10:34,"It was, they weren't on the job at the time."
00:10:34,00:10:36,"- They were on a job, but they weren't on the job."
00:10:36,00:10:38,(audience laughing)
00:10:38,00:10:39,"- And the, yeah."
00:10:39,00:10:41,"- I'm afraid it will be extra to smell your flour, so."
00:10:41,00:10:44,(audience laughing)
00:10:44,00:10:49,"- Ooh, big feet, you know what they say?"
00:10:49,00:10:52,(audience laughing)
00:10:52,00:10:56,"- So, that happened and then the firefighters turned up,"
00:10:56,00:10:58,and then this fight broke out.
00:10:58,00:11:00,"I don't know what was arriving over,"
00:11:00,00:11:02,but the firefighters just started on the clowns.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"The clowns had just come to town,"
00:11:04,00:11:06,"so they were using their prostitutes, maybe."
00:11:06,00:11:08,"And this huge fight broke out,"
00:11:08,00:11:10,"and a policeman came to break up the whole Malay,"
00:11:10,00:11:12,and it ended up with a lot of people
00:11:12,00:11:14,being really badly injured.
00:11:14,00:11:16,And I think actually they went and met again
00:11:16,00:11:19,"a couple of days later, so they established this rivalry,"
00:11:19,00:11:21,"like the Jets and the Sharks and West Side Story,"
00:11:21,00:11:24,"and so they agreed to meet a couple of days later,"
00:11:24,00:11:26,"and the clowns and the firemen met again,"
00:11:26,00:11:28,and then a fight started because of firemen
00:11:28,00:11:30,"knocked a hat off a clown's head,"
00:11:30,00:11:33,and everyone got wounded.
00:11:33,00:11:37,"And because of that, the police force was regulated,"
00:11:37,00:11:39,"and rules were introduced as to how you put down a riot,"
00:11:39,00:11:42,and how you don't let things get out of hand.
00:11:42,00:11:43,And those rules still remain today.
00:11:43,00:11:44,- Do you know what the good thing
00:11:44,00:11:46,about arresting a bunch of clowns is?
00:11:46,00:11:48,"You don't need as many police cars,"
00:11:48,00:11:53,because you can at least 20 into each.
00:11:53,00:11:56,"Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:11:56,00:11:58,- My fact is that Baby Robbins sometimes eats
00:11:58,00:12:01,so many caterpillars they turn green.
00:12:01,00:12:04,This happens.
00:12:04,00:12:07,There's a new book out called The Robin Abography.
00:12:07,00:12:10,"It's by a guy called Stephen Moss, a pro-priot."
00:12:10,00:12:11,- Oh. - Isch.
00:12:11,00:12:13,"- They turn green. - Oh, yeah."
00:12:13,00:12:14,"- You know what I'm saying? - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:14,00:12:15,- Moss is green.
00:12:15,00:12:20,- It can be like brown sometimes.
00:12:20,00:12:21,- Yeah.
00:12:21,00:12:26,"- Well, they turn green, because they eat a lot of caterpillars,"
00:12:26,00:12:27,"and the caterpillars are green,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,and so they just change colour.
00:12:29,00:12:30,- Not all caterpillars are green.
00:12:30,00:12:32,Do they turn whatever colour the caterpillar is?
00:12:32,00:12:33,- This fact has been pedanted.
00:12:33,00:12:39,- I'll give you a good fact about Robbins turning green.
00:12:39,00:12:42,"- Is it just the breast that goes green,"
00:12:42,00:12:43,or is it the whole Robin? - I don't know.
00:12:43,00:12:48,"- Wait, you didn't even look at a photo of your fact."
00:12:48,00:12:50,- It's very hard to find a photo of a green Robin.
00:12:50,00:12:52,- So spacious. - Very suspicious.
00:12:52,00:12:55,- Although Baby Robbins don't have red breasts today.
00:12:55,00:12:57,- I don't know. - So red breasts are the sign
00:12:57,00:12:59,that you're ready to fight.
00:12:59,00:13:00,So I think Robbins are really famous
00:13:00,00:13:02,"for being very pugnacious, aren't they?"
00:13:02,00:13:04,"They, you know, anyone comes near their territory,"
00:13:04,00:13:07,"they sing that beautiful song, which means get the fuck out of here,"
00:13:07,00:13:08,"and they have that big red breast,"
00:13:08,00:13:10,which means get the fuck out of here.
00:13:10,00:13:12,"And so Baby Robbins for their first sort of year,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,"they don't have red breasts,"
00:13:14,00:13:16,because that's sort of an invitation to fight.
00:13:16,00:13:18,It's something you display when you're ready
00:13:18,00:13:19,"to, you know, get in the boxing ring."
00:13:19,00:13:21,"- Yeah, it's true, because Robbins will attack anything"
00:13:21,00:13:22,"that's red, won't they?"
00:13:22,00:13:24,If you just give them a little bit of red cloth
00:13:24,00:13:26,"or something, like a tiger's bullfight."
00:13:26,00:13:29,- It's so cool. (laughing)
00:13:29,00:13:30,- Do they really?
00:13:30,00:13:32,"- Yeah, they do."
00:13:32,00:13:32,- I'll leave!
00:13:32,00:13:37,"- They do, they do die so much."
00:13:37,00:13:38,They murder each other a lot.
00:13:38,00:13:41,They'll pack each other at the base of the skull
00:13:41,00:13:42,to break each other's spinal cords.
00:13:42,00:13:44,- They're vicious bastards.
00:13:44,00:13:45,"- Yeah, they are."
00:13:45,00:13:46,- I didn't notice.
00:13:46,00:13:48,"Red breast, Robyn red breast, red breast,"
00:13:48,00:13:50,is their surname.
00:13:50,00:13:52,- Well...
00:13:52,00:13:53,(laughing)
00:13:53,00:13:54,- Explain yourself.
00:13:54,00:13:59,"- Okay, in the 15th century, they used to give human names"
00:13:59,00:14:02,to familiar species.
00:14:02,00:14:04,"So it was a red breast, but then there would be like,"
00:14:04,00:14:05,"Robyn, how you do it?"
00:14:05,00:14:08,"It's a Robyn red breast, so red breast is a surname."
00:14:08,00:14:10,"And red breast, it shouldn't be red breast,"
00:14:10,00:14:12,it should be Robyn orange breast
00:14:12,00:14:13,because they have orange breast.
00:14:13,00:14:15,"- Well, you haven't, sorry."
00:14:15,00:14:18,"You just, the fiddled us with changing red to orange"
00:14:18,00:14:20,and going down that line.
00:14:20,00:14:20,- Yeah.
00:14:20,00:14:23,- So are you saying that they used to call birds?
00:14:23,00:14:24,- Yeah.
00:14:24,00:14:24,"- That's true, actually."
00:14:24,00:14:26,"Like, I think one of them's Mavis, isn't it?"
00:14:26,00:14:28,"Like, is it a thrush or something?"
00:14:28,00:14:29,They call Mavis in no place.
00:14:29,00:14:30,- Really?
00:14:30,00:14:33,And Robyn is the only Christian human name
00:14:33,00:14:35,that stuck around in the species name.
00:14:35,00:14:36,"- I think that's right, Robyn red breast."
00:14:36,00:14:38,"Mavis thrush, that was how..."
00:14:38,00:14:40,(laughing)
00:14:40,00:14:41,"But then what you're saying, actually,"
00:14:41,00:14:43,"the other bit is quite true as well,"
00:14:43,00:14:45,which is that they don't have red breasts.
00:14:45,00:14:49,"They have orange breasts, but back then in the 15th century,"
00:14:49,00:14:52,we didn't have the word red amazingly.
00:14:52,00:14:53,We just didn't have the word.
00:14:53,00:14:55,So they said that's orange
00:14:55,00:14:58,'cause that's what they associated as they lumped in to...
00:14:58,00:15:00,- We didn't have the word orange.
00:15:00,00:15:03,That's why we called them red.
00:15:03,00:15:05,(laughing)
00:15:05,00:15:07,'Cause we did have the word red.
00:15:07,00:15:11,"- Usually, I can save that in the edit,"
00:15:11,00:15:12,but I think it might work.
00:15:12,00:15:13,(laughing)
00:15:13,00:15:14,"- Yeah, no."
00:15:14,00:15:16,So the opposite of what I said is true.
00:15:16,00:15:18,(laughing)
00:15:18,00:15:22,"- You know, they measure the size of the red/orange part"
00:15:22,00:15:25,"of Robin's breast, 'cause scientists wanted to know"
00:15:25,00:15:26,"whether they grow or shrink,"
00:15:26,00:15:28,or whether they're particularly big when they're trying to mate.
00:15:28,00:15:30,And you know how they do this?
00:15:30,00:15:32,It's kind of sweet.
00:15:32,00:15:35,So this is a study in Spain that was done a couple of years ago.
00:15:35,00:15:36,And they catch the robins.
00:15:36,00:15:39,"And in the study report, it said,"
00:15:39,00:15:42,"""We placed it gently on its back on a table."""
00:15:42,00:15:44,"And I imagine then tied it down,"
00:15:44,00:15:45,'cause I don't think your Robin lies
00:15:45,00:15:47,on its back on a table unless you do.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"And then they get a bit of tracing paper,"
00:15:49,00:15:51,"and they just put it around the front of the Robin,"
00:15:51,00:15:54,and they trace around the red bit through it.
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And then they measured all the bits,"
00:15:56,00:15:58,and they deduce the male red breast
00:15:58,00:16:00,"get bigger with age and females, don't."
00:16:00,00:16:02,So that's basic science.
00:16:02,00:16:04,You could do that in science class.
00:16:04,00:16:05,- That's really cool.
00:16:05,00:16:06,- Yeah.
00:16:06,00:16:09,- Do you know robins go through puberty every year?
00:16:09,00:16:10,- Every year.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- Every year, imagine that."
00:16:12,00:16:13,- Wow.
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- So towards the summer when the days get longer,"
00:16:15,00:16:17,"their brains get flooded with hormones,"
00:16:17,00:16:19,"their gonads grow,"
00:16:19,00:16:23,"and the males start learning songs to kind of attract women,"
00:16:23,00:16:24,not women.
00:16:24,00:16:26,(audience laughs)
00:16:26,00:16:28,"Sorry, I was going back to my old papers and I was like,"
00:16:28,00:16:31,(audience laughs)
00:16:31,00:16:34,"And then in the winter, they go back down again,"
00:16:34,00:16:36,"the gonads shrink, and their hormones flush out the system,"
00:16:36,00:16:39,and then every summer they get this puberty.
00:16:39,00:16:40,- God.
00:16:40,00:16:41,"- It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:16:41,00:16:42,"- I mean, women get that once a month,"
00:16:42,00:16:44,"so I might still be able to make some sense too,"
00:16:44,00:16:48,"but I'm still most anywhere, apparently."
00:16:48,00:16:51,"So they'll pick any nesting site,"
00:16:51,00:16:53,and I was reading a review of a book
00:16:53,00:16:56,in the telegraph about robins that listed
00:16:56,00:16:59,a series of nesting sites that they'd made.
00:16:59,00:17:02,"So plant pots, a pigeonhole, and a desk,"
00:17:02,00:17:04,"the engine of a World War II plane,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,in the body of a dead cat.
00:17:06,00:17:09,"- Well, that took a real turn, Anna."
00:17:09,00:17:11,(audience laughs)
00:17:11,00:17:13,That was really sweet.
00:17:13,00:17:14,Right till the end.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"- That was a sweet revenge, I think."
00:17:17,00:17:20,"And then there was one that made its nest on an unmade bed,"
00:17:20,00:17:23,"while the bed's owner was downstairs having breakfast,"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"and the owner came upstairs again and thought,"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"""That's sweet,"" and allowed it to nest there,"
00:17:27,00:17:28,and incubate its eggs.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"And it didn't tell me this article,"
00:17:30,00:17:33,what the owner slept on for the subsequent however long it takes.
00:17:33,00:17:35,- I think he slept in a dead cat.
00:17:35,00:17:38,(audience laughs)
00:17:38,00:17:41,"- I was looking at what would happen,"
00:17:41,00:17:44,whether caterpillars can change color for meeting things.
00:17:44,00:17:46,"Okay, I just thought there might be something out there."
00:17:46,00:17:48,"And I found the paper on the internet called,"
00:17:48,00:17:52,"""The Effects of Blue Die in the Food of Caterpillar Species"
00:17:52,00:17:53,"""of Vanessa Caduay."""
00:17:53,00:17:55,"I couldn't quite find out which paper this was from,"
00:17:55,00:17:57,but it's genuinely there.
00:17:57,00:18:00,"And they said, ""Our experiment had lots of problems."""
00:18:00,00:18:03,"First, we did not record all our results correctly."
00:18:03,00:18:06,(audience laughs)
00:18:06,00:18:11,"So what they wanted to do, they wanted to check"
00:18:11,00:18:14,"whether the caterpillars, when they had the blue die,"
00:18:14,00:18:16,whether they'd be blue when they became butterflies.
00:18:16,00:18:19,"So first, they did not record all of those results correctly."
00:18:19,00:18:22,"Next, we miscalculated the number of dead butterflies"
00:18:22,00:18:23,at each group.
00:18:23,00:18:25,Then we mixed up all the labels.
00:18:25,00:18:28,(audience laughs)
00:18:28,00:18:33,"Next, some of our butterflies fell off their cups,"
00:18:33,00:18:36,and then one of our group members knocked over the bin
00:18:36,00:18:37,for the control group.
00:18:37,00:18:40,(audience laughs)
00:18:40,00:18:43,"And then it said, ""All of these mistakes affected our results"
00:18:43,00:18:44,"in some way."""
00:18:44,00:18:46,(audience laughs)
00:18:46,00:18:47,I read about a animal.
00:18:47,00:18:48,It's a really odd thing.
00:18:48,00:18:51,"It's a cave dwelling crocodile,"
00:18:51,00:18:53,which crocodiles don't dwell in caves.
00:18:53,00:18:55,"So this was quite a big finding,"
00:18:55,00:18:56,and they were studying them for ages
00:18:56,00:18:58,'cause they couldn't work out why they were doing it.
00:18:58,00:19:00,And the thing that really stuck out about them
00:19:00,00:19:02,"was that they were bright orange,"
00:19:02,00:19:03,and crocodiles are not bright orange.
00:19:03,00:19:07,"So they were like, ""Oh, that's two things we need to look at now."""
00:19:07,00:19:10,"And the orange thing that they couldn't work out for ages,"
00:19:10,00:19:13,"it turns out that there were bats living inside the cave,"
00:19:13,00:19:15,and they would poo into the cave water
00:19:15,00:19:17,"where the crocodiles were,"
00:19:17,00:19:21,and these crocodiles were being dyed orange by bat poo.
00:19:21,00:19:22,"But it was like in the water,"
00:19:22,00:19:24,and then the water was dying.
00:19:24,00:19:27,"It was like going into like one of those T-shirt tie dye things,"
00:19:27,00:19:29,"and it was just, yeah, it just dyed them."
00:19:29,00:19:33,"And so for a while, we had this mysterious orange crocodile,"
00:19:33,00:19:34,but it turns out they're just covered in shit.
00:19:34,00:19:36,(audience laughs)
00:19:36,00:19:39,"Have you guys seen waxwing birds, like cedar wax wings?"
00:19:39,00:19:42,So they're these birds that they have
00:19:42,00:19:45,really brightly colored yellow tips on their tails
00:19:45,00:19:47,and on some of their feathers.
00:19:47,00:19:50,And so they've had this forever and ever as long as we know.
00:19:50,00:19:53,"And then there's a cedar waxwing that lives in North America,"
00:19:53,00:19:56,which has this really bright yellow tip of its tail.
00:19:56,00:20:00,"And in the last 50 years, it's suddenly been turning red."
00:20:00,00:20:04,And this is because a bunch of Asian honey suckle
00:20:04,00:20:05,"has been brought into North America,"
00:20:05,00:20:07,"and it has these bright red berries,"
00:20:07,00:20:09,"and they eat these really, really red berries."
00:20:09,00:20:11,And it's changing the color of them.
00:20:11,00:20:14,So the cedar waxwing is changing color as a species
00:20:14,00:20:16,because it's eating all these red berries.
00:20:16,00:20:18,That is amazing.
00:20:18,00:20:19,Imagine.
00:20:19,00:20:22,"Well, the orange crocodile didn't do anything for you."
00:20:22,00:20:23,"No, it was good."
00:20:23,00:20:25,I was just imagine they've humans all started
00:20:25,00:20:27,drinking sunny delight or something.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Yes, exactly."
00:20:28,00:20:29,And that happens. It does happen.
00:20:29,00:20:33,"So babies sometimes turn orange if they have too much,"
00:20:33,00:20:34,is it keratin in the system?
00:20:34,00:20:37,"Yeah, too many keratin, too much orange juice,"
00:20:37,00:20:38,and your baby will turn orange.
00:20:38,00:20:39,Yeah.
00:20:39,00:20:40,I've just had a baby.
00:20:40,00:20:42,I don't believe that.
00:20:42,00:20:45,I feel an experiment coming on.
00:20:45,00:20:47,I just know what the report's going to read like afterwards.
00:20:47,00:20:49,"Firstly, we mixed up all the babies."
00:20:49,00:20:55,"OK, it is time for fact number three."
00:20:55,00:20:57,And that is my fact.
00:20:57,00:21:00,"My fact this week is that the Russian Communist leader,"
00:21:00,00:21:06,"Vladimir Lenin, spoke with an Irish accent."
00:21:06,00:21:07,OK.
00:21:07,00:21:10,"Oh, the Russian Communist leader, Vladimir Lenin."
00:21:10,00:21:13,So I think we need to specify that this
00:21:13,00:21:15,is not him speaking Russian in an Irish accent.
00:21:15,00:21:16,"No, no."
00:21:16,00:21:17,It's when he spoke English.
00:21:17,00:21:21,He was taught by an Irish tutor and the way that he spoke.
00:21:21,00:21:22,He just carried.
00:21:22,00:21:23,So whenever people spoke to him--
00:21:23,00:21:25,How do we know that this is true?
00:21:25,00:21:30,"Like, is there a recording of him by singing ""Danny Boy"" or something?"
00:21:30,00:21:31,The Russians have admitted to it.
00:21:31,00:21:32,They said that this was--
00:21:32,00:21:35,"It's not a crime to speak with an Irish accent, Dan."
00:21:35,00:21:37,"It's weird, because the Russians admit to so little."
00:21:37,00:21:40,"Yeah, they were willing to give this away."
00:21:40,00:21:42,"Yeah, I was a terrible investigative journalist"
00:21:42,00:21:43,when I was going-- Did you do the hacking?
00:21:43,00:21:45,"No, OK."
00:21:45,00:21:46,The accent thing?
00:21:46,00:21:47,"Yes, great."
00:21:47,00:21:48,I'm out of here.
00:21:48,00:21:52,"No, he was taught-- we also know it because H.G. Wells met him."
00:21:52,00:21:54,And they had a conversation.
00:21:54,00:21:56,"And he came away going, that was the weirdest conversation,"
00:21:56,00:21:58,"because I was talking to an Irishman,"
00:21:58,00:22:01,but it was Russian Communist leader.
00:22:01,00:22:03,Vladimir was his name--
00:22:03,00:22:05,Lenin.
00:22:05,00:22:07,"Well, apparently Lenin spoke with what's"
00:22:07,00:22:09,"called a ""Rathmines"" accent."
00:22:09,00:22:11,"And ""Rathmines"", apparently, I've never heard of it,"
00:22:11,00:22:13,is in particular area of Dublin.
00:22:13,00:22:15,And he had an accent from this area.
00:22:15,00:22:17,And it meant that not only would people in England
00:22:17,00:22:19,"have struggled to understand him, but people in Ireland"
00:22:19,00:22:22,would have struggled to understand him.
00:22:22,00:22:26,Did you guys know that the posh--
00:22:26,00:22:28,you know the posh American accent that's
00:22:28,00:22:30,in all the Hollywood films of the '20s and '30s
00:22:30,00:22:35,"at the Catherine Hepburn classic icon impersonated,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,but imagine Catherine Hepburn in a film
00:22:37,00:22:39,or Bet Davis or someone?
00:22:39,00:22:42,That posh American accent is not an accent.
00:22:42,00:22:44,So no one real had that accent.
00:22:44,00:22:47,That was an accent that was created for Hollywood.
00:22:47,00:22:52,"So that kind of American English hybrid of the '20s, '30s, '40s."
00:22:52,00:22:54,And then it was suddenly phased out in the '50s
00:22:54,00:22:56,when they thought it was a bit weird.
00:22:56,00:22:58,Was they got accent coaches in to train people
00:22:58,00:22:59,to speak like that?
00:22:59,00:23:02,"And they thought it would make them sound more educated,"
00:23:02,00:23:03,because it had that English vibe.
00:23:03,00:23:05,And the only people who spoke with that voice
00:23:05,00:23:07,were Hollywood actresses and actresses.
00:23:07,00:23:08,That is amazing.
00:23:08,00:23:09,"It's weird, isn't it?"
00:23:09,00:23:10,It's really weird.
00:23:10,00:23:11,Yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"Is that-- so as in, when you then heard"
00:23:14,00:23:17,"their real voice in real life, it was completely different?"
00:23:17,00:23:18,Yeah.
00:23:18,00:23:20,"I mean, I think they got voice coaches"
00:23:20,00:23:22,"to teach them how to just speak like that, really."
00:23:22,00:23:23,But yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:24,So I read Eva Green.
00:23:24,00:23:26,Do you remember she was the--
00:23:26,00:23:31,"she was in the Casina Royal reboot with Daniel Craig, James Bond."
00:23:31,00:23:32,She's French.
00:23:32,00:23:33,And when she did all the interview--
00:23:33,00:23:35,"and I didn't know that when I saw the movie,"
00:23:35,00:23:37,because she did it with a British accent.
00:23:37,00:23:40,"But in the interviews, she thought"
00:23:40,00:23:42,that people are just going to be so bothered by the fact
00:23:42,00:23:43,that I have a French accent.
00:23:43,00:23:46,She did all her publicity in the English accent
00:23:46,00:23:46,that she did with the movie.
00:23:46,00:23:48,"And it was really, really convincing."
00:23:48,00:23:49,Yeah.
00:23:49,00:23:49,You wouldn't know.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Or did you notice in--
00:23:50,00:23:52,"Well, no, I was the same with Dick Van Dyke, actually."
00:23:52,00:23:54,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:54,00:23:57,Yeah.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Poor Dick Van Dyke.
00:23:58,00:24:00,"Last year, he apologized for the accent"
00:24:00,00:24:01,for the first time ever.
00:24:01,00:24:03,"Oh, I'm terribly sorry, though."
00:24:03,00:24:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:06,00:24:08,"He, by the way, he was in the news a few years ago,"
00:24:08,00:24:11,"because he loved Dick Van Dyke, and he fell asleep on his surfboard,"
00:24:11,00:24:13,and he got carried out into the ocean.
00:24:13,00:24:14,What is surfboard?
00:24:14,00:24:15,"Yeah, that is a relaxed surfer."
00:24:15,00:24:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:24:18,00:24:20,"Yeah, and he woke up, and he was in the middle of the ocean,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,and he was being carried by currency.
00:24:22,00:24:23,He didn't know where he was.
00:24:23,00:24:25,"And he said a bunch of porpoises came up,"
00:24:25,00:24:27,and they guided him back to shore.
00:24:27,00:24:29,"And otherwise, we would have no more Dick Van Dyke."
00:24:29,00:24:31,He would have gone off into the ocean.
00:24:31,00:24:32,"Guys, on accents."
00:24:32,00:24:33,"Oh, yeah."
00:24:33,00:24:37,"Do you know Paddy Ashtown, former Lib Dem leader?"
00:24:37,00:24:38,Yes.
00:24:38,00:24:39,Do you know what his name was?
00:24:39,00:24:41,Patrick Ashtown?
00:24:41,00:24:43,"Yeah, so his name-- it's not a funny name."
00:24:43,00:24:44,His name's Jeremy.
00:24:44,00:24:48,"But he was Irish, and the reason we call him Paddy Ashtown"
00:24:48,00:24:51,"is that he went to boarding school in England,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"and everyone called him Paddy, because he had an Irish accent."
00:24:53,00:24:54,No.
00:24:54,00:24:58,"And he said, I just feel comfortable with Paddy now."
00:24:58,00:24:59,Isn't that bizarre?
00:24:59,00:25:01,And he openly embraced it.
00:25:01,00:25:04,"And I suppose it was a different time,"
00:25:04,00:25:06,"but Paddy Ashtown is Jeremy Ashtown,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,where it not for xenophobia.
00:25:09,00:25:11,Wow.
00:25:11,00:25:15,"Well, on that, so there was a study in 2015"
00:25:15,00:25:17,"on the way people perceive different accents,"
00:25:17,00:25:19,"because obviously there are dozens of accents all over the UK,"
00:25:19,00:25:22,and they have different perceptions that come with them.
00:25:22,00:25:26,There was a study that perceived intelligence
00:25:26,00:25:29,that found that the Birmingham accent--
00:25:29,00:25:31,"this is very unfair, but it found that the Birmingham accent"
00:25:31,00:25:34,was so low-rated in the study that it ranked worse
00:25:34,00:25:36,than staying completely silent.
00:25:36,00:25:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:38,00:25:47,Do you remember how this fact was about Lenin?
00:25:47,00:25:48,Yeah.
00:25:48,00:25:51,"Did you know Lenin's body is still hanging around and barmed,"
00:25:51,00:25:53,looking exactly like he does.
00:25:53,00:25:56,"So Lenin's body is there, but he was sort of the first instance"
00:25:56,00:26:00,of that kind of embalming to make bodies look exactly
00:26:00,00:26:01,like they have look for a friend of them.
00:26:01,00:26:03,So pre-Malsytong.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"Yes, yeah, pre-all of those."
00:26:05,00:26:07,"And so now, all other countries who"
00:26:07,00:26:10,"want to embalm their great leaders,"
00:26:10,00:26:14,"like Ho Chi Minh, for instance, and in North Korea,"
00:26:14,00:26:18,"Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, they've all been embalmed,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,and they get sent to Russia periodically
00:26:21,00:26:23,in order to be professionally maintained.
00:26:23,00:26:23,You're kidding.
00:26:23,00:26:24,Is that so good at it?
00:26:24,00:26:25,They don't bring the people there.
00:26:25,00:26:26,They physically quit.
00:26:26,00:26:28,"No, apparently they get sent to Russia."
00:26:28,00:26:32,So I certainly know that Ho Chi Minh is sent to Russia
00:26:32,00:26:34,"every few years to get maintained,"
00:26:34,00:26:35,because they're so good at keeping them.
00:26:35,00:26:37,Imagine the Christmas party at that place.
00:26:37,00:26:41,"When you've got Ho Chi Minh there, Lenin here."
00:26:41,00:26:42,There's a lot of good Instagram photos out there.
00:26:42,00:26:44,That's all I'm saying.
00:26:44,00:26:47,It's time to move on to our final fact of the evening.
00:26:47,00:26:49,And that is Anachasensky.
00:26:49,00:26:53,"Yes, my fact is that in Japan, if you make a mistake at work,"
00:26:53,00:26:56,you can hire someone to get told off by your boss
00:26:56,00:27:00,so you don't have to.
00:27:00,00:27:02,This is so weird.
00:27:02,00:27:05,"I read this incredible article in the Atlantic,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,"and it was interviewing someone who,"
00:27:08,00:27:10,"what's their company called, Family Romance."
00:27:10,00:27:13,And the idea is that you fill the gaps in people's lives.
00:27:13,00:27:15,"People's personal lives, people's lives, generally,"
00:27:15,00:27:16,that need filling.
00:27:16,00:27:20,"And so in this instance, he said he sometimes"
00:27:20,00:27:23,gets hired out to people who salary men.
00:27:23,00:27:26,"And in Japan, that's quite a big thing."
00:27:26,00:27:28,People work for big corporations.
00:27:28,00:27:29,It's quite faceless.
00:27:29,00:27:31,Sometimes they don't necessarily know their bosses.
00:27:31,00:27:32,"And then they make a massive mistake,"
00:27:32,00:27:34,and they're sent to the boss to get told off.
00:27:34,00:27:36,And the boss doesn't know who they are.
00:27:36,00:27:38,"And at this point, this man gets hired."
00:27:38,00:27:40,And he has to go into the boss instead
00:27:40,00:27:41,"and say, I'm so sorry."
00:27:41,00:27:42,I did that.
00:27:42,00:27:43,How embarrassing.
00:27:43,00:27:45,"And he says in this article, he says,"
00:27:45,00:27:46,do you know how we apologize?
00:27:46,00:27:49,We have to get down on our hands and knees on the floor.
00:27:49,00:27:51,"And really say, I'm so, so sorry."
00:27:51,00:27:53,"Well, the boss holds abuse of us."
00:27:53,00:27:56,"And he's paid to do this, so the other boss doesn't have to."
00:27:56,00:27:59,"Is there ever a scenario where like five people are being told off,"
00:27:59,00:28:02,but that one guy's been hired for every single hour?
00:28:02,00:28:04,"And so he's like, you're crap."
00:28:04,00:28:06,"Get out of here, send the next guy in."
00:28:06,00:28:08,Same guy comes back in here.
00:28:08,00:28:10,A series of novelty hats.
00:28:10,00:28:11,Send in the guy with a sombrero outside.
00:28:11,00:28:12,I'm furious.
00:28:12,00:28:17,That interview is unbelievable.
00:28:17,00:28:18,There's firm family romance.
00:28:18,00:28:20,"So the man who founded the company,"
00:28:20,00:28:22,his name is Ishi Yuichi.
00:28:22,00:28:24,And he is acting.
00:28:24,00:28:26,His first success was playing a father
00:28:26,00:28:27,"for a girl who had a single mother,"
00:28:27,00:28:29,and the mother wanted the girl to grow up
00:28:29,00:28:31,with a father figure in her life.
00:28:31,00:28:35,So he has been playing the father of this girl for eight years.
00:28:35,00:28:36,She doesn't know it.
00:28:36,00:28:40,She doesn't know that this man is not her father.
00:28:40,00:28:42,"And he says, if the client never reveals the truth,"
00:28:42,00:28:43,I must continue the role indefinitely.
00:28:43,00:28:44,"If the daughter gets married,"
00:28:44,00:28:46,I have to be a father in the wedding.
00:28:46,00:28:48,And then I have to be the grandfather.
00:28:48,00:28:51,"And he, this is, it's a gig for life he's got now."
00:28:51,00:28:52,He's committed to the job.
00:28:52,00:28:53,You've got to say that for him.
00:28:53,00:28:55,It is amazing.
00:28:55,00:28:58,"Like, yeah, Andy and I have read it and do read it."
00:28:58,00:29:02,But one other thing he does that I think is quite funny
00:29:02,00:29:07,is that he is hired by wives to apologize to their husbands
00:29:07,00:29:09,for having an affair with the wife.
00:29:09,00:29:11,When the real person who had an affair with the wife
00:29:11,00:29:13,has run away.
00:29:13,00:29:16,"So when the husband finds out that the wife's having an affair,"
00:29:16,00:29:20,"quite often, the other guy says, OK, well, I'm out of here."
00:29:20,00:29:23,And so she'll hire someone to go and apologize to him.
00:29:23,00:29:26,And he says his tactic there is that he
00:29:26,00:29:29,goes pretending to be this man who's been shagging the wife.
00:29:29,00:29:31,And he goes and he meets the husband.
00:29:31,00:29:33,And he bows very deeply.
00:29:33,00:29:35,And he apologizes very profusely.
00:29:35,00:29:38,"But also, he dresses and acts like a yakuza,"
00:29:38,00:29:40,as in a Japanese gangster.
00:29:40,00:29:45,"And so he says the husband accepts the apology quite quickly,"
00:29:45,00:29:48,"because otherwise, he may kill him."
00:29:48,00:29:50,That's the technique there.
00:29:50,00:29:53,That's-- but don't yakuza only have four fingers?
00:29:53,00:29:55,He's a good actor.
00:29:55,00:29:58,He can act only having four fingers.
00:29:58,00:30:00,So there's another thing.
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Christian weddings are really popular,"
00:30:01,00:30:05,"as in white weddings, as we know them in Britain."
00:30:05,00:30:09,And 99% of the Christian weddings that they have there are fake.
00:30:09,00:30:11,"So if you're a Westerner in Japan,"
00:30:11,00:30:14,it's often an easy acting gig to pretend
00:30:14,00:30:16,"to be a priest for a couple of hours,"
00:30:16,00:30:17,conduct a wedding ceremony.
00:30:17,00:30:18,You're not a priest.
00:30:18,00:30:21,You don't know any clerical rituals or anything like that.
00:30:21,00:30:22,They happen in a fake chapel.
00:30:22,00:30:25,And it's often just English teachers from the West
00:30:25,00:30:26,making a bit of money on the side.
00:30:26,00:30:28,"Everyone kind of knows his fate, but everyone goes along with it,"
00:30:28,00:30:30,because they like the ritual.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Wait, so people aren't getting married in the ceremony?"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"It's not legally binding, it's, but it"
00:30:34,00:30:36,is what people do for their wedding.
00:30:36,00:30:38,So you would also have the kind of registry office thing.
00:30:38,00:30:39,I think they have a registry office thing.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"But the actual-- yeah, they're sort of big ceremony"
00:30:41,00:30:42,a bit.
00:30:42,00:30:44,One account from one of these guys who conducted--
00:30:44,00:30:47,I think he said he conducted about 900 weddings over the decade.
00:30:47,00:30:49,I know.
00:30:49,00:30:53,He recorded his first-ever wedding rehearsal that he'd done.
00:30:53,00:30:56,"And he showed it to his wife, who I think was Japanese."
00:30:56,00:30:58,And she looked at him conducting a ceremony
00:30:58,00:31:00,and speaking in Japanese to the couple.
00:31:00,00:31:02,"And she said, well, it was good."
00:31:02,00:31:03,But you made one big mistake.
00:31:03,00:31:06,"Instead of saying, you may now exchange rings."
00:31:06,00:31:08,"You said, put the ring in her crotch."
00:31:08,00:31:17,So if you can't afford this guy to--
00:31:17,00:31:19,"when you're at work, to be told off for you."
00:31:19,00:31:20,And there's a cheaper version.
00:31:20,00:31:24,"For about $65 equivalent, you can hire in Japan"
00:31:24,00:31:27,an attractive man to come to your workplace
00:31:27,00:31:29,and gently brush away your tears while you weep.
00:31:29,00:31:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:31:32,00:31:36,The company's called Hanson Weeping Boys.
00:31:36,00:31:38,"And also, in China, there's a big thing at the moment"
00:31:38,00:31:41,with the Uber economy kind of thing.
00:31:41,00:31:46,"So you can kind of get part-time use of washing machines,"
00:31:46,00:31:49,"basket bowls, umbrellas."
00:31:49,00:31:51,There was an umbrella sharing company.
00:31:51,00:31:52,"In fact, that's in our book, isn't it?"
00:31:52,00:31:53,Yeah.
00:31:53,00:31:57,"They lost all 300,000 umbrellas straight away"
00:31:57,00:31:58,when they rented them out and forgot
00:31:58,00:32:02,to put a tracking system on them and no one returned.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Actually, in China, there was the case"
00:32:04,00:32:09,"this year of a man who got married, had his wedding."
00:32:09,00:32:10,And then was arrested because it turned out
00:32:10,00:32:14,he'd hired 200 guests to pretend to be his friends at his wedding.
00:32:14,00:32:17,"And apparently, the bride and her family"
00:32:17,00:32:21,became suspicious when none of them could explain how they knew him.
00:32:21,00:32:23,So they were obviously on a very low wage.
00:32:23,00:32:26,I think they were being paid the equivalent of nine pounds each.
00:32:26,00:32:28,So they hadn't been given a backstory or anything.
00:32:28,00:32:30,"So the bride just came up and said, ""How do you know this guy?"""
00:32:30,00:32:33,"And they said, ""I don't know, I'm being paid to do this."""
00:32:33,00:32:36,"But yeah, that one, he was arrested."
00:32:36,00:32:38,And the happy ending to that story
00:32:38,00:32:40,is that he claimed he was 27.
00:32:40,00:32:43,And it turned out he was 20.
00:32:43,00:32:44,"And in China, I didn't realize this."
00:32:44,00:32:48,The minimum age at which you can legally marry as a man is 22.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"- Really? - And yeah, I know."
00:32:50,00:32:51,I have no idea.
00:32:51,00:32:53,"So yeah, not valid."
00:32:53,00:32:54,We're going to have to wrap up in a second.
00:32:54,00:32:57,So anything before we do?
00:32:57,00:32:59,A Japanese thing.
00:32:59,00:33:01,"There's Japanese word called new hara, which"
00:33:01,00:33:05,means noodle harassment.
00:33:05,00:33:07,And that refers to the hassle that some people
00:33:07,00:33:10,get for slurping their noodles too loudly.
00:33:10,00:33:12,This is a big thing in Japan at the moment.
00:33:12,00:33:15,"Apparently, I'll call into the internet."
00:33:15,00:33:17,And someone has managed to deal with it
00:33:17,00:33:19,by inventing a musical spoon.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"So basically, you have a musical spoon."
00:33:21,00:33:23,"It plays loads of music, and no one can hear you slurping"
00:33:23,00:33:24,your noodles.
00:33:24,00:33:28,"Oh, no, that's not much more annoying."
00:33:28,00:33:30,"Yeah, what does it sing?"
00:33:30,00:33:33,[CHEERING]
00:33:33,00:33:36,Nice.
00:33:36,00:33:39,"Well, OK, speaking of our theme tune, we must wrap up."
00:33:39,00:33:40,Thank you so much for listening.

00:33:57,00:34:00,"You can go to our website, nosuchthingasafish.com,"
00:34:00,00:34:02,"where we have links to our book, The Book of the Year."
00:34:02,00:34:05,"It's out now, and we're going to give a copy away"
00:34:05,00:34:07,in a second to someone from our audience.
00:34:07,00:34:09,We've picked out our favorite fact that you guys sent.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"Andy, what was the best fact?"
00:34:11,00:34:12,This one is from Sam Ward.
00:34:12,00:34:16,And it's that the Lichtenstein Football team's national stadium
00:34:16,00:34:18,is only half in Lichtenstein.
00:34:18,00:34:20,The other half is in Switzerland.
00:34:20,00:34:23,"So for 45 minutes every match, the Lichtenstein goalie"
00:34:23,00:34:24,invades Switzerland.
00:34:24,00:34:26,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:26,00:34:31,And who is that from?
00:34:31,00:34:32,That's from Sam Ward.
00:34:32,00:34:34,"Cool, come and collect your book at the end."
00:34:34,00:34:36,"Guys, thank you so much for having us."
00:34:36,00:34:38,"We're going to be out the back, as I said before."
00:34:38,00:34:39,We're going to be signing our book.
00:34:39,00:34:40,So they're on sale.
00:34:40,00:34:42,"If you want to come say hi, please do anyway."
00:34:42,00:34:43,"Thank you so much, guys."
00:34:43,00:34:44,We'll see you again.
