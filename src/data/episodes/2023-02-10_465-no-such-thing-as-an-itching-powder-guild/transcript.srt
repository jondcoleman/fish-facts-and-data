00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,100
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,660
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,720
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,100
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,260
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:29,400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,360
 And in a particular order, here we go.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,520
 - My fact is that the man who invented

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,640
 the underwater ejector seat once broke his tailbone

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,600
 in six places while testing the system on the ground

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
 rather than in the water.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,560
 - What an idiot.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,120
 - This was a bike called John Rawlins.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,960
 - Yeah.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,120
 - It was very eminent.

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,440
 Well, I didn't know about him.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,920
 I was at a comedy gig a few weeks ago

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,800
 and the comedians started talking to the guy next to me

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,760
 in the audience.

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,440
 And this guy started talking about

26
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,280
 how he was either reading about or related to

27
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,320
 the man who invented the underwater ejector seat.

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
 And the comedian just made hay with it.

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,960
 - Did he?

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,800
 - Still a whale of a time.

31
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,200
 - Had he been speaking to you previously?

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,560
 - He said, he said, anything's better than that guy.

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,800
 And he just, yeah, yeah, they spoke phrases actually.

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
 - That's so amazing.

35
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,640
 Wow.

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,280
 - What a heckle.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,480
 - He just mentioned Sir John Rawlins.

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,320
 I thought underwater ejector seat, I've never heard of that.

39
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,720
 - No, I don't think of that as something

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,440
 that has been invented, in fact.

41
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,280
 - Right.

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,120
 - Sir John Rawlins.

43
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
 - You would be gutted, actually, Anna,

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,960
 if you invented the underwater ejector seat,

45
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
 which you would reasonably assume hasn't been invented yet.

46
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,800
 - Yeah.

47
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,640
 - You wanted to find out about this.

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,000
 - I've drawn up a lot of patents.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,320
 I was about to apply.

50
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,720
 This is devastating.

51
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,520
 - But it's for, it is for planes.

52
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
 But it's for underwater planes.

53
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
 - Yeah.

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,520
 - So.

55
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,360
 - Well, no, no, no.

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,760
 It's for planes that have crashed and gone underwater.

57
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,600
 - Yeah.

58
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,440
 - Underwater planes.

59
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,280
 - Sorry.

60
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,100
 - Yes, yes.

61
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,940
 - So it basically, it works.

62
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,720
 If a pilot is unconscious and the plane is sinking,

63
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,000
 it'll pop out the pilot without the pilot

64
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,840
 needing to do anything.

65
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
 So that's very clever.

66
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,120
 - Why not pop him out prior to hitting the water

67
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,640
 and sinking, like I would argue an ejector seat

68
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,480
 is built to do.

69
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,240
 - I suppose the plane is thinking,

70
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
 maybe he's, maybe he's all right.

71
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,360
 - The plane is thinking, yeah, maybe he's still,

72
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,200
 he or she will pull this round

73
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,560
 and then the plane is into the water

74
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,400
 and the plane realizes, I better step in.

75
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
 - Okay.

76
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,320
 I think it's usually the pilot

77
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,960
 that presses the ejector seat button or pulls the lever.

78
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,520
 I'm not sure the sentient plane has been invented yet.

79
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,520
 - In this case, in this case, it's automatic.

80
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,600
 - Yes, once it hits water.

81
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
 But I think what happens is often,

82
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,680
 if you're trying to land your plane,

83
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,880
 you want to land it rather than eject

84
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,360
 'cause then you can save the plane.

85
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,520
 You can land planes on water as we've seen,

86
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,640
 slowly landed there on the Hudson.

87
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,720
 Maybe you try and do it,

88
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,920
 but then you don't get it quite right

89
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
 and you start sinking.

90
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,360
 - Okay.

91
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
 - Also, it's dangerous to eject

92
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
 when you're too close to the ground anyway.

93
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,560
 Like if you look at the survival rates of ejection

94
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,920
 under a certain altitude, it's a lot lower.

95
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,520
 So, you know, if you're too close to the water,

96
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,720
 if you're just coming into land, you get into trouble.

97
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,280
 - But they are amazing because, okay,

98
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,400
 let's say you were parachuting out of a regular plane

99
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,080
 and it was too low altitude.

100
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,840
 The parachute wouldn't be able to get the grip

101
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
 and so you would plummet and die.

102
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
 But ejector seats are actually designed

103
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
 so that you can eject from a plane

104
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
 while it's on the ground and survive.

105
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,440
 Yes, the rates are low.

106
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,280
 - I didn't know that you could do that.

107
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,120
 - Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

108
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
 - I got a little working on what can propel you up high enough.

109
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,680
 - It propels you up high enough and the parachute works.

110
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,360
 And that's what they're designed to do.

111
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,200
 - There are some, like not all of them do that, I think.

112
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,040
 - No.

113
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,880
 - But they do that.

114
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,720
 - Yeah, you can.

115
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,520
 And you actually, and this was available in the '80s.

116
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,340
 I'm sure we'll get on to Rollins in a minute.

117
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,320
 But this was in the '80s, there was a Soviet pilot

118
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,720
 and he was flying down and his plane had rolled

119
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,240
 and so the cockpit was now facing towards the ground.

120
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,440
 And he was only a few feet from the ground.

121
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,480
 Like he was like, I don't know how many,

122
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,200
 but it was like, let's say less,

123
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,680
 definitely less than 50 feet away from the ground.

124
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
 But he's facing downwards, right?

125
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
 - He didn't, yeah.

126
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,840
 - You pressed the ejector seat,

127
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
 fired him towards the ground.

128
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,440
 Everyone thought he's a goner, obviously.

129
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,280
 - Yeah.

130
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,640
 - Like almost in a cartoon way.

131
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
 - Did they go and look at the 20 feet deep hole

132
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,880
 that had been drilled into the ground by his head?

133
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,720
 - Can we guess?

134
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,560
 - Yeah, go on.

135
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,640
 - Marshmallow factory.

136
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,280
 It's always a moth factory.

137
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,600
 - Yeah, or a mattress factory.

138
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,440
 - Yeah, exactly.

139
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,280
 Just a bit further.

140
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,320
 Just got to get directly over the old pillow mountain.

141
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,080
 - Oh no, that's the broken glass factory.

142
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,480
 - No, they had like an auto gyroscope system in their seat.

143
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,400
 So as it pushed you out, it knew which way was up

144
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,160
 and then it could fire rocket boosters,

145
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,720
 which took him in the right direction

146
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,000
 away from the ground.

147
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,680
 And the amazing thing was that no one knew about this.

148
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,960
 It was Soviet technology

149
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,440
 and the Americans didn't know about it

150
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
 and Europeans didn't know about it.

151
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
 And it was live on television or shown on television.

152
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,880
 So everyone thought he was dead.

153
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,360
 And then suddenly when he survived,

154
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
 everyone was like, holy shit, how did that happen?

155
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,880
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

156
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,240
 - They thought he was dead when he ejected,

157
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,880
 but then they saw him spin around

158
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,720
 and go back up in the end.

159
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
 - I think they thought he was dead.

160
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,440
 Everyone's eyes kind of followed the wreckage

161
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,080
 and then they turned back and he was, ta-da.

162
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,920
 - Yeah.

163
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,760
 - What a trick.

164
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,600
 - So cool.

165
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
 - That was amazing.

166
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,000
 - Quickly back on the original character in this,

167
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
 John Rawlins.

168
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,040
 So Sir John Rawlins, amazing character.

169
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,520
 - Sir John Stuart, Peeps Rawlins.

170
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,360
 - Peeps Rawlins because he was a descendant of Pete.

171
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,200
 - Yeah.

172
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,040
 - Pretty cool.

173
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,860
 - Direct descendant.

174
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,280
 - Apparently I couldn't find the family tree,

175
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,160
 but his father was also hugely decorated

176
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,240
 as a military person.

177
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,080
 He comes from huge stock

178
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
 and he designed the first protected helmets

179
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,040
 using composite materials.

180
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,560
 - He advised the British Standards Institute

181
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,640
 on how to make motorcycle helmets, cycling helmets,

182
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,200
 horse riding helmets, racing helmets.

183
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,320
 So a lot of the helmets we wear today,

184
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,240
 very, very slightly, thanks to some of his research.

185
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,720
 - That's cool, so cool, isn't it?

186
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
 - This is interesting about Rawlins

187
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
 'cause I have often wondered before,

188
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,580
 why are all these helmets different?

189
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,500
 You know, horse riding and cycling,

190
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,380
 it's gonna be very similar if you fall off head first.

191
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,540
 Bet the same helmet will do it,

192
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,060
 but do you think John just wanted to make us an extra buck

193
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,500
 by- - It just looks so stupid.

194
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,340
 - Diversifying.

195
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,060
 - Wearing a bike helmet on a horse.

196
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,900
 - Well, one of my second helmets looks

197
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,620
 a lot like a horse helmet, doesn't it?

198
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,700
 You know that orange one that I wear?

199
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,020
 - It does, it does.

200
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,380
 - I don't look stupid, Andy, do I?

201
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,060
 - No, no, no, no.

202
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,620
 (laughing)

203
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,820
 I was trying to read more about the underwater ejector.

204
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,960
 - Oh, sorry, I'll be saying ejection seat.

205
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,720
 I think this is like a detectorist's thing.

206
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,560
 - Yes, right.

207
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
 - We'll get lots of letters saying it's an ejection seat.

208
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
 I've seen lots of people saying ejection seat.

209
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,680
 - I saw a few things online saying ejection, but yeah.

210
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,520
 - I'm gonna keep saying it.

211
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,920
 And then if you wanna contact James individually

212
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,720
 for saying ejector, we'll just duke it out.

213
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,320
 - I'm going off the James Bond name.

214
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,880
 He would call it an ejector seat, wouldn't he?

215
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
 - Yeah, absolutely would.

216
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,300
 But that's Bond for you.

217
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,520
 - It's such a never- - It's such a never-

218
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,160
 - It's such a never- - It's such a never-

219
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,280
 - But I was reading about someone who ejected

220
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,020
 in 1954, which was just before Rawlins invented

221
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,380
 the underwater ejection seat.

222
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,620
 - Yeah.

223
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
 - And it was off an aircraft carrier,

224
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,900
 a British aircraft carrier, right?

225
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
 And their plane was a thing called the Westland Wyvern,

226
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,740
 right?

227
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,340
 You know, Wyvern is a mythical dragon-y creature.

228
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,300
 Get this, it had folding wings.

229
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,060
 There are these pictures of all the planes

230
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,740
 on the aircraft carrier, and their wings,

231
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,820
 just halfway across, just fold up like elbows.

232
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,660
 - Okay.

233
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,180
 - Like a table tennis table.

234
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,020
 - Exactly, exactly like that.

235
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,860
 - So they like to fly through some mountain-close mountains.

236
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,200
 - That's exactly what it's for, right?

237
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,360
 - That's it, yeah, yeah.

238
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,900
 - Everyone breathe in, we're going through two mountains.

239
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,000
 - No, it's a stash them on the decks of aircraft carriers.

240
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 You can store five planes where you could only store two

241
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,840
 if they had their wings out.

242
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,300
 But honestly, I've never seen it before.

243
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,220
 The wings literally halfway along, they just fold up.

244
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,480
 - Like a butterfly.

245
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,320
 - Amazing.

246
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,140
 - Or a finger.

247
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,460
 In fact, they had two joints.

248
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,160
 (laughing)

249
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,320
 They had two joints in them, so it is exactly like a finger.

250
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,800
 Because if you crook your finger in that creepy way,

251
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
 that's what the wings do.

252
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,480
 - Oh yeah, all right, well they should have done it.

253
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,800
 - They could have closed your finger.

254
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
 - Why didn't they do like a butterfly?

255
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,880
 That would take up much less space.

256
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,760
 - Yeah, you could have folded it right up.

257
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,800
 - Do it at the shoulder.

258
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,940
 Yeah, not the elbow, you idiots.

259
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,280
 (laughing)

260
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,200
 So I thought that the only underwater ejection seats

261
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,580
 were ejection seats that were used underwater

262
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,380
 having not been intended for it,

263
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,120
 because that does seem to happen.

264
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,760
 And I was reading a blog of a guy called Russ Pearson,

265
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,760
 who, did you read about him?

266
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,080
 - Russ is 1969, and he ejected in the Pacific

267
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,520
 off the coast of California from an ejecto seat underwater.

268
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,320
 So he'd crash landed.

269
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,960
 I mean, it sounds like he definitely said,

270
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,200
 I thought I was definitely gonna die,

271
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,600
 'cause obviously I was 20 feet underwater.

272
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,640
 I was sinking incredibly fast.

273
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,080
 I just pressed a button and hoped for the best.

274
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
 It broke his back at the time,

275
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,560
 but I think he was too panicked to notice

276
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
 while he was underwater.

277
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,520
 And somehow, I think there was a boat suddenly

278
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,920
 which turned a light on in the distance,

279
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,680
 which told him where the surface was.

280
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,560
 So he managed to swim up to the surface.

281
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,280
 But he said the worst thing about ejecting underwater

282
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,080
 in an ejecto seat is what do you have to have on you

283
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,920
 that automatically is applied

284
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,840
 when you eject from a plane in the air?

285
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
 - Oxygen?

286
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,760
 - Actually, oxygen is one thing.

287
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,600
 - Lip balm.

288
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
 - Like, what's applied to you?

289
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
 - I haven't phrased this very well,

290
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,040
 and I can understand the errors,

291
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,400
 but I'm talking about a parachute.

292
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,240
 - Oh, yeah.

293
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,080
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

294
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,200
 - So it ejects you with a parachute.

295
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,880
 He made it up to the surface,

296
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,400
 but then the parachute just pulled him down and down again.

297
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,240
 - Oh, no.

298
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,040
 - And he just up there with a broken back parachute

299
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
 pulling him down.

300
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
 And then he said he felt something on his feet

301
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
 and he thought that's a shark.

302
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
 And so he tried to find his shark repellent,

303
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,920
 which for some reason he was carrying in his pocket.

304
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
 - He was a Batman from the 1960s.

305
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,960
 - But he realized it was just the plane.

306
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,120
 And then, yeah, he just about survived.

307
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,240
 He managed to be evacuated on a medical plane.

308
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,080
 - Pretty cool.

309
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,600
 I have a cool thing.

310
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,880
 So the first person to use an ejecto seat,

311
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,600
 I think in the UK was a guy,

312
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,000
 he was an Irish mechanic.

313
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
 He was called Bernard Lynch.

314
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,520
 And he did it in 1945.

315
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,160
 And later he did 32 more ejections from planes

316
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
 to test the stuff.

317
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,720
 - Yeah, he was the guinea pig.

318
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,560
 - He was the guinea pig.

319
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,400
 - The ejecto seat guinea pig.

320
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,800
 - Yeah, for the firm Martin Baker,

321
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
 which is the British firm,

322
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,000
 which makes thousands of ejecto seats and does all that.

323
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,440
 Anyway, I got to speak to Bernard Lynch's son, Dermot.

324
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,480
 I rang him up and we had a cool chat.

325
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,000
 - Yeah, and he had some crazy adventures.

326
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,760
 So once he landed in a field right

327
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,480
 when he was testing an ejecto seat.

328
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,280
 And then he just sort of left his parachute behind.

329
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,520
 I think he tied it to a tree or something.

330
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
 - Yeah.

331
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,200
 - And he just went to the pub.

332
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,040
 - Like a dog poo.

333
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,760
 - Yeah, huge huge dog poo.

334
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,440
 - I'm coming back to pick it up, okay?

335
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,840
 Don't get dressed up.

336
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,120
 - He just went to the pub.

337
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
 And then the team turned up, obviously,

338
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,880
 'cause they track broadly where you're going

339
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,720
 and they're looking for it.

340
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,080
 And so the team from the company arrived at the field,

341
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,480
 thought, oh no, Bernard's, he's died somehow.

342
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
 - He was evaporated.

343
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,560
 - The tree ate him.

344
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,480
 - They phoned his wife, they told him he was dead.

345
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
 And then they found him in the pub.

346
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
 - Straight away?

347
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,320
 - That was premature.

348
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 - Before they found the bunny or anything.

349
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
 They were just like, oh, I'm really sure.

350
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,120
 He tied up his parachutes and then he died.

351
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,960
 - Actually, I've got to say,

352
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,200
 when you were 10 minutes late today, James,

353
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,480
 they did call Paulina on that.

354
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,960
 So you'll want to reassure her.

355
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
 - Such a good point.

356
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,160
 - Yeah, two hours later,

357
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
 they found him in the parking lot.

358
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,760
 - Two hours later.

359
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
 - Wow.

360
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,720
 - He was a legend and he subjected his body

361
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,120
 to so much volunteering to do this.

362
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,240
 'Cause he used to, before he had himself

363
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,480
 fired out of actual planes,

364
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,760
 they erected what sounds to me like one of those things

365
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,040
 that are fairground where you're sitting

366
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,440
 on a big, long bench and it lifts all the way up a pole.

367
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,240
 And then it drops you really hard, do you know what I mean?

368
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,080
 - Yeah, those fairground ones.

369
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,720
 - I think he was like on a reverse version of that.

370
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
 So he would sit--

371
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,000
 - So he was on the pole.

372
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
 - He was reverse polling.

373
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,120
 No, he was on something that would look the same,

374
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,400
 but it shoots you up incredibly fast.

375
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,160
 So it was like a bench attached to a pole.

376
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,480
 - It was more like, if we're talking fairground things,

377
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,160
 it was more like the strongman kind of where you,

378
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,760
 you slam the hammer out and you send the weight.

379
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,000
 - He's sitting on the weight.

380
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
 - He's sitting on the weight.

381
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,080
 - That's brilliant.

382
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,000
 - Yeah, he's bringing love to the top.

383
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,440
 - He was only six inches tall, wasn't he?

384
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,480
 - This worked.

386
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,120
 But he used to just do that until it got too painful.

387
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,880
 So they do it more and more with more and more force.

388
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,000
 'Cause you need maximum force for an ejection seat

389
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,840
 to get people out of harm's way.

390
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,040
 And as soon as it got to such an agonizing level

391
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,360
 that he was like, I don't think we can do this to pilots.

392
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,800
 He'd say, that's max force.

393
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,640
 Next up.

394
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,980
 - He was very tough.

395
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,120
 He did one thing, he refused to eject over water.

396
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
 - Okay.

397
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,780
 - He just wouldn't do it.

398
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,620
 He just wouldn't do it.

399
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,440
 And none of the experiments was he willing to--

400
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,280
 - Oh, okay.

401
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,120
 - No pubs.

402
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,960
 - No water.

403
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,780
 - What?

404
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,620
 - No pubs.

405
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,440
 (laughing)

406
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,540
 - It was because he'd fallen in sheep dip when he was eight.

407
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,200
 And it was a really traumatizing experience.

408
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,280
 He might have nearly drowned or something.

409
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,120
 - Really?

410
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
 - He would form a pool of sheep dip.

411
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,280
 - What's that?

412
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,560
 - It's a chemical solution that you make sheep walk through

413
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,620
 to, I think, keep them clean or antiseptic.

414
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,720
 - It's quite different than an ocean.

415
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,560
 - Yeah.

416
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,400
 - So it's quite strange that you would project one

417
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,240
 onto the other.

418
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,080
 - Yeah.

419
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
 - I guess it must just be a bit of drowning.

420
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,280
 - Sounds more like that thing you go through

421
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,360
 when you're going to a swimming pool.

422
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,200
 - Yeah, it's like that.

423
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
 - It is like that.

424
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:57,880
 - Ah, yeah, yeah.

425
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,720
 That's it.

426
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,560
 Okay, but trauma.

427
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
 - It was enough to traumatize Bernard, yeah.

428
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,280
 - I think that's probably a fair enough request.

429
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,420
 - If you're constantly being lobbed out of an ejector seat.

430
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,140
 - Martin Baker, did he work for this guy?

431
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,980
 - Yeah.

432
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,820
 - Yeah.

433
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,620
 So they have a website, and on the website,

434
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,860
 it has a counter that tells you how many lives

435
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,400
 they've saved.

436
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,240
 - Oh, really?

437
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,080
 - Yeah, isn't that cool?

438
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,300
 Last time I checked, which was when I did this research

439
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,140
 yesterday, it was 7,690 lives that they've saved.

440
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,100
 - I wonder how soon after the ejector seat saving the life,

441
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,140
 they do the counter.

442
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,580
 It'd be cool if they did it in real time.

443
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,060
 - As in they have some kind of thing in the chairs

445
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,900
 that whatever.

446
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,520
 - It actually, when you pull the lever

447
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,040
 and you rock it out of the thing,

448
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,760
 the chair automatically spits out a little form.

449
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,080
 And you have to write.

450
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,400
 I have had my life saved by this.

451
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,960
 - Do you think it ever then goes down again?

452
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,120
 'Cause sometimes, you know, you'll think you've saved

453
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,080
 the life, and then they'll crash into a thorn bush

454
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,920
 or something.

455
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,760
 (laughing)

456
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,800
 Or we think it's, it's like when a goal's disallowed,

457
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,240
 you know, the goal the score goes up.

458
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,300
 But they are actually, yeah, VAR says death.

459
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,080
 - What if, what if that guy was run over by a car

460
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,780
 on the way to the pub with that, with that discount?

461
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,640
 - Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

462
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,080
 - But they were called James Martin

463
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,920
 and Valentine Baker, weren't they?

464
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
 - Yeah, he was an amazing pilot, Valentine Baker.

465
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
 He was Amy Johnson's flight instructor.

466
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
 - Sorry, wait, is Amy Johnson was an aviator

467
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
 from the 30s?

468
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,280
 - Yeah, a sort of classic aviator from the,

469
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,880
 God, the Amelia Earhart sort of period.

470
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,380
 - She was, was she the first to fly across the Atlantic?

471
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,640
 - God, I can't remember now.

472
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,760
 - She was the first to do something.

473
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,600
 - Fly to Australia?

474
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,660
 - Fly to Australia, I think she crash landed on her way,

475
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,740
 though I've seen footage of that.

476
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,900
 - So Amy Johnson, I think I've been to the town

477
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,260
 on the coast in Kent where she disappeared.

478
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,300
 - Did she disappear as well?

479
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,700
 - Yeah, yeah, I think she was flying,

480
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,980
 oh gosh, where is it?

481
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,620
 It's near, there was a Turkish restaurant we went to

482
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,140
 and I had, I had, - Oh yeah, okay,

483
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,700
 I know, that's the Turkish restaurant.

484
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,580
 - I didn't remember it 'cause I ordered the Turnip Juice

485
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,860
 as my drink for the meal.

486
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,900
 - I've heard this story before.

487
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,280
 And the waiter said, the waiter said are you sure,

488
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,720
 are you sure you want the Turnip Juice?

489
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,880
 I said, I'm here, I'm on the North Kent coast,

490
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,200
 I want to experience Turkish culture as it was intended to

491
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,640
 and it was absolutely tough.

492
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,760
 - He didn't like it guys, spoiler, he didn't like it.

493
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
 - Okay guys, so if you wanna know where this happened,

494
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,040
 either Google where Amy Johnson crashed

495
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,320
 or just check out Andy's history on TripAdvisor reviews

496
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,600
 and you'll see it in there.

497
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
 - I thank God you weren't asked to do the eulogy

498
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,960
 at a funeral.

499
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,560
 She was a wonderful person.

500
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,480
 Can I quickly just mention yesterday?

501
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:42,320
 - Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

502
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,140
 - My wife once won a load of teddies

503
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,900
 on a shooting gallery in Hurn Bay.

504
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,740
 - Really?

505
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,580
 - Yeah.

506
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,200
 - So many good personal anecdotes in Hurn Bay.

507
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,760
 - It's a rich place.

508
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,020
 - I went there not long ago,

509
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,700
 but yeah, but I was only making a connecting train

510
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,220
 so I just stayed in the station.

511
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,200
 - That's a better story than both lines.

512
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,900
 (all laughing)

513
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,500
 - I read an article about the ejection club

514
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,300
 at the Waterbaker Run and it was,

515
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,700
 they called it the only club where you have to be thrown out

516
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,540
 to get in.

517
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,940
 - Brilliant, that's really good.

518
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,420
 - I got an alternative to an ejection seat here.

519
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,680
 This is great.

520
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,120
 This is a plane, it's an American plane

521
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,660
 with the Douglas F3D Sky Night.

522
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,500
 - All right.

523
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,340
 - Do you have to say it like that?

524
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,940
 - Yes, you do.

525
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,780
 It was this year's plane and if you had to bail out,

526
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,660
 it was a really small cruise, that's two-seater plane.

527
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,020
 You're sitting next to each other, okay?

528
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,620
 One is the pilot and one is...

529
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,580
 - Co-pilot?

530
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,740
 - No, genuinely doing something else like radar or something.

531
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,740
 - Or getting some drinks.

532
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,900
 - He's got a tiny trolley and he offers the pilot chicken

534
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,540
 or fish about halfway through the flight.

535
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,060
 - Do you want to buy any lottery cards?

536
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,820
 We're selling lottery cards as for charity.

537
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,860
 If you've got any spare change in the country

538
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,980
 you've come from, you can buy these lottery cards.

539
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,900
 - Both flying over Cambodia now, what are you doing?

540
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,420
 (all laughing)

541
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,780
 Yeah, but it's exactly that, you know.

542
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,500
 So anyway, there's this plane, the Sky Night,

543
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,060
 and if they had to bail out,

544
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,460
 the crew didn't have an ejector seat in the plane.

545
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,900
 What they had effectively was a slide.

546
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,660
 - Oh, okay. - Going down and back.

547
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,500
 - Yeah, yeah.

548
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,740
 - So you would just have to pop out

549
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,940
 between the engines of the plane.

550
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,900
 It's, I mean, this sounds incredibly risky.

551
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,240
 You did, obviously you'd have a parachute on

552
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,580
 when you did that, ideally.

553
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,660
 - Yeah, I do always want to, what's the next flavor?

554
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,460
 - It sounds risky, but...

555
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,500
 (all laughing)

556
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,580
 - Are you sure you want to do this?

557
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,260
 This looks pretty risky.

558
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,460
 No, you're right, let's die instead.

559
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,420
 Let's just crash.

560
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,420
 - I'll have the chicken!

561
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,100
 (all laughing)

562
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,340
 - But sometimes they use this plane

563
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,860
 to deploy commandos into the jungle.

564
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,180
 So you'd have one pilot and one commando in the plane.

565
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,020
 And at a certain point,

566
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,740
 the commando just pops down the slide.

567
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,380
 - Really? - It sounds so cool.

568
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,620
 - It sounds amazing.

569
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,420
 - Yeah, I think it was. - Did it work?

570
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,180
 - I think it was incredibly dangerous.

571
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,020
 - It wasn't used for long.

572
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,860
 And I think 'cause it was first used in the A3D,

573
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,180
 which came to stand for all three dead,

574
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,020
 'cause that was three people who would be in the plane.

575
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,540
 And I think it took a long time

576
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,900
 'cause it was sort of behind the seats,

577
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,260
 so you realized you were gonna crash

578
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,740
 and then you had to sort of clamber over,

579
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,580
 you weren't quite a lot of gear.

580
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,900
 - Yeah, it's really cramped, yeah.

581
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,380
 - Squeezing one after the other.

582
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

583
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,100
 - 'Cause even now they say if you lose your phone

584
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,340
 behind the seats, you're not allowed to get it yourself.

585
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,820
 You have to get the attendant to come

586
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,660
 and get your phone for you.

587
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,740
 - And that's in case you fall down the chute

588
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,460
 when you're trying, so. (laughing)

589
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,300
 - It's just the last thing.

590
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,500
 If you love ejector seats and they look so cool,

591
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,380
 and I spent a lot of hours last night

592
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,740
 trying to find the most affordable one,

593
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,580
 but on eBay, they go--

594
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,140
 - Can you try and eject other?

595
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,380
 - They look so cool.

596
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,380
 They sell them to just--

597
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,540
 - Not going to the hospital, did I?

598
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,940
 (laughing)

599
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,940
 - Let me tell you an anecdote about Turkish breakfast.

600
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,520
 (upbeat music)

601
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,020
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

602
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,260
 and that is my fact.

603
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,140
 My fact this week is that there is a school in Massachusetts

604
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,340
 that has had all of its 7,000 light bulbs permanently on

605
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,980
 for over a year and a half now

606
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,300
 because no one knows how to turn them off.

607
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,620
 (laughing)

608
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,980
 So this is a lighting system that was installed

609
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,980
 in Minnichalg Regional High School,

610
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,340
 which is in Massachusetts.

611
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,820
 And the idea was they were thinking,

612
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,060
 how can we have a lighting system

613
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,700
 that's gonna save us a lot of money?

614
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
 And they came up with this.

615
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,180
 They thought this is gonna save us

616
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,860
 hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.

617
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,700
 Unfortunately--

618
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,740
 - 'Cause it happened to be very efficiently built.

619
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,700
 - Yeah, there were LED light bulbs.

620
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,420
 There was, it had dimming qualities on it.

621
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,020
 It was a great system that was energy efficient

622
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,220
 in a way that usual light bulbs wouldn't be.

623
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,580
 And so they decided to go for the system.

624
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,540
 And then during the pandemic,

625
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,300
 something in the system went faulty and failed,

626
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,820
 which meant that the lights weren't dimming.

627
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,300
 It meant they weren't going off altogether.

628
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,420
 It meant basically that close to 7,000 of these light bulbs

629
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,260
 were just remaining on.

630
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,900
 Then it was discovered that actually

631
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,780
 the hardware that was needed to fix it

632
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,140
 wasn't available and they needed to order it from China,

633
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,100
 which had a backlog of orders so they couldn't get it over.

634
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,300
 So as we speak, it still hasn't been fixed.

635
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,140
 They know the problem.

636
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,100
 They've ordered the parts.

637
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,940
 They're arriving.

638
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,900
 I think they have them now,

639
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,020
 but they're not putting them in till March.

640
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,860
 And so--

641
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,500
 - 'Cause they need experts to come and put them in

642
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,340
 and they can't get them.

643
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,500
 It is so mad.

644
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,700
 'Cause it's like taxpayer funded school, obviously.

645
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,900
 So every day you have a reminder

646
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,220
 of what your taxes are going towards

647
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,260
 as you walk past this brightly illuminated school.

648
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,020
 - And it's costing thousands a month.

649
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,860
 - 'Cause they turn the electricity off,

650
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,340
 like as in every night,

651
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,740
 when all the kids go away, you just...

652
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,820
 (imitates electric sound)

653
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,860
 - Yeah, you'd think so, right?

654
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,660
 - Maybe, maybe there's health and safety reasons

655
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,900
 why you can't do that.

656
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,860
 - Feels like there must be something

657
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,700
 that they can use that light for.

658
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
 - Do you know what I mean?

659
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,380
 I mean, there must be a use at night.

660
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,820
 - Put solar panels in there.

661
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,940
 (all laughing)

662
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,540
 That's how I actually, all my electricity in my house

663
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,380
 is I put solar panels underneath all my lights

664
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,420
 and then keep my lights on all the time.

665
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,060
 - Yeah, so it's a big problem.

666
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,860
 It's costing them possibly tens of thousands of dollars

667
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,700
 at this point.

668
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,780
 I mean, it certainly has.

669
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,740
 And some of the teachers try to fix it

670
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,700
 by just taking the light bulbs out themselves.

671
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,620
 Yeah, just going around. - Does that work?

672
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:05,140
 - It does, but they only take out three or four

673
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,980
 as opposed to the 7,000. - You can't do that every night.

674
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,820
 Can you?

675
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,660
 It's 7,000 bulbs?

676
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,500
 You've got a shot.

677
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,740
 - It's further ceiling lights.

678
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,100
 You know, the recessed ceiling lights,

679
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,020
 they're a complete pain in the ass to get in the screw.

680
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
 - Yeah, exactly. - It's my two penny worth.

681
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,420
 (all laughing)

682
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,940
 It's being a bad lighting systems.

683
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,660
 Actually, I had a look in the fish inbox,

684
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,380
 podcast@qi.com, just to see if anyone

685
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,660
 had written in about light bulbs.

686
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,700
 Thank you, Paddy McCray, who wrote in quite a while ago now.

687
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,420
 I hope you're still listening, Paddy.

688
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,380
 This is an incredible fact.

689
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,220
 It's about the terminal five at Heathrow, right?

690
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,300
 - Oh yeah.

691
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,780
 - Which has this beautiful high ceiling.

692
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,020
 Like the bulbs are all about 120 feet in the air.

693
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,580
 And between 2008 and 2013,

694
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,500
 no bulbs were changed in the ceiling

695
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,460
 because they didn't have a good way of doing it.

696
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,300
 And at that point, about 60% of the bulbs had gone.

697
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,580
 And so the reports say that they hired a team

698
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,140
 of tightrope walkers because that was the only way.

699
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,980
 - No. - That's so funny.

700
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,580
 That can't be true. - That's untrue.

701
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,140
 - I'm pretty, look, take it up with the Daily Telegraph,

702
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,940
 who reported that a Cirque du Soleil style,

703
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,460
 high level rope work firm had been engaged

704
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,420
 in taking the bulbs. - So funny.

705
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,740
 But then they would do some of them

706
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,140
 and then some of them would be changed

707
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,020
 by someone in a human cannonball.

708
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,580
 And they would be fired up.

709
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,660
 And then other ones, it would be trapeze guys.

710
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,860
 - Pyramid of clowns, just all doing one,

711
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,460
 very, very rescue there.

712
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,780
 - That's so funny.

713
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,780
 - I'm sure no one was in a costume at Heathrow.

714
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,100
 - I was in Dubai recently

715
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,580
 and there's lots of glass skyscrapers there.

716
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,260
 And they're all, the window cleaners are all done by hand.

717
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,260
 So they have people who are literally like on ropes

718
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,620
 going down all of the highest buildings in the world,

719
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,700
 just cleaning them.

720
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
 - That's a fun job.

721
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,060
 I've always thought that would be a fun job actually.

722
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,420
 - I'm one of those harnesses.

723
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,540
 - They call them rats,

724
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,340
 'cause they're rope access technicians.

725
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,980
 - The main company that does Burj Khalifa,

726
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,820
 which is the highest building,

727
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,220
 if you want to get a job there,

728
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,980
 they show you like a video nasty

729
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,340
 before you are allowed to apply.

730
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,940
 And they show you like really awful examples

731
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,940
 of people who almost fell and stuff.

732
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,380
 And they're like, if you're okay with a video,

733
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,540
 then you can have an interview.

734
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,300
 - Right, do they show you Mission Impossible 4?

735
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,020
 In which Tom Cruise climbs up the Burj Khalifa.

736
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,380
 - And there's a sandstorm as well.

737
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,940
 - Yeah, he's got some special sticky gloves

738
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,020
 and they stop working.

739
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,860
 I think he looks behind them

740
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,060
 and there's a sandstorm approaching

741
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,500
 and they go, whoa, better climb a bit faster.

742
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
 - Well, isn't he responsible

743
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,820
 for making one of these guys have to do extra work?

744
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,140
 Because while he was up there,

745
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,940
 he graffitied Katie Holmes' name.

746
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,300
 Like, I love Katie Holmes.

747
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,100
 Yeah, yeah, and they had to go and clean that off.

748
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,980
 Yeah, that's great.

749
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,900
 - When they first had the electric lights, Edison's ones,

750
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,860
 you would have them in a building.

751
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,540
 Obviously no one had seen them before.

752
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,820
 And so there would be a sign often next to them

753
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,220
 warning people not to try and light the light bulb

754
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,660
 with a match.

755
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,060
 - Wow, that's brilliant.

756
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,540
 - I've seen one of these signs.

757
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,860
 It says, this room is equipped with Edison electric light.

758
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,460
 Do not attempt to light with match.

759
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,500
 Simply turn key on wall by door.

760
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,140
 The use of electricity for lighting

761
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,300
 is in no way harmful to health,

762
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,220
 nor does it affect the soundness of sleep.

763
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,060
 - It does affect.

764
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,100
 If you leave the lights on all night,

765
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,420
 you're gonna have your sleep affected.

766
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,420
 That's just a lie.

767
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,260
 - It was a lie.

768
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,300
 They didn't know at the time.

769
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,220
 They didn't know any better.

770
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,340
 - They didn't, lights on all night, insomnia.

771
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,220
 - I didn't know why you had to have a light bulb.

772
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,900
 Like, why you needed the glass, basically.

773
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,740
 - Go on.

774
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,100
 - Well, it's because it'll react with the oxygen,

775
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:28,940
 the filament.

776
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,540
 - To make a vacuum, right?

777
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,820
 - So if you have an incandescent bulb,

778
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,580
 this is the old, the good old fashioned, you know,

779
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,900
 pre-EU.

780
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,740
 - Oh good.

781
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,580
 - Okay.

782
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,420
 - Oh good, you're one of those.

783
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,260
 - It's the one where you've got the bulb,

784
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,100
 the tiny bit of wire,

785
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,380
 and then you run it through the wire and that grows.

786
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,540
 It's because the filament would react with oxygen

787
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,860
 immediately and then burnouts really fast.

788
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,900
 And if you, as James says, create a vacuum,

789
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,940
 or fill it with an inert gas,

790
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,060
 then it lasts longer.

791
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,980
 But I just, I didn't know actually why.

792
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,900
 I had this moment yesterday,

793
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,260
 where it's kind of an anti-light bulb moment,

794
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,220
 where I was thinking,

795
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,820
 wait, hang on, why don't we just not have the bulb, right?

796
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,140
 - Save our glass.

797
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,780
 - I saved so much glass.

798
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,260
 - And, yeah.

799
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,900
 - What would the safety be outside of that,

800
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,020
 in terms of if you went and touched it,

801
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,860
 rather than burning it in half?

802
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,900
 - But you wouldn't electrocute yourself, or?

803
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,100
 - Yeah, and there's an electric current flowing through it.

804
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,780
 - It's a small current, I think,

805
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,540
 but you would burn yourself, it's so hot.

806
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,380
 - The heat is so cool.

807
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,180
 The level of heat that you have in your own room,

808
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,740
 again, if you're using an incandescent bulb,

809
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,780
 which you shouldn't be,

810
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,740
 'cause obviously they're not as efficient,

811
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,740
 but that filament gets to 2,200 degrees centigrade.

812
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,020
 - Isn't it so weird to think

813
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,460
 you're sitting in your sitting room,

814
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,940
 just biding your time,

815
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,300
 and there's something over there, which is that hot.

816
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,860
 And also the filament is so long,

817
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
 when you look inside an old bulb, it's two meters long.

818
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,780
 - Really? - It's just really,

819
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,020
 really thin, 0.2 millimeters thick.

820
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,900
 This is an old tungsten filament.

821
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,740
 - In Babylon, ancient Babylon.

822
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,860
 - Yeah, yeah.

823
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,700
 - If you wanted to buy enough oil

824
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,700
 to light your front room with an oil lamp,

825
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,780
 you would have to work for 41 hours

826
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,660
 to burn for an hour.

827
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,300
 - Oh, I see. - Okay, so 41 hours work,

828
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,700
 you'd be able to buy enough oil

829
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,820
 to make your light bulb for one hour.

830
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,700
 - Okay, that is rubbish.

831
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,860
 - In 1992, in America,

832
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,260
 you could get the same amount of light

833
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,340
 by working for less than one second.

834
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,180
 - Wow.

835
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,100
 - Imagine being a dad in ancient Babylon,

836
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,220
 getting your family to go around turning off the light.

837
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,340
 - That has taken 40 hours of work.

838
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,300
 I've worked all week for one hour.

839
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,280
 I come back into the room, no one's in the room.

840
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,540
 (laughing)

841
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,220
 - So we've never mentioned, actually,

842
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,320
 the longest burning light bulb in the world,

843
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,420
 which is kind of incredible,

844
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,460
 the Livermore Centennial light bulb.

845
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,220
 It's been burning non-stop brackets

846
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,620
 with a couple of caveats, closed brackets, since 1901.

847
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:02,100
 And I think one of the keys to a success is that it's four watts.

848
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,780
 But it has to be on 24 hours a day

849
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,000
 'cause it's in a fire station,

850
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,060
 so it's to provide a bit of illumination for fire engines.

851
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,060
 And Guinness says there's been one break in its operation

852
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,420
 when it was taken from one station to another in the '70s.

853
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,300
 And on that occasion, it had, apparently,

854
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,820
 it says on its own website,

855
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,820
 "A full police and fire truck escort to take it to its site."

856
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,260
 - It's just the fire truck taking it to another place.

857
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,100
 - I don't, you can't call that an escort

858
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,340
 if you're bringing your own thing.

859
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,060
 - Escort implied to me there was another fire truck

860
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,260
 running alongside it,

861
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,180
 kind of stopping anyone else from getting here,

862
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,100
 like a bodyguard.

863
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,900
 - I'm more, for the longest light bulb in the world,

864
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,300
 I'm more interested in the fourth longest

865
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,380
 lasting light bulb in the world.

866
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,740
 Because it was, so this is a light bulb

867
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,500
 that is in New York City, it's not there anymore.

868
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,300
 But at the time, it was outside a place

869
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,540
 called the Gasnik Supply, which was a hardware store.

870
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,900
 And the owner, Jack Gasnik,

871
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,380
 he was the guy who was trying to get it acknowledged

872
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,460
 to be older than all of the other light bulbs.

873
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,940
 But to the point of like, he was furious.

874
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,140
 He was like, "There's no way that the Livermore light bulb

875
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,700
 is an actual genuine light bulb."

876
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,940
 He wrote to Dear Abby,

877
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,900
 which was like one of those agony aunt things,

878
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,740
 saying, "What do I do?

879
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,780
 I've got a light bulb that's lasted longer."

880
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,780
 - That must have been a nice day for Abby.

881
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,620
 - Yeah.

882
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,660
 - He's normally writing about people having affairs.

883
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,500
 - Yeah.

884
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,980
 - He's like, "Oh, finally, a light bulb."

885
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
 - Yeah.

886
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,220
 And he wrote to Guinness saying,

887
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,140
 "This is insane that you've given this record.

888
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,700
 It's clearly a fake light bulb.

889
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
 My light bulb."

890
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,380
 - A fake light bulb?

891
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,620
 - He's like a cardboard cashier.

892
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,140
 - He thinks something was going on.

893
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,580
 So he said that the bulb is not dark enough

894
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,980
 to have burned consistently.

895
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,180
 So he said, "Right away, I saw it was so clear.

896
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,980
 It does not show any sign of carbonization.

897
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,980
 A bulb that has burned 20, 30, 40 years

898
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,060
 would be extremely dark from the carbon.

899
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,900
 Two, the bulb is a brass-term knob socket.

900
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,860
 You can't have a bulb burn continuously

901
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,700
 in a brass-term knob socket.

902
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,100
 - I strongly disagree.

903
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,700
 - It would get so hot, it would burn the wires.

904
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,460
 Yeah, so there was a big challenge

905
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,620
 and no one accepted it.

906
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,060
 - When you said this one isn't there anymore in New York,

907
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,300
 has it gone off or is it, do we know what's happened to it?

908
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,860
 - The whole of that block,

909
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,820
 the half block was sort of taken down to the ground.

910
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,460
 So as far as we know--

911
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,860
 - By the sky in a rage.

912
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,220
 - No, by Livermore and it's Mafia.

913
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,060
 - There was a huge fire.

914
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,940
 - You know when you try and build a new house

915
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,140
 and they say, oh, sorry, there's some really,

916
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,340
 like, there's some lizards here

917
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,060
 that are going extinct or something.

918
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,300
 It does feel like you shouldn't be able to knock down

919
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,780
 a house that has the four-foldest light bulb in it.

920
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,100
 - Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

921
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,940
 - Conservation.

922
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,220
 - There is an older one in the UK, an older light bulb,

923
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,980
 then the Livermore one, yeah.

924
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,820
 - Is there?

925
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:43,780
 - Yeah, but it just hasn't been on all the time.

926
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,620
 - Oh, right.

927
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,060
 - So this tragic person's just kept to use light bulb.

928
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,180
 - Pretty much, yeah.

929
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,100
 It's called the Ediswan light bulb.

930
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,100
 It was first turned on in 1883 in Haitian in England

931
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,060
 and it's owned by someone called Beth Crook,

932
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,460
 or at least it was when I read this article.

933
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,860
 But yeah, they don't really turn it on very often.

934
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,100
 - I think that's sensible.

935
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,940
 - Yeah, makes sense.

936
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,140
 - I think they have special occasions.

937
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,860
 - Well, some people think that the Livermore one

938
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,860
 has lasted so long because it's never turned off.

939
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,180
 Because when you turn something off,

940
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,140
 sometimes it's like a surge of electricity

941
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,580
 and stuff that can damage the filament.

942
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,860
 Whereas this has always had four watts just--

943
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,460
 - I did that with my computer.

944
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
 - Yeah.

945
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,100
 - If I turn it off, I think horrible things will happen.

946
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,540
 So I just keep flogging it on for a few more years.

947
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,140
 - I do the same with my car engine.

948
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,720
 (upbeat music)

949
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:37,340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

950
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,620
 - My fact is that in 1955,

951
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,620
 one person secretly bought almost all the onions in America.

952
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,980
 (laughing)

953
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,420
 This is a guy called Vince Kosuga

954
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,540
 and he was an onion farmer in the 1930s.

955
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,780
 And he thought, "I wanna take this bigger."

956
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:59,140
 And so he decided to corner the entire onion market

957
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,780
 of America by buying all of the onions.

958
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,340
 And so then you've cornered the market,

959
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,380
 you've got all the onions

960
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,380
 so you can absolutely control the price of onions.

961
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,740
 But the thing I find so incredible about this

962
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:14,180
 is that in order to stop word spreading,

963
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,060
 'cause as soon as word spreads that he's doing this,

964
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,540
 then people selling him onions are gonna go,

965
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,940
 "I'm gonna charge away more for these onions then."

966
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,780
 It's not word spreading,

967
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,020
 he would have had to do it completely in secret

968
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,620
 and make sure none of the onion sellers

969
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,460
 are talking to each other,

970
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,060
 going, "Did that guy have Vince come through last?"

971
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,140
 - So he would just go in with a different moustache

972
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,980
 and a hat and stuff.

973
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,820
 - I think so.

974
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,340
 (laughing)

975
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,540
 - So what he especially bought, he bought onions, yes,

976
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,780
 but he also bought onions before they existed.

977
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,700
 - Potential onions.

978
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,540
 - Yeah, potential onions.

979
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,820
 He bought onion futures.

980
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,780
 - Conceptual onions.

981
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,100
 - Conceptual onions.

982
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,940
 The basic idea is you buy the right to buy

983
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,380
 the future onions for an agreed price,

984
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,020
 you say I'll buy 10 tons of onions from you next year

985
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,660
 for a pound of kilo or whatever,

986
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,340
 and then you have to do that.

987
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,540
 - You're betting that the price will go up in that time

988
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,900
 and you've already made the agreement

989
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,060
 so you'll make the difference.

990
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,260
 - And you could also be screwed though,

991
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,980
 you'd have to still stick to that price

992
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,020
 even if they were worth less at the time,

993
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,900
 but if you bought all the onions,

994
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,460
 - You can charge whatever price you want.

995
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,620
 - Well, but then the weird trick he did was,

996
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,100
 as well as cornering the onion market,

997
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,820
 he didn't stop there, so he bought all the onions

998
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,900
 and then he said to people who wanted to distribute onions,

999
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,420
 you're gonna have to buy them off me for a huge price

1000
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,580
 'cause I'm the only one with them.

1001
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,260
 So they did that, he made shed loads of money there

1002
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,460
 and then he thought, sort it,

1003
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,820
 I'm gonna screw these guys over and flood the market anyway.

1004
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,420
 So then, stage two, he went to Chicago

1005
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,140
 with all the onions left over in his warehouse,

1006
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,620
 just lorry load after lorry load, dump them,

1007
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,820
 it sounds like just on the streets in giant sacks.

1008
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,460
 So flooding the market with onions,

1009
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,220
 plummeting the onion price down.

1010
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:46,140
 - Must have been like, onion Christmas.

1011
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,540
 Everyone just walks outside

1012
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,940
 and there's just onions everywhere.

1013
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,140
 - It's quite a shit Christmas actually, I think, isn't it?

1014
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,820
 Stocking filled with onions.

1015
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,820
 Yeah, the reason he did that

1016
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,300
 is 'cause he was betting on onion futures.

1017
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,580
 So he knew he was gonna do this,

1018
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,860
 so he bet that the price would go down.

1019
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,940
 - So he made eight and a half million at the time,

1020
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,780
 money at the time,

1021
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,700
 and for the first initial selling back to the farmer.

1022
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,980
 So he was kind of quits in anyway, right?

1023
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,140
 - Yeah, if you think about it,

1024
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,180
 you've done this brilliant scheme of buying all the onions.

1025
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,700
 You've made a ton of money,

1026
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,780
 but then you're left with all these onions, right?

1027
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,620
 - What are you gonna do?

1028
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,660
 - You need to get rid of the onions somehow,

1029
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,300
 but also make money out of them.

1030
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,180
 You could sell them at the normal price,

1031
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,460
 or you could do this betting

1032
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,980
 against the price going down thing.

1033
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,500
 - The betting thing was very clever, yeah.

1034
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,180
 - How amazing that he pulled it off just by the way.

1035
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,700
 This guy went around America

1036
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,220
 and managed to successfully collect every single,

1037
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,740
 virtually every single onion.

1038
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,220
 I mean, he was brought into Congress

1039
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,580
 because the farmers, once this scheme was discovered,

1040
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,020
 and particularly the second bit that you were mentioning, Anna,

1041
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,260
 about how he screwed them over,

1042
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,500
 they said to their congressman,

1043
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,020
 "You can't have someone doing this."

1044
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,700
 This is, we've always said this is gonna be the problem

1045
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,100
 with future trading and so on.

1046
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,460
 He's monopolized the market, this can't happen.

1047
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,860
 So it wasn't illegal though,

1048
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,220
 but he was brought into Congress,

1049
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,060
 and his lawyer said,

1050
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,900
 "Make sure you just don't lie about anything."

1051
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,420
 And they said, "We understand you own 97%

1052
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,900
 "of the onions in the United States."

1053
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,940
 And he said, "That's incorrect, 98%."

1054
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,820
 Like he was missing 2% of onions in the States.

1055
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
 - So onions are really good.

1056
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,940
 They keep for a really long time.

1057
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,980
 If you keep them dark and dry,

1058
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,780
 they keep for months and months and months on end

1059
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,620
 without going off.

1060
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,100
 But some of them did start to go off

1061
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,860
 because he had lots and lots of onions

1062
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,060
 in the oldies' warehouses.

1063
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,620
 And then supposedly,

1064
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,780
 Kasuga, he had the onions reconditioned

1065
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,820
 to clean them up a bit, repackage them.

1066
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,380
 - Set the few layers off and it'll be like,

1067
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,900
 "Yeah, peel off the mold on the outside."

1068
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,780
 - And then they were sent back into all the warehouses

1069
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,620
 in Chicago where they'd been stored in the first place.

1070
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,140
 But that was assumed to be even more onions

1071
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,980
 coming into the city.

1072
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,860
 We didn't realize those were the same ones as before.

1073
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,980
 People were like, "Oh my God, there are even more onions!"

1074
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,860
 And the prices really collapsed then.

1075
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,220
 And this onion mess that happened in Chicago,

1076
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,460
 it sounds absolutely bananas.

1077
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,660
 Orphans were receiving free onions in the streets.

1078
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,860
 The Chicago River was just taking load after load

1079
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,500
 of onions that were being chucked into it.

1080
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,340
 - Really?

1081
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,180
 - Yeah.

1082
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,020
 - The fish.

1083
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,860
 - Like breath.

1084
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,700
 - Just years after.

1085
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,740
 - They were like, "Fence, why are you crying?

1086
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,540
 You've just made millions of dollars."

1087
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,060
 - I'm a bit confused about why they were starting

1088
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,460
 to be handed out to everyone.

1089
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,300
 The price was nothing.

1090
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,580
 - But who's handing it out at this point?

1091
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,420
 Is it Vince?

1092
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,540
 - Well, let's say you run an orphanage

1093
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,940
 and you want to feed your orphans.

1094
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,300
 You're going to feed them with the thing

1095
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,820
 that costs 10p for a million.

1096
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,660
 - Got it, okay.

1097
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,900
 - Well, it is free in a sack that's been dumped

1098
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
 on your, not great fun for the orphans actually,

1099
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,980
 'cause once you've had 17 meals of just onion,

1100
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
 then it gets old.

1101
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,220
 - It's very versatile.

1102
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,060
 - Yeah.

1103
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:33,100
 - I think onions are one of those base foods.

1104
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,540
 - Who was it who said this about British cuisine?

1105
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,780
 I think it was Athena, actually,

1106
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,100
 Athena Kaplenu, our friend.

1107
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,540
 And she said that basically every English dish

1108
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,660
 begins with an English person cutting up an onion,

1109
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,820
 putting it in a pan with some oil,

1110
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,060
 and then we just decide what to do after that.

1111
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,140
 - Yeah, that's very true, yeah.

1112
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,780
 - You can't leave it on its own, though, can you?

1113
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,740
 It is very much a base, you know?

1114
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,500
 You've got to toss something else in.

1115
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,340
 - Onions soup.

1116
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,180
 - That's, yeah, yeah.

1117
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
 They're the closest.

1118
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,060
 - Onion soup is probably the closest

1119
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,700
 to a natural onion.

1120
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,740
 - Yeah, and really that's 90% cheese.

1121
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,020
 - In 1958, President Eisenhower signed

1122
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,540
 the Onion Futures Act that meant

1123
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,460
 that this could never happen again.

1124
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,980
 And it bans anyone from trading in onion futures, basically,

1125
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,500
 in the United States.

1126
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,660
 But the Onion Futures Act also bans people

1127
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,180
 from betting on the receipts of motion picture box office.

1128
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,780
 - Oh, why?

1129
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,020
 - So, according to the Onion Futures Act,

1130
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,060
 you're not allowed to trade in onion futures

1131
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,300
 or motion picture box office receipt futures.

1132
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,700
 - What the hell?

1133
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,140
 - So, onions and minions, they're the two areas.

1134
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,980
 - Brilliant, and that was because in 2010,

1135
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,220
 the Motion Picture Association of America lobbied

1136
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,740
 to stop people from being able

1137
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,380
 to do these futures in motion pictures.

1138
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,620
 And rather than doing a new act,

1139
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,300
 they just sort of lobbed it on the end of this onion act.

1140
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,380
 - I'm slightly confused about the aspect

1141
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,140
 of motion picture box office receipts,

1142
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,060
 because it's the idea that, I'll make,

1143
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,940
 James Cameron doing this by basically saying,

1144
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,580
 like, I'm gonna buy the rights to all future avatar movies.

1145
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,220
 And then he makes five avatar movies, flooding the market.

1146
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,420
 - That's pretty much what's happened.

1147
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,260
 - He controls all the avatar movies.

1148
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,100
 So, and then there are so many

1149
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,500
 that they're being given away for free

1150
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,140
 to orphans in the streets.

1151
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,740
 I'm slightly confused about that.

1152
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,340
 - Yeah, that's why-- - I thought it might be

1153
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,860
 like a producers thing where you buy them up

1154
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,260
 and then you make a deliberately shit film.

1155
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,500
 And then it doesn't get any box office receipts

1156
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,460
 and you bet against them.

1157
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,220
 - But there were some tax schemes that did that in the UK.

1158
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,980
 There were tax schemes investing money in.

1159
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,220
 Is why there was a rash of particularly bad British comedy

1160
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,260
 films made? - Well, it was actually

1161
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,740
 the way that that worked is that you got tax relief

1162
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,540
 if you invested in a British movie in the same way

1163
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,140
 that if you gave money to charity, you would.

1164
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,420
 - Yeah, and that's the avatar thing

1165
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,540
 that we talked about with Wayne Rooney.

1166
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,460
 - Oh, yes, yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1167
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,060
 - Someone that James and I know from back in the day,

1168
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:55,900
 Gareth Edwards, who made Rogue One, the Star Wars movie.

1169
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,500
 But his first movie that he made was called "Monster."

1170
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,340
 - That's a great film.

1171
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,940
 - It's a great film and that was a tax scheme.

1172
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,660
 That was the company that needed to offset some money

1173
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,380
 and that's how he was funded to make that movie.

1174
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,980
 - Well, that's the most entertaining tax scheme

1175
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,020
 I've ever seen. - Yeah, it was a brilliant movie.

1176
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,180
 - Brilliant movie, yeah, yeah, absolutely brilliant.

1177
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,740
 - Nutmeg, what, the Nutmeg monopoly?

1178
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,220
 Can we talk about that?

1179
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,580
 - Oh, right, sorry.

1180
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,740
 - I was looking up other historical monopolies

1181
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,980
 and the Spice Nutmeg was controlled

1182
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,580
 by the Dutch for-- - Classic.

1183
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,900
 - Decades, oh, a long time.

1184
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,420
 I think they even, that's the thing they traded

1185
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,940
 Manhattan for, the island of Manhattan.

1186
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,500
 They said, "No, the British had it."

1187
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,740
 And then they said, "No, we'll have that."

1188
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,580
 Sorry, they had it.

1189
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:36,980
 And then the British said, "We'd quite like an island."

1190
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,460
 They said, "Well, we want this random spice island

1191
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,660
 "in the Pacific from you." - Yeah, yeah.

1192
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,060
 Bander Island, was that something?

1193
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,300
 - Exactly, exactly.

1194
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,820
 The Bander Islands in Indonesia

1195
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,220
 and the Dutch secured them.

1196
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,140
 Not actually a bad deal trading Manhattan

1197
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,980
 for this spice island

1198
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,860
 because the sheer amount of value they extracted

1199
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,660
 by controlling, you know, really fiercely the Nutmeg trade

1200
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,460
 as in, you know, as with all colonial things,

1201
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,060
 they treated the local people appallingly,

1202
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:03,180
 killing people, importing their own farmers, all of this,

1203
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,100
 like clearing the islands, planting their own trees.

1204
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,740
 And then they got the monopoly in Nutmeg

1205
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,220
 and for about 150 years,

1206
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,500
 they controlled Nutmeg in clothes, pretty much worldwide.

1207
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,380
 They had almost all the Nutmeg in clothes on the planet.

1208
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,140
 Right, it's kind of 98% of it.

1209
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,940
 And if you stole a Nutmeg, they'd come after you,

1210
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
 they'd kill you.

1211
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,140
 They've ritually burned all their excess Nutmeg every year

1212
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,220
 in what must have been a lovely smelling.

1213
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,140
 - Yeah, nice. - Yeah, so nice.

1214
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,380
 - Christmas time, come on.

1215
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1216
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:32,900
 And the markup was about 60,000% between source

1217
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,380
 and street value of Nutmeg.

1218
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
 - Nice, that's a good markup.

1219
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,220
 - A good amount.

1220
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,340
 And if you had a small sackful, you were made for life.

1221
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,260
 - Right. - Basically.

1222
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,020
 - And this was just the bunch of Dutch people

1223
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,540
 who got this island basically.

1224
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,100
 - Yeah, exactly. - This company, great.

1225
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,340
 And this is before everyone knew it was bloody poisonous,

1226
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,740
 so you shouldn't owe them anything.

1227
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,580
 - Isn't it, I see, I have a distant memory of them also

1228
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,820
 as a result, having a monopoly over a certain type

1229
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,860
 of drug as a result of Nutmeg being used.

1230
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,100
 I wanna say MDMA.

1231
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,060
 They were basically the providers of MDMA

1232
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,140
 as a result of this.

1233
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,460
 - I think, well, the monopoly was broken

1234
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,140
 in the late 18th century, so I don't know.

1235
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,700
 - Yeah, yeah. (laughing)

1236
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,780
 - Yeah, no, you read Jane Austen a certain way.

1237
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,860
 You can tell they are.

1238
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,180
 - That was what caused the French Revolution, actually.

1239
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,020
 (laughing)

1240
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,500
 They're all off their tits.

1241
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,860
 - Wow.

1242
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,420
 - Okay, yeah.

1243
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,460
 - And the man who broke the monopoly,

1244
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,300
 or one of the men who broke the monopoly

1245
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,860
 was a Frenchman who called Pierre Poivre,

1246
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,900
 whose name pleasantly is Peter Pepper.

1247
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,220
 - Peter Pepper, yeah.

1248
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,380
 - Very nice. - Good on him.

1249
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,020
 - And he supposedly, he nicked one of the trees

1250
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,140
 out of the way that the Dutch hadn't spotted

1251
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,740
 and made off with it, and then seven years later,

1252
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,660
 well, he's broken, got nutmeg everywhere.

1253
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,540
 - What a shame his name wasn't Pierre Nutmeg.

1254
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,540
 - There is a theory that Peter Piper picked a pack

1255
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,300
 of pickled peppers as based on him.

1256
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,380
 - Right, I like that.

1257
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,700
 - I'm not sure it's true.

1258
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,380
 - But you can see where the theory came from.

1259
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,820
 (laughing)

1260
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,780
 - Just this fact is about sort of someone

1261
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,220
 controlling a market, they're not being any competition,

1262
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,900
 and it just reminded me of one of my favorite things.

1263
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,060
 And I think I learned this

1264
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,620
 listening to a Wondrium course ages ago, actually,

1265
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,980
 but in medieval times, the guilds were really, really strong.

1266
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,660
 So if you're trading produce in a town,

1267
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,180
 you have to be part of a guild.

1268
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,340
 This is in medieval England and France,

1269
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,060
 and not by the European countries.

1270
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,780
 And if you weren't a member of the guild,

1271
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,340
 you would not be allowed to sell.

1272
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,420
 You're carrot or bracelets or whatever.

1273
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,460
 And only two things I could think of.

1274
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,140
 But yeah, the guilds were so strict,

1275
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,820
 so they didn't want any competition

1276
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,100
 between any of their members.

1277
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,980
 You forget that capitalism today,

1278
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,580
 everyone's in competition all the time,

1279
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,940
 that was just anathema to them.

1280
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,020
 So they dictated everything you use to make your produce.

1281
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,100
 So if you're making your carrots,

1282
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,140
 you have to make them with the tool

1283
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,060
 that the guild says you have to make it with,

1284
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,580
 using the exact techniques.

1285
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,460
 You're not allowed to work

1286
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,060
 more than a certain number of working hours.

1287
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,020
 They'll monitor you.

1288
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,620
 Yeah, everything, machinery, everything.

1289
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,780
 And then you get to market

1290
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,180
 and you've done exactly the same as everyone else.

1291
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,820
 And you absolutely can't advertise,

1292
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,780
 which means you literally can't draw attention

1293
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,140
 to yourself at all.

1294
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,980
 - No.

1295
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,180
 - And there were guilds would forbid things like sneezing

1296
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,900
 or nodding at passers-by.

1297
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,940
 'Cause this was thought to be--

1298
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,140
 - That must have been tough for the pepper guilds.

1299
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,380
 (laughing)

1300
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
 - That poor man from the itching powder guild

1301
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,780
 has to stand ramrod still.

1302
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,500
 (laughing)

1303
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,340
 - That's amazing.

1304
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,180
 - Wow.

1305
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,500
 - I did not only want to do anything, really.

1306
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,080
 (upbeat music)

1307
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,940
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

1308
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,540
 and that is James.

1309
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:44,100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1983,

1310
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,140
 an autograph hunter wrote to Steve Jobs.

1311
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,980
 Jobs replied saying that he didn't sign autographs,

1312
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,020
 but he signed that letter and it's sold last year

1313
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,740
 for half a million dollars.

1314
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,580
 (laughing)

1315
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,660
 - That's incredible.

1316
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:59,140
 - Did he put the stamp and put it through the post box

1317
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,020
 and then go, "Oh, damn it."

1318
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,620
 - I think he was knowing Lee.

1319
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,860
 It's written very much as if a gag, I would say.

1320
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,700
 - You may.

1321
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,540
 - You never know, though, you never know.

1322
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,380
 - He said, it's written.

1323
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,860
 He says, "I'm honored you were right,

1324
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,420
 but I'm afraid I don't sign autographs."

1325
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,380
 And it was sold at R.R. auctions.

1326
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,740
 That's the letter R.

1327
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,140
 I know my accent is a bit weird,

1328
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,460
 but R.R. auctions.

1329
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,900
 - So pirate auction signs, man.

1330
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,660
 (laughing)

1331
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,500
 - And they suggested that perhaps there was a photograph

1332
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,060
 or magazine enclosed in the original letter

1333
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,820
 and that he didn't sign that

1334
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,540
 as opposed to it being a joke.

1335
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,900
 But I agree, it does sound kind of like a joke,

1336
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,740
 doesn't it?

1337
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:37,580
 - It does.

1338
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,260
 I have an alternate theory about Jobs.

1339
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,980
 So I was reading a book from 1910

1340
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,020
 called Chats on Autographs by A.M. Broadley.

1341
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,220
 Just a little shout out to him.

1342
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,340
 He'll be really grateful for that.

1343
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,100
 - And he relates in this book,

1344
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,340
 the story of the Archbishop of York

1345
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,580
 who wrote back to an autograph hunter saying,

1346
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,540
 "Sir, I never give my autograph and never will."

1347
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,800
 And then signed it.

1348
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,380
 And maybe it was Steve Jobs doing a little tribute

1349
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,220
 to that.

1350
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,380
 (laughing)

1351
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,060
 - To the Archbishop of York.

1352
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,380
 - One of them, yeah, I don't know which one.

1353
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,220
 - Wow.

1354
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,060
 - Yeah, wow.

1355
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,420
 - Oh my God, and you're the first person ever to get that.

1356
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,820
 And he's finally can rest in peace.

1357
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,660
 - Wow.

1358
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:18,260
 - He was a huge fan of the Archbishops of Northern England.

1359
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,100
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1360
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,140
 (laughing)

1361
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,380
 - I've read a few times

1362
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,500
 where people have tricked others into giving a signature

1363
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,780
 in almost the Steve Jobs-S kind of thing.

1364
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,420
 So for example, Lee Harvey Oswald's mother,

1365
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,500
 one of the ways that she used to make money

1366
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,980
 after the assassination was that she used to sell

1367
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,460
 her signature to people.

1368
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,980
 And got to a point where selling her signature

1369
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,060
 got her quite a good living if she could do it.

1370
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,460
 But what people who would interview her would always

1371
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,820
 trick her, it would be to get her to sign a release form

1372
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,860
 to the interview that they'd filmed or whatever.

1373
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,260
 And then that's how they would get their signature.

1374
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,460
 So yeah, there's all these tricky ways, isn't there,

1375
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,180
 of getting a celebrity signature if they don't give it.

1376
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,180
 'Cause if you don't, we've mentioned Steve Martin.

1377
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,580
 He has a card that he hands.

1378
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,220
 Jonah Hill does the same thing.

1379
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,940
 Instead of signing, if you approach Jonah Hill,

1380
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:06,980
 he just hands a card saying, "I just met Jonah Hill."

1381
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:08,340
 It was a total let down.

1382
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,780
 And that's just on his little business card.

1383
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,700
 - There's a famous story of Dennis Lilly,

1384
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,860
 the Australian fast bowler, Cricketer,

1385
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,060
 who met the queen and asked for her autograph.

1386
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,980
 So she was in Melbourne watching some test cricket

1387
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,340
 and then he sort of queued up and said,

1388
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,420
 "Can I get your autograph, mate?"

1389
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,740
 And there's actually a photo of him.

1390
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,980
 (laughing)

1391
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,060
 - That's pronounced ma'am.

1392
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,500
 (laughing)

1393
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,580
 - Well, in fact, that the first time he met her was earlier

1394
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,540
 and I think he said, "G'day, how are you going?"

1395
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,340
 And then chucked out his hand for a handshake.

1396
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,460
 So he had form with the queen.

1397
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,580
 - Yeah, what's Prince Harry's child called?

1398
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,100
 - Archie or Lilibet?

1399
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,220
 - Lilibet, it's actually named after Dennis Lilly.

1400
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,180
 (laughing)

1401
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,780
 - Made such an impression.

1402
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:51,700
 Well, he obviously did,

1403
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,620
 'cause he said, "Can I have your autograph?"

1404
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,980
 Someone took a photo, actually, of him

1405
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,700
 holding out a notebook and pen

1406
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,180
 and her looking a bit like,

1407
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,540
 "Probably not gonna do that."

1408
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,620
 And she said, "No, I'm sorry, it's against protocol."

1409
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,360
 But then a few weeks later,

1410
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,740
 he received in the post a photograph of that moment

1411
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,300
 when he asked for her autograph signed by the queen.

1412
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:12,460
 - No way! - Oh, yeah.

1413
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,300
 - On people who refuse autographs,

1414
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,260
 friend of the podcast, George Elliott,

1415
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,100
 she instructed her boyfriend, Henry Lewis,

1416
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,100
 to write point blank refusals to anyone who--

1417
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,940
 - Well, she would have to get a massive crayon

1418
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,420
 'cause she would have a huge hand in the room.

1419
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,900
 - There's novelty pencils, yeah.

1420
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,460
 (laughing)

1421
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,100
 Why, why did she refuse?

1422
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,260
 - She's busy.

1423
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,100
 - A little more confused, sorry.

1424
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,540
 - Also, she was quite confused about what her name was,

1425
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,380
 wasn't she?

1426
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,740
 I'm at George, I'm at Marianne Evans.

1427
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:39,060
 Have I got in another suit on him now?

1428
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,900
 - Yeah.

1429
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,940
 - Can I tell you, someone who collected autographs?

1430
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,600
 - Sure. - Queen Victoria.

1431
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:44,440
 - Oh, yeah. - Really?

1432
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,280
 - Yeah.

1433
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,120
 She had this cool thing.

1434
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,960
 I'd never heard of it before.

1435
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,220
 It was called an autograph fan.

1436
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,400
 And it's literally a fan,

1437
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:51,820
 and every separate blade of the fan,

1438
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,780
 you write a different person's signature on it.

1439
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,620
 - Oh, they write it.

1440
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,320
 (laughing)

1441
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,380
 - Even better, they write it on it.

1442
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,540
 - She was a great forger.

1443
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,940
 - But I just love the idea of Queen Victoria saying,

1444
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,180
 "Can I have your autograph to someone?"

1445
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,020
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

1446
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,020
 - It was mostly her children and prime ministers

1447
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:08,700
 and things like that. - Okay, okay.

1448
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,540
 - That's pretty cool.

1449
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,380
 Do we have the fans?

1450
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,980
 Are they in? - Yeah, we just, wow.

1451
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,820
 - I'd love to see those.

1452
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,580
 - Is that why they're called fans?

1453
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,860
 People who ask for autographs?

1454
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,700
 - Yeah, yeah.

1455
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,940
 It's a good legit question, I think.

1456
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,460
 - No, I knew it was not.

1457
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,940
 - I know, but why are they called fans?

1458
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,980
 - Fanatical.

1459
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,820
 - Oh, yeah.

1460
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,660
 - Or.

1461
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,180
 (laughing)

1462
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,940
 - One of the most expensive autographs

1463
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,580
 you can get is a Button Gwinnett.

1464
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,420
 - Button Gwinnett.

1465
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,740
 - If you ever have an autograph of Button Gwinnett,

1466
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,700
 it will cost at least $1 million.

1467
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,060
 - Button Gwinnett. - At least.

1468
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,500
 - Button Gwinnett.

1469
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,220
 Button as in the things that you fasten your clothes with

1470
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,900
 and Gwinnett exactly how you would expect to spell it.

1471
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,740
 - Can we guess?

1472
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,980
 You're leaving us hanging as if maybe

1473
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,820
 we could guess who this person is.

1474
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,740
 - So it's obvious, I reckon it's a,

1475
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,620
 oh no, it won't be a forger, would it?

1476
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,140
 This is the most expensive signature.

1477
00:47:58,140 --> 00:47:59,220
 - It's not the most expensive,

1478
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,380
 but it will cost you at least a million dollars to get it.

1479
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,220
 - I think I know it.

1480
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,100
 - Ooh, go on.

1481
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,340
 - Is it Declaration of Independence?

1482
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,940
 - It is Declaration of Independence

1483
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,740
 and most people have,

1484
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,700
 or a lot of people who collect autographs of people

1485
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,460
 who sign the Declaration of Independence

1486
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,140
 will have 55 of the 56,

1487
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,340
 but Button Gwinnett is extremely rare.

1488
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,300
 He died quite soon afterwards in a duel.

1489
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,260
 Someone called him a scoundrel and a lying rascal

1490
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,820
 and he got in a duel and died.

1491
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,380
 And so there's like maybe a dozen

1492
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,780
 or half a dozen of his signatures out there.

1493
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,260
 And if you want the full set,

1494
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,660
 you're going to have to cuff up at least a million dollars

1495
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,500
 for it.

1496
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,460
 - It's like the rarest football sticker.

1497
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,300
 - Yeah.

1498
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,380
 - They've put it in six packs.

1499
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,740
 - It's amazing because he's like the least famous,

1500
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,500
 one of the least famous ones, right?

1501
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,340
 - Yeah.

1502
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,180
 - But he's still.

1503
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,020
 - By a long way.

1504
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:47,860
 - Although I was, well,

1505
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,300
 I was skimming the Declaration of Independence

1506
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,580
 and you haven't heard of most of them.

1507
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,420
 Trust me.

1508
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,260
 - Skimming.

1509
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,100
 - Why were you?

1510
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,940
 - I happen to be skimming.

1511
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,780
 I was actually.

1512
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,620
 (laughing)

1513
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:56,580
 I would just like to remind myself

1514
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,500
 of the principles of which the country is based.

1515
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,900
 - Everyone else on the buses on their phone.

1516
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,020
 Anna's on her scroll.

1517
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,780
 (laughing)

1518
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,460
 - I think if you're ever on Pointless Listener

1519
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
 and it comes up,

1520
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:08,540
 name someone from the Declaration of Independence,

1521
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,940
 but Gwyneth has got to be.

1522
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:10,780
 - Oh yes.

1523
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,620
 - This is a good one.

1524
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,300
 I reckon most people couldn't get me on the first six or seven.

1525
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,580
 But anyway, the reason I was skimming it

1526
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,740
 was because I was wondering about.

1527
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,460
 - That's right, get me on George Washington.

1528
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,580
 John Hancock.

1529
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,740
 - Yeah, just name the first few presidents.

1530
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,300
 - Ben Franklin, though, was he one as well?

1531
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,500
 - Was Gouverneur Morris,

1532
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,900
 who died with a whale bone off his penis.

1533
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,740
 - Yeah, he was.

1534
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,580
 - I think he was.

1535
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,420
 - He was on there.

1536
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,260
 - Poor guy.

1537
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,380
 - We've got that extra sentence there.

1538
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,460
 - We broke it.

1539
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:37,180
 - We just said Ben Franklin, John Adams.

1540
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,300
 Gouverneur Morris, the guy had the whale bone

1541
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,420
 off his penis and died.

1542
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:41,660
 (laughing)

1543
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:45,620
 - The English getting this Declaration of Independence

1544
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,780
 and reading it, going, it's the guy.

1545
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,100
 (laughing)

1546
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:51,060
 - It's actually part of the signature.

1547
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,540
 They've just added it on afterwards.

1548
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,220
 For anyone doubting who this is.

1549
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:56,020
 - John Hancock.

1550
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,700
 This is why I was browsing it for this,

1551
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,540
 'cause I was thinking about,

1552
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,700
 I wonder what interesting stuff it is

1553
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,740
 about the John Hancock.

1554
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:01,580
 - Oh yeah.

1555
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,220
 - The signature, you know, by word for a signature,

1556
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,740
 'cause he was the first person to sign it.

1557
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,060
 - Yeah.

1558
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:06,900
 - And there's not much,

1559
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,980
 but I hadn't really looked at the signatures there before.

1560
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,940
 And it's really like, you know,

1561
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,860
 if you sign someone's birthday card at work

1562
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,820
 and someone writes their own name incredibly big.

1563
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:18,260
 And it's like, did you not know the rest of us

1564
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,540
 were gonna have to sign this?

1565
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,900
 (laughing)

1566
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,260
 Way more than twice the size of the second biggest.

1567
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,460
 - John Adams has just written, get well soon.

1568
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,300
 - Yeah.

1569
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,140
 (laughing)

1570
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,980
 - See you later.

1571
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,820
 We're just lovely working with you.

1572
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,980
 (laughing)

1573
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,780
 - There's just sport signatures.

1574
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,620
 - Yeah.

1575
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,860
 - There's Luka Dončić, who's a basketball player.

1576
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,700
 - Genius.

1577
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,540
 - He's a big deal.

1578
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,360
 - Yeah.

1579
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,200
 - He's a genius.

1580
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,040
 - Mavericks.

1581
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,740
 - And he's signatures been making the news lately

1582
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,300
 because it broke a record for the most ever paid

1583
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,820
 for a basketball card at public auction.

1584
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,780
 - Okay, wow.

1585
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,380
 - Get these specific cards called logoman cards,

1586
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,660
 or logoman cards, the thing in the basketball world

1587
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,500
 where you have your NBA logo on this card

1588
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,340
 from your jersey.

1589
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,380
 - Feels like it'll be logoman then.

1590
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,060
 - It does, and yeah, some people say logo.

1591
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,920
 So you got your NBA logo.

1592
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,860
 (laughing)

1593
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,260
 Or your NBA logo.

1594
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,100
 - Yeah.

1595
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,100
 - It just depends where you come from, doesn't it?

1596
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,940
 - It does, doesn't it?

1597
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,780
 - Yeah.

1598
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,620
 - Anyway.

1599
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,620
 (laughing)

1600
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,060
 - Are you gonna ask us to guess?

1601
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:14,940
 - Yes, okay, fine.

1602
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,860
 Well, that wasn't gonna be part of it, but sure.

1603
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,980
 So that's sold at most ever paid public auction

1604
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,820
 for basketball card.

1605
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:21,660
 How much do you think for?

1606
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:22,500
 November 22.

1607
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,380
 - $75 if it does.

1608
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,980
 (laughing)

1609
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:28,740
 - Well, Steve Jobs, half a mill.

1610
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,100
 Button Gwinnett, over one million.

1611
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,940
 I'm gonna say it would be somewhere in between the two.

1612
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:36,220
 I'll go for $700,000.

1613
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,300
 - Oh, I like that you've done that.

1614
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,700
 You've undershot it, and it's very generous of you.

1615
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,780
 So it went for 3.12 million and actually sold in private

1616
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:46,580
 the year before for 4.6 million,

1617
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,180
 which doesn't apply to the person who's lost.

1618
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,100
 - So someone just lost a huge loss in a year as well.

1619
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,620
 (laughing)

1620
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:55,100
 - What makes you think you've got this card

1621
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,660
 that you've paid $4 million for?

1622
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,780
 And a year later you're like,

1623
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,820
 you know what, I'm gonna sell it for 3 million.

1624
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,900
 What goes through your head?

1625
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:03,020
 - They must have come up on really hard time.

1626
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,340
 - I think what it was is it was initially bought

1627
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,260
 by Vince Kosuga, and then he sold it,

1628
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,540
 but then flooded the market

1629
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,180
 with all his other Luka signature.

1630
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,980
 - The orphans of Chicago were receiving

1631
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,500
 so many of these bloody basketball cards.

1632
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,060
 - Anyway, the thing I really like about this,

1633
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,500
 which makes me wanna laugh at the fate of whoever bought it,

1634
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,260
 is that his signatures keeps changing,

1635
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,820
 and it's changed a lot since his teens,

1636
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,820
 and there's a lot of chat

1637
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,380
 that actually it's not his signature.

1638
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,220
 - He said his hand replaced.

1639
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,260
 (laughing)

1640
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,340
 - Is that it?

1641
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,780
 - You're so close.

1642
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,020
 - Oh, the basketball has crippled his fingers over the years,

1643
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,500
 and it's changed the way he writes his name.

1644
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,180
 Someone's just forged it.

1645
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,020
 - That's the claim.

1646
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,420
 - He's died and been replaced by another.

1647
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,620
 Someone's just forged it.

1648
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,620
 - Okay, I think James has just said the, yeah.

1649
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,300
 - Keep going, Andy, keep going.

1650
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,980
 - People think he's got the Luka signature,

1651
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,500
 which is his old one, and the Lula one,

1652
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,420
 which is his new one, because it's more feminine.

1653
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,300
 Since he became president of Brazil.

1654
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,460
 - He's like he's been replaced by the president.

1655
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:59,220
 - That's the conspiracy theory.

1656
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,060
 - Wow, I love it.

1657
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,620
 - And as Dan says, he's a genius,

1658
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,100
 so I think he's gonna do a pretty good job.

1659
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,260
 Sorry, it's actually called the Lula one.

1660
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:08,400
 - Since he was replaced by the 80s singer.

1661
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,140
 (laughing)

1662
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:13,860
 - There's been a body swap comedy somewhere,

1663
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,860
 and anyway, it's thought that it's his mother's signature.

1664
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,420
 - Oh, interesting. - Oh, really?

1665
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,260
 - Someone else did that,

1666
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,340
 and in fact, we were talking about presidential signatures,

1667
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,020
 from Ronald Reagan, but when he was an actor,

1668
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:26,580
 not when he was president, he got his mum.

1669
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,300
 I think he paid his mum, or he asked the studio

1670
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,540
 to pay for his mum to sign all of his fan mail,

1671
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,340
 and it's now believed that pretty much everything he wrote

1672
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,820
 from the late 1930s to the late 1950s is suspect.

1673
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,820
 You can't trust any signature from that time.

1674
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,660
 (laughing)

1675
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,860
 Even his Christmas card was probably

1676
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,540
 him getting his mum to do it all.

1677
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,140
 - You know, the whole Berlin Wall thing and everything.

1678
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:46,300
 That was actually his mum. - It was all his mum, yeah.

1679
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,780
 - I'm so glad you clarified it.

1680
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,220
 I thought what you meant, Anna,

1681
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,900
 was not that his mum had written the fake signature,

1682
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,580
 but that he'd changed his signature to his mum's signature.

1683
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,820
 (laughing)

1684
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,620
 - Well, that's because when he was at school,

1685
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,100
 they sent the letter back saying

1686
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,460
 that he'd come to his homework.

1687
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,500
 He used to practice his mum's signature.

1688
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,580
 - Yeah, he knew it inside out, yeah.

1689
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,340
 I'm in the category of autograph collector.

1690
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,820
 - Yeah. - To a certain degree.

1691
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,260
 - Yeah, I like the occasional.

1692
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,820
 Yeah, if I could find one,

1693
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,140
 and I brought in a few of my favorite

1694
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,740
 from my collection just to show you.

1695
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,220
 - So, first off, I've just, you guys can't see

1696
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:21,380
 when I can see the dance bank from where I'm sitting,

1697
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,500
 and I know the story behind this one.

1698
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,300
 - So the first thing I have is a signed Beatles drumstick

1699
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,540
 from the drummer of the Beatles.

1700
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,340
 - Okay. - Yeah, Pete Best,

1701
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,140
 who was the original.

1702
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,060
 - Oh, you got the Pete Best, that's so cool.

1703
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,780
 - Yeah, so I don't remember buying this.

1704
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:40,380
 I woke up one day, and in the post came it,

1705
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,620
 and it turns out I was drunk in a car,

1706
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,420
 and on the way home, I bought a Pete Best.

1707
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,300
 - You got to stop doing that with the driving home.

1708
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,180
 Don't drink and drive and ebay.

1709
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:50,860
 (laughing)

1710
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:51,820
 - So that's the first thing.

1711
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,460
 So drummers love to sign a stick.

1712
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,780
 I like when signatures are appropriate to an item, you know?

1713
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,740
 This I found in a secondhand bookshop,

1714
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,420
 and I know I've shown you guys this before,

1715
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,260
 but for the listener,

1716
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,860
 what it is is a signed Stephen Hawking book.

1717
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,620
 Now, how would Stephen Hawking do his signature?

1718
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,140
 - Kiss, I was thinking, like put lipstick on him

1719
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:10,980
 and kiss the book.

1720
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,820
 - It's kind of close.

1721
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,180
 - It's not too far away.

1722
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:16,500
 What they used to do was is his assistant

1723
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,740
 would dip his thumb into some ink.

1724
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,100
 So I have the thumbprint of Stephen Hawking,

1725
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,660
 and it says thumbprint of Stephen Hawking

1726
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,100
 witnessed by Susan Maisie,

1727
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,220
 who must have been his assistant or a nurse at the time.

1728
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,820
 - It says, "I never give my thumbprint out,

1729
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,900
 "and I will not be doing so on this occasion."

1730
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,140
 (laughing)

1731
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,940
 So that's quite cool.

1732
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,620
 I found that for five quid in a secondhand bookshop.

1733
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,700
 - Here's the last one, which is interesting.

1734
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,140
 This is a baseball.

1735
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:45,980
 - Oh, yeah.

1736
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,700
 - Baseball signed by a Hall of Famer called Gaylord Perry.

1737
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,540
 - Oh, Gaylord Perry, yeah.

1738
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,980
 - Yeah, who is someone I'm fascinated with,

1739
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:53,020
 but we won't go into it now.

1740
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,500
 But what's interesting about this

1741
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,580
 is you can get baseballs that are worth more

1742
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:00,220
 if they're signed in certain ways.

1743
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,900
 So this is worth more than most baseballs

1744
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,880
 would be if he'd signed it differently.

1745
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,260
 So can you guess why this is worth more

1746
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,100
 signed by Gaylord Perry?

1747
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,620
 - He spelled his name wrong?

1748
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:11,140
 - No, no, correct spelling.

1749
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,580
 - So he signed it, there are two seams,

1750
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,420
 or the rather is one seam,

1751
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,740
 isn't there that goes all the way around?

1752
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:18,420
 And he signed it in the nice bow beautifully

1753
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,940
 between the point where the two seams

1754
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,780
 are closer to each other.

1755
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:22,260
 - So that's the first thing, that's absolutely right.

1756
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,260
 So this is what's known as the sweet spot of a baseball.

1757
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,420
 You can get a long signature right across

1758
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:28,420
 without having to break it up.

1759
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,580
 Nothing gets in the way.

1760
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,480
 The other thing is that it's a official ball American League,

1761
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,040
 which is not the NLB, right?

1762
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,620
 So this would be worth less

1763
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,460
 because it's an official Major League baseball.

1764
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,900
 So that shoots it down.

1765
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:47,420
 It has his details, Hall of Famer, 91 on it.

1766
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,140
 So if anyone's a world champion,

1767
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:50,820
 a world series champion or whatever,

1768
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,060
 if they add the detail, that's gonna make it more.

1769
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:53,900
 And then the last thing--

1770
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,700
 - How many, like if you put your name, address, phone number,

1771
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,060
 Twitter handle, it gets better and better.

1772
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,020
 - So there's one more thing

1773
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,540
 it's specifically to do with the signature

1774
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:03,940
 that makes this worth more

1775
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,260
 than a different baseball signature.

1776
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,300
 - Is it 'cause it's blue?

1777
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,060
 - Absolutely, it's blue ink.

1778
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,860
 - It looks nicer with the red scene.

1779
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,580
 - It will also stay on longer than black.

1780
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,620
 Black will rub off according to the experts

1781
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,300
 who auction baseballs off.

1782
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,420
 - I have assigned American football by Colin Kaepernick.

1783
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,380
 - Oh yeah.

1784
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:23,580
 - Which I got when he was an American footballer

1785
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,220
 and now he's a civil rights guy, right?

1786
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:29,740
 But it's signed in like silver writing.

1787
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,500
 And to be honest, I'm not sure it'll last

1788
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,740
 for another 10 years, I think it'll all rub off.

1789
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:35,580
 - Yeah.

1790
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,900
 - Still, it's so nice to get a signature

1791
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,740
 where you can say I got it when he was American football

1792
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:39,820
 and now he's a civil rights guy

1793
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,460
 rather than now he's a pedophile

1794
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,100
 or now he's in prison for massive tax fraud.

1795
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,460
 (laughing)

1796
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,040
 (upbeat music)

1797
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,900
 - Okay, that's it.

1798
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,860
 That is all of our facts.

1799
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:53,380
