00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.100
 - Hello and welcome to another episode

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.660
 of No Such Thing as a Fish,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.360
 a weekly podcast coming to you

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.720
 from the QI offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.840
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.100
 I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.260
 Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.680
 Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.520
 - My fact is that the man who invented

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.640
 the underwater ejector seat once broke his tailbone

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.600
 in six places while testing the system on the ground

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.100
 rather than in the water.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.560
 - What an idiot.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.120
 - This was a bike called John Rawlins.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 - Yeah.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.120
 - It was very eminent.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.440
 Well, I didn't know about him.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.920
 I was at a comedy gig a few weeks ago

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.800
 and the comedians started talking to the guy next to me

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.760
 in the audience.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.440
 And this guy started talking about

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.280
 how he was either reading about or related to

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.320
 the man who invented the underwater ejector seat.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.120
 And the comedian just made hay with it.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.960
 - Did he?

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.800
 - Still a whale of a time.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.200
 - Had he been speaking to you previously?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.560
 - He said, he said, anything's better than that guy.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.800
 And he just, yeah, yeah, they spoke phrases actually.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.800
 - That's so amazing.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.640
 Wow.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.280
 - What a heckle.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.480
 - He just mentioned Sir John Rawlins.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.320
 I thought underwater ejector seat, I've never heard of that.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.720
 - No, I don't think of that as something

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 that has been invented, in fact.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.280
 - Right.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.120
 - Sir John Rawlins.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.960
 - You would be gutted, actually, Anna,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 if you invented the underwater ejector seat,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 which you would reasonably assume hasn't been invented yet.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.800
 - Yeah.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.640
 - You wanted to find out about this.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 - I've drawn up a lot of patents.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.320
 I was about to apply.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.720
 This is devastating.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 - But it's for, it is for planes.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.840
 But it's for underwater planes.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.680
 - Yeah.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.520
 - So.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 - Well, no, no, no.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.760
 It's for planes that have crashed and gone underwater.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.600
 - Yeah.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.440
 - Underwater planes.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.280
 - Sorry.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.100
 - Yes, yes.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.940
 - So it basically, it works.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.720
 If a pilot is unconscious and the plane is sinking,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 it'll pop out the pilot without the pilot

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 needing to do anything.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
 So that's very clever.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.120
 - Why not pop him out prior to hitting the water

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.640
 and sinking, like I would argue an ejector seat

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.480
 is built to do.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.240
 - I suppose the plane is thinking,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.920
 maybe he's, maybe he's all right.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.360
 - The plane is thinking, yeah, maybe he's still,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.200
 he or she will pull this round

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.560
 and then the plane is into the water

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.400
 and the plane realizes, I better step in.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.240
 - Okay.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 I think it's usually the pilot

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.960
 that presses the ejector seat button or pulls the lever.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.520
 I'm not sure the sentient plane has been invented yet.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.520
 - In this case, in this case, it's automatic.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.600
 - Yes, once it hits water.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.400
 But I think what happens is often,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.680
 if you're trying to land your plane,

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.880
 you want to land it rather than eject

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.360
 'cause then you can save the plane.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.520
 You can land planes on water as we've seen,

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.640
 slowly landed there on the Hudson.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.720
 Maybe you try and do it,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 but then you don't get it quite right

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.440
 and you start sinking.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 - Okay.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.520
 - Also, it's dangerous to eject

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.240
 when you're too close to the ground anyway.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.560
 Like if you look at the survival rates of ejection

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.920
 under a certain altitude, it's a lot lower.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.520
 So, you know, if you're too close to the water,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.720
 if you're just coming into land, you get into trouble.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.280
 - But they are amazing because, okay,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.400
 let's say you were parachuting out of a regular plane

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.080
 and it was too low altitude.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.840
 The parachute wouldn't be able to get the grip

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.640
 and so you would plummet and die.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.400
 But ejector seats are actually designed

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.000
 so that you can eject from a plane

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.600
 while it's on the ground and survive.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.440
 Yes, the rates are low.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.280
 - I didn't know that you could do that.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.120
 - Absolutely, yeah, yeah.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.160
 - I got a little working on what can propel you up high enough.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.680
 - It propels you up high enough and the parachute works.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.360
 And that's what they're designed to do.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.200
 - There are some, like not all of them do that, I think.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.040
 - No.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.880
 - But they do that.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.720
 - Yeah, you can.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.520
 And you actually, and this was available in the '80s.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.340
 I'm sure we'll get on to Rollins in a minute.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.320
 But this was in the '80s, there was a Soviet pilot

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.720
 and he was flying down and his plane had rolled

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.240
 and so the cockpit was now facing towards the ground.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.440
 And he was only a few feet from the ground.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 Like he was like, I don't know how many,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.200
 but it was like, let's say less,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.680
 definitely less than 50 feet away from the ground.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.560
 But he's facing downwards, right?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.400
 - He didn't, yeah.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 - You pressed the ejector seat,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840
 fired him towards the ground.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.440
 Everyone thought he's a goner, obviously.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.280
 - Yeah.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.640
 - Like almost in a cartoon way.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.800
 - Did they go and look at the 20 feet deep hole

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.880
 that had been drilled into the ground by his head?

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.720
 - Can we guess?

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.560
 - Yeah, go on.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.640
 - Marshmallow factory.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.280
 It's always a moth factory.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.600
 - Yeah, or a mattress factory.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.440
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
 Just a bit further.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.320
 Just got to get directly over the old pillow mountain.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.080
 - Oh no, that's the broken glass factory.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.480
 - No, they had like an auto gyroscope system in their seat.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.400
 So as it pushed you out, it knew which way was up

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.160
 and then it could fire rocket boosters,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.720
 which took him in the right direction

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.000
 away from the ground.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.680
 And the amazing thing was that no one knew about this.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.960
 It was Soviet technology

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.440
 and the Americans didn't know about it

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 and Europeans didn't know about it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.400
 And it was live on television or shown on television.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.880
 So everyone thought he was dead.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 And then suddenly when he survived,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.560
 everyone was like, holy shit, how did that happen?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.880
 - Yeah, that's amazing.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.240
 - They thought he was dead when he ejected,

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.880
 but then they saw him spin around

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.720
 and go back up in the end.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.960
 - I think they thought he was dead.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.440
 Everyone's eyes kind of followed the wreckage

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.080
 and then they turned back and he was, ta-da.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.920
 - Yeah.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.760
 - What a trick.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.600
 - So cool.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.440
 - That was amazing.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.000
 - Quickly back on the original character in this,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.840
 John Rawlins.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.040
 So Sir John Rawlins, amazing character.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.520
 - Sir John Stuart, Peeps Rawlins.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.360
 - Peeps Rawlins because he was a descendant of Pete.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 - Yeah.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.040
 - Pretty cool.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.860
 - Direct descendant.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.280
 - Apparently I couldn't find the family tree,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.160
 but his father was also hugely decorated

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.240
 as a military person.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.080
 He comes from huge stock

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.320
 and he designed the first protected helmets

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.040
 using composite materials.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.560
 - He advised the British Standards Institute

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.640
 on how to make motorcycle helmets, cycling helmets,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.200
 horse riding helmets, racing helmets.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.320
 So a lot of the helmets we wear today,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.240
 very, very slightly, thanks to some of his research.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.720
 - That's cool, so cool, isn't it?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.640
 - This is interesting about Rawlins

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.960
 'cause I have often wondered before,

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.580
 why are all these helmets different?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.500
 You know, horse riding and cycling,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.380
 it's gonna be very similar if you fall off head first.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.540
 Bet the same helmet will do it,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.060
 but do you think John just wanted to make us an extra buck

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.500
 by- - It just looks so stupid.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.340
 - Diversifying.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.060
 - Wearing a bike helmet on a horse.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.900
 - Well, one of my second helmets looks

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.620
 a lot like a horse helmet, doesn't it?

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.700
 You know that orange one that I wear?

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.020
 - It does, it does.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.380
 - I don't look stupid, Andy, do I?

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.060
 - No, no, no, no.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.620
 (laughing)

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.820
 I was trying to read more about the underwater ejector.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.960
 - Oh, sorry, I'll be saying ejection seat.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.720
 I think this is like a detectorist's thing.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.560
 - Yes, right.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.880
 - We'll get lots of letters saying it's an ejection seat.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.080
 I've seen lots of people saying ejection seat.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.680
 - I saw a few things online saying ejection, but yeah.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.520
 - I'm gonna keep saying it.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.920
 And then if you wanna contact James individually

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.720
 for saying ejector, we'll just duke it out.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.320
 - I'm going off the James Bond name.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.880
 He would call it an ejector seat, wouldn't he?

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:40.720
 - Yeah, absolutely would.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.300
 But that's Bond for you.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.520
 - It's such a never- - It's such a never-

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.160
 - It's such a never- - It's such a never-

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.280
 - But I was reading about someone who ejected

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.020
 in 1954, which was just before Rawlins invented

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.380
 the underwater ejection seat.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.620
 - Yeah.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.780
 - And it was off an aircraft carrier,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.900
 a British aircraft carrier, right?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.900
 And their plane was a thing called the Westland Wyvern,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.740
 right?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.340
 You know, Wyvern is a mythical dragon-y creature.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.300
 Get this, it had folding wings.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.060
 There are these pictures of all the planes

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.740
 on the aircraft carrier, and their wings,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.820
 just halfway across, just fold up like elbows.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.660
 - Okay.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.180
 - Like a table tennis table.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.020
 - Exactly, exactly like that.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.860
 - So they like to fly through some mountain-close mountains.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.200
 - That's exactly what it's for, right?

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.360
 - That's it, yeah, yeah.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.900
 - Everyone breathe in, we're going through two mountains.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.000
 - No, it's a stash them on the decks of aircraft carriers.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
 You can store five planes where you could only store two

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.840
 if they had their wings out.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.300
 But honestly, I've never seen it before.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.220
 The wings literally halfway along, they just fold up.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.480
 - Like a butterfly.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.320
 - Amazing.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.140
 - Or a finger.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.460
 In fact, they had two joints.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.160
 (laughing)

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.320
 They had two joints in them, so it is exactly like a finger.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.800
 Because if you crook your finger in that creepy way,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.640
 that's what the wings do.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.480
 - Oh yeah, all right, well they should have done it.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.800
 - They could have closed your finger.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.100
 - Why didn't they do like a butterfly?

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.880
 That would take up much less space.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.760
 - Yeah, you could have folded it right up.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:55.800
 - Do it at the shoulder.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.940
 Yeah, not the elbow, you idiots.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.280
 (laughing)

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.200
 So I thought that the only underwater ejection seats

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.580
 were ejection seats that were used underwater

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.380
 having not been intended for it,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.120
 because that does seem to happen.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.760
 And I was reading a blog of a guy called Russ Pearson,

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760
 who, did you read about him?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.080
 - Russ is 1969, and he ejected in the Pacific

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.520
 off the coast of California from an ejecto seat underwater.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.320
 So he'd crash landed.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.960
 I mean, it sounds like he definitely said,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.200
 I thought I was definitely gonna die,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.600
 'cause obviously I was 20 feet underwater.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.640
 I was sinking incredibly fast.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.080
 I just pressed a button and hoped for the best.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.440
 It broke his back at the time,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.560
 but I think he was too panicked to notice

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.120
 while he was underwater.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.520
 And somehow, I think there was a boat suddenly

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.920
 which turned a light on in the distance,

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.680
 which told him where the surface was.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.560
 So he managed to swim up to the surface.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.280
 But he said the worst thing about ejecting underwater

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.080
 in an ejecto seat is what do you have to have on you

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.920
 that automatically is applied

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.840
 when you eject from a plane in the air?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.040
 - Oxygen?

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.760
 - Actually, oxygen is one thing.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.600
 - Lip balm.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
 - Like, what's applied to you?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600
 - I haven't phrased this very well,

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.040
 and I can understand the errors,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.400
 but I'm talking about a parachute.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.240
 - Oh, yeah.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.080
 - Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.200
 - So it ejects you with a parachute.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.880
 He made it up to the surface,

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.400
 but then the parachute just pulled him down and down again.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.240
 - Oh, no.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.040
 - And he just up there with a broken back parachute

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.120
 pulling him down.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.440
 And then he said he felt something on his feet

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.200
 and he thought that's a shark.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.120
 And so he tried to find his shark repellent,

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.920
 which for some reason he was carrying in his pocket.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.760
 - He was a Batman from the 1960s.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.960
 - But he realized it was just the plane.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.120
 And then, yeah, he just about survived.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.240
 He managed to be evacuated on a medical plane.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.080
 - Pretty cool.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.600
 I have a cool thing.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.880
 So the first person to use an ejecto seat,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.600
 I think in the UK was a guy,

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.000
 he was an Irish mechanic.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.720
 He was called Bernard Lynch.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.520
 And he did it in 1945.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:52.160
 And later he did 32 more ejections from planes

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.440
 to test the stuff.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.720
 - Yeah, he was the guinea pig.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.560
 - He was the guinea pig.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.400
 - The ejecto seat guinea pig.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.800
 - Yeah, for the firm Martin Baker,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.640
 which is the British firm,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.000
 which makes thousands of ejecto seats and does all that.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.440
 Anyway, I got to speak to Bernard Lynch's son, Dermot.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.480
 I rang him up and we had a cool chat.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.000
 - Yeah, and he had some crazy adventures.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.760
 So once he landed in a field right

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.480
 when he was testing an ejecto seat.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.280
 And then he just sort of left his parachute behind.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.520
 I think he tied it to a tree or something.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.360
 - Yeah.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.200
 - And he just went to the pub.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.040
 - Like a dog poo.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.760
 - Yeah, huge huge dog poo.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.440
 - I'm coming back to pick it up, okay?

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.840
 Don't get dressed up.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.120
 - He just went to the pub.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.040
 And then the team turned up, obviously,

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.880
 'cause they track broadly where you're going

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.720
 and they're looking for it.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.080
 And so the team from the company arrived at the field,

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.480
 thought, oh no, Bernard's, he's died somehow.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.080
 - He was evaporated.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.560
 - The tree ate him.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.480
 - They phoned his wife, they told him he was dead.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.120
 And then they found him in the pub.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.960
 - Straight away?

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.320
 - That was premature.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320
 - Before they found the bunny or anything.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.480
 They were just like, oh, I'm really sure.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.120
 He tied up his parachutes and then he died.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.960
 - Actually, I've got to say,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.200
 when you were 10 minutes late today, James,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.480
 they did call Paulina on that.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.960
 So you'll want to reassure her.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.080
 - Such a good point.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.160
 - Yeah, two hours later,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.320
 they found him in the parking lot.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.760
 - Two hours later.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.600
 - Wow.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.720
 - He was a legend and he subjected his body

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.120
 to so much volunteering to do this.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.240
 'Cause he used to, before he had himself

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.480
 fired out of actual planes,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.760
 they erected what sounds to me like one of those things

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.040
 that are fairground where you're sitting

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.440
 on a big, long bench and it lifts all the way up a pole.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.240
 And then it drops you really hard, do you know what I mean?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.080
 - Yeah, those fairground ones.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.720
 - I think he was like on a reverse version of that.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.560
 So he would sit--

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.000
 - So he was on the pole.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.280
 - He was reverse polling.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.120
 No, he was on something that would look the same,

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.400
 but it shoots you up incredibly fast.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.160
 So it was like a bench attached to a pole.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.480
 - It was more like, if we're talking fairground things,

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.160
 it was more like the strongman kind of where you,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.760
 you slam the hammer out and you send the weight.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.000
 - He's sitting on the weight.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.240
 - He's sitting on the weight.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.080
 - That's brilliant.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.000
 - Yeah, he's bringing love to the top.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.440
 - He was only six inches tall, wasn't he?

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.280
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:00.480
 - This worked.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.120
 But he used to just do that until it got too painful.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.880
 So they do it more and more with more and more force.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.000
 'Cause you need maximum force for an ejection seat

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.840
 to get people out of harm's way.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.040
 And as soon as it got to such an agonizing level

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.360
 that he was like, I don't think we can do this to pilots.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.800
 He'd say, that's max force.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.640
 Next up.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.980
 - He was very tough.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:23.120
 He did one thing, he refused to eject over water.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.960
 - Okay.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.780
 - He just wouldn't do it.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.620
 He just wouldn't do it.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:26.440
 And none of the experiments was he willing to--

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.280
 - Oh, okay.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.120
 - No pubs.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.960
 - No water.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.780
 - What?

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.620
 - No pubs.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.440
 (laughing)

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.540
 - It was because he'd fallen in sheep dip when he was eight.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.200
 And it was a really traumatizing experience.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.280
 He might have nearly drowned or something.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.120
 - Really?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.440
 - He would form a pool of sheep dip.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.280
 - What's that?

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.560
 - It's a chemical solution that you make sheep walk through

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.620
 to, I think, keep them clean or antiseptic.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.720
 - It's quite different than an ocean.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.560
 - Yeah.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.400
 - So it's quite strange that you would project one

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.240
 onto the other.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.080
 - Yeah.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.000
 - I guess it must just be a bit of drowning.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.280
 - Sounds more like that thing you go through

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.360
 when you're going to a swimming pool.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.200
 - Yeah, it's like that.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.040
 - It is like that.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.880
 - Ah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.720
 That's it.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.560
 Okay, but trauma.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.400
 - It was enough to traumatize Bernard, yeah.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.280
 - I think that's probably a fair enough request.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.420
 - If you're constantly being lobbed out of an ejector seat.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.140
 - Martin Baker, did he work for this guy?

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.980
 - Yeah.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:09.820
 - Yeah.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.620
 So they have a website, and on the website,

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.860
 it has a counter that tells you how many lives

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.400
 they've saved.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.240
 - Oh, really?

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.080
 - Yeah, isn't that cool?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.300
 Last time I checked, which was when I did this research

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:26.140
 yesterday, it was 7,690 lives that they've saved.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.100
 - I wonder how soon after the ejector seat saving the life,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.140
 they do the counter.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.580
 It'd be cool if they did it in real time.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.420
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:37.060
 - As in they have some kind of thing in the chairs

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.900
 that whatever.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.520
 - It actually, when you pull the lever

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.040
 and you rock it out of the thing,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.760
 the chair automatically spits out a little form.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.080
 And you have to write.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.400
 I have had my life saved by this.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.960
 - Do you think it ever then goes down again?

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.120
 'Cause sometimes, you know, you'll think you've saved

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.080
 the life, and then they'll crash into a thorn bush

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.920
 or something.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.760
 (laughing)

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.800
 Or we think it's, it's like when a goal's disallowed,

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.240
 you know, the goal the score goes up.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.300
 But they are actually, yeah, VAR says death.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.080
 - What if, what if that guy was run over by a car

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.780
 on the way to the pub with that, with that discount?

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.640
 - Yeah, yeah, I don't know.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.080
 - But they were called James Martin

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.920
 and Valentine Baker, weren't they?

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.720
 - Yeah, he was an amazing pilot, Valentine Baker.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.480
 He was Amy Johnson's flight instructor.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.800
 - Sorry, wait, is Amy Johnson was an aviator

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.640
 from the 30s?

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.280
 - Yeah, a sort of classic aviator from the,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.880
 God, the Amelia Earhart sort of period.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.380
 - She was, was she the first to fly across the Atlantic?

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.640
 - God, I can't remember now.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.760
 - She was the first to do something.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.600
 - Fly to Australia?

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.660
 - Fly to Australia, I think she crash landed on her way,

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:34.740
 though I've seen footage of that.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.900
 - So Amy Johnson, I think I've been to the town

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.260
 on the coast in Kent where she disappeared.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.300
 - Did she disappear as well?

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.700
 - Yeah, yeah, I think she was flying,

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.980
 oh gosh, where is it?

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.620
 It's near, there was a Turkish restaurant we went to

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.140
 and I had, I had, - Oh yeah, okay,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.700
 I know, that's the Turkish restaurant.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.580
 - I didn't remember it 'cause I ordered the Turnip Juice

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.860
 as my drink for the meal.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.900
 - I've heard this story before.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.280
 And the waiter said, the waiter said are you sure,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.720
 are you sure you want the Turnip Juice?

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.880
 I said, I'm here, I'm on the North Kent coast,

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:11.200
 I want to experience Turkish culture as it was intended to

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.640
 and it was absolutely tough.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.760
 - He didn't like it guys, spoiler, he didn't like it.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.800
 - Okay guys, so if you wanna know where this happened,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.040
 either Google where Amy Johnson crashed

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.320
 or just check out Andy's history on TripAdvisor reviews

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.600
 and you'll see it in there.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.120
 - I thank God you weren't asked to do the eulogy

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:30.960
 at a funeral.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.560
 She was a wonderful person.

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.480
 Can I quickly just mention yesterday?

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:42.320
 - Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.140
 - My wife once won a load of teddies

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.900
 on a shooting gallery in Hurn Bay.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.740
 - Really?

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:49.580
 - Yeah.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.200
 - So many good personal anecdotes in Hurn Bay.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.760
 - It's a rich place.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.020
 - I went there not long ago,

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.700
 but yeah, but I was only making a connecting train

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.220
 so I just stayed in the station.

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:01.200
 - That's a better story than both lines.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.900
 (all laughing)

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.500
 - I read an article about the ejection club

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.300
 at the Waterbaker Run and it was,

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.700
 they called it the only club where you have to be thrown out

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.540
 to get in.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.940
 - Brilliant, that's really good.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.420
 - I got an alternative to an ejection seat here.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.680
 This is great.

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.120
 This is a plane, it's an American plane

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.660
 with the Douglas F3D Sky Night.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.500
 - All right.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.340
 - Do you have to say it like that?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.940
 - Yes, you do.

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.780
 It was this year's plane and if you had to bail out,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.660
 it was a really small cruise, that's two-seater plane.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.020
 You're sitting next to each other, okay?

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.620
 One is the pilot and one is...

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.580
 - Co-pilot?

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.740
 - No, genuinely doing something else like radar or something.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.740
 - Or getting some drinks.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.300
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.900
 - He's got a tiny trolley and he offers the pilot chicken

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:47.540
 or fish about halfway through the flight.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.060
 - Do you want to buy any lottery cards?

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.820
 We're selling lottery cards as for charity.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.860
 If you've got any spare change in the country

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.980
 you've come from, you can buy these lottery cards.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.900
 - Both flying over Cambodia now, what are you doing?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.420
 (all laughing)

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.780
 Yeah, but it's exactly that, you know.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.500
 So anyway, there's this plane, the Sky Night,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.060
 and if they had to bail out,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.460
 the crew didn't have an ejector seat in the plane.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:10.900
 What they had effectively was a slide.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.660
 - Oh, okay. - Going down and back.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.740
 - So you would just have to pop out

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.940
 between the engines of the plane.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.900
 It's, I mean, this sounds incredibly risky.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.240
 You did, obviously you'd have a parachute on

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.580
 when you did that, ideally.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.660
 - Yeah, I do always want to, what's the next flavor?

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.460
 - It sounds risky, but...

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.500
 (all laughing)

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.580
 - Are you sure you want to do this?

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.260
 This looks pretty risky.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:33.460
 No, you're right, let's die instead.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.420
 Let's just crash.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.420
 - I'll have the chicken!

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.100
 (all laughing)

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.340
 - But sometimes they use this plane

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.860
 to deploy commandos into the jungle.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.180
 So you'd have one pilot and one commando in the plane.

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:44.020
 And at a certain point,

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.740
 the commando just pops down the slide.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.380
 - Really? - It sounds so cool.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.620
 - It sounds amazing.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.420
 - Yeah, I think it was. - Did it work?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.180
 - I think it was incredibly dangerous.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.020
 - It wasn't used for long.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.860
 And I think 'cause it was first used in the A3D,

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.180
 which came to stand for all three dead,

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.020
 'cause that was three people who would be in the plane.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.540
 And I think it took a long time

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.900
 'cause it was sort of behind the seats,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:06.260
 so you realized you were gonna crash

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:07.740
 and then you had to sort of clamber over,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:08.580
 you weren't quite a lot of gear.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:09.900
 - Yeah, it's really cramped, yeah.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.380
 - Squeezing one after the other.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.220
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.100
 - 'Cause even now they say if you lose your phone

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.340
 behind the seats, you're not allowed to get it yourself.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.820
 You have to get the attendant to come

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.660
 and get your phone for you.

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.740
 - And that's in case you fall down the chute

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.460
 when you're trying, so. (laughing)

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.300
 - It's just the last thing.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.500
 If you love ejector seats and they look so cool,

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.380
 and I spent a lot of hours last night

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.740
 trying to find the most affordable one,

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.580
 but on eBay, they go--

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.140
 - Can you try and eject other?

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.380
 - They look so cool.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.380
 They sell them to just--

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.540
 - Not going to the hospital, did I?

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.940
 (laughing)

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.940
 - Let me tell you an anecdote about Turkish breakfast.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.520
 (upbeat music)

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.020
 - Okay, it is time for fact number two,

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:49.260
 and that is my fact.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:52.140
 My fact this week is that there is a school in Massachusetts

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.340
 that has had all of its 7,000 light bulbs permanently on

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.980
 for over a year and a half now

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:00.300
 because no one knows how to turn them off.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.620
 (laughing)

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.980
 So this is a lighting system that was installed

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.980
 in Minnichalg Regional High School,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:07.340
 which is in Massachusetts.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.820
 And the idea was they were thinking,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.060
 how can we have a lighting system

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:12.700
 that's gonna save us a lot of money?

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:13.700
 And they came up with this.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.180
 They thought this is gonna save us

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.860
 hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.700
 Unfortunately--

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.740
 - 'Cause it happened to be very efficiently built.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.700
 - Yeah, there were LED light bulbs.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.420
 There was, it had dimming qualities on it.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.020
 It was a great system that was energy efficient

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.220
 in a way that usual light bulbs wouldn't be.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:31.580
 And so they decided to go for the system.

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.540
 And then during the pandemic,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.300
 something in the system went faulty and failed,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.820
 which meant that the lights weren't dimming.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.300
 It meant they weren't going off altogether.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.420
 It meant basically that close to 7,000 of these light bulbs

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.260
 were just remaining on.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.900
 Then it was discovered that actually

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.780
 the hardware that was needed to fix it

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.140
 wasn't available and they needed to order it from China,

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.100
 which had a backlog of orders so they couldn't get it over.

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.300
 So as we speak, it still hasn't been fixed.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.140
 They know the problem.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.100
 They've ordered the parts.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.940
 They're arriving.

00:19:58.940 --> 00:19:59.900
 I think they have them now,

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.020
 but they're not putting them in till March.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.860
 And so--

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.500
 - 'Cause they need experts to come and put them in

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.340
 and they can't get them.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.500
 It is so mad.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.700
 'Cause it's like taxpayer funded school, obviously.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.900
 So every day you have a reminder

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.220
 of what your taxes are going towards

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.260
 as you walk past this brightly illuminated school.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.020
 - And it's costing thousands a month.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.860
 - 'Cause they turn the electricity off,

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.340
 like as in every night,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.740
 when all the kids go away, you just...

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.820
 (imitates electric sound)

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.860
 - Yeah, you'd think so, right?

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.660
 - Maybe, maybe there's health and safety reasons

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.900
 why you can't do that.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.860
 - Feels like there must be something

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.700
 that they can use that light for.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:33.540
 - Do you know what I mean?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.380
 I mean, there must be a use at night.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.820
 - Put solar panels in there.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.940
 (all laughing)

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.540
 That's how I actually, all my electricity in my house

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.380
 is I put solar panels underneath all my lights

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.420
 and then keep my lights on all the time.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.060
 - Yeah, so it's a big problem.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.860
 It's costing them possibly tens of thousands of dollars

00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.700
 at this point.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.780
 I mean, it certainly has.

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.740
 And some of the teachers try to fix it

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.700
 by just taking the light bulbs out themselves.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.620
 Yeah, just going around. - Does that work?

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:05.140
 - It does, but they only take out three or four

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:06.980
 as opposed to the 7,000. - You can't do that every night.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.820
 Can you?

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.660
 It's 7,000 bulbs?

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.500
 You've got a shot.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.740
 - It's further ceiling lights.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.100
 You know, the recessed ceiling lights,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.020
 they're a complete pain in the ass to get in the screw.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.020
 - Yeah, exactly. - It's my two penny worth.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.420
 (all laughing)

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.940
 It's being a bad lighting systems.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:24.660
 Actually, I had a look in the fish inbox,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.380
 podcast@qi.com, just to see if anyone

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.660
 had written in about light bulbs.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.700
 Thank you, Paddy McCray, who wrote in quite a while ago now.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.420
 I hope you're still listening, Paddy.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.380
 This is an incredible fact.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.220
 It's about the terminal five at Heathrow, right?

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.300
 - Oh yeah.

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.780
 - Which has this beautiful high ceiling.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.020
 Like the bulbs are all about 120 feet in the air.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.580
 And between 2008 and 2013,

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:47.500
 no bulbs were changed in the ceiling

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.460
 because they didn't have a good way of doing it.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.300
 And at that point, about 60% of the bulbs had gone.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.580
 And so the reports say that they hired a team

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.140
 of tightrope walkers because that was the only way.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.980
 - No. - That's so funny.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.580
 That can't be true. - That's untrue.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.140
 - I'm pretty, look, take it up with the Daily Telegraph,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.940
 who reported that a Cirque du Soleil style,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.460
 high level rope work firm had been engaged

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.420
 in taking the bulbs. - So funny.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.740
 But then they would do some of them

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.140
 and then some of them would be changed

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.020
 by someone in a human cannonball.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.580
 And they would be fired up.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.660
 And then other ones, it would be trapeze guys.

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.860
 - Pyramid of clowns, just all doing one,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.460
 very, very rescue there.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.780
 - That's so funny.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.780
 - I'm sure no one was in a costume at Heathrow.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.100
 - I was in Dubai recently

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.580
 and there's lots of glass skyscrapers there.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:36.260
 And they're all, the window cleaners are all done by hand.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.260
 So they have people who are literally like on ropes

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:43.620
 going down all of the highest buildings in the world,

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.700
 just cleaning them.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.700
 - That's a fun job.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.060
 I've always thought that would be a fun job actually.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.420
 - I'm one of those harnesses.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.540
 - They call them rats,

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.340
 'cause they're rope access technicians.

00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.980
 - The main company that does Burj Khalifa,

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:57.820
 which is the highest building,

00:22:57.820 --> 00:22:59.220
 if you want to get a job there,

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:00.980
 they show you like a video nasty

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.340
 before you are allowed to apply.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:06.940
 And they show you like really awful examples

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.940
 of people who almost fell and stuff.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:10.380
 And they're like, if you're okay with a video,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.540
 then you can have an interview.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.300
 - Right, do they show you Mission Impossible 4?

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.020
 In which Tom Cruise climbs up the Burj Khalifa.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.380
 - And there's a sandstorm as well.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.940
 - Yeah, he's got some special sticky gloves

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.020
 and they stop working.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.860
 I think he looks behind them

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.060
 and there's a sandstorm approaching

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.500
 and they go, whoa, better climb a bit faster.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.780
 - Well, isn't he responsible

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.820
 for making one of these guys have to do extra work?

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.140
 Because while he was up there,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.940
 he graffitied Katie Holmes' name.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.300
 Like, I love Katie Holmes.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.100
 Yeah, yeah, and they had to go and clean that off.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.980
 Yeah, that's great.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.900
 - When they first had the electric lights, Edison's ones,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.860
 you would have them in a building.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.540
 Obviously no one had seen them before.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.820
 And so there would be a sign often next to them

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.220
 warning people not to try and light the light bulb

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:48.660
 with a match.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.060
 - Wow, that's brilliant.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.540
 - I've seen one of these signs.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.860
 It says, this room is equipped with Edison electric light.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:58.460
 Do not attempt to light with match.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.500
 Simply turn key on wall by door.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.140
 The use of electricity for lighting

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.300
 is in no way harmful to health,

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.220
 nor does it affect the soundness of sleep.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.060
 - It does affect.

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.100
 If you leave the lights on all night,

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.420
 you're gonna have your sleep affected.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.420
 That's just a lie.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.260
 - It was a lie.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.300
 They didn't know at the time.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.220
 They didn't know any better.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:18.340
 - They didn't, lights on all night, insomnia.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.220
 - I didn't know why you had to have a light bulb.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:23.900
 Like, why you needed the glass, basically.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.740
 - Go on.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:28.100
 - Well, it's because it'll react with the oxygen,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:28.940
 the filament.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.540
 - To make a vacuum, right?

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.820
 - So if you have an incandescent bulb,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.580
 this is the old, the good old fashioned, you know,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.900
 pre-EU.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.740
 - Oh good.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.580
 - Okay.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.420
 - Oh good, you're one of those.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.260
 - It's the one where you've got the bulb,

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.100
 the tiny bit of wire,

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.380
 and then you run it through the wire and that grows.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.540
 It's because the filament would react with oxygen

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.860
 immediately and then burnouts really fast.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.900
 And if you, as James says, create a vacuum,

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.940
 or fill it with an inert gas,

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.060
 then it lasts longer.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.980
 But I just, I didn't know actually why.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:54.900
 I had this moment yesterday,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.260
 where it's kind of an anti-light bulb moment,

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.220
 where I was thinking,

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.820
 wait, hang on, why don't we just not have the bulb, right?

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.140
 - Save our glass.

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.780
 - I saved so much glass.

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.260
 - And, yeah.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.900
 - What would the safety be outside of that,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.020
 in terms of if you went and touched it,

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.860
 rather than burning it in half?

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.900
 - But you wouldn't electrocute yourself, or?

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.100
 - Yeah, and there's an electric current flowing through it.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.780
 - It's a small current, I think,

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:18.540
 but you would burn yourself, it's so hot.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.380
 - The heat is so cool.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:22.180
 The level of heat that you have in your own room,

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.740
 again, if you're using an incandescent bulb,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.780
 which you shouldn't be,

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.740
 'cause obviously they're not as efficient,

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:32.740
 but that filament gets to 2,200 degrees centigrade.

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.020
 - Isn't it so weird to think

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.460
 you're sitting in your sitting room,

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.940
 just biding your time,

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.300
 and there's something over there, which is that hot.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.860
 And also the filament is so long,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.860
 when you look inside an old bulb, it's two meters long.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.780
 - Really? - It's just really,

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.020
 really thin, 0.2 millimeters thick.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.900
 This is an old tungsten filament.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.740
 - In Babylon, ancient Babylon.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:51.860
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.700
 - If you wanted to buy enough oil

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.700
 to light your front room with an oil lamp,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.780
 you would have to work for 41 hours

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.660
 to burn for an hour.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.300
 - Oh, I see. - Okay, so 41 hours work,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:11.700
 you'd be able to buy enough oil

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.820
 to make your light bulb for one hour.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.700
 - Okay, that is rubbish.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.860
 - In 1992, in America,

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.260
 you could get the same amount of light

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.340
 by working for less than one second.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.180
 - Wow.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:28.100
 - Imagine being a dad in ancient Babylon,

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.220
 getting your family to go around turning off the light.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.340
 - That has taken 40 hours of work.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.300
 I've worked all week for one hour.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.280
 I come back into the room, no one's in the room.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.540
 (laughing)

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.220
 - So we've never mentioned, actually,

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.320
 the longest burning light bulb in the world,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.420
 which is kind of incredible,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.460
 the Livermore Centennial light bulb.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.220
 It's been burning non-stop brackets

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.620
 with a couple of caveats, closed brackets, since 1901.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:02.100
 And I think one of the keys to a success is that it's four watts.

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.780
 But it has to be on 24 hours a day

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.000
 'cause it's in a fire station,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.060
 so it's to provide a bit of illumination for fire engines.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:11.060
 And Guinness says there's been one break in its operation

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.420
 when it was taken from one station to another in the '70s.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.300
 And on that occasion, it had, apparently,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.820
 it says on its own website,

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.820
 "A full police and fire truck escort to take it to its site."

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.260
 - It's just the fire truck taking it to another place.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.100
 - I don't, you can't call that an escort

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.340
 if you're bringing your own thing.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.060
 - Escort implied to me there was another fire truck

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.260
 running alongside it,

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.180
 kind of stopping anyone else from getting here,

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.100
 like a bodyguard.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.900
 - I'm more, for the longest light bulb in the world,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.300
 I'm more interested in the fourth longest

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.380
 lasting light bulb in the world.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.740
 Because it was, so this is a light bulb

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.500
 that is in New York City, it's not there anymore.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.300
 But at the time, it was outside a place

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.540
 called the Gasnik Supply, which was a hardware store.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.900
 And the owner, Jack Gasnik,

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.380
 he was the guy who was trying to get it acknowledged

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.460
 to be older than all of the other light bulbs.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.940
 But to the point of like, he was furious.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.140
 He was like, "There's no way that the Livermore light bulb

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.700
 is an actual genuine light bulb."

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.940
 He wrote to Dear Abby,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.900
 which was like one of those agony aunt things,

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.740
 saying, "What do I do?

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.780
 I've got a light bulb that's lasted longer."

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.780
 - That must have been a nice day for Abby.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.620
 - Yeah.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.660
 - He's normally writing about people having affairs.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.500
 - Yeah.

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.980
 - He's like, "Oh, finally, a light bulb."

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.820
 - Yeah.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.220
 And he wrote to Guinness saying,

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:24.140
 "This is insane that you've given this record.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.700
 It's clearly a fake light bulb.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.540
 My light bulb."

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.380
 - A fake light bulb?

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.620
 - He's like a cardboard cashier.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.140
 - He thinks something was going on.

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.580
 So he said that the bulb is not dark enough

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.980
 to have burned consistently.

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.180
 So he said, "Right away, I saw it was so clear.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.980
 It does not show any sign of carbonization.

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.980
 A bulb that has burned 20, 30, 40 years

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.060
 would be extremely dark from the carbon.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.900
 Two, the bulb is a brass-term knob socket.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.860
 You can't have a bulb burn continuously

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.700
 in a brass-term knob socket.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.100
 - I strongly disagree.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:53.700
 - It would get so hot, it would burn the wires.

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.460
 Yeah, so there was a big challenge

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.620
 and no one accepted it.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.060
 - When you said this one isn't there anymore in New York,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.300
 has it gone off or is it, do we know what's happened to it?

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.860
 - The whole of that block,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.820
 the half block was sort of taken down to the ground.

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.460
 So as far as we know--

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.860
 - By the sky in a rage.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.220
 - No, by Livermore and it's Mafia.

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.060
 - There was a huge fire.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.940
 - You know when you try and build a new house

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.140
 and they say, oh, sorry, there's some really,

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.340
 like, there's some lizards here

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.060
 that are going extinct or something.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.300
 It does feel like you shouldn't be able to knock down

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.780
 a house that has the four-foldest light bulb in it.

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.100
 - Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:35.940
 - Conservation.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.220
 - There is an older one in the UK, an older light bulb,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.980
 then the Livermore one, yeah.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:41.820
 - Is there?

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.780
 - Yeah, but it just hasn't been on all the time.

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:44.620
 - Oh, right.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.060
 - So this tragic person's just kept to use light bulb.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.180
 - Pretty much, yeah.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.100
 It's called the Ediswan light bulb.

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:55.100
 It was first turned on in 1883 in Haitian in England

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.060
 and it's owned by someone called Beth Crook,

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.460
 or at least it was when I read this article.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.860
 But yeah, they don't really turn it on very often.

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.100
 - I think that's sensible.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.940
 - Yeah, makes sense.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.140
 - I think they have special occasions.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.860
 - Well, some people think that the Livermore one

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.860
 has lasted so long because it's never turned off.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.180
 Because when you turn something off,

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.140
 sometimes it's like a surge of electricity

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.580
 and stuff that can damage the filament.

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.860
 Whereas this has always had four watts just--

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.460
 - I did that with my computer.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.300
 - Yeah.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.100
 - If I turn it off, I think horrible things will happen.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.540
 So I just keep flogging it on for a few more years.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.140
 - I do the same with my car engine.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.720
 (upbeat music)

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:37.340
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.620
 - My fact is that in 1955,

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.620
 one person secretly bought almost all the onions in America.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.980
 (laughing)

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.420
 This is a guy called Vince Kosuga

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.540
 and he was an onion farmer in the 1930s.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.780
 And he thought, "I wanna take this bigger."

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:59.140
 And so he decided to corner the entire onion market

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:03.780
 of America by buying all of the onions.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.340
 And so then you've cornered the market,

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.380
 you've got all the onions

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.380
 so you can absolutely control the price of onions.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.740
 But the thing I find so incredible about this

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.180
 is that in order to stop word spreading,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.060
 'cause as soon as word spreads that he's doing this,

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.540
 then people selling him onions are gonna go,

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.940
 "I'm gonna charge away more for these onions then."

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.780
 It's not word spreading,

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.020
 he would have had to do it completely in secret

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.620
 and make sure none of the onion sellers

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.460
 are talking to each other,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.060
 going, "Did that guy have Vince come through last?"

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.140
 - So he would just go in with a different moustache

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.980
 and a hat and stuff.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.820
 - I think so.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.340
 (laughing)

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.540
 - So what he especially bought, he bought onions, yes,

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:37.780
 but he also bought onions before they existed.

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.700
 - Potential onions.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:39.540
 - Yeah, potential onions.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.820
 He bought onion futures.

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:41.780
 - Conceptual onions.

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.100
 - Conceptual onions.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.940
 The basic idea is you buy the right to buy

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.380
 the future onions for an agreed price,

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.020
 you say I'll buy 10 tons of onions from you next year

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.660
 for a pound of kilo or whatever,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.340
 and then you have to do that.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.540
 - You're betting that the price will go up in that time

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.900
 and you've already made the agreement

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.060
 so you'll make the difference.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.260
 - And you could also be screwed though,

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.980
 you'd have to still stick to that price

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.020
 even if they were worth less at the time,

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.900
 but if you bought all the onions,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.460
 - You can charge whatever price you want.

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:10.620
 - Well, but then the weird trick he did was,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.100
 as well as cornering the onion market,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.820
 he didn't stop there, so he bought all the onions

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.900
 and then he said to people who wanted to distribute onions,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.420
 you're gonna have to buy them off me for a huge price

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.580
 'cause I'm the only one with them.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.260
 So they did that, he made shed loads of money there

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.460
 and then he thought, sort it,

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:28.820
 I'm gonna screw these guys over and flood the market anyway.

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:32.420
 So then, stage two, he went to Chicago

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.140
 with all the onions left over in his warehouse,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.620
 just lorry load after lorry load, dump them,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.820
 it sounds like just on the streets in giant sacks.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.460
 So flooding the market with onions,

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.220
 plummeting the onion price down.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.140
 - Must have been like, onion Christmas.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.540
 Everyone just walks outside

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:48.940
 and there's just onions everywhere.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:51.140
 - It's quite a shit Christmas actually, I think, isn't it?

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.820
 Stocking filled with onions.

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:54.820
 Yeah, the reason he did that

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.300
 is 'cause he was betting on onion futures.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.580
 So he knew he was gonna do this,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:00.860
 so he bet that the price would go down.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.940
 - So he made eight and a half million at the time,

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.780
 money at the time,

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.700
 and for the first initial selling back to the farmer.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.980
 So he was kind of quits in anyway, right?

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.140
 - Yeah, if you think about it,

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.180
 you've done this brilliant scheme of buying all the onions.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.700
 You've made a ton of money,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.780
 but then you're left with all these onions, right?

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.620
 - What are you gonna do?

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:19.660
 - You need to get rid of the onions somehow,

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.300
 but also make money out of them.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.180
 You could sell them at the normal price,

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.460
 or you could do this betting

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:25.980
 against the price going down thing.

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.500
 - The betting thing was very clever, yeah.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.180
 - How amazing that he pulled it off just by the way.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.700
 This guy went around America

00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.220
 and managed to successfully collect every single,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.740
 virtually every single onion.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.220
 I mean, he was brought into Congress

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.580
 because the farmers, once this scheme was discovered,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.020
 and particularly the second bit that you were mentioning, Anna,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:44.260
 about how he screwed them over,

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:45.500
 they said to their congressman,

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.020
 "You can't have someone doing this."

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.700
 This is, we've always said this is gonna be the problem

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.100
 with future trading and so on.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.460
 He's monopolized the market, this can't happen.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.860
 So it wasn't illegal though,

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.220
 but he was brought into Congress,

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.060
 and his lawyer said,

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.900
 "Make sure you just don't lie about anything."

00:33:57.900 --> 00:34:00.420
 And they said, "We understand you own 97%

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.900
 "of the onions in the United States."

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.940
 And he said, "That's incorrect, 98%."

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.820
 Like he was missing 2% of onions in the States.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.820
 - So onions are really good.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.940
 They keep for a really long time.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.980
 If you keep them dark and dry,

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.780
 they keep for months and months and months on end

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.620
 without going off.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.100
 But some of them did start to go off

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.860
 because he had lots and lots of onions

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.060
 in the oldies' warehouses.

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.620
 And then supposedly,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.780
 Kasuga, he had the onions reconditioned

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.820
 to clean them up a bit, repackage them.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.380
 - Set the few layers off and it'll be like,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.900
 "Yeah, peel off the mold on the outside."

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.780
 - And then they were sent back into all the warehouses

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.620
 in Chicago where they'd been stored in the first place.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.140
 But that was assumed to be even more onions

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:37.980
 coming into the city.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.860
 We didn't realize those were the same ones as before.

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.980
 People were like, "Oh my God, there are even more onions!"

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.860
 And the prices really collapsed then.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.220
 And this onion mess that happened in Chicago,

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.460
 it sounds absolutely bananas.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:52.660
 Orphans were receiving free onions in the streets.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:54.860
 The Chicago River was just taking load after load

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.500
 of onions that were being chucked into it.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:57.340
 - Really?

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:58.180
 - Yeah.

00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.020
 - The fish.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:34:59.860
 - Like breath.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.700
 - Just years after.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.740
 - They were like, "Fence, why are you crying?

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.540
 You've just made millions of dollars."

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.060
 - I'm a bit confused about why they were starting

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:09.460
 to be handed out to everyone.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.300
 The price was nothing.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.580
 - But who's handing it out at this point?

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.420
 Is it Vince?

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:13.540
 - Well, let's say you run an orphanage

00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.940
 and you want to feed your orphans.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.300
 You're going to feed them with the thing

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.820
 that costs 10p for a million.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:20.660
 - Got it, okay.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.900
 - Well, it is free in a sack that's been dumped

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:24.900
 on your, not great fun for the orphans actually,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.980
 'cause once you've had 17 meals of just onion,

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.980
 then it gets old.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.220
 - It's very versatile.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.060
 - Yeah.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.100
 - I think onions are one of those base foods.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.540
 - Who was it who said this about British cuisine?

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.780
 I think it was Athena, actually,

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.100
 Athena Kaplenu, our friend.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.540
 And she said that basically every English dish

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.660
 begins with an English person cutting up an onion,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.820
 putting it in a pan with some oil,

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:48.060
 and then we just decide what to do after that.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.140
 - Yeah, that's very true, yeah.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.780
 - You can't leave it on its own, though, can you?

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.740
 It is very much a base, you know?

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.500
 You've got to toss something else in.

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.340
 - Onions soup.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.180
 - That's, yeah, yeah.

00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.020
 They're the closest.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.060
 - Onion soup is probably the closest

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.700
 to a natural onion.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.740
 - Yeah, and really that's 90% cheese.

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.020
 - In 1958, President Eisenhower signed

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.540
 the Onion Futures Act that meant

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:12.460
 that this could never happen again.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.980
 And it bans anyone from trading in onion futures, basically,

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.500
 in the United States.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.660
 But the Onion Futures Act also bans people

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:26.180
 from betting on the receipts of motion picture box office.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.780
 - Oh, why?

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.020
 - So, according to the Onion Futures Act,

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.060
 you're not allowed to trade in onion futures

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.300
 or motion picture box office receipt futures.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.700
 - What the hell?

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.140
 - So, onions and minions, they're the two areas.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.980
 - Brilliant, and that was because in 2010,

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.220
 the Motion Picture Association of America lobbied

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.740
 to stop people from being able

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.380
 to do these futures in motion pictures.

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.620
 And rather than doing a new act,

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.300
 they just sort of lobbed it on the end of this onion act.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.380
 - I'm slightly confused about the aspect

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:59.140
 of motion picture box office receipts,

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.060
 because it's the idea that, I'll make,

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.940
 James Cameron doing this by basically saying,

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.580
 like, I'm gonna buy the rights to all future avatar movies.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:10.220
 And then he makes five avatar movies, flooding the market.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.420
 - That's pretty much what's happened.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:13.260
 - He controls all the avatar movies.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.100
 So, and then there are so many

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.500
 that they're being given away for free

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.140
 to orphans in the streets.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.740
 I'm slightly confused about that.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.340
 - Yeah, that's why-- - I thought it might be

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.860
 like a producers thing where you buy them up

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.260
 and then you make a deliberately shit film.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:28.500
 And then it doesn't get any box office receipts

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.460
 and you bet against them.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.220
 - But there were some tax schemes that did that in the UK.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:33.980
 There were tax schemes investing money in.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.220
 Is why there was a rash of particularly bad British comedy

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.260
 films made? - Well, it was actually

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.740
 the way that that worked is that you got tax relief

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.540
 if you invested in a British movie in the same way

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.140
 that if you gave money to charity, you would.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:45.420
 - Yeah, and that's the avatar thing

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.540
 that we talked about with Wayne Rooney.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.460
 - Oh, yes, yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:52.060
 - Someone that James and I know from back in the day,

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:55.900
 Gareth Edwards, who made Rogue One, the Star Wars movie.

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:58.500
 But his first movie that he made was called "Monster."

00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.340
 - That's a great film.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.940
 - It's a great film and that was a tax scheme.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.660
 That was the company that needed to offset some money

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.380
 and that's how he was funded to make that movie.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.980
 - Well, that's the most entertaining tax scheme

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.020
 I've ever seen. - Yeah, it was a brilliant movie.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.180
 - Brilliant movie, yeah, yeah, absolutely brilliant.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.740
 - Nutmeg, what, the Nutmeg monopoly?

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.220
 Can we talk about that?

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.580
 - Oh, right, sorry.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.740
 - I was looking up other historical monopolies

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.980
 and the Spice Nutmeg was controlled

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:25.580
 by the Dutch for-- - Classic.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:26.900
 - Decades, oh, a long time.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.420
 I think they even, that's the thing they traded

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.940
 Manhattan for, the island of Manhattan.

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.500
 They said, "No, the British had it."

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.740
 And then they said, "No, we'll have that."

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:35.580
 Sorry, they had it.

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.980
 And then the British said, "We'd quite like an island."

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:39.460
 They said, "Well, we want this random spice island

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.660
 "in the Pacific from you." - Yeah, yeah.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.060
 Bander Island, was that something?

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.300
 - Exactly, exactly.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.820
 The Bander Islands in Indonesia

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.220
 and the Dutch secured them.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.140
 Not actually a bad deal trading Manhattan

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.980
 for this spice island

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.860
 because the sheer amount of value they extracted

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.660
 by controlling, you know, really fiercely the Nutmeg trade

00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:58.460
 as in, you know, as with all colonial things,

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.060
 they treated the local people appallingly,

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.180
 killing people, importing their own farmers, all of this,

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:06.100
 like clearing the islands, planting their own trees.

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.740
 And then they got the monopoly in Nutmeg

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.220
 and for about 150 years,

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.500
 they controlled Nutmeg in clothes, pretty much worldwide.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.380
 They had almost all the Nutmeg in clothes on the planet.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:15.140
 Right, it's kind of 98% of it.

00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.940
 And if you stole a Nutmeg, they'd come after you,

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:18.940
 they'd kill you.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.140
 They've ritually burned all their excess Nutmeg every year

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.220
 in what must have been a lovely smelling.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.140
 - Yeah, nice. - Yeah, so nice.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.380
 - Christmas time, come on.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.500
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.900
 And the markup was about 60,000% between source

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.380
 and street value of Nutmeg.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.380
 - Nice, that's a good markup.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.220
 - A good amount.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.340
 And if you had a small sackful, you were made for life.

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.260
 - Right. - Basically.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.020
 - And this was just the bunch of Dutch people

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.540
 who got this island basically.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.100
 - Yeah, exactly. - This company, great.

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.340
 And this is before everyone knew it was bloody poisonous,

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.740
 so you shouldn't owe them anything.

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.580
 - Isn't it, I see, I have a distant memory of them also

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.820
 as a result, having a monopoly over a certain type

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.860
 of drug as a result of Nutmeg being used.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.100
 I wanna say MDMA.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.060
 They were basically the providers of MDMA

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.140
 as a result of this.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.460
 - I think, well, the monopoly was broken

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:09.140
 in the late 18th century, so I don't know.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.700
 - Yeah, yeah. (laughing)

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.780
 - Yeah, no, you read Jane Austen a certain way.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:13.860
 You can tell they are.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.180
 - That was what caused the French Revolution, actually.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.020
 (laughing)

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.500
 They're all off their tits.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.860
 - Wow.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.420
 - Okay, yeah.

00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.460
 - And the man who broke the monopoly,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.300
 or one of the men who broke the monopoly

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.860
 was a Frenchman who called Pierre Poivre,

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.900
 whose name pleasantly is Peter Pepper.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.220
 - Peter Pepper, yeah.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.380
 - Very nice. - Good on him.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:35.020
 - And he supposedly, he nicked one of the trees

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.140
 out of the way that the Dutch hadn't spotted

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.740
 and made off with it, and then seven years later,

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.660
 well, he's broken, got nutmeg everywhere.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.540
 - What a shame his name wasn't Pierre Nutmeg.

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.540
 - There is a theory that Peter Piper picked a pack

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.300
 of pickled peppers as based on him.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:51.380
 - Right, I like that.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.700
 - I'm not sure it's true.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.380
 - But you can see where the theory came from.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:56.820
 (laughing)

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.780
 - Just this fact is about sort of someone

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.220
 controlling a market, they're not being any competition,

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.900
 and it just reminded me of one of my favorite things.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.060
 And I think I learned this

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.620
 listening to a Wondrium course ages ago, actually,

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.980
 but in medieval times, the guilds were really, really strong.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.660
 So if you're trading produce in a town,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.180
 you have to be part of a guild.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:19.340
 This is in medieval England and France,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.060
 and not by the European countries.

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:22.780
 And if you weren't a member of the guild,

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.340
 you would not be allowed to sell.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.420
 You're carrot or bracelets or whatever.

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:31.460
 And only two things I could think of.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:34.140
 But yeah, the guilds were so strict,

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.820
 so they didn't want any competition

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.100
 between any of their members.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:38.980
 You forget that capitalism today,

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.580
 everyone's in competition all the time,

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.940
 that was just anathema to them.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.020
 So they dictated everything you use to make your produce.

00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.100
 So if you're making your carrots,

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.140
 you have to make them with the tool

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.060
 that the guild says you have to make it with,

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.580
 using the exact techniques.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.460
 You're not allowed to work

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.060
 more than a certain number of working hours.

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:55.020
 They'll monitor you.

00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:58.620
 Yeah, everything, machinery, everything.

00:41:58.620 --> 00:41:59.780
 And then you get to market

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:02.180
 and you've done exactly the same as everyone else.

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.820
 And you absolutely can't advertise,

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.780
 which means you literally can't draw attention

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:08.140
 to yourself at all.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:08.980
 - No.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:12.180
 - And there were guilds would forbid things like sneezing

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.900
 or nodding at passers-by.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.940
 'Cause this was thought to be--

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.140
 - That must have been tough for the pepper guilds.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.380
 (laughing)

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.860
 - That poor man from the itching powder guild

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.780
 has to stand ramrod still.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.500
 (laughing)

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.340
 - That's amazing.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.180
 - Wow.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.500
 - I did not only want to do anything, really.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.080
 (upbeat music)

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.940
 - Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.540
 and that is James.

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.100
 - Okay, my fact this week is that in 1983,

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.140
 an autograph hunter wrote to Steve Jobs.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.980
 Jobs replied saying that he didn't sign autographs,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.020
 but he signed that letter and it's sold last year

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.740
 for half a million dollars.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.580
 (laughing)

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:56.660
 - That's incredible.

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.140
 - Did he put the stamp and put it through the post box

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.020
 and then go, "Oh, damn it."

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.620
 - I think he was knowing Lee.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.860
 It's written very much as if a gag, I would say.

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:07.700
 - You may.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.540
 - You never know, though, you never know.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.380
 - He said, it's written.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:10.860
 He says, "I'm honored you were right,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.420
 but I'm afraid I don't sign autographs."

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.380
 And it was sold at R.R. auctions.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.740
 That's the letter R.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.140
 I know my accent is a bit weird,

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.460
 but R.R. auctions.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.900
 - So pirate auction signs, man.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.660
 (laughing)

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.500
 - And they suggested that perhaps there was a photograph

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.060
 or magazine enclosed in the original letter

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:31.820
 and that he didn't sign that

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.540
 as opposed to it being a joke.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.900
 But I agree, it does sound kind of like a joke,

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.740
 doesn't it?

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:37.580
 - It does.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.260
 I have an alternate theory about Jobs.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.980
 So I was reading a book from 1910

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.020
 called Chats on Autographs by A.M. Broadley.

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.220
 Just a little shout out to him.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.340
 He'll be really grateful for that.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.100
 - And he relates in this book,

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.340
 the story of the Archbishop of York

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.580
 who wrote back to an autograph hunter saying,

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.540
 "Sir, I never give my autograph and never will."

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.800
 And then signed it.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.380
 And maybe it was Steve Jobs doing a little tribute

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.220
 to that.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.380
 (laughing)

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:07.060
 - To the Archbishop of York.

00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:08.380
 - One of them, yeah, I don't know which one.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.220
 - Wow.

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.060
 - Yeah, wow.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.420
 - Oh my God, and you're the first person ever to get that.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:14.820
 And he's finally can rest in peace.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:15.660
 - Wow.

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.260
 - He was a huge fan of the Archbishops of Northern England.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.100
 - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:22.140
 (laughing)

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:23.380
 - I've read a few times

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.500
 where people have tricked others into giving a signature

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.780
 in almost the Steve Jobs-S kind of thing.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.420
 So for example, Lee Harvey Oswald's mother,

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.500
 one of the ways that she used to make money

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.980
 after the assassination was that she used to sell

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.460
 her signature to people.

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.980
 And got to a point where selling her signature

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.060
 got her quite a good living if she could do it.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.460
 But what people who would interview her would always

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.820
 trick her, it would be to get her to sign a release form

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.860
 to the interview that they'd filmed or whatever.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:53.260
 And then that's how they would get their signature.

00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:55.460
 So yeah, there's all these tricky ways, isn't there,

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.180
 of getting a celebrity signature if they don't give it.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.180
 'Cause if you don't, we've mentioned Steve Martin.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.580
 He has a card that he hands.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.220
 Jonah Hill does the same thing.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.940
 Instead of signing, if you approach Jonah Hill,

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.980
 he just hands a card saying, "I just met Jonah Hill."

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.340
 It was a total let down.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.780
 And that's just on his little business card.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.700
 - There's a famous story of Dennis Lilly,

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.860
 the Australian fast bowler, Cricketer,

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.060
 who met the queen and asked for her autograph.

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.980
 So she was in Melbourne watching some test cricket

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:23.340
 and then he sort of queued up and said,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.420
 "Can I get your autograph, mate?"

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.740
 And there's actually a photo of him.

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:27.980
 (laughing)

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.060
 - That's pronounced ma'am.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.500
 (laughing)

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.580
 - Well, in fact, that the first time he met her was earlier

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:35.540
 and I think he said, "G'day, how are you going?"

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.340
 And then chucked out his hand for a handshake.

00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:39.460
 So he had form with the queen.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.580
 - Yeah, what's Prince Harry's child called?

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.100
 - Archie or Lilibet?

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.220
 - Lilibet, it's actually named after Dennis Lilly.

00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.180
 (laughing)

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.780
 - Made such an impression.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.700
 Well, he obviously did,

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.620
 'cause he said, "Can I have your autograph?"

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.980
 Someone took a photo, actually, of him

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.700
 holding out a notebook and pen

00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:58.180
 and her looking a bit like,

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.540
 "Probably not gonna do that."

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.620
 And she said, "No, I'm sorry, it's against protocol."

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.360
 But then a few weeks later,

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.740
 he received in the post a photograph of that moment

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.300
 when he asked for her autograph signed by the queen.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.460
 - No way! - Oh, yeah.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.300
 - On people who refuse autographs,

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.260
 friend of the podcast, George Elliott,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.100
 she instructed her boyfriend, Henry Lewis,

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:21.100
 to write point blank refusals to anyone who--

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.940
 - Well, she would have to get a massive crayon

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.420
 'cause she would have a huge hand in the room.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.900
 - There's novelty pencils, yeah.

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.460
 (laughing)

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.100
 Why, why did she refuse?

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:31.260
 - She's busy.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.100
 - A little more confused, sorry.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.540
 - Also, she was quite confused about what her name was,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:35.380
 wasn't she?

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.740
 I'm at George, I'm at Marianne Evans.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.060
 Have I got in another suit on him now?

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.900
 - Yeah.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.940
 - Can I tell you, someone who collected autographs?

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.600
 - Sure. - Queen Victoria.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.440
 - Oh, yeah. - Really?

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.280
 - Yeah.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.120
 She had this cool thing.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:46.960
 I'd never heard of it before.

00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.220
 It was called an autograph fan.

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.400
 And it's literally a fan,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.820
 and every separate blade of the fan,

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:53.780
 you write a different person's signature on it.

00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.620
 - Oh, they write it.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.320
 (laughing)

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.380
 - Even better, they write it on it.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.540
 - She was a great forger.

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.940
 - But I just love the idea of Queen Victoria saying,

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.180
 "Can I have your autograph to someone?"

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.020
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.020
 - It was mostly her children and prime ministers

00:47:07.020 --> 00:47:08.700
 and things like that. - Okay, okay.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.540
 - That's pretty cool.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.380
 Do we have the fans?

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:11.980
 Are they in? - Yeah, we just, wow.

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:12.820
 - I'd love to see those.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:14.580
 - Is that why they're called fans?

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.860
 People who ask for autographs?

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:16.700
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.940
 It's a good legit question, I think.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.460
 - No, I knew it was not.

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:22.940
 - I know, but why are they called fans?

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:23.980
 - Fanatical.

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:24.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:25.660
 - Or.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.180
 (laughing)

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.940
 - One of the most expensive autographs

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.580
 you can get is a Button Gwinnett.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:34.420
 - Button Gwinnett.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.740
 - If you ever have an autograph of Button Gwinnett,

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.700
 it will cost at least $1 million.

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.060
 - Button Gwinnett. - At least.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.500
 - Button Gwinnett.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:47.220
 Button as in the things that you fasten your clothes with

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.900
 and Gwinnett exactly how you would expect to spell it.

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:50.740
 - Can we guess?

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:51.980
 You're leaving us hanging as if maybe

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:52.820
 we could guess who this person is.

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.740
 - So it's obvious, I reckon it's a,

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.620
 oh no, it won't be a forger, would it?

00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:58.140
 This is the most expensive signature.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.220
 - It's not the most expensive,

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:02.380
 but it will cost you at least a million dollars to get it.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:03.220
 - I think I know it.

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.100
 - Ooh, go on.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.340
 - Is it Declaration of Independence?

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:06.940
 - It is Declaration of Independence

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.740
 and most people have,

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.700
 or a lot of people who collect autographs of people

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.460
 who sign the Declaration of Independence

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.140
 will have 55 of the 56,

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.340
 but Button Gwinnett is extremely rare.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.300
 He died quite soon afterwards in a duel.

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:26.260
 Someone called him a scoundrel and a lying rascal

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.820
 and he got in a duel and died.

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:30.380
 And so there's like maybe a dozen

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.780
 or half a dozen of his signatures out there.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:34.260
 And if you want the full set,

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.660
 you're going to have to cuff up at least a million dollars

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.500
 for it.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.460
 - It's like the rarest football sticker.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:39.300
 - Yeah.

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.380
 - They've put it in six packs.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:42.740
 - It's amazing because he's like the least famous,

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.500
 one of the least famous ones, right?

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:45.340
 - Yeah.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.180
 - But he's still.

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.020
 - By a long way.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.860
 - Although I was, well,

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.300
 I was skimming the Declaration of Independence

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.580
 and you haven't heard of most of them.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.420
 Trust me.

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:52.260
 - Skimming.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.100
 - Why were you?

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.940
 - I happen to be skimming.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:54.780
 I was actually.

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.620
 (laughing)

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.580
 I would just like to remind myself

00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:58.500
 of the principles of which the country is based.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:48:59.900
 - Everyone else on the buses on their phone.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:01.020
 Anna's on her scroll.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.780
 (laughing)

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.460
 - I think if you're ever on Pointless Listener

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.460
 and it comes up,

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.540
 name someone from the Declaration of Independence,

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.940
 but Gwyneth has got to be.

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.780
 - Oh yes.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:11.620
 - This is a good one.

00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.300
 I reckon most people couldn't get me on the first six or seven.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.580
 But anyway, the reason I was skimming it

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.740
 was because I was wondering about.

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:20.460
 - That's right, get me on George Washington.

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.580
 John Hancock.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.740
 - Yeah, just name the first few presidents.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.300
 - Ben Franklin, though, was he one as well?

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.500
 - Was Gouverneur Morris,

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.900
 who died with a whale bone off his penis.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:28.740
 - Yeah, he was.

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:29.580
 - I think he was.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.420
 - He was on there.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.260
 - Poor guy.

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:33.380
 - We've got that extra sentence there.

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:34.460
 - We broke it.

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.180
 - We just said Ben Franklin, John Adams.

00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.300
 Gouverneur Morris, the guy had the whale bone

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.420
 off his penis and died.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.660
 (laughing)

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:45.620
 - The English getting this Declaration of Independence

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:47.780
 and reading it, going, it's the guy.

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.100
 (laughing)

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.060
 - It's actually part of the signature.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.540
 They've just added it on afterwards.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.220
 For anyone doubting who this is.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:56.020
 - John Hancock.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:57.700
 This is why I was browsing it for this,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.540
 'cause I was thinking about,

00:49:58.540 --> 00:49:59.700
 I wonder what interesting stuff it is

00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.740
 about the John Hancock.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:01.580
 - Oh yeah.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.220
 - The signature, you know, by word for a signature,

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.740
 'cause he was the first person to sign it.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.060
 - Yeah.

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:06.900
 - And there's not much,

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.980
 but I hadn't really looked at the signatures there before.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.940
 And it's really like, you know,

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.860
 if you sign someone's birthday card at work

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.820
 and someone writes their own name incredibly big.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.260
 And it's like, did you not know the rest of us

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.540
 were gonna have to sign this?

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.900
 (laughing)

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.260
 Way more than twice the size of the second biggest.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.460
 - John Adams has just written, get well soon.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:26.300
 - Yeah.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.140
 (laughing)

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.980
 - See you later.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:28.820
 We're just lovely working with you.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.980
 (laughing)

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.780
 - There's just sport signatures.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.620
 - Yeah.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:35.860
 - There's Luka Dončić, who's a basketball player.

00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:36.700
 - Genius.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.540
 - He's a big deal.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.360
 - Yeah.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:39.200
 - He's a genius.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.040
 - Mavericks.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.740
 - And he's signatures been making the news lately

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.300
 because it broke a record for the most ever paid

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.820
 for a basketball card at public auction.

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:47.780
 - Okay, wow.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.380
 - Get these specific cards called logoman cards,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.660
 or logoman cards, the thing in the basketball world

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.500
 where you have your NBA logo on this card

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.340
 from your jersey.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:58.380
 - Feels like it'll be logoman then.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:01.060
 - It does, and yeah, some people say logo.

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:02.920
 So you got your NBA logo.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.860
 (laughing)

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.260
 Or your NBA logo.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.100
 - Yeah.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.100
 - It just depends where you come from, doesn't it?

00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:09.940
 - It does, doesn't it?

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.780
 - Yeah.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.620
 - Anyway.

00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:12.620
 (laughing)

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.060
 - Are you gonna ask us to guess?

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.940
 - Yes, okay, fine.

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:16.860
 Well, that wasn't gonna be part of it, but sure.

00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:19.980
 So that's sold at most ever paid public auction

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.820
 for basketball card.

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.660
 How much do you think for?

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.500
 November 22.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:24.380
 - $75 if it does.

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:25.980
 (laughing)

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.740
 - Well, Steve Jobs, half a mill.

00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.100
 Button Gwinnett, over one million.

00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.940
 I'm gonna say it would be somewhere in between the two.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.220
 I'll go for $700,000.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.300
 - Oh, I like that you've done that.

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.700
 You've undershot it, and it's very generous of you.

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.780
 So it went for 3.12 million and actually sold in private

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.580
 the year before for 4.6 million,

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.180
 which doesn't apply to the person who's lost.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:51.100
 - So someone just lost a huge loss in a year as well.

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:52.620
 (laughing)

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.100
 - What makes you think you've got this card

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.660
 that you've paid $4 million for?

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:57.780
 And a year later you're like,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.820
 you know what, I'm gonna sell it for 3 million.

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.900
 What goes through your head?

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.020
 - They must have come up on really hard time.

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.340
 - I think what it was is it was initially bought

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:08.260
 by Vince Kosuga, and then he sold it,

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.540
 but then flooded the market

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:11.180
 with all his other Luka signature.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.980
 - The orphans of Chicago were receiving

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.500
 so many of these bloody basketball cards.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.060
 - Anyway, the thing I really like about this,

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.500
 which makes me wanna laugh at the fate of whoever bought it,

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.260
 is that his signatures keeps changing,

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.820
 and it's changed a lot since his teens,

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.820
 and there's a lot of chat

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.380
 that actually it's not his signature.

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:30.220
 - He said his hand replaced.

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.260
 (laughing)

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.340
 - Is that it?

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:33.780
 - You're so close.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.020
 - Oh, the basketball has crippled his fingers over the years,

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.500
 and it's changed the way he writes his name.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.180
 Someone's just forged it.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.020
 - That's the claim.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.420
 - He's died and been replaced by another.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.620
 Someone's just forged it.

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:45.620
 - Okay, I think James has just said the, yeah.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.300
 - Keep going, Andy, keep going.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.980
 - People think he's got the Luka signature,

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:50.500
 which is his old one, and the Lula one,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.420
 which is his new one, because it's more feminine.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.300
 Since he became president of Brazil.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.460
 - He's like he's been replaced by the president.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.220
 - That's the conspiracy theory.

00:52:59.220 --> 00:53:00.060
 - Wow, I love it.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.620
 - And as Dan says, he's a genius,

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:04.100
 so I think he's gonna do a pretty good job.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.260
 Sorry, it's actually called the Lula one.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:08.400
 - Since he was replaced by the 80s singer.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.140
 (laughing)

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.860
 - There's been a body swap comedy somewhere,

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.860
 and anyway, it's thought that it's his mother's signature.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.420
 - Oh, interesting. - Oh, really?

00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.260
 - Someone else did that,

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.340
 and in fact, we were talking about presidential signatures,

00:53:21.340 --> 00:53:24.020
 from Ronald Reagan, but when he was an actor,

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.580
 not when he was president, he got his mum.

00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:29.300
 I think he paid his mum, or he asked the studio

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:31.540
 to pay for his mum to sign all of his fan mail,

00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.340
 and it's now believed that pretty much everything he wrote

00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.820
 from the late 1930s to the late 1950s is suspect.

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.820
 You can't trust any signature from that time.

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.660
 (laughing)

00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.860
 Even his Christmas card was probably

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.540
 him getting his mum to do it all.

00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.140
 - You know, the whole Berlin Wall thing and everything.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.300
 That was actually his mum. - It was all his mum, yeah.

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.780
 - I'm so glad you clarified it.

00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:49.220
 I thought what you meant, Anna,

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:51.900
 was not that his mum had written the fake signature,

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.580
 but that he'd changed his signature to his mum's signature.

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:55.820
 (laughing)

00:53:55.820 --> 00:53:57.620
 - Well, that's because when he was at school,

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.100
 they sent the letter back saying

00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:00.460
 that he'd come to his homework.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:01.500
 He used to practice his mum's signature.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.580
 - Yeah, he knew it inside out, yeah.

00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:06.340
 I'm in the category of autograph collector.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.820
 - Yeah. - To a certain degree.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.260
 - Yeah, I like the occasional.

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.820
 Yeah, if I could find one,

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:13.140
 and I brought in a few of my favorite

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:14.740
 from my collection just to show you.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:19.220
 - So, first off, I've just, you guys can't see

00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:21.380
 when I can see the dance bank from where I'm sitting,

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.500
 and I know the story behind this one.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.300
 - So the first thing I have is a signed Beatles drumstick

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.540
 from the drummer of the Beatles.

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:29.340
 - Okay. - Yeah, Pete Best,

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:31.140
 who was the original.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:34.060
 - Oh, you got the Pete Best, that's so cool.

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:36.780
 - Yeah, so I don't remember buying this.

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:40.380
 I woke up one day, and in the post came it,

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.620
 and it turns out I was drunk in a car,

00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:45.420
 and on the way home, I bought a Pete Best.

00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:47.300
 - You got to stop doing that with the driving home.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:49.180
 Don't drink and drive and ebay.

00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:50.860
 (laughing)

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:51.820
 - So that's the first thing.

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:53.460
 So drummers love to sign a stick.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.780
 I like when signatures are appropriate to an item, you know?

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:58.740
 This I found in a secondhand bookshop,

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.420
 and I know I've shown you guys this before,

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.260
 but for the listener,

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.860
 what it is is a signed Stephen Hawking book.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.620
 Now, how would Stephen Hawking do his signature?

00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:10.140
 - Kiss, I was thinking, like put lipstick on him

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:10.980
 and kiss the book.

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:11.820
 - It's kind of close.

00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.180
 - It's not too far away.

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:16.500
 What they used to do was is his assistant

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:19.740
 would dip his thumb into some ink.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:23.100
 So I have the thumbprint of Stephen Hawking,

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.660
 and it says thumbprint of Stephen Hawking

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.100
 witnessed by Susan Maisie,

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.220
 who must have been his assistant or a nurse at the time.

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.820
 - It says, "I never give my thumbprint out,

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.900
 "and I will not be doing so on this occasion."

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:36.140
 (laughing)

00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.940
 So that's quite cool.

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:41.620
 I found that for five quid in a secondhand bookshop.

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:43.700
 - Here's the last one, which is interesting.

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.140
 This is a baseball.

00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:45.980
 - Oh, yeah.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:48.700
 - Baseball signed by a Hall of Famer called Gaylord Perry.

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:49.540
 - Oh, Gaylord Perry, yeah.

00:55:49.540 --> 00:55:51.980
 - Yeah, who is someone I'm fascinated with,

00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.020
 but we won't go into it now.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.500
 But what's interesting about this

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.580
 is you can get baseballs that are worth more

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:00.220
 if they're signed in certain ways.

00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.900
 So this is worth more than most baseballs

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.880
 would be if he'd signed it differently.

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.260
 So can you guess why this is worth more

00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.100
 signed by Gaylord Perry?

00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:09.620
 - He spelled his name wrong?

00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.140
 - No, no, correct spelling.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.580
 - So he signed it, there are two seams,

00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:14.420
 or the rather is one seam,

00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.740
 isn't there that goes all the way around?

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.420
 And he signed it in the nice bow beautifully

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.940
 between the point where the two seams

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:20.780
 are closer to each other.

00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:22.260
 - So that's the first thing, that's absolutely right.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.260
 So this is what's known as the sweet spot of a baseball.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:27.420
 You can get a long signature right across

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.420
 without having to break it up.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.580
 Nothing gets in the way.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:33.480
 The other thing is that it's a official ball American League,

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.040
 which is not the NLB, right?

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.620
 So this would be worth less

00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.460
 because it's an official Major League baseball.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:42.900
 So that shoots it down.

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:47.420
 It has his details, Hall of Famer, 91 on it.

00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.140
 So if anyone's a world champion,

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.820
 a world series champion or whatever,

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.060
 if they add the detail, that's gonna make it more.

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:53.900
 And then the last thing--

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.700
 - How many, like if you put your name, address, phone number,

00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:00.060
 Twitter handle, it gets better and better.

00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.020
 - So there's one more thing

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.540
 it's specifically to do with the signature

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:03.940
 that makes this worth more

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.260
 than a different baseball signature.

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:07.300
 - Is it 'cause it's blue?

00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.060
 - Absolutely, it's blue ink.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:10.860
 - It looks nicer with the red scene.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.580
 - It will also stay on longer than black.

00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:14.620
 Black will rub off according to the experts

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.300
 who auction baseballs off.

00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:20.420
 - I have assigned American football by Colin Kaepernick.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:21.380
 - Oh yeah.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:23.580
 - Which I got when he was an American footballer

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:26.220
 and now he's a civil rights guy, right?

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.740
 But it's signed in like silver writing.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:31.500
 And to be honest, I'm not sure it'll last

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:34.740
 for another 10 years, I think it'll all rub off.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:35.580
 - Yeah.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.900
 - Still, it's so nice to get a signature

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.740
 where you can say I got it when he was American football

00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.820
 and now he's a civil rights guy

00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.460
 rather than now he's a pedophile

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:44.100
 or now he's in prison for massive tax fraud.

00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:45.460
 (laughing)

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:48.040
 (upbeat music)

00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.900
 - Okay, that's it.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:51.860
 That is all of our facts.

00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.380
