00:00:00,00:00:02,(upbeat music)
00:00:02,00:00:16,- Hello and welcome to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:17,"of No Such Thing as a Fish,"
00:00:17,00:00:19,a weekly podcast coming to you
00:00:19,00:00:21,from the QI offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:22,00:00:25,"I am sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray,"
00:00:25,00:00:27,Anna Tyshinski and James Harkin.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:32,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:32,00:00:35,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:38,"Starting with fact number one, and that is Andy."
00:00:38,00:00:40,- My fact is that the man who invented
00:00:40,00:00:43,the underwater ejector seat once broke his tailbone
00:00:43,00:00:46,in six places while testing the system on the ground
00:00:46,00:00:48,rather than in the water.
00:00:48,00:00:50,- What an idiot.
00:00:50,00:00:53,- This was a bike called John Rawlins.
00:00:53,00:00:53,- Yeah.
00:00:53,00:00:55,- It was very eminent.
00:00:55,00:00:56,"Well, I didn't know about him."
00:00:56,00:00:57,I was at a comedy gig a few weeks ago
00:00:57,00:00:59,and the comedians started talking to the guy next to me
00:00:59,00:01:00,in the audience.
00:01:00,00:01:02,And this guy started talking about
00:01:02,00:01:04,how he was either reading about or related to
00:01:04,00:01:06,the man who invented the underwater ejector seat.
00:01:06,00:01:09,And the comedian just made hay with it.
00:01:09,00:01:09,- Did he?
00:01:09,00:01:10,- Still a whale of a time.
00:01:10,00:01:12,- Had he been speaking to you previously?
00:01:12,00:01:14,"- He said, he said, anything's better than that guy."
00:01:14,00:01:16,"And he just, yeah, yeah, they spoke phrases actually."
00:01:16,00:01:17,- That's so amazing.
00:01:17,00:01:18,Wow.
00:01:18,00:01:20,- What a heckle.
00:01:20,00:01:21,- He just mentioned Sir John Rawlins.
00:01:21,00:01:23,"I thought underwater ejector seat, I've never heard of that."
00:01:23,00:01:24,"- No, I don't think of that as something"
00:01:24,00:01:26,"that has been invented, in fact."
00:01:26,00:01:27,- Right.
00:01:27,00:01:28,- Sir John Rawlins.
00:01:28,00:01:28,"- You would be gutted, actually, Anna,"
00:01:28,00:01:30,"if you invented the underwater ejector seat,"
00:01:30,00:01:33,which you would reasonably assume hasn't been invented yet.
00:01:33,00:01:34,- Yeah.
00:01:34,00:01:35,- You wanted to find out about this.
00:01:35,00:01:37,- I've drawn up a lot of patents.
00:01:37,00:01:38,I was about to apply.
00:01:38,00:01:39,This is devastating.
00:01:39,00:01:41,"- But it's for, it is for planes."
00:01:41,00:01:42,But it's for underwater planes.
00:01:42,00:01:43,- Yeah.
00:01:43,00:01:44,- So.
00:01:44,00:01:45,"- Well, no, no, no."
00:01:45,00:01:47,It's for planes that have crashed and gone underwater.
00:01:47,00:01:48,- Yeah.
00:01:48,00:01:49,- Underwater planes.
00:01:49,00:01:50,- Sorry.
00:01:50,00:01:51,"- Yes, yes."
00:01:51,00:01:51,"- So it basically, it works."
00:01:51,00:01:53,"If a pilot is unconscious and the plane is sinking,"
00:01:53,00:01:57,it'll pop out the pilot without the pilot
00:01:57,00:01:57,needing to do anything.
00:01:57,00:01:58,So that's very clever.
00:01:58,00:02:01,- Why not pop him out prior to hitting the water
00:02:01,00:02:03,"and sinking, like I would argue an ejector seat"
00:02:03,00:02:04,is built to do.
00:02:04,00:02:06,"- I suppose the plane is thinking,"
00:02:06,00:02:07,"maybe he's, maybe he's all right."
00:02:07,00:02:10,"- The plane is thinking, yeah, maybe he's still,"
00:02:10,00:02:12,he or she will pull this round
00:02:12,00:02:13,and then the plane is into the water
00:02:13,00:02:15,"and the plane realizes, I better step in."
00:02:15,00:02:16,- Okay.
00:02:16,00:02:17,I think it's usually the pilot
00:02:17,00:02:19,that presses the ejector seat button or pulls the lever.
00:02:19,00:02:22,I'm not sure the sentient plane has been invented yet.
00:02:22,00:02:24,"- In this case, in this case, it's automatic."
00:02:24,00:02:25,"- Yes, once it hits water."
00:02:25,00:02:27,"But I think what happens is often,"
00:02:27,00:02:28,"if you're trying to land your plane,"
00:02:28,00:02:30,you want to land it rather than eject
00:02:30,00:02:32,'cause then you can save the plane.
00:02:32,00:02:34,"You can land planes on water as we've seen,"
00:02:34,00:02:37,slowly landed there on the Hudson.
00:02:37,00:02:38,"Maybe you try and do it,"
00:02:38,00:02:39,but then you don't get it quite right
00:02:39,00:02:41,and you start sinking.
00:02:41,00:02:42,- Okay.
00:02:42,00:02:43,"- Also, it's dangerous to eject"
00:02:43,00:02:45,when you're too close to the ground anyway.
00:02:45,00:02:47,Like if you look at the survival rates of ejection
00:02:47,00:02:49,"under a certain altitude, it's a lot lower."
00:02:49,00:02:51,"So, you know, if you're too close to the water,"
00:02:51,00:02:53,"if you're just coming into land, you get into trouble."
00:02:53,00:02:56,"- But they are amazing because, okay,"
00:02:56,00:02:59,let's say you were parachuting out of a regular plane
00:02:59,00:03:01,and it was too low altitude.
00:03:01,00:03:02,The parachute wouldn't be able to get the grip
00:03:02,00:03:04,and so you would plummet and die.
00:03:04,00:03:06,But ejector seats are actually designed
00:03:06,00:03:09,so that you can eject from a plane
00:03:09,00:03:11,while it's on the ground and survive.
00:03:11,00:03:12,"Yes, the rates are low."
00:03:12,00:03:13,- I didn't know that you could do that.
00:03:13,00:03:14,"- Absolutely, yeah, yeah."
00:03:14,00:03:16,- I got a little working on what can propel you up high enough.
00:03:16,00:03:18,- It propels you up high enough and the parachute works.
00:03:18,00:03:20,And that's what they're designed to do.
00:03:20,00:03:22,"- There are some, like not all of them do that, I think."
00:03:22,00:03:23,- No.
00:03:23,00:03:23,- But they do that.
00:03:23,00:03:24,"- Yeah, you can."
00:03:24,00:03:27,"And you actually, and this was available in the '80s."
00:03:27,00:03:30,I'm sure we'll get on to Rollins in a minute.
00:03:30,00:03:33,"But this was in the '80s, there was a Soviet pilot"
00:03:33,00:03:37,and he was flying down and his plane had rolled
00:03:37,00:03:41,and so the cockpit was now facing towards the ground.
00:03:41,00:03:44,And he was only a few feet from the ground.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"Like he was like, I don't know how many,"
00:03:46,00:03:48,"but it was like, let's say less,"
00:03:48,00:03:50,definitely less than 50 feet away from the ground.
00:03:50,00:03:52,"But he's facing downwards, right?"
00:03:52,00:03:53,"- He didn't, yeah."
00:03:53,00:03:54,"- You pressed the ejector seat,"
00:03:54,00:03:56,fired him towards the ground.
00:03:56,00:03:59,"Everyone thought he's a goner, obviously."
00:03:59,00:04:00,- Yeah.
00:04:00,00:04:01,- Like almost in a cartoon way.
00:04:01,00:04:03,- Did they go and look at the 20 feet deep hole
00:04:03,00:04:05,that had been drilled into the ground by his head?
00:04:05,00:04:06,- Can we guess?
00:04:06,00:04:07,"- Yeah, go on."
00:04:07,00:04:08,- Marshmallow factory.
00:04:08,00:04:10,It's always a moth factory.
00:04:10,00:04:11,"- Yeah, or a mattress factory."
00:04:11,00:04:12,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:04:12,00:04:13,Just a bit further.
00:04:13,00:04:16,Just got to get directly over the old pillow mountain.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"- Oh no, that's the broken glass factory."
00:04:21,00:04:26,"- No, they had like an auto gyroscope system in their seat."
00:04:26,00:04:30,"So as it pushed you out, it knew which way was up"
00:04:30,00:04:32,"and then it could fire rocket boosters,"
00:04:32,00:04:33,which took him in the right direction
00:04:33,00:04:35,away from the ground.
00:04:35,00:04:37,And the amazing thing was that no one knew about this.
00:04:37,00:04:38,It was Soviet technology
00:04:38,00:04:40,and the Americans didn't know about it
00:04:40,00:04:42,and Europeans didn't know about it.
00:04:42,00:04:44,And it was live on television or shown on television.
00:04:44,00:04:45,So everyone thought he was dead.
00:04:45,00:04:47,"And then suddenly when he survived,"
00:04:47,00:04:49,"everyone was like, holy shit, how did that happen?"
00:04:49,00:04:50,"- Yeah, that's amazing."
00:04:50,00:04:52,"- They thought he was dead when he ejected,"
00:04:52,00:04:53,but then they saw him spin around
00:04:53,00:04:54,and go back up in the end.
00:04:54,00:04:56,- I think they thought he was dead.
00:04:56,00:04:59,Everyone's eyes kind of followed the wreckage
00:04:59,00:05:02,"and then they turned back and he was, ta-da."
00:05:02,00:05:02,- Yeah.
00:05:02,00:05:03,- What a trick.
00:05:03,00:05:04,- So cool.
00:05:04,00:05:05,- That was amazing.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"- Quickly back on the original character in this,"
00:05:08,00:05:08,John Rawlins.
00:05:08,00:05:12,"So Sir John Rawlins, amazing character."
00:05:12,00:05:14,"- Sir John Stuart, Peeps Rawlins."
00:05:14,00:05:17,- Peeps Rawlins because he was a descendant of Pete.
00:05:17,00:05:18,- Yeah.
00:05:18,00:05:19,- Pretty cool.
00:05:19,00:05:19,- Direct descendant.
00:05:19,00:05:21,"- Apparently I couldn't find the family tree,"
00:05:21,00:05:25,but his father was also hugely decorated
00:05:25,00:05:26,as a military person.
00:05:26,00:05:28,He comes from huge stock
00:05:28,00:05:30,and he designed the first protected helmets
00:05:30,00:05:32,using composite materials.
00:05:32,00:05:34,- He advised the British Standards Institute
00:05:34,00:05:37,"on how to make motorcycle helmets, cycling helmets,"
00:05:37,00:05:40,"horse riding helmets, racing helmets."
00:05:40,00:05:42,"So a lot of the helmets we wear today,"
00:05:42,00:05:45,"very, very slightly, thanks to some of his research."
00:05:45,00:05:46,"- That's cool, so cool, isn't it?"
00:05:46,00:05:47,- This is interesting about Rawlins
00:05:47,00:05:48,"'cause I have often wondered before,"
00:05:48,00:05:50,why are all these helmets different?
00:05:50,00:05:52,"You know, horse riding and cycling,"
00:05:52,00:05:55,it's gonna be very similar if you fall off head first.
00:05:55,00:05:56,"Bet the same helmet will do it,"
00:05:56,00:05:59,but do you think John just wanted to make us an extra buck
00:05:59,00:06:00,by- - It just looks so stupid.
00:06:00,00:06:01,- Diversifying.
00:06:01,00:06:03,- Wearing a bike helmet on a horse.
00:06:03,00:06:04,"- Well, one of my second helmets looks"
00:06:04,00:06:06,"a lot like a horse helmet, doesn't it?"
00:06:06,00:06:07,You know that orange one that I wear?
00:06:07,00:06:09,"- It does, it does."
00:06:09,00:06:10,"- I don't look stupid, Andy, do I?"
00:06:10,00:06:13,"- No, no, no, no."
00:06:13,00:06:15,(laughing)
00:06:15,00:06:17,I was trying to read more about the underwater ejector.
00:06:17,00:06:19,"- Oh, sorry, I'll be saying ejection seat."
00:06:19,00:06:23,I think this is like a detectorist's thing.
00:06:23,00:06:24,"- Yes, right."
00:06:24,00:06:26,- We'll get lots of letters saying it's an ejection seat.
00:06:26,00:06:28,I've seen lots of people saying ejection seat.
00:06:28,00:06:30,"- I saw a few things online saying ejection, but yeah."
00:06:30,00:06:31,- I'm gonna keep saying it.
00:06:31,00:06:33,And then if you wanna contact James individually
00:06:33,00:06:35,"for saying ejector, we'll just duke it out."
00:06:35,00:06:38,- I'm going off the James Bond name.
00:06:38,00:06:39,"He would call it an ejector seat, wouldn't he?"
00:06:39,00:06:40,"- Yeah, absolutely would."
00:06:40,00:06:42,But that's Bond for you.
00:06:42,00:06:43,- It's such a never- - It's such a never-
00:06:43,00:06:45,- It's such a never- - It's such a never-
00:06:45,00:06:47,- But I was reading about someone who ejected
00:06:47,00:06:50,"in 1954, which was just before Rawlins invented"
00:06:50,00:06:52,the underwater ejection seat.
00:06:52,00:06:53,- Yeah.
00:06:53,00:06:54,"- And it was off an aircraft carrier,"
00:06:54,00:06:55,"a British aircraft carrier, right?"
00:06:55,00:06:59,"And their plane was a thing called the Westland Wyvern,"
00:06:59,00:07:00,right?
00:07:00,00:07:03,"You know, Wyvern is a mythical dragon-y creature."
00:07:03,00:07:06,"Get this, it had folding wings."
00:07:06,00:07:08,There are these pictures of all the planes
00:07:08,00:07:09,"on the aircraft carrier, and their wings,"
00:07:09,00:07:12,"just halfway across, just fold up like elbows."
00:07:12,00:07:13,- Okay.
00:07:13,00:07:15,- Like a table tennis table.
00:07:15,00:07:16,"- Exactly, exactly like that."
00:07:16,00:07:20,- So they like to fly through some mountain-close mountains.
00:07:20,00:07:22,"- That's exactly what it's for, right?"
00:07:22,00:07:23,"- That's it, yeah, yeah."
00:07:23,00:07:26,"- Everyone breathe in, we're going through two mountains."
00:07:26,00:07:29,"- No, it's a stash them on the decks of aircraft carriers."
00:07:29,00:07:31,You can store five planes where you could only store two
00:07:31,00:07:31,if they had their wings out.
00:07:31,00:07:33,"But honestly, I've never seen it before."
00:07:33,00:07:36,"The wings literally halfway along, they just fold up."
00:07:36,00:07:37,- Like a butterfly.
00:07:37,00:07:38,- Amazing.
00:07:38,00:07:39,- Or a finger.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"In fact, they had two joints."
00:07:40,00:07:42,(laughing)
00:07:42,00:07:44,"They had two joints in them, so it is exactly like a finger."
00:07:44,00:07:46,"Because if you crook your finger in that creepy way,"
00:07:46,00:07:47,that's what the wings do.
00:07:47,00:07:48,"- Oh yeah, all right, well they should have done it."
00:07:48,00:07:49,- They could have closed your finger.
00:07:49,00:07:51,- Why didn't they do like a butterfly?
00:07:51,00:07:52,That would take up much less space.
00:07:52,00:07:54,"- Yeah, you could have folded it right up."
00:07:54,00:07:55,- Do it at the shoulder.
00:07:55,00:07:57,"Yeah, not the elbow, you idiots."
00:07:57,00:07:59,(laughing)
00:07:59,00:08:02,So I thought that the only underwater ejection seats
00:08:02,00:08:04,were ejection seats that were used underwater
00:08:04,00:08:06,"having not been intended for it,"
00:08:06,00:08:08,because that does seem to happen.
00:08:08,00:08:11,"And I was reading a blog of a guy called Russ Pearson,"
00:08:11,00:08:12,"who, did you read about him?"
00:08:12,00:08:16,"- Russ is 1969, and he ejected in the Pacific"
00:08:16,00:08:19,off the coast of California from an ejecto seat underwater.
00:08:19,00:08:21,So he'd crash landed.
00:08:21,00:08:22,"I mean, it sounds like he definitely said,"
00:08:22,00:08:24,"I thought I was definitely gonna die,"
00:08:24,00:08:25,'cause obviously I was 20 feet underwater.
00:08:25,00:08:27,I was sinking incredibly fast.
00:08:27,00:08:30,I just pressed a button and hoped for the best.
00:08:30,00:08:31,"It broke his back at the time,"
00:08:31,00:08:33,but I think he was too panicked to notice
00:08:33,00:08:35,while he was underwater.
00:08:35,00:08:37,"And somehow, I think there was a boat suddenly"
00:08:37,00:08:38,"which turned a light on in the distance,"
00:08:38,00:08:40,which told him where the surface was.
00:08:40,00:08:42,So he managed to swim up to the surface.
00:08:42,00:08:45,But he said the worst thing about ejecting underwater
00:08:45,00:08:49,in an ejecto seat is what do you have to have on you
00:08:49,00:08:50,that automatically is applied
00:08:50,00:08:52,when you eject from a plane in the air?
00:08:52,00:08:54,- Oxygen?
00:08:54,00:08:55,"- Actually, oxygen is one thing."
00:08:55,00:08:56,- Lip balm.
00:08:56,00:08:58,"- Like, what's applied to you?"
00:08:58,00:09:00,"- I haven't phrased this very well,"
00:09:00,00:09:02,"and I can understand the errors,"
00:09:02,00:09:03,but I'm talking about a parachute.
00:09:03,00:09:04,"- Oh, yeah."
00:09:04,00:09:05,"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:09:05,00:09:06,- So it ejects you with a parachute.
00:09:06,00:09:07,"He made it up to the surface,"
00:09:07,00:09:11,but then the parachute just pulled him down and down again.
00:09:11,00:09:12,"- Oh, no."
00:09:12,00:09:14,- And he just up there with a broken back parachute
00:09:14,00:09:15,pulling him down.
00:09:15,00:09:17,And then he said he felt something on his feet
00:09:17,00:09:19,and he thought that's a shark.
00:09:19,00:09:21,"And so he tried to find his shark repellent,"
00:09:21,00:09:23,which for some reason he was carrying in his pocket.
00:09:23,00:09:25,- He was a Batman from the 1960s.
00:09:25,00:09:29,- But he realized it was just the plane.
00:09:29,00:09:32,"And then, yeah, he just about survived."
00:09:32,00:09:34,He managed to be evacuated on a medical plane.
00:09:34,00:09:35,- Pretty cool.
00:09:35,00:09:36,I have a cool thing.
00:09:36,00:09:39,"So the first person to use an ejecto seat,"
00:09:39,00:09:43,"I think in the UK was a guy,"
00:09:43,00:09:45,he was an Irish mechanic.
00:09:45,00:09:46,He was called Bernard Lynch.
00:09:46,00:09:48,And he did it in 1945.
00:09:48,00:09:52,And later he did 32 more ejections from planes
00:09:52,00:09:53,to test the stuff.
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Yeah, he was the guinea pig."
00:09:54,00:09:55,- He was the guinea pig.
00:09:55,00:09:56,- The ejecto seat guinea pig.
00:09:56,00:09:57,"- Yeah, for the firm Martin Baker,"
00:09:57,00:09:58,"which is the British firm,"
00:09:58,00:10:02,which makes thousands of ejecto seats and does all that.
00:10:02,00:10:06,"Anyway, I got to speak to Bernard Lynch's son, Dermot."
00:10:06,00:10:08,I rang him up and we had a cool chat.
00:10:08,00:10:13,"- Yeah, and he had some crazy adventures."
00:10:13,00:10:14,So once he landed in a field right
00:10:14,00:10:16,when he was testing an ejecto seat.
00:10:16,00:10:18,And then he just sort of left his parachute behind.
00:10:18,00:10:19,I think he tied it to a tree or something.
00:10:19,00:10:20,- Yeah.
00:10:20,00:10:21,- And he just went to the pub.
00:10:21,00:10:22,- Like a dog poo.
00:10:22,00:10:23,"- Yeah, huge huge dog poo."
00:10:23,00:10:25,"- I'm coming back to pick it up, okay?"
00:10:25,00:10:26,Don't get dressed up.
00:10:26,00:10:28,- He just went to the pub.
00:10:28,00:10:30,"And then the team turned up, obviously,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,'cause they track broadly where you're going
00:10:31,00:10:32,and they're looking for it.
00:10:32,00:10:35,"And so the team from the company arrived at the field,"
00:10:35,00:10:37,"thought, oh no, Bernard's, he's died somehow."
00:10:37,00:10:39,- He was evaporated.
00:10:39,00:10:40,- The tree ate him.
00:10:40,00:10:43,"- They phoned his wife, they told him he was dead."
00:10:43,00:10:45,And then they found him in the pub.
00:10:45,00:10:45,- Straight away?
00:10:45,00:10:47,- That was premature.
00:10:47,00:10:49,- Before they found the bunny or anything.
00:10:49,00:10:51,"They were just like, oh, I'm really sure."
00:10:51,00:10:54,He tied up his parachutes and then he died.
00:10:54,00:10:55,"- Actually, I've got to say,"
00:10:55,00:10:57,"when you were 10 minutes late today, James,"
00:10:57,00:10:59,they did call Paulina on that.
00:10:59,00:11:01,So you'll want to reassure her.
00:11:01,00:11:03,- Such a good point.
00:11:03,00:11:06,"- Yeah, two hours later,"
00:11:06,00:11:07,they found him in the parking lot.
00:11:07,00:11:08,- Two hours later.
00:11:08,00:11:09,- Wow.
00:11:09,00:11:11,- He was a legend and he subjected his body
00:11:11,00:11:14,to so much volunteering to do this.
00:11:14,00:11:16,"'Cause he used to, before he had himself"
00:11:16,00:11:18,"fired out of actual planes,"
00:11:18,00:11:20,they erected what sounds to me like one of those things
00:11:20,00:11:22,that are fairground where you're sitting
00:11:22,00:11:26,"on a big, long bench and it lifts all the way up a pole."
00:11:26,00:11:29,"And then it drops you really hard, do you know what I mean?"
00:11:29,00:11:30,"- Yeah, those fairground ones."
00:11:30,00:11:32,- I think he was like on a reverse version of that.
00:11:32,00:11:33,So he would sit--
00:11:33,00:11:35,- So he was on the pole.
00:11:36,00:11:38,- He was reverse polling.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"No, he was on something that would look the same,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,but it shoots you up incredibly fast.
00:11:42,00:11:44,So it was like a bench attached to a pole.
00:11:44,00:11:46,"- It was more like, if we're talking fairground things,"
00:11:46,00:11:50,"it was more like the strongman kind of where you,"
00:11:50,00:11:52,you slam the hammer out and you send the weight.
00:11:52,00:11:54,- He's sitting on the weight.
00:11:54,00:11:55,- He's sitting on the weight.
00:11:55,00:11:56,- That's brilliant.
00:11:56,00:11:57,"- Yeah, he's bringing love to the top."
00:11:57,00:11:58,"- He was only six inches tall, wasn't he?"
00:11:58,00:11:59,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:11:59,00:12:00,- This worked.
00:12:00,00:12:03,But he used to just do that until it got too painful.
00:12:03,00:12:04,So they do it more and more with more and more force.
00:12:04,00:12:07,'Cause you need maximum force for an ejection seat
00:12:07,00:12:08,to get people out of harm's way.
00:12:08,00:12:12,And as soon as it got to such an agonizing level
00:12:12,00:12:14,"that he was like, I don't think we can do this to pilots."
00:12:14,00:12:16,"He'd say, that's max force."
00:12:16,00:12:17,Next up.
00:12:17,00:12:18,- He was very tough.
00:12:18,00:12:23,"He did one thing, he refused to eject over water."
00:12:23,00:12:23,- Okay.
00:12:23,00:12:24,- He just wouldn't do it.
00:12:24,00:12:25,He just wouldn't do it.
00:12:25,00:12:26,And none of the experiments was he willing to--
00:12:26,00:12:27,"- Oh, okay."
00:12:27,00:12:28,- No pubs.
00:12:28,00:12:28,- No water.
00:12:28,00:12:29,- What?
00:12:29,00:12:30,- No pubs.
00:12:30,00:12:31,(laughing)
00:12:31,00:12:34,- It was because he'd fallen in sheep dip when he was eight.
00:12:34,00:12:36,And it was a really traumatizing experience.
00:12:36,00:12:37,He might have nearly drowned or something.
00:12:37,00:12:38,- Really?
00:12:38,00:12:39,- He would form a pool of sheep dip.
00:12:39,00:12:40,- What's that?
00:12:40,00:12:42,- It's a chemical solution that you make sheep walk through
00:12:42,00:12:45,"to, I think, keep them clean or antiseptic."
00:12:45,00:12:47,- It's quite different than an ocean.
00:12:47,00:12:48,- Yeah.
00:12:48,00:12:50,- So it's quite strange that you would project one
00:12:50,00:12:51,onto the other.
00:12:51,00:12:52,- Yeah.
00:12:52,00:12:53,- I guess it must just be a bit of drowning.
00:12:53,00:12:54,- Sounds more like that thing you go through
00:12:54,00:12:55,when you're going to a swimming pool.
00:12:55,00:12:56,"- Yeah, it's like that."
00:12:56,00:12:57,- It is like that.
00:12:57,00:12:57,"- Ah, yeah, yeah."
00:12:57,00:12:58,That's it.
00:12:58,00:12:59,"Okay, but trauma."
00:12:59,00:13:00,"- It was enough to traumatize Bernard, yeah."
00:13:00,00:13:03,- I think that's probably a fair enough request.
00:13:03,00:13:06,- If you're constantly being lobbed out of an ejector seat.
00:13:06,00:13:08,"- Martin Baker, did he work for this guy?"
00:13:08,00:13:08,- Yeah.
00:13:08,00:13:09,- Yeah.
00:13:09,00:13:13,"So they have a website, and on the website,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,it has a counter that tells you how many lives
00:13:15,00:13:17,they've saved.
00:13:17,00:13:18,"- Oh, really?"
00:13:18,00:13:19,"- Yeah, isn't that cool?"
00:13:19,00:13:21,"Last time I checked, which was when I did this research"
00:13:21,00:13:26,"yesterday, it was 7,690 lives that they've saved."
00:13:26,00:13:30,"- I wonder how soon after the ejector seat saving the life,"
00:13:30,00:13:31,they do the counter.
00:13:31,00:13:32,It'd be cool if they did it in real time.
00:13:32,00:13:33,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:13:33,00:13:37,- As in they have some kind of thing in the chairs
00:13:37,00:13:37,that whatever.
00:13:37,00:13:39,"- It actually, when you pull the lever"
00:13:39,00:13:41,"and you rock it out of the thing,"
00:13:41,00:13:43,the chair automatically spits out a little form.
00:13:43,00:13:45,And you have to write.
00:13:45,00:13:47,I have had my life saved by this.
00:13:47,00:13:48,- Do you think it ever then goes down again?
00:13:48,00:13:51,"'Cause sometimes, you know, you'll think you've saved"
00:13:51,00:13:54,"the life, and then they'll crash into a thorn bush"
00:13:54,00:13:54,or something.
00:13:54,00:13:55,(laughing)
00:13:55,00:13:57,"Or we think it's, it's like when a goal's disallowed,"
00:13:57,00:13:59,"you know, the goal the score goes up."
00:13:59,00:14:02,"But they are actually, yeah, VAR says death."
00:14:02,00:14:04,"- What if, what if that guy was run over by a car"
00:14:04,00:14:06,"on the way to the pub with that, with that discount?"
00:14:06,00:14:08,"- Yeah, yeah, I don't know."
00:14:08,00:14:10,- But they were called James Martin
00:14:10,00:14:11,"and Valentine Baker, weren't they?"
00:14:11,00:14:14,"- Yeah, he was an amazing pilot, Valentine Baker."
00:14:14,00:14:16,He was Amy Johnson's flight instructor.
00:14:16,00:14:18,"- Sorry, wait, is Amy Johnson was an aviator"
00:14:18,00:14:19,from the 30s?
00:14:19,00:14:22,"- Yeah, a sort of classic aviator from the,"
00:14:22,00:14:24,"God, the Amelia Earhart sort of period."
00:14:24,00:14:28,"- She was, was she the first to fly across the Atlantic?"
00:14:28,00:14:29,"- God, I can't remember now."
00:14:29,00:14:30,- She was the first to do something.
00:14:30,00:14:31,- Fly to Australia?
00:14:31,00:14:33,"- Fly to Australia, I think she crash landed on her way,"
00:14:33,00:14:34,though I've seen footage of that.
00:14:34,00:14:38,"- So Amy Johnson, I think I've been to the town"
00:14:38,00:14:42,on the coast in Kent where she disappeared.
00:14:42,00:14:43,- Did she disappear as well?
00:14:43,00:14:45,"- Yeah, yeah, I think she was flying,"
00:14:45,00:14:46,"oh gosh, where is it?"
00:14:46,00:14:50,"It's near, there was a Turkish restaurant we went to"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"and I had, I had, - Oh yeah, okay,"
00:14:52,00:14:53,"I know, that's the Turkish restaurant."
00:14:53,00:14:55,- I didn't remember it 'cause I ordered the Turnip Juice
00:14:55,00:14:56,as my drink for the meal.
00:14:56,00:14:57,- I've heard this story before.
00:14:57,00:15:02,"And the waiter said, the waiter said are you sure,"
00:15:02,00:15:03,are you sure you want the Turnip Juice?
00:15:03,00:15:06,"I said, I'm here, I'm on the North Kent coast,"
00:15:06,00:15:11,I want to experience Turkish culture as it was intended to
00:15:11,00:15:13,and it was absolutely tough.
00:15:13,00:15:15,"- He didn't like it guys, spoiler, he didn't like it."
00:15:15,00:15:18,"- Okay guys, so if you wanna know where this happened,"
00:15:18,00:15:22,either Google where Amy Johnson crashed
00:15:22,00:15:25,or just check out Andy's history on TripAdvisor reviews
00:15:25,00:15:28,and you'll see it in there.
00:15:28,00:15:30,- I thank God you weren't asked to do the eulogy
00:15:30,00:15:30,at a funeral.
00:15:30,00:15:33,She was a wonderful person.
00:15:33,00:15:35,Can I quickly just mention yesterday?
00:15:35,00:15:42,"- Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, Hurn Bay, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:15:42,00:15:46,- My wife once won a load of teddies
00:15:46,00:15:47,on a shooting gallery in Hurn Bay.
00:15:47,00:15:48,- Really?
00:15:48,00:15:49,- Yeah.
00:15:49,00:15:52,- So many good personal anecdotes in Hurn Bay.
00:15:52,00:15:53,- It's a rich place.
00:15:53,00:15:55,"- I went there not long ago,"
00:15:55,00:15:57,"but yeah, but I was only making a connecting train"
00:15:57,00:15:59,so I just stayed in the station.
00:15:59,00:16:01,- That's a better story than both lines.
00:16:01,00:16:02,(all laughing)
00:16:02,00:16:05,- I read an article about the ejection club
00:16:05,00:16:07,"at the Waterbaker Run and it was,"
00:16:07,00:16:09,they called it the only club where you have to be thrown out
00:16:09,00:16:10,to get in.
00:16:10,00:16:12,"- Brilliant, that's really good."
00:16:12,00:16:15,- I got an alternative to an ejection seat here.
00:16:15,00:16:16,This is great.
00:16:16,00:16:18,"This is a plane, it's an American plane"
00:16:18,00:16:21,with the Douglas F3D Sky Night.
00:16:21,00:16:22,- All right.
00:16:22,00:16:23,- Do you have to say it like that?
00:16:23,00:16:24,"- Yes, you do."
00:16:24,00:16:26,"It was this year's plane and if you had to bail out,"
00:16:26,00:16:29,"it was a really small cruise, that's two-seater plane."
00:16:29,00:16:32,"You're sitting next to each other, okay?"
00:16:32,00:16:33,One is the pilot and one is...
00:16:33,00:16:34,- Co-pilot?
00:16:34,00:16:38,"- No, genuinely doing something else like radar or something."
00:16:38,00:16:39,- Or getting some drinks.
00:16:39,00:16:41,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:16:41,00:16:44,- He's got a tiny trolley and he offers the pilot chicken
00:16:44,00:16:47,or fish about halfway through the flight.
00:16:47,00:16:49,- Do you want to buy any lottery cards?
00:16:49,00:16:51,We're selling lottery cards as for charity.
00:16:51,00:16:53,If you've got any spare change in the country
00:16:53,00:16:56,"you've come from, you can buy these lottery cards."
00:16:56,00:16:58,"- Both flying over Cambodia now, what are you doing?"
00:16:58,00:17:00,(all laughing)
00:17:00,00:17:01,"Yeah, but it's exactly that, you know."
00:17:01,00:17:04,"So anyway, there's this plane, the Sky Night,"
00:17:04,00:17:06,"and if they had to bail out,"
00:17:06,00:17:08,the crew didn't have an ejector seat in the plane.
00:17:08,00:17:10,What they had effectively was a slide.
00:17:10,00:17:12,"- Oh, okay. - Going down and back."
00:17:12,00:17:13,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:17:13,00:17:15,- So you would just have to pop out
00:17:15,00:17:17,between the engines of the plane.
00:17:17,00:17:19,"It's, I mean, this sounds incredibly risky."
00:17:19,00:17:21,"You did, obviously you'd have a parachute on"
00:17:21,00:17:22,"when you did that, ideally."
00:17:22,00:17:25,"- Yeah, I do always want to, what's the next flavor?"
00:17:25,00:17:27,"- It sounds risky, but..."
00:17:27,00:17:28,(all laughing)
00:17:28,00:17:29,- Are you sure you want to do this?
00:17:29,00:17:31,This looks pretty risky.
00:17:31,00:17:33,"No, you're right, let's die instead."
00:17:33,00:17:34,Let's just crash.
00:17:34,00:17:35,- I'll have the chicken!
00:17:35,00:17:38,(all laughing)
00:17:38,00:17:39,- But sometimes they use this plane
00:17:39,00:17:40,to deploy commandos into the jungle.
00:17:40,00:17:43,So you'd have one pilot and one commando in the plane.
00:17:43,00:17:44,"And at a certain point,"
00:17:44,00:17:45,the commando just pops down the slide.
00:17:45,00:17:47,- Really? - It sounds so cool.
00:17:47,00:17:48,- It sounds amazing.
00:17:48,00:17:50,"- Yeah, I think it was. - Did it work?"
00:17:50,00:17:52,- I think it was incredibly dangerous.
00:17:52,00:17:53,- It wasn't used for long.
00:17:53,00:17:55,"And I think 'cause it was first used in the A3D,"
00:17:55,00:17:58,"which came to stand for all three dead,"
00:17:58,00:18:02,'cause that was three people who would be in the plane.
00:18:02,00:18:03,And I think it took a long time
00:18:03,00:18:04,"'cause it was sort of behind the seats,"
00:18:04,00:18:06,so you realized you were gonna crash
00:18:06,00:18:07,"and then you had to sort of clamber over,"
00:18:07,00:18:08,you weren't quite a lot of gear.
00:18:08,00:18:09,"- Yeah, it's really cramped, yeah."
00:18:09,00:18:11,- Squeezing one after the other.
00:18:11,00:18:12,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:18:12,00:18:14,- 'Cause even now they say if you lose your phone
00:18:14,00:18:16,"behind the seats, you're not allowed to get it yourself."
00:18:16,00:18:17,You have to get the attendant to come
00:18:17,00:18:18,and get your phone for you.
00:18:18,00:18:19,- And that's in case you fall down the chute
00:18:19,00:18:22,"when you're trying, so. (laughing)"
00:18:22,00:18:23,- It's just the last thing.
00:18:23,00:18:26,"If you love ejector seats and they look so cool,"
00:18:26,00:18:28,and I spent a lot of hours last night
00:18:28,00:18:29,"trying to find the most affordable one,"
00:18:29,00:18:31,"but on eBay, they go--"
00:18:31,00:18:33,- Can you try and eject other?
00:18:33,00:18:34,- They look so cool.
00:18:34,00:18:35,They sell them to just--
00:18:35,00:18:36,"- Not going to the hospital, did I?"
00:18:36,00:18:37,(laughing)
00:18:37,00:18:40,- Let me tell you an anecdote about Turkish breakfast.
00:18:40,00:18:43,(upbeat music)
00:18:43,00:18:48,"- Okay, it is time for fact number two,"
00:18:48,00:18:49,and that is my fact.
00:18:49,00:18:52,My fact this week is that there is a school in Massachusetts
00:18:52,00:18:56,"that has had all of its 7,000 light bulbs permanently on"
00:18:56,00:18:57,for over a year and a half now
00:18:57,00:19:00,because no one knows how to turn them off.
00:19:00,00:19:01,(laughing)
00:19:01,00:19:03,So this is a lighting system that was installed
00:19:03,00:19:05,"in Minnichalg Regional High School,"
00:19:05,00:19:07,which is in Massachusetts.
00:19:07,00:19:09,"And the idea was they were thinking,"
00:19:09,00:19:11,how can we have a lighting system
00:19:11,00:19:12,that's gonna save us a lot of money?
00:19:12,00:19:13,And they came up with this.
00:19:13,00:19:15,They thought this is gonna save us
00:19:15,00:19:17,hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.
00:19:17,00:19:18,Unfortunately--
00:19:18,00:19:20,- 'Cause it happened to be very efficiently built.
00:19:20,00:19:22,"- Yeah, there were LED light bulbs."
00:19:22,00:19:24,"There was, it had dimming qualities on it."
00:19:24,00:19:27,It was a great system that was energy efficient
00:19:27,00:19:29,in a way that usual light bulbs wouldn't be.
00:19:29,00:19:31,And so they decided to go for the system.
00:19:31,00:19:33,"And then during the pandemic,"
00:19:33,00:19:36,"something in the system went faulty and failed,"
00:19:36,00:19:37,which meant that the lights weren't dimming.
00:19:37,00:19:39,It meant they weren't going off altogether.
00:19:39,00:19:42,"It meant basically that close to 7,000 of these light bulbs"
00:19:42,00:19:44,were just remaining on.
00:19:44,00:19:45,Then it was discovered that actually
00:19:45,00:19:47,the hardware that was needed to fix it
00:19:47,00:19:50,"wasn't available and they needed to order it from China,"
00:19:50,00:19:53,which had a backlog of orders so they couldn't get it over.
00:19:53,00:19:56,"So as we speak, it still hasn't been fixed."
00:19:56,00:19:57,They know the problem.
00:19:57,00:19:58,They've ordered the parts.
00:19:58,00:19:58,They're arriving.
00:19:58,00:19:59,"I think they have them now,"
00:19:59,00:20:02,but they're not putting them in till March.
00:20:02,00:20:02,And so--
00:20:02,00:20:04,- 'Cause they need experts to come and put them in
00:20:04,00:20:05,and they can't get them.
00:20:05,00:20:07,It is so mad.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"'Cause it's like taxpayer funded school, obviously."
00:20:09,00:20:11,So every day you have a reminder
00:20:11,00:20:13,of what your taxes are going towards
00:20:13,00:20:16,as you walk past this brightly illuminated school.
00:20:16,00:20:18,- And it's costing thousands a month.
00:20:18,00:20:19,"- 'Cause they turn the electricity off,"
00:20:19,00:20:21,"like as in every night,"
00:20:21,00:20:23,"when all the kids go away, you just..."
00:20:23,00:20:24,(imitates electric sound)
00:20:24,00:20:25,"- Yeah, you'd think so, right?"
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- Maybe, maybe there's health and safety reasons"
00:20:27,00:20:28,why you can't do that.
00:20:28,00:20:29,- Feels like there must be something
00:20:29,00:20:32,that they can use that light for.
00:20:32,00:20:33,- Do you know what I mean?
00:20:33,00:20:35,"I mean, there must be a use at night."
00:20:35,00:20:36,- Put solar panels in there.
00:20:36,00:20:39,(all laughing)
00:20:39,00:20:43,"That's how I actually, all my electricity in my house"
00:20:43,00:20:46,is I put solar panels underneath all my lights
00:20:46,00:20:48,and then keep my lights on all the time.
00:20:48,00:20:51,"- Yeah, so it's a big problem."
00:20:51,00:20:53,It's costing them possibly tens of thousands of dollars
00:20:53,00:20:54,at this point.
00:20:54,00:20:55,"I mean, it certainly has."
00:20:55,00:20:57,And some of the teachers try to fix it
00:20:57,00:21:00,by just taking the light bulbs out themselves.
00:21:00,00:21:02,"Yeah, just going around. - Does that work?"
00:21:02,00:21:05,"- It does, but they only take out three or four"
00:21:05,00:21:06,"as opposed to the 7,000. - You can't do that every night."
00:21:06,00:21:07,Can you?
00:21:07,00:21:08,"It's 7,000 bulbs?"
00:21:08,00:21:09,You've got a shot.
00:21:09,00:21:10,- It's further ceiling lights.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"You know, the recessed ceiling lights,"
00:21:12,00:21:15,they're a complete pain in the ass to get in the screw.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"- Yeah, exactly. - It's my two penny worth."
00:21:17,00:21:18,(all laughing)
00:21:18,00:21:19,It's being a bad lighting systems.
00:21:19,00:21:24,"Actually, I had a look in the fish inbox,"
00:21:24,00:21:27,"podcast@qi.com, just to see if anyone"
00:21:27,00:21:29,had written in about light bulbs.
00:21:29,00:21:32,"Thank you, Paddy McCray, who wrote in quite a while ago now."
00:21:32,00:21:34,"I hope you're still listening, Paddy."
00:21:34,00:21:35,This is an incredible fact.
00:21:35,00:21:37,"It's about the terminal five at Heathrow, right?"
00:21:37,00:21:38,- Oh yeah.
00:21:38,00:21:40,- Which has this beautiful high ceiling.
00:21:40,00:21:43,Like the bulbs are all about 120 feet in the air.
00:21:43,00:21:45,"And between 2008 and 2013,"
00:21:45,00:21:47,no bulbs were changed in the ceiling
00:21:47,00:21:49,because they didn't have a good way of doing it.
00:21:49,00:21:52,"And at that point, about 60% of the bulbs had gone."
00:21:52,00:21:56,And so the reports say that they hired a team
00:21:56,00:21:59,of tightrope walkers because that was the only way.
00:21:59,00:22:00,- No. - That's so funny.
00:22:00,00:22:02,That can't be true. - That's untrue.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"- I'm pretty, look, take it up with the Daily Telegraph,"
00:22:05,00:22:07,"who reported that a Cirque du Soleil style,"
00:22:07,00:22:10,high level rope work firm had been engaged
00:22:10,00:22:11,in taking the bulbs. - So funny.
00:22:11,00:22:12,But then they would do some of them
00:22:12,00:22:14,and then some of them would be changed
00:22:14,00:22:16,by someone in a human cannonball.
00:22:16,00:22:17,And they would be fired up.
00:22:17,00:22:19,"And then other ones, it would be trapeze guys."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"- Pyramid of clowns, just all doing one,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,"very, very rescue there."
00:22:23,00:22:24,- That's so funny.
00:22:24,00:22:26,- I'm sure no one was in a costume at Heathrow.
00:22:26,00:22:29,- I was in Dubai recently
00:22:29,00:22:32,and there's lots of glass skyscrapers there.
00:22:32,00:22:36,"And they're all, the window cleaners are all done by hand."
00:22:36,00:22:40,So they have people who are literally like on ropes
00:22:40,00:22:43,"going down all of the highest buildings in the world,"
00:22:43,00:22:44,just cleaning them.
00:22:44,00:22:45,- That's a fun job.
00:22:45,00:22:48,I've always thought that would be a fun job actually.
00:22:48,00:22:49,- I'm one of those harnesses.
00:22:49,00:22:50,"- They call them rats,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,'cause they're rope access technicians.
00:22:52,00:22:55,"- The main company that does Burj Khalifa,"
00:22:55,00:22:57,"which is the highest building,"
00:22:57,00:22:59,"if you want to get a job there,"
00:22:59,00:23:00,they show you like a video nasty
00:23:00,00:23:03,before you are allowed to apply.
00:23:03,00:23:06,And they show you like really awful examples
00:23:06,00:23:08,of people who almost fell and stuff.
00:23:08,00:23:10,"And they're like, if you're okay with a video,"
00:23:10,00:23:11,then you can have an interview.
00:23:11,00:23:14,"- Right, do they show you Mission Impossible 4?"
00:23:14,00:23:17,In which Tom Cruise climbs up the Burj Khalifa.
00:23:17,00:23:18,- And there's a sandstorm as well.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"- Yeah, he's got some special sticky gloves"
00:23:19,00:23:21,and they stop working.
00:23:21,00:23:21,I think he looks behind them
00:23:21,00:23:23,and there's a sandstorm approaching
00:23:23,00:23:24,"and they go, whoa, better climb a bit faster."
00:23:24,00:23:25,"- Well, isn't he responsible"
00:23:25,00:23:27,for making one of these guys have to do extra work?
00:23:27,00:23:29,"Because while he was up there,"
00:23:29,00:23:30,he graffitied Katie Holmes' name.
00:23:30,00:23:32,"Like, I love Katie Holmes."
00:23:32,00:23:34,"Yeah, yeah, and they had to go and clean that off."
00:23:34,00:23:35,"Yeah, that's great."
00:23:35,00:23:39,"- When they first had the electric lights, Edison's ones,"
00:23:39,00:23:40,you would have them in a building.
00:23:40,00:23:42,Obviously no one had seen them before.
00:23:42,00:23:44,And so there would be a sign often next to them
00:23:44,00:23:47,warning people not to try and light the light bulb
00:23:47,00:23:48,with a match.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"- Wow, that's brilliant."
00:23:51,00:23:52,- I've seen one of these signs.
00:23:52,00:23:55,"It says, this room is equipped with Edison electric light."
00:23:55,00:23:58,Do not attempt to light with match.
00:23:58,00:24:01,Simply turn key on wall by door.
00:24:01,00:24:03,The use of electricity for lighting
00:24:03,00:24:05,"is in no way harmful to health,"
00:24:05,00:24:08,nor does it affect the soundness of sleep.
00:24:08,00:24:09,- It does affect.
00:24:09,00:24:10,"If you leave the lights on all night,"
00:24:10,00:24:11,you're gonna have your sleep affected.
00:24:11,00:24:12,That's just a lie.
00:24:12,00:24:13,- It was a lie.
00:24:13,00:24:14,They didn't know at the time.
00:24:14,00:24:15,They didn't know any better.
00:24:15,00:24:18,"- They didn't, lights on all night, insomnia."
00:24:18,00:24:21,- I didn't know why you had to have a light bulb.
00:24:21,00:24:23,"Like, why you needed the glass, basically."
00:24:23,00:24:24,- Go on.
00:24:24,00:24:28,"- Well, it's because it'll react with the oxygen,"
00:24:28,00:24:28,the filament.
00:24:28,00:24:30,"- To make a vacuum, right?"
00:24:30,00:24:31,"- So if you have an incandescent bulb,"
00:24:31,00:24:34,"this is the old, the good old fashioned, you know,"
00:24:34,00:24:35,pre-EU.
00:24:35,00:24:36,- Oh good.
00:24:36,00:24:37,- Okay.
00:24:37,00:24:38,"- Oh good, you're one of those."
00:24:38,00:24:39,"- It's the one where you've got the bulb,"
00:24:39,00:24:40,"the tiny bit of wire,"
00:24:40,00:24:42,and then you run it through the wire and that grows.
00:24:42,00:24:44,It's because the filament would react with oxygen
00:24:44,00:24:46,immediately and then burnouts really fast.
00:24:46,00:24:48,"And if you, as James says, create a vacuum,"
00:24:48,00:24:50,"or fill it with an inert gas,"
00:24:50,00:24:52,then it lasts longer.
00:24:52,00:24:53,"But I just, I didn't know actually why."
00:24:53,00:24:54,"I had this moment yesterday,"
00:24:54,00:24:56,"where it's kind of an anti-light bulb moment,"
00:24:56,00:24:57,"where I was thinking,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,"wait, hang on, why don't we just not have the bulb, right?"
00:25:00,00:25:02,- Save our glass.
00:25:02,00:25:03,- I saved so much glass.
00:25:03,00:25:05,"- And, yeah."
00:25:05,00:25:06,"- What would the safety be outside of that,"
00:25:06,00:25:09,"in terms of if you went and touched it,"
00:25:09,00:25:10,rather than burning it in half?
00:25:10,00:25:12,"- But you wouldn't electrocute yourself, or?"
00:25:12,00:25:15,"- Yeah, and there's an electric current flowing through it."
00:25:15,00:25:16,"- It's a small current, I think,"
00:25:16,00:25:18,"but you would burn yourself, it's so hot."
00:25:18,00:25:20,- The heat is so cool.
00:25:20,00:25:22,"The level of heat that you have in your own room,"
00:25:22,00:25:23,"again, if you're using an incandescent bulb,"
00:25:23,00:25:25,"which you shouldn't be,"
00:25:25,00:25:27,"'cause obviously they're not as efficient,"
00:25:27,00:25:32,"but that filament gets to 2,200 degrees centigrade."
00:25:32,00:25:34,- Isn't it so weird to think
00:25:34,00:25:35,"you're sitting in your sitting room,"
00:25:35,00:25:36,"just biding your time,"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"and there's something over there, which is that hot."
00:25:39,00:25:40,"And also the filament is so long,"
00:25:40,00:25:43,"when you look inside an old bulb, it's two meters long."
00:25:43,00:25:44,"- Really? - It's just really,"
00:25:44,00:25:47,"really thin, 0.2 millimeters thick."
00:25:47,00:25:48,This is an old tungsten filament.
00:25:48,00:25:50,"- In Babylon, ancient Babylon."
00:25:50,00:25:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:25:51,00:25:54,- If you wanted to buy enough oil
00:25:54,00:25:59,"to light your front room with an oil lamp,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,you would have to work for 41 hours
00:26:04,00:26:06,to burn for an hour.
00:26:06,00:26:09,"- Oh, I see. - Okay, so 41 hours work,"
00:26:09,00:26:11,you'd be able to buy enough oil
00:26:11,00:26:14,to make your light bulb for one hour.
00:26:14,00:26:16,"- Okay, that is rubbish."
00:26:16,00:26:18,"- In 1992, in America,"
00:26:18,00:26:21,you could get the same amount of light
00:26:21,00:26:23,by working for less than one second.
00:26:23,00:26:24,- Wow.
00:26:24,00:26:28,"- Imagine being a dad in ancient Babylon,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,getting your family to go around turning off the light.
00:26:30,00:26:33,- That has taken 40 hours of work.
00:26:33,00:26:36,I've worked all week for one hour.
00:26:36,00:26:38,"I come back into the room, no one's in the room."
00:26:38,00:26:40,(laughing)
00:26:40,00:26:43,"- So we've never mentioned, actually,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,"the longest burning light bulb in the world,"
00:26:46,00:26:48,"which is kind of incredible,"
00:26:48,00:26:50,the Livermore Centennial light bulb.
00:26:50,00:26:53,It's been burning non-stop brackets
00:26:53,00:26:57,"with a couple of caveats, closed brackets, since 1901."
00:26:57,00:27:02,And I think one of the keys to a success is that it's four watts.
00:27:02,00:27:03,But it has to be on 24 hours a day
00:27:03,00:27:05,"'cause it's in a fire station,"
00:27:05,00:27:08,so it's to provide a bit of illumination for fire engines.
00:27:08,00:27:11,And Guinness says there's been one break in its operation
00:27:11,00:27:14,when it was taken from one station to another in the '70s.
00:27:14,00:27:17,"And on that occasion, it had, apparently,"
00:27:17,00:27:18,"it says on its own website,"
00:27:18,00:27:23,"""A full police and fire truck escort to take it to its site."""
00:27:23,00:27:26,- It's just the fire truck taking it to another place.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- I don't, you can't call that an escort"
00:27:28,00:27:30,if you're bringing your own thing.
00:27:30,00:27:32,- Escort implied to me there was another fire truck
00:27:32,00:27:33,"running alongside it,"
00:27:33,00:27:35,"kind of stopping anyone else from getting here,"
00:27:35,00:27:36,like a bodyguard.
00:27:36,00:27:37,"- I'm more, for the longest light bulb in the world,"
00:27:37,00:27:40,I'm more interested in the fourth longest
00:27:40,00:27:42,lasting light bulb in the world.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"Because it was, so this is a light bulb"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"that is in New York City, it's not there anymore."
00:27:47,00:27:49,"But at the time, it was outside a place"
00:27:49,00:27:52,"called the Gasnik Supply, which was a hardware store."
00:27:52,00:27:54,"And the owner, Jack Gasnik,"
00:27:54,00:27:57,he was the guy who was trying to get it acknowledged
00:27:57,00:28:00,to be older than all of the other light bulbs.
00:28:00,00:28:02,"But to the point of like, he was furious."
00:28:02,00:28:05,"He was like, ""There's no way that the Livermore light bulb"
00:28:05,00:28:06,"is an actual genuine light bulb."""
00:28:06,00:28:07,"He wrote to Dear Abby,"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"which was like one of those agony aunt things,"
00:28:09,00:28:10,"saying, ""What do I do?"
00:28:10,00:28:12,"I've got a light bulb that's lasted longer."""
00:28:12,00:28:14,- That must have been a nice day for Abby.
00:28:14,00:28:15,- Yeah.
00:28:15,00:28:17,- He's normally writing about people having affairs.
00:28:17,00:28:18,- Yeah.
00:28:18,00:28:19,"- He's like, ""Oh, finally, a light bulb."""
00:28:19,00:28:20,- Yeah.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"And he wrote to Guinness saying,"
00:28:22,00:28:24,"""This is insane that you've given this record."
00:28:24,00:28:25,It's clearly a fake light bulb.
00:28:25,00:28:26,"My light bulb."""
00:28:26,00:28:27,- A fake light bulb?
00:28:27,00:28:28,- He's like a cardboard cashier.
00:28:28,00:28:30,- He thinks something was going on.
00:28:30,00:28:32,So he said that the bulb is not dark enough
00:28:32,00:28:33,to have burned consistently.
00:28:33,00:28:36,"So he said, ""Right away, I saw it was so clear."
00:28:36,00:28:38,It does not show any sign of carbonization.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"A bulb that has burned 20, 30, 40 years"
00:28:40,00:28:43,would be extremely dark from the carbon.
00:28:43,00:28:45,"Two, the bulb is a brass-term knob socket."
00:28:45,00:28:47,You can't have a bulb burn continuously
00:28:47,00:28:49,in a brass-term knob socket.
00:28:49,00:28:51,- I strongly disagree.
00:28:51,00:28:53,"- It would get so hot, it would burn the wires."
00:28:54,00:28:57,"Yeah, so there was a big challenge"
00:28:57,00:28:59,and no one accepted it.
00:28:59,00:29:02,"- When you said this one isn't there anymore in New York,"
00:29:02,00:29:05,"has it gone off or is it, do we know what's happened to it?"
00:29:05,00:29:06,"- The whole of that block,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,the half block was sort of taken down to the ground.
00:29:09,00:29:11,So as far as we know--
00:29:11,00:29:13,- By the sky in a rage.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"- No, by Livermore and it's Mafia."
00:29:17,00:29:19,- There was a huge fire.
00:29:19,00:29:21,- You know when you try and build a new house
00:29:21,00:29:24,"and they say, oh, sorry, there's some really,"
00:29:24,00:29:26,"like, there's some lizards here"
00:29:26,00:29:28,that are going extinct or something.
00:29:28,00:29:30,It does feel like you shouldn't be able to knock down
00:29:30,00:29:32,a house that has the four-foldest light bulb in it.
00:29:32,00:29:35,"- Yeah, absolutely, absolutely."
00:29:35,00:29:35,- Conservation.
00:29:35,00:29:39,"- There is an older one in the UK, an older light bulb,"
00:29:39,00:29:40,"then the Livermore one, yeah."
00:29:40,00:29:41,- Is there?
00:29:41,00:29:43,"- Yeah, but it just hasn't been on all the time."
00:29:43,00:29:44,"- Oh, right."
00:29:44,00:29:47,- So this tragic person's just kept to use light bulb.
00:29:47,00:29:48,"- Pretty much, yeah."
00:29:48,00:29:50,It's called the Ediswan light bulb.
00:29:50,00:29:55,It was first turned on in 1883 in Haitian in England
00:29:55,00:29:57,"and it's owned by someone called Beth Crook,"
00:29:57,00:29:59,or at least it was when I read this article.
00:29:59,00:30:02,"But yeah, they don't really turn it on very often."
00:30:02,00:30:04,- I think that's sensible.
00:30:04,00:30:04,"- Yeah, makes sense."
00:30:04,00:30:06,- I think they have special occasions.
00:30:06,00:30:07,"- Well, some people think that the Livermore one"
00:30:07,00:30:10,has lasted so long because it's never turned off.
00:30:10,00:30:12,"Because when you turn something off,"
00:30:12,00:30:14,sometimes it's like a surge of electricity
00:30:14,00:30:15,and stuff that can damage the filament.
00:30:15,00:30:17,Whereas this has always had four watts just--
00:30:17,00:30:19,- I did that with my computer.
00:30:19,00:30:20,- Yeah.
00:30:20,00:30:22,"- If I turn it off, I think horrible things will happen."
00:30:22,00:30:25,So I just keep flogging it on for a few more years.
00:30:25,00:30:27,- I do the same with my car engine.
00:30:27,00:30:29,(upbeat music)
00:30:29,00:30:37,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Anna."
00:30:37,00:30:39,"- My fact is that in 1955,"
00:30:39,00:30:44,one person secretly bought almost all the onions in America.
00:30:44,00:30:45,(laughing)
00:30:45,00:30:48,This is a guy called Vince Kosuga
00:30:48,00:30:51,and he was an onion farmer in the 1930s.
00:30:51,00:30:55,"And he thought, ""I wanna take this bigger."""
00:30:55,00:30:59,And so he decided to corner the entire onion market
00:30:59,00:31:03,of America by buying all of the onions.
00:31:03,00:31:05,"And so then you've cornered the market,"
00:31:05,00:31:06,you've got all the onions
00:31:06,00:31:09,so you can absolutely control the price of onions.
00:31:09,00:31:11,But the thing I find so incredible about this
00:31:11,00:31:14,"is that in order to stop word spreading,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"'cause as soon as word spreads that he's doing this,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,"then people selling him onions are gonna go,"
00:31:17,00:31:19,"""I'm gonna charge away more for these onions then."""
00:31:19,00:31:20,"It's not word spreading,"
00:31:20,00:31:23,he would have had to do it completely in secret
00:31:23,00:31:24,and make sure none of the onion sellers
00:31:24,00:31:25,"are talking to each other,"
00:31:25,00:31:27,"going, ""Did that guy have Vince come through last?"""
00:31:27,00:31:29,- So he would just go in with a different moustache
00:31:29,00:31:29,and a hat and stuff.
00:31:29,00:31:30,- I think so.
00:31:30,00:31:32,(laughing)
00:31:32,00:31:35,"- So what he especially bought, he bought onions, yes,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,but he also bought onions before they existed.
00:31:37,00:31:38,- Potential onions.
00:31:38,00:31:39,"- Yeah, potential onions."
00:31:39,00:31:40,He bought onion futures.
00:31:40,00:31:41,- Conceptual onions.
00:31:41,00:31:43,- Conceptual onions.
00:31:43,00:31:45,The basic idea is you buy the right to buy
00:31:45,00:31:47,"the future onions for an agreed price,"
00:31:47,00:31:50,you say I'll buy 10 tons of onions from you next year
00:31:50,00:31:52,"for a pound of kilo or whatever,"
00:31:52,00:31:54,and then you have to do that.
00:31:54,00:31:56,- You're betting that the price will go up in that time
00:31:56,00:31:57,and you've already made the agreement
00:31:57,00:31:59,so you'll make the difference.
00:31:59,00:32:00,"- And you could also be screwed though,"
00:32:00,00:32:01,you'd have to still stick to that price
00:32:01,00:32:04,"even if they were worth less at the time,"
00:32:04,00:32:05,"but if you bought all the onions,"
00:32:05,00:32:07,- You can charge whatever price you want.
00:32:07,00:32:10,"- Well, but then the weird trick he did was,"
00:32:10,00:32:12,"as well as cornering the onion market,"
00:32:12,00:32:14,"he didn't stop there, so he bought all the onions"
00:32:14,00:32:17,"and then he said to people who wanted to distribute onions,"
00:32:17,00:32:20,you're gonna have to buy them off me for a huge price
00:32:20,00:32:21,'cause I'm the only one with them.
00:32:21,00:32:24,"So they did that, he made shed loads of money there"
00:32:24,00:32:25,"and then he thought, sort it,"
00:32:25,00:32:28,I'm gonna screw these guys over and flood the market anyway.
00:32:28,00:32:32,"So then, stage two, he went to Chicago"
00:32:32,00:32:35,"with all the onions left over in his warehouse,"
00:32:35,00:32:37,"just lorry load after lorry load, dump them,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,it sounds like just on the streets in giant sacks.
00:32:40,00:32:42,"So flooding the market with onions,"
00:32:42,00:32:44,plummeting the onion price down.
00:32:44,00:32:46,"- Must have been like, onion Christmas."
00:32:46,00:32:47,Everyone just walks outside
00:32:47,00:32:48,and there's just onions everywhere.
00:32:48,00:32:51,"- It's quite a shit Christmas actually, I think, isn't it?"
00:32:51,00:32:53,Stocking filled with onions.
00:32:53,00:32:54,"Yeah, the reason he did that"
00:32:54,00:32:57,is 'cause he was betting on onion futures.
00:32:57,00:32:58,"So he knew he was gonna do this,"
00:32:58,00:33:00,so he bet that the price would go down.
00:33:00,00:33:03,"- So he made eight and a half million at the time,"
00:33:03,00:33:04,"money at the time,"
00:33:04,00:33:07,and for the first initial selling back to the farmer.
00:33:07,00:33:09,"So he was kind of quits in anyway, right?"
00:33:09,00:33:11,"- Yeah, if you think about it,"
00:33:11,00:33:14,you've done this brilliant scheme of buying all the onions.
00:33:14,00:33:15,"You've made a ton of money,"
00:33:15,00:33:17,"but then you're left with all these onions, right?"
00:33:17,00:33:18,- What are you gonna do?
00:33:18,00:33:19,"- You need to get rid of the onions somehow,"
00:33:19,00:33:21,but also make money out of them.
00:33:21,00:33:23,"You could sell them at the normal price,"
00:33:23,00:33:24,or you could do this betting
00:33:24,00:33:25,against the price going down thing.
00:33:25,00:33:27,"- The betting thing was very clever, yeah."
00:33:27,00:33:30,- How amazing that he pulled it off just by the way.
00:33:30,00:33:31,This guy went around America
00:33:31,00:33:35,"and managed to successfully collect every single,"
00:33:35,00:33:36,virtually every single onion.
00:33:36,00:33:38,"I mean, he was brought into Congress"
00:33:38,00:33:40,"because the farmers, once this scheme was discovered,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,"and particularly the second bit that you were mentioning, Anna,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,"about how he screwed them over,"
00:33:44,00:33:45,"they said to their congressman,"
00:33:45,00:33:47,"""You can't have someone doing this."""
00:33:47,00:33:48,"This is, we've always said this is gonna be the problem"
00:33:48,00:33:50,with future trading and so on.
00:33:50,00:33:52,"He's monopolized the market, this can't happen."
00:33:52,00:33:53,"So it wasn't illegal though,"
00:33:53,00:33:55,"but he was brought into Congress,"
00:33:55,00:33:56,"and his lawyer said,"
00:33:56,00:33:57,"""Make sure you just don't lie about anything."""
00:33:57,00:34:00,"And they said, ""We understand you own 97%"
00:34:00,00:34:01,"""of the onions in the United States."""
00:34:01,00:34:03,"And he said, ""That's incorrect, 98%."""
00:34:03,00:34:07,Like he was missing 2% of onions in the States.
00:34:07,00:34:08,- So onions are really good.
00:34:08,00:34:09,They keep for a really long time.
00:34:09,00:34:10,"If you keep them dark and dry,"
00:34:10,00:34:12,they keep for months and months and months on end
00:34:12,00:34:13,without going off.
00:34:13,00:34:16,But some of them did start to go off
00:34:16,00:34:17,because he had lots and lots of onions
00:34:17,00:34:19,in the oldies' warehouses.
00:34:19,00:34:21,"And then supposedly,"
00:34:21,00:34:23,"Kasuga, he had the onions reconditioned"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"to clean them up a bit, repackage them."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- Set the few layers off and it'll be like,"
00:34:27,00:34:29,"""Yeah, peel off the mold on the outside."""
00:34:29,00:34:32,- And then they were sent back into all the warehouses
00:34:32,00:34:34,in Chicago where they'd been stored in the first place.
00:34:34,00:34:37,But that was assumed to be even more onions
00:34:37,00:34:37,coming into the city.
00:34:37,00:34:39,We didn't realize those were the same ones as before.
00:34:39,00:34:41,"People were like, ""Oh my God, there are even more onions!"""
00:34:41,00:34:44,And the prices really collapsed then.
00:34:44,00:34:47,"And this onion mess that happened in Chicago,"
00:34:47,00:34:49,it sounds absolutely bananas.
00:34:49,00:34:52,Orphans were receiving free onions in the streets.
00:34:52,00:34:54,The Chicago River was just taking load after load
00:34:54,00:34:56,of onions that were being chucked into it.
00:34:56,00:34:57,- Really?
00:34:57,00:34:58,- Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,- The fish.
00:34:59,00:34:59,- Like breath.
00:34:59,00:35:00,- Just years after.
00:35:00,00:35:01,"- They were like, ""Fence, why are you crying?"
00:35:01,00:35:03,"You've just made millions of dollars."""
00:35:03,00:35:07,- I'm a bit confused about why they were starting
00:35:07,00:35:09,to be handed out to everyone.
00:35:09,00:35:10,The price was nothing.
00:35:10,00:35:11,- But who's handing it out at this point?
00:35:11,00:35:12,Is it Vince?
00:35:12,00:35:13,"- Well, let's say you run an orphanage"
00:35:13,00:35:15,and you want to feed your orphans.
00:35:15,00:35:17,You're going to feed them with the thing
00:35:17,00:35:19,that costs 10p for a million.
00:35:19,00:35:20,"- Got it, okay."
00:35:20,00:35:22,"- Well, it is free in a sack that's been dumped"
00:35:22,00:35:24,"on your, not great fun for the orphans actually,"
00:35:24,00:35:26,"'cause once you've had 17 meals of just onion,"
00:35:26,00:35:27,then it gets old.
00:35:27,00:35:29,- It's very versatile.
00:35:29,00:35:30,- Yeah.
00:35:30,00:35:33,- I think onions are one of those base foods.
00:35:33,00:35:35,- Who was it who said this about British cuisine?
00:35:35,00:35:36,"I think it was Athena, actually,"
00:35:36,00:35:38,"Athena Kaplenu, our friend."
00:35:38,00:35:40,And she said that basically every English dish
00:35:40,00:35:43,"begins with an English person cutting up an onion,"
00:35:43,00:35:45,"putting it in a pan with some oil,"
00:35:45,00:35:48,and then we just decide what to do after that.
00:35:48,00:35:50,"- Yeah, that's very true, yeah."
00:35:50,00:35:51,"- You can't leave it on its own, though, can you?"
00:35:51,00:35:53,"It is very much a base, you know?"
00:35:53,00:35:56,You've got to toss something else in.
00:35:56,00:35:57,- Onions soup.
00:35:57,00:35:58,"- That's, yeah, yeah."
00:35:58,00:35:59,They're the closest.
00:35:59,00:36:00,- Onion soup is probably the closest
00:36:00,00:36:01,to a natural onion.
00:36:01,00:36:03,"- Yeah, and really that's 90% cheese."
00:36:05,00:36:08,"- In 1958, President Eisenhower signed"
00:36:08,00:36:10,the Onion Futures Act that meant
00:36:10,00:36:12,that this could never happen again.
00:36:12,00:36:16,"And it bans anyone from trading in onion futures, basically,"
00:36:16,00:36:18,in the United States.
00:36:18,00:36:21,But the Onion Futures Act also bans people
00:36:21,00:36:26,from betting on the receipts of motion picture box office.
00:36:26,00:36:27,"- Oh, why?"
00:36:27,00:36:30,"- So, according to the Onion Futures Act,"
00:36:30,00:36:32,you're not allowed to trade in onion futures
00:36:32,00:36:34,or motion picture box office receipt futures.
00:36:34,00:36:35,- What the hell?
00:36:35,00:36:39,"- So, onions and minions, they're the two areas."
00:36:39,00:36:41,"- Brilliant, and that was because in 2010,"
00:36:41,00:36:45,the Motion Picture Association of America lobbied
00:36:45,00:36:46,to stop people from being able
00:36:46,00:36:49,to do these futures in motion pictures.
00:36:49,00:36:51,"And rather than doing a new act,"
00:36:51,00:36:54,they just sort of lobbed it on the end of this onion act.
00:36:54,00:36:57,- I'm slightly confused about the aspect
00:36:57,00:36:59,"of motion picture box office receipts,"
00:36:59,00:37:02,"because it's the idea that, I'll make,"
00:37:02,00:37:03,"James Cameron doing this by basically saying,"
00:37:03,00:37:06,"like, I'm gonna buy the rights to all future avatar movies."
00:37:06,00:37:10,"And then he makes five avatar movies, flooding the market."
00:37:10,00:37:11,- That's pretty much what's happened.
00:37:11,00:37:13,- He controls all the avatar movies.
00:37:13,00:37:15,"So, and then there are so many"
00:37:15,00:37:16,that they're being given away for free
00:37:16,00:37:18,to orphans in the streets.
00:37:18,00:37:19,I'm slightly confused about that.
00:37:19,00:37:21,"- Yeah, that's why-- - I thought it might be"
00:37:21,00:37:23,like a producers thing where you buy them up
00:37:23,00:37:26,and then you make a deliberately shit film.
00:37:26,00:37:28,And then it doesn't get any box office receipts
00:37:28,00:37:29,and you bet against them.
00:37:29,00:37:32,- But there were some tax schemes that did that in the UK.
00:37:32,00:37:33,There were tax schemes investing money in.
00:37:33,00:37:36,Is why there was a rash of particularly bad British comedy
00:37:36,00:37:37,"films made? - Well, it was actually"
00:37:37,00:37:39,the way that that worked is that you got tax relief
00:37:39,00:37:42,if you invested in a British movie in the same way
00:37:42,00:37:44,"that if you gave money to charity, you would."
00:37:44,00:37:45,"- Yeah, and that's the avatar thing"
00:37:45,00:37:47,that we talked about with Wayne Rooney.
00:37:47,00:37:49,"- Oh, yes, yeah. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:49,00:37:52,"- Someone that James and I know from back in the day,"
00:37:52,00:37:55,"Gareth Edwards, who made Rogue One, the Star Wars movie."
00:37:55,00:37:58,"But his first movie that he made was called ""Monster."""
00:37:58,00:37:59,- That's a great film.
00:37:59,00:38:00,- It's a great film and that was a tax scheme.
00:38:00,00:38:03,That was the company that needed to offset some money
00:38:03,00:38:06,and that's how he was funded to make that movie.
00:38:06,00:38:07,"- Well, that's the most entertaining tax scheme"
00:38:07,00:38:10,"I've ever seen. - Yeah, it was a brilliant movie."
00:38:10,00:38:12,"- Brilliant movie, yeah, yeah, absolutely brilliant."
00:38:12,00:38:15,"- Nutmeg, what, the Nutmeg monopoly?"
00:38:15,00:38:17,Can we talk about that?
00:38:17,00:38:18,"- Oh, right, sorry."
00:38:18,00:38:20,- I was looking up other historical monopolies
00:38:20,00:38:22,and the Spice Nutmeg was controlled
00:38:22,00:38:25,by the Dutch for-- - Classic.
00:38:25,00:38:26,"- Decades, oh, a long time."
00:38:26,00:38:29,"I think they even, that's the thing they traded"
00:38:29,00:38:30,"Manhattan for, the island of Manhattan."
00:38:30,00:38:32,"They said, ""No, the British had it."""
00:38:32,00:38:34,"And then they said, ""No, we'll have that."""
00:38:34,00:38:35,"Sorry, they had it."
00:38:35,00:38:36,"And then the British said, ""We'd quite like an island."""
00:38:36,00:38:39,"They said, ""Well, we want this random spice island"
00:38:39,00:38:40,"""in the Pacific from you."" - Yeah, yeah."
00:38:40,00:38:42,"Bander Island, was that something?"
00:38:42,00:38:43,"- Exactly, exactly."
00:38:43,00:38:44,The Bander Islands in Indonesia
00:38:44,00:38:47,and the Dutch secured them.
00:38:47,00:38:49,Not actually a bad deal trading Manhattan
00:38:49,00:38:49,for this spice island
00:38:49,00:38:52,because the sheer amount of value they extracted
00:38:52,00:38:56,"by controlling, you know, really fiercely the Nutmeg trade"
00:38:56,00:38:58,"as in, you know, as with all colonial things,"
00:38:58,00:39:01,"they treated the local people appallingly,"
00:39:01,00:39:03,"killing people, importing their own farmers, all of this,"
00:39:03,00:39:06,"like clearing the islands, planting their own trees."
00:39:06,00:39:07,And then they got the monopoly in Nutmeg
00:39:07,00:39:09,"and for about 150 years,"
00:39:09,00:39:11,"they controlled Nutmeg in clothes, pretty much worldwide."
00:39:11,00:39:13,They had almost all the Nutmeg in clothes on the planet.
00:39:13,00:39:15,"Right, it's kind of 98% of it."
00:39:15,00:39:17,"And if you stole a Nutmeg, they'd come after you,"
00:39:17,00:39:18,they'd kill you.
00:39:18,00:39:22,They've ritually burned all their excess Nutmeg every year
00:39:22,00:39:24,in what must have been a lovely smelling.
00:39:24,00:39:26,"- Yeah, nice. - Yeah, so nice."
00:39:26,00:39:27,"- Christmas time, come on."
00:39:27,00:39:28,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:39:28,00:39:32,"And the markup was about 60,000% between source"
00:39:32,00:39:35,and street value of Nutmeg.
00:39:35,00:39:36,"- Nice, that's a good markup."
00:39:36,00:39:37,- A good amount.
00:39:37,00:39:40,"And if you had a small sackful, you were made for life."
00:39:40,00:39:41,- Right. - Basically.
00:39:41,00:39:43,- And this was just the bunch of Dutch people
00:39:43,00:39:44,who got this island basically.
00:39:44,00:39:46,"- Yeah, exactly. - This company, great."
00:39:46,00:39:48,"And this is before everyone knew it was bloody poisonous,"
00:39:48,00:39:50,so you shouldn't owe them anything.
00:39:50,00:39:53,"- Isn't it, I see, I have a distant memory of them also"
00:39:53,00:39:55,"as a result, having a monopoly over a certain type"
00:39:55,00:39:57,of drug as a result of Nutmeg being used.
00:39:57,00:39:59,I wanna say MDMA.
00:39:59,00:40:03,They were basically the providers of MDMA
00:40:03,00:40:04,as a result of this.
00:40:04,00:40:06,"- I think, well, the monopoly was broken"
00:40:06,00:40:09,"in the late 18th century, so I don't know."
00:40:09,00:40:10,"- Yeah, yeah. (laughing)"
00:40:10,00:40:12,"- Yeah, no, you read Jane Austen a certain way."
00:40:12,00:40:13,You can tell they are.
00:40:13,00:40:16,"- That was what caused the French Revolution, actually."
00:40:16,00:40:17,(laughing)
00:40:17,00:40:18,They're all off their tits.
00:40:18,00:40:20,- Wow.
00:40:20,00:40:23,"- Okay, yeah."
00:40:23,00:40:24,"- And the man who broke the monopoly,"
00:40:24,00:40:25,or one of the men who broke the monopoly
00:40:25,00:40:27,"was a Frenchman who called Pierre Poivre,"
00:40:27,00:40:29,whose name pleasantly is Peter Pepper.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"- Peter Pepper, yeah."
00:40:31,00:40:32,- Very nice. - Good on him.
00:40:32,00:40:35,"- And he supposedly, he nicked one of the trees"
00:40:35,00:40:37,out of the way that the Dutch hadn't spotted
00:40:37,00:40:39,"and made off with it, and then seven years later,"
00:40:39,00:40:41,"well, he's broken, got nutmeg everywhere."
00:40:41,00:40:44,- What a shame his name wasn't Pierre Nutmeg.
00:40:44,00:40:48,- There is a theory that Peter Piper picked a pack
00:40:48,00:40:50,of pickled peppers as based on him.
00:40:50,00:40:51,"- Right, I like that."
00:40:51,00:40:52,- I'm not sure it's true.
00:40:52,00:40:54,- But you can see where the theory came from.
00:40:54,00:40:56,(laughing)
00:40:56,00:40:59,- Just this fact is about sort of someone
00:40:59,00:41:02,"controlling a market, they're not being any competition,"
00:41:02,00:41:04,and it just reminded me of one of my favorite things.
00:41:04,00:41:06,And I think I learned this
00:41:06,00:41:08,"listening to a Wondrium course ages ago, actually,"
00:41:08,00:41:11,"but in medieval times, the guilds were really, really strong."
00:41:11,00:41:15,"So if you're trading produce in a town,"
00:41:15,00:41:17,you have to be part of a guild.
00:41:17,00:41:19,"This is in medieval England and France,"
00:41:19,00:41:21,and not by the European countries.
00:41:21,00:41:22,"And if you weren't a member of the guild,"
00:41:22,00:41:24,you would not be allowed to sell.
00:41:24,00:41:28,You're carrot or bracelets or whatever.
00:41:28,00:41:31,And only two things I could think of.
00:41:31,00:41:34,"But yeah, the guilds were so strict,"
00:41:34,00:41:35,so they didn't want any competition
00:41:35,00:41:37,between any of their members.
00:41:37,00:41:38,"You forget that capitalism today,"
00:41:38,00:41:40,"everyone's in competition all the time,"
00:41:40,00:41:41,that was just anathema to them.
00:41:41,00:41:45,So they dictated everything you use to make your produce.
00:41:45,00:41:46,"So if you're making your carrots,"
00:41:46,00:41:48,you have to make them with the tool
00:41:48,00:41:50,"that the guild says you have to make it with,"
00:41:50,00:41:51,using the exact techniques.
00:41:51,00:41:52,You're not allowed to work
00:41:52,00:41:54,more than a certain number of working hours.
00:41:54,00:41:55,They'll monitor you.
00:41:55,00:41:58,"Yeah, everything, machinery, everything."
00:41:58,00:41:59,And then you get to market
00:41:59,00:42:02,and you've done exactly the same as everyone else.
00:42:02,00:42:04,"And you absolutely can't advertise,"
00:42:04,00:42:06,which means you literally can't draw attention
00:42:06,00:42:08,to yourself at all.
00:42:08,00:42:08,- No.
00:42:08,00:42:12,- And there were guilds would forbid things like sneezing
00:42:12,00:42:14,or nodding at passers-by.
00:42:14,00:42:15,'Cause this was thought to be--
00:42:15,00:42:18,- That must have been tough for the pepper guilds.
00:42:18,00:42:20,(laughing)
00:42:21,00:42:23,- That poor man from the itching powder guild
00:42:23,00:42:25,has to stand ramrod still.
00:42:25,00:42:27,(laughing)
00:42:27,00:42:28,- That's amazing.
00:42:28,00:42:29,- Wow.
00:42:29,00:42:31,"- I did not only want to do anything, really."
00:42:31,00:42:34,(upbeat music)
00:42:34,00:42:38,"- Okay, it's time for our final fact of the show,"
00:42:38,00:42:40,and that is James.
00:42:40,00:42:44,"- Okay, my fact this week is that in 1983,"
00:42:44,00:42:47,an autograph hunter wrote to Steve Jobs.
00:42:47,00:42:49,"Jobs replied saying that he didn't sign autographs,"
00:42:49,00:42:53,but he signed that letter and it's sold last year
00:42:53,00:42:54,for half a million dollars.
00:42:54,00:42:55,(laughing)
00:42:55,00:42:56,- That's incredible.
00:42:56,00:42:59,- Did he put the stamp and put it through the post box
00:42:59,00:43:02,"and then go, ""Oh, damn it."""
00:43:02,00:43:03,- I think he was knowing Lee.
00:43:03,00:43:06,"It's written very much as if a gag, I would say."
00:43:06,00:43:07,- You may.
00:43:07,00:43:08,"- You never know, though, you never know."
00:43:08,00:43:09,"- He said, it's written."
00:43:09,00:43:10,"He says, ""I'm honored you were right,"
00:43:10,00:43:13,"but I'm afraid I don't sign autographs."""
00:43:13,00:43:16,And it was sold at R.R. auctions.
00:43:16,00:43:17,That's the letter R.
00:43:17,00:43:19,"I know my accent is a bit weird,"
00:43:19,00:43:20,but R.R. auctions.
00:43:20,00:43:21,"- So pirate auction signs, man."
00:43:21,00:43:24,(laughing)
00:43:24,00:43:27,- And they suggested that perhaps there was a photograph
00:43:27,00:43:30,or magazine enclosed in the original letter
00:43:30,00:43:31,and that he didn't sign that
00:43:31,00:43:33,as opposed to it being a joke.
00:43:33,00:43:35,"But I agree, it does sound kind of like a joke,"
00:43:35,00:43:36,doesn't it?
00:43:36,00:43:37,- It does.
00:43:37,00:43:39,I have an alternate theory about Jobs.
00:43:39,00:43:41,So I was reading a book from 1910
00:43:41,00:43:45,called Chats on Autographs by A.M. Broadley.
00:43:45,00:43:47,Just a little shout out to him.
00:43:47,00:43:49,He'll be really grateful for that.
00:43:49,00:43:51,"- And he relates in this book,"
00:43:51,00:43:53,the story of the Archbishop of York
00:43:53,00:43:55,"who wrote back to an autograph hunter saying,"
00:43:55,00:43:58,"""Sir, I never give my autograph and never will."""
00:43:58,00:43:59,And then signed it.
00:43:59,00:44:03,And maybe it was Steve Jobs doing a little tribute
00:44:03,00:44:04,to that.
00:44:04,00:44:05,(laughing)
00:44:05,00:44:07,- To the Archbishop of York.
00:44:07,00:44:08,"- One of them, yeah, I don't know which one."
00:44:08,00:44:09,- Wow.
00:44:09,00:44:10,"- Yeah, wow."
00:44:10,00:44:12,"- Oh my God, and you're the first person ever to get that."
00:44:12,00:44:14,And he's finally can rest in peace.
00:44:14,00:44:15,- Wow.
00:44:15,00:44:18,- He was a huge fan of the Archbishops of Northern England.
00:44:18,00:44:19,"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:44:19,00:44:22,(laughing)
00:44:22,00:44:23,- I've read a few times
00:44:23,00:44:26,where people have tricked others into giving a signature
00:44:26,00:44:28,in almost the Steve Jobs-S kind of thing.
00:44:28,00:44:32,"So for example, Lee Harvey Oswald's mother,"
00:44:32,00:44:34,one of the ways that she used to make money
00:44:34,00:44:37,after the assassination was that she used to sell
00:44:37,00:44:39,her signature to people.
00:44:39,00:44:41,And got to a point where selling her signature
00:44:41,00:44:44,got her quite a good living if she could do it.
00:44:44,00:44:46,But what people who would interview her would always
00:44:46,00:44:48,"trick her, it would be to get her to sign a release form"
00:44:48,00:44:50,to the interview that they'd filmed or whatever.
00:44:50,00:44:53,And then that's how they would get their signature.
00:44:53,00:44:55,"So yeah, there's all these tricky ways, isn't there,"
00:44:55,00:44:58,of getting a celebrity signature if they don't give it.
00:44:58,00:45:00,"'Cause if you don't, we've mentioned Steve Martin."
00:45:00,00:45:01,He has a card that he hands.
00:45:01,00:45:03,Jonah Hill does the same thing.
00:45:03,00:45:04,"Instead of signing, if you approach Jonah Hill,"
00:45:04,00:45:06,"he just hands a card saying, ""I just met Jonah Hill."""
00:45:06,00:45:08,It was a total let down.
00:45:08,00:45:10,And that's just on his little business card.
00:45:10,00:45:13,"- There's a famous story of Dennis Lilly,"
00:45:13,00:45:16,"the Australian fast bowler, Cricketer,"
00:45:16,00:45:20,who met the queen and asked for her autograph.
00:45:20,00:45:21,So she was in Melbourne watching some test cricket
00:45:21,00:45:23,"and then he sort of queued up and said,"
00:45:23,00:45:24,"""Can I get your autograph, mate?"""
00:45:24,00:45:25,And there's actually a photo of him.
00:45:25,00:45:27,(laughing)
00:45:27,00:45:29,- That's pronounced ma'am.
00:45:29,00:45:31,(laughing)
00:45:31,00:45:33,"- Well, in fact, that the first time he met her was earlier"
00:45:33,00:45:35,"and I think he said, ""G'day, how are you going?"""
00:45:35,00:45:37,And then chucked out his hand for a handshake.
00:45:37,00:45:39,So he had form with the queen.
00:45:39,00:45:43,"- Yeah, what's Prince Harry's child called?"
00:45:43,00:45:45,- Archie or Lilibet?
00:45:45,00:45:47,"- Lilibet, it's actually named after Dennis Lilly."
00:45:47,00:45:49,(laughing)
00:45:49,00:45:50,- Made such an impression.
00:45:50,00:45:51,"Well, he obviously did,"
00:45:51,00:45:53,"'cause he said, ""Can I have your autograph?"""
00:45:53,00:45:54,"Someone took a photo, actually, of him"
00:45:54,00:45:56,holding out a notebook and pen
00:45:56,00:45:58,"and her looking a bit like,"
00:45:58,00:45:59,"""Probably not gonna do that."""
00:45:59,00:46:01,"And she said, ""No, I'm sorry, it's against protocol."""
00:46:01,00:46:03,"But then a few weeks later,"
00:46:03,00:46:06,he received in the post a photograph of that moment
00:46:06,00:46:09,when he asked for her autograph signed by the queen.
00:46:09,00:46:12,"- No way! - Oh, yeah."
00:46:12,00:46:15,"- On people who refuse autographs,"
00:46:15,00:46:17,"friend of the podcast, George Elliott,"
00:46:17,00:46:19,"she instructed her boyfriend, Henry Lewis,"
00:46:19,00:46:21,to write point blank refusals to anyone who--
00:46:21,00:46:22,"- Well, she would have to get a massive crayon"
00:46:22,00:46:25,'cause she would have a huge hand in the room.
00:46:25,00:46:26,"- There's novelty pencils, yeah."
00:46:26,00:46:28,(laughing)
00:46:28,00:46:30,"Why, why did she refuse?"
00:46:30,00:46:31,- She's busy.
00:46:31,00:46:33,"- A little more confused, sorry."
00:46:33,00:46:34,"- Also, she was quite confused about what her name was,"
00:46:34,00:46:35,wasn't she?
00:46:35,00:46:36,"I'm at George, I'm at Marianne Evans."
00:46:36,00:46:39,Have I got in another suit on him now?
00:46:39,00:46:39,- Yeah.
00:46:39,00:46:41,"- Can I tell you, someone who collected autographs?"
00:46:41,00:46:43,- Sure. - Queen Victoria.
00:46:43,00:46:44,"- Oh, yeah. - Really?"
00:46:44,00:46:45,- Yeah.
00:46:45,00:46:46,She had this cool thing.
00:46:46,00:46:46,I'd never heard of it before.
00:46:46,00:46:48,It was called an autograph fan.
00:46:48,00:46:49,"And it's literally a fan,"
00:46:49,00:46:51,"and every separate blade of the fan,"
00:46:51,00:46:53,you write a different person's signature on it.
00:46:53,00:46:54,"- Oh, they write it."
00:46:54,00:46:56,(laughing)
00:46:56,00:46:58,"- Even better, they write it on it."
00:46:58,00:46:59,- She was a great forger.
00:46:59,00:47:01,"- But I just love the idea of Queen Victoria saying,"
00:47:01,00:47:03,"""Can I have your autograph to someone?"""
00:47:03,00:47:04,- Yeah. - Yeah.
00:47:04,00:47:07,- It was mostly her children and prime ministers
00:47:07,00:47:08,"and things like that. - Okay, okay."
00:47:08,00:47:09,- That's pretty cool.
00:47:09,00:47:10,Do we have the fans?
00:47:10,00:47:11,"Are they in? - Yeah, we just, wow."
00:47:11,00:47:12,- I'd love to see those.
00:47:12,00:47:14,- Is that why they're called fans?
00:47:14,00:47:15,People who ask for autographs?
00:47:15,00:47:16,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:16,00:47:18,"It's a good legit question, I think."
00:47:18,00:47:20,"- No, I knew it was not."
00:47:20,00:47:22,"- I know, but why are they called fans?"
00:47:22,00:47:23,- Fanatical.
00:47:23,00:47:24,"- Oh, yeah."
00:47:24,00:47:25,- Or.
00:47:25,00:47:28,(laughing)
00:47:28,00:47:30,- One of the most expensive autographs
00:47:30,00:47:33,you can get is a Button Gwinnett.
00:47:33,00:47:34,- Button Gwinnett.
00:47:34,00:47:36,"- If you ever have an autograph of Button Gwinnett,"
00:47:36,00:47:39,it will cost at least $1 million.
00:47:39,00:47:42,- Button Gwinnett. - At least.
00:47:42,00:47:43,- Button Gwinnett.
00:47:43,00:47:47,Button as in the things that you fasten your clothes with
00:47:47,00:47:49,and Gwinnett exactly how you would expect to spell it.
00:47:49,00:47:50,- Can we guess?
00:47:50,00:47:51,You're leaving us hanging as if maybe
00:47:51,00:47:52,we could guess who this person is.
00:47:52,00:47:54,"- So it's obvious, I reckon it's a,"
00:47:54,00:47:56,"oh no, it won't be a forger, would it?"
00:47:56,00:47:58,This is the most expensive signature.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"- It's not the most expensive,"
00:47:59,00:48:02,but it will cost you at least a million dollars to get it.
00:48:02,00:48:03,- I think I know it.
00:48:03,00:48:04,"- Ooh, go on."
00:48:04,00:48:05,- Is it Declaration of Independence?
00:48:05,00:48:06,- It is Declaration of Independence
00:48:06,00:48:09,"and most people have,"
00:48:09,00:48:12,or a lot of people who collect autographs of people
00:48:12,00:48:14,who sign the Declaration of Independence
00:48:14,00:48:17,"will have 55 of the 56,"
00:48:17,00:48:20,but Button Gwinnett is extremely rare.
00:48:20,00:48:23,He died quite soon afterwards in a duel.
00:48:23,00:48:26,Someone called him a scoundrel and a lying rascal
00:48:26,00:48:27,and he got in a duel and died.
00:48:27,00:48:30,And so there's like maybe a dozen
00:48:30,00:48:32,or half a dozen of his signatures out there.
00:48:32,00:48:34,"And if you want the full set,"
00:48:34,00:48:36,you're going to have to cuff up at least a million dollars
00:48:36,00:48:37,for it.
00:48:37,00:48:38,- It's like the rarest football sticker.
00:48:38,00:48:39,- Yeah.
00:48:39,00:48:40,- They've put it in six packs.
00:48:40,00:48:42,"- It's amazing because he's like the least famous,"
00:48:42,00:48:44,"one of the least famous ones, right?"
00:48:44,00:48:45,- Yeah.
00:48:45,00:48:46,- But he's still.
00:48:46,00:48:47,- By a long way.
00:48:47,00:48:47,"- Although I was, well,"
00:48:47,00:48:49,I was skimming the Declaration of Independence
00:48:49,00:48:50,and you haven't heard of most of them.
00:48:50,00:48:51,Trust me.
00:48:51,00:48:52,- Skimming.
00:48:52,00:48:53,- Why were you?
00:48:53,00:48:53,- I happen to be skimming.
00:48:53,00:48:54,I was actually.
00:48:54,00:48:55,(laughing)
00:48:55,00:48:56,I would just like to remind myself
00:48:56,00:48:58,of the principles of which the country is based.
00:48:58,00:48:59,- Everyone else on the buses on their phone.
00:48:59,00:49:01,Anna's on her scroll.
00:49:01,00:49:02,(laughing)
00:49:02,00:49:05,- I think if you're ever on Pointless Listener
00:49:05,00:49:06,"and it comes up,"
00:49:06,00:49:08,"name someone from the Declaration of Independence,"
00:49:08,00:49:09,but Gwyneth has got to be.
00:49:09,00:49:10,- Oh yes.
00:49:10,00:49:11,- This is a good one.
00:49:11,00:49:14,I reckon most people couldn't get me on the first six or seven.
00:49:14,00:49:15,"But anyway, the reason I was skimming it"
00:49:15,00:49:17,was because I was wondering about.
00:49:17,00:49:20,"- That's right, get me on George Washington."
00:49:20,00:49:21,John Hancock.
00:49:21,00:49:23,"- Yeah, just name the first few presidents."
00:49:23,00:49:25,"- Ben Franklin, though, was he one as well?"
00:49:25,00:49:26,"- Was Gouverneur Morris,"
00:49:26,00:49:27,who died with a whale bone off his penis.
00:49:27,00:49:28,"- Yeah, he was."
00:49:28,00:49:29,- I think he was.
00:49:29,00:49:30,- He was on there.
00:49:30,00:49:31,- Poor guy.
00:49:31,00:49:33,- We've got that extra sentence there.
00:49:33,00:49:34,- We broke it.
00:49:34,00:49:37,"- We just said Ben Franklin, John Adams."
00:49:37,00:49:38,"Gouverneur Morris, the guy had the whale bone"
00:49:38,00:49:39,off his penis and died.
00:49:39,00:49:41,(laughing)
00:49:41,00:49:45,- The English getting this Declaration of Independence
00:49:45,00:49:47,"and reading it, going, it's the guy."
00:49:47,00:49:49,(laughing)
00:49:49,00:49:51,- It's actually part of the signature.
00:49:51,00:49:52,They've just added it on afterwards.
00:49:52,00:49:54,For anyone doubting who this is.
00:49:54,00:49:56,- John Hancock.
00:49:56,00:49:57,"This is why I was browsing it for this,"
00:49:57,00:49:58,"'cause I was thinking about,"
00:49:58,00:49:59,I wonder what interesting stuff it is
00:49:59,00:50:00,about the John Hancock.
00:50:00,00:50:01,- Oh yeah.
00:50:01,00:50:03,"- The signature, you know, by word for a signature,"
00:50:03,00:50:04,'cause he was the first person to sign it.
00:50:04,00:50:06,- Yeah.
00:50:06,00:50:06,"- And there's not much,"
00:50:06,00:50:09,but I hadn't really looked at the signatures there before.
00:50:09,00:50:10,"And it's really like, you know,"
00:50:10,00:50:12,if you sign someone's birthday card at work
00:50:12,00:50:15,and someone writes their own name incredibly big.
00:50:15,00:50:18,"And it's like, did you not know the rest of us"
00:50:18,00:50:19,were gonna have to sign this?
00:50:19,00:50:20,(laughing)
00:50:20,00:50:23,Way more than twice the size of the second biggest.
00:50:23,00:50:25,"- John Adams has just written, get well soon."
00:50:25,00:50:26,- Yeah.
00:50:26,00:50:27,(laughing)
00:50:27,00:50:27,- See you later.
00:50:27,00:50:28,We're just lovely working with you.
00:50:28,00:50:30,(laughing)
00:50:30,00:50:32,- There's just sport signatures.
00:50:32,00:50:33,- Yeah.
00:50:33,00:50:35,"- There's Luka Dončić, who's a basketball player."
00:50:35,00:50:36,- Genius.
00:50:36,00:50:37,- He's a big deal.
00:50:37,00:50:38,- Yeah.
00:50:38,00:50:39,- He's a genius.
00:50:39,00:50:40,- Mavericks.
00:50:40,00:50:41,- And he's signatures been making the news lately
00:50:41,00:50:44,because it broke a record for the most ever paid
00:50:44,00:50:46,for a basketball card at public auction.
00:50:46,00:50:47,"- Okay, wow."
00:50:47,00:50:50,"- Get these specific cards called logoman cards,"
00:50:50,00:50:52,"or logoman cards, the thing in the basketball world"
00:50:52,00:50:55,where you have your NBA logo on this card
00:50:55,00:50:56,from your jersey.
00:50:56,00:50:58,- Feels like it'll be logoman then.
00:50:58,00:51:01,"- It does, and yeah, some people say logo."
00:51:01,00:51:02,So you got your NBA logo.
00:51:02,00:51:04,(laughing)
00:51:04,00:51:06,Or your NBA logo.
00:51:06,00:51:07,- Yeah.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"- It just depends where you come from, doesn't it?"
00:51:09,00:51:09,"- It does, doesn't it?"
00:51:09,00:51:10,- Yeah.
00:51:10,00:51:11,- Anyway.
00:51:11,00:51:12,(laughing)
00:51:12,00:51:14,- Are you gonna ask us to guess?
00:51:14,00:51:14,"- Yes, okay, fine."
00:51:14,00:51:16,"Well, that wasn't gonna be part of it, but sure."
00:51:16,00:51:19,So that's sold at most ever paid public auction
00:51:19,00:51:20,for basketball card.
00:51:20,00:51:21,How much do you think for?
00:51:21,00:51:22,November 22.
00:51:22,00:51:24,- $75 if it does.
00:51:24,00:51:25,(laughing)
00:51:25,00:51:28,"- Well, Steve Jobs, half a mill."
00:51:28,00:51:31,"Button Gwinnett, over one million."
00:51:31,00:51:33,I'm gonna say it would be somewhere in between the two.
00:51:33,00:51:36,"I'll go for $700,000."
00:51:36,00:51:37,"- Oh, I like that you've done that."
00:51:37,00:51:39,"You've undershot it, and it's very generous of you."
00:51:39,00:51:43,So it went for 3.12 million and actually sold in private
00:51:43,00:51:46,"the year before for 4.6 million,"
00:51:46,00:51:48,which doesn't apply to the person who's lost.
00:51:48,00:51:51,- So someone just lost a huge loss in a year as well.
00:51:51,00:51:52,(laughing)
00:51:52,00:51:55,- What makes you think you've got this card
00:51:55,00:51:56,that you've paid $4 million for?
00:51:56,00:51:57,"And a year later you're like,"
00:51:57,00:51:59,"you know what, I'm gonna sell it for 3 million."
00:51:59,00:52:00,What goes through your head?
00:52:00,00:52:03,- They must have come up on really hard time.
00:52:03,00:52:05,- I think what it was is it was initially bought
00:52:05,00:52:08,"by Vince Kosuga, and then he sold it,"
00:52:08,00:52:09,but then flooded the market
00:52:09,00:52:11,with all his other Luka signature.
00:52:11,00:52:13,- The orphans of Chicago were receiving
00:52:13,00:52:16,so many of these bloody basketball cards.
00:52:16,00:52:19,"- Anyway, the thing I really like about this,"
00:52:19,00:52:21,"which makes me wanna laugh at the fate of whoever bought it,"
00:52:21,00:52:24,"is that his signatures keeps changing,"
00:52:24,00:52:25,"and it's changed a lot since his teens,"
00:52:25,00:52:26,and there's a lot of chat
00:52:26,00:52:28,that actually it's not his signature.
00:52:28,00:52:30,- He said his hand replaced.
00:52:30,00:52:31,(laughing)
00:52:31,00:52:32,- Is that it?
00:52:32,00:52:33,- You're so close.
00:52:33,00:52:37,"- Oh, the basketball has crippled his fingers over the years,"
00:52:37,00:52:38,and it's changed the way he writes his name.
00:52:38,00:52:40,Someone's just forged it.
00:52:40,00:52:41,- That's the claim.
00:52:41,00:52:42,- He's died and been replaced by another.
00:52:42,00:52:43,Someone's just forged it.
00:52:43,00:52:45,"- Okay, I think James has just said the, yeah."
00:52:45,00:52:47,"- Keep going, Andy, keep going."
00:52:47,00:52:48,"- People think he's got the Luka signature,"
00:52:48,00:52:50,"which is his old one, and the Lula one,"
00:52:50,00:52:52,"which is his new one, because it's more feminine."
00:52:52,00:52:54,Since he became president of Brazil.
00:52:54,00:52:57,- He's like he's been replaced by the president.
00:52:57,00:52:59,- That's the conspiracy theory.
00:52:59,00:53:00,"- Wow, I love it."
00:53:00,00:53:01,"- And as Dan says, he's a genius,"
00:53:01,00:53:04,so I think he's gonna do a pretty good job.
00:53:04,00:53:06,"Sorry, it's actually called the Lula one."
00:53:06,00:53:08,- Since he was replaced by the 80s singer.
00:53:08,00:53:11,(laughing)
00:53:11,00:53:13,"- There's been a body swap comedy somewhere,"
00:53:13,00:53:16,"and anyway, it's thought that it's his mother's signature."
00:53:16,00:53:18,"- Oh, interesting. - Oh, really?"
00:53:18,00:53:19,"- Someone else did that,"
00:53:19,00:53:21,"and in fact, we were talking about presidential signatures,"
00:53:21,00:53:24,"from Ronald Reagan, but when he was an actor,"
00:53:24,00:53:26,"not when he was president, he got his mum."
00:53:26,00:53:29,"I think he paid his mum, or he asked the studio"
00:53:29,00:53:31,"to pay for his mum to sign all of his fan mail,"
00:53:31,00:53:33,and it's now believed that pretty much everything he wrote
00:53:33,00:53:35,from the late 1930s to the late 1950s is suspect.
00:53:35,00:53:37,You can't trust any signature from that time.
00:53:37,00:53:38,(laughing)
00:53:38,00:53:40,Even his Christmas card was probably
00:53:40,00:53:42,him getting his mum to do it all.
00:53:42,00:53:44,"- You know, the whole Berlin Wall thing and everything."
00:53:44,00:53:46,"That was actually his mum. - It was all his mum, yeah."
00:53:46,00:53:47,- I'm so glad you clarified it.
00:53:47,00:53:49,"I thought what you meant, Anna,"
00:53:49,00:53:51,"was not that his mum had written the fake signature,"
00:53:51,00:53:54,but that he'd changed his signature to his mum's signature.
00:53:54,00:53:55,(laughing)
00:53:55,00:53:57,"- Well, that's because when he was at school,"
00:53:57,00:53:59,they sent the letter back saying
00:53:59,00:54:00,that he'd come to his homework.
00:54:00,00:54:01,He used to practice his mum's signature.
00:54:01,00:54:03,"- Yeah, he knew it inside out, yeah."
00:54:03,00:54:06,I'm in the category of autograph collector.
00:54:06,00:54:07,- Yeah. - To a certain degree.
00:54:07,00:54:09,"- Yeah, I like the occasional."
00:54:09,00:54:10,"Yeah, if I could find one,"
00:54:10,00:54:13,and I brought in a few of my favorite
00:54:13,00:54:14,from my collection just to show you.
00:54:14,00:54:19,"- So, first off, I've just, you guys can't see"
00:54:19,00:54:21,"when I can see the dance bank from where I'm sitting,"
00:54:21,00:54:22,and I know the story behind this one.
00:54:22,00:54:26,- So the first thing I have is a signed Beatles drumstick
00:54:26,00:54:27,from the drummer of the Beatles.
00:54:27,00:54:29,"- Okay. - Yeah, Pete Best,"
00:54:29,00:54:31,who was the original.
00:54:31,00:54:34,"- Oh, you got the Pete Best, that's so cool."
00:54:34,00:54:36,"- Yeah, so I don't remember buying this."
00:54:36,00:54:40,"I woke up one day, and in the post came it,"
00:54:40,00:54:42,"and it turns out I was drunk in a car,"
00:54:42,00:54:45,"and on the way home, I bought a Pete Best."
00:54:45,00:54:47,- You got to stop doing that with the driving home.
00:54:47,00:54:49,Don't drink and drive and ebay.
00:54:49,00:54:50,(laughing)
00:54:50,00:54:51,- So that's the first thing.
00:54:51,00:54:53,So drummers love to sign a stick.
00:54:53,00:54:56,"I like when signatures are appropriate to an item, you know?"
00:54:56,00:54:58,"This I found in a secondhand bookshop,"
00:54:58,00:55:00,"and I know I've shown you guys this before,"
00:55:00,00:55:01,"but for the listener,"
00:55:01,00:55:03,what it is is a signed Stephen Hawking book.
00:55:03,00:55:06,"Now, how would Stephen Hawking do his signature?"
00:55:06,00:55:10,"- Kiss, I was thinking, like put lipstick on him"
00:55:10,00:55:10,and kiss the book.
00:55:10,00:55:11,- It's kind of close.
00:55:11,00:55:13,- It's not too far away.
00:55:13,00:55:16,What they used to do was is his assistant
00:55:16,00:55:19,would dip his thumb into some ink.
00:55:19,00:55:23,"So I have the thumbprint of Stephen Hawking,"
00:55:23,00:55:24,and it says thumbprint of Stephen Hawking
00:55:24,00:55:26,"witnessed by Susan Maisie,"
00:55:26,00:55:29,who must have been his assistant or a nurse at the time.
00:55:29,00:55:31,"- It says, ""I never give my thumbprint out,"
00:55:31,00:55:33,"""and I will not be doing so on this occasion."""
00:55:33,00:55:36,(laughing)
00:55:36,00:55:38,So that's quite cool.
00:55:38,00:55:41,I found that for five quid in a secondhand bookshop.
00:55:41,00:55:43,"- Here's the last one, which is interesting."
00:55:43,00:55:45,This is a baseball.
00:55:45,00:55:45,"- Oh, yeah."
00:55:45,00:55:48,- Baseball signed by a Hall of Famer called Gaylord Perry.
00:55:48,00:55:49,"- Oh, Gaylord Perry, yeah."
00:55:49,00:55:51,"- Yeah, who is someone I'm fascinated with,"
00:55:51,00:55:53,but we won't go into it now.
00:55:53,00:55:55,But what's interesting about this
00:55:55,00:55:58,is you can get baseballs that are worth more
00:55:58,00:56:00,if they're signed in certain ways.
00:56:00,00:56:02,So this is worth more than most baseballs
00:56:02,00:56:04,would be if he'd signed it differently.
00:56:04,00:56:07,So can you guess why this is worth more
00:56:07,00:56:08,signed by Gaylord Perry?
00:56:08,00:56:09,- He spelled his name wrong?
00:56:09,00:56:11,"- No, no, correct spelling."
00:56:11,00:56:13,"- So he signed it, there are two seams,"
00:56:13,00:56:14,"or the rather is one seam,"
00:56:14,00:56:15,isn't there that goes all the way around?
00:56:15,00:56:18,And he signed it in the nice bow beautifully
00:56:18,00:56:19,between the point where the two seams
00:56:19,00:56:20,are closer to each other.
00:56:20,00:56:22,"- So that's the first thing, that's absolutely right."
00:56:22,00:56:25,So this is what's known as the sweet spot of a baseball.
00:56:25,00:56:27,You can get a long signature right across
00:56:27,00:56:28,without having to break it up.
00:56:28,00:56:29,Nothing gets in the way.
00:56:29,00:56:33,"The other thing is that it's a official ball American League,"
00:56:33,00:56:38,"which is not the NLB, right?"
00:56:38,00:56:39,So this would be worth less
00:56:39,00:56:41,because it's an official Major League baseball.
00:56:41,00:56:42,So that shoots it down.
00:56:42,00:56:47,"It has his details, Hall of Famer, 91 on it."
00:56:47,00:56:49,"So if anyone's a world champion,"
00:56:49,00:56:50,"a world series champion or whatever,"
00:56:50,00:56:53,"if they add the detail, that's gonna make it more."
00:56:53,00:56:53,And then the last thing--
00:56:53,00:56:56,"- How many, like if you put your name, address, phone number,"
00:56:56,00:57:00,"Twitter handle, it gets better and better."
00:57:00,00:57:01,- So there's one more thing
00:57:01,00:57:02,it's specifically to do with the signature
00:57:02,00:57:03,that makes this worth more
00:57:03,00:57:06,than a different baseball signature.
00:57:06,00:57:07,- Is it 'cause it's blue?
00:57:07,00:57:09,"- Absolutely, it's blue ink."
00:57:09,00:57:10,- It looks nicer with the red scene.
00:57:10,00:57:12,- It will also stay on longer than black.
00:57:12,00:57:14,Black will rub off according to the experts
00:57:14,00:57:16,who auction baseballs off.
00:57:16,00:57:20,- I have assigned American football by Colin Kaepernick.
00:57:20,00:57:21,- Oh yeah.
00:57:21,00:57:23,- Which I got when he was an American footballer
00:57:23,00:57:26,"and now he's a civil rights guy, right?"
00:57:26,00:57:29,But it's signed in like silver writing.
00:57:29,00:57:31,"And to be honest, I'm not sure it'll last"
00:57:31,00:57:34,"for another 10 years, I think it'll all rub off."
00:57:34,00:57:35,- Yeah.
00:57:35,00:57:36,"- Still, it's so nice to get a signature"
00:57:36,00:57:38,where you can say I got it when he was American football
00:57:38,00:57:39,and now he's a civil rights guy
00:57:39,00:57:41,rather than now he's a pedophile
00:57:41,00:57:44,or now he's in prison for massive tax fraud.
00:57:44,00:57:45,(laughing)
00:57:45,00:57:48,(upbeat music)
00:57:48,00:57:50,"- Okay, that's it."
00:57:50,00:57:51,That is all of our facts.
