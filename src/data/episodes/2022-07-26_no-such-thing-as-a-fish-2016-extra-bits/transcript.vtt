00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 Hi everyone, James here. This week's podcast is a compilation.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.040
 It's all the little bits from the last year of Fish,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.840
 which didn't quite fit in a show,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.280
 but they're kind of self-contained little nuggets,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 and we put them all together for a little best-off show.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.560
 I really hope you enjoy it.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.760
 We'll be back next week with a normal show,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.600
 but in the meantime, happy new year.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.360
 [CHEERS]

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.040
 Do you know what it would or what would it be?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.240
 [CHEERS]

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.560
 Do you know what it would be?

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.760
 [CHEERS]

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.560
 Something that these do that people think is impossible is fly.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.000
 And so it's constantly claimed that they defy the laws of physics,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 and it's because an entomologist in 1934 wrote a book in which he said,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.200
 "I have applied to insects, the laws of air resistance,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.120
 and I've arrived at the conclusion that their flight is impossible."

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.440
 And it's not impossible, obviously,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.440
 but the way they do fly is not by flapping their wings up and down,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.560
 it's by flapping them back and forth.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.280
 So they go from front to back,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 and it's kind of like the motion of rowing, I think.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
 So imagine if you put your hands out and your palm faces the ground,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.840
 and then you move your arms forward with your palm facing the ground,

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.200
 and then when you get your arm in front of you,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.720
 you flip your hand over so your palms facing upwards,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.680
 and you move your arm back, and then they fly with that motion.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.720
 So they're doing backstroke?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.680
 Is that you must do a really weird backstroke, Dan?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.240
 It's a bit more like the butterfly.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.760
 Yeah.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.240
 Yes, it is more like the butterfly.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 But it's not.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 Oh, OK.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.920
 And that creates kind of vortexes which reduces pressure above their wings

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 and means they can fly, but isn't that cool?

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.320
 That's very cool.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 They float like a butterfly.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760
 And stick like a bee.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.080
 So was it just a bee?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.920
 How would I leave?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.720
 Yeah.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.440
 I was actually thinking about this phrase yesterday,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.920
 because I saw a really good play about him.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.440
 But butterflies don't really float.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.760
 I mean, they fly, right?

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.360
 They don't just sit motionless in the air with their wings hanging.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.720
 I just think it was a bit of a fraud statement.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.680
 But I think really it was more--

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560
 it was like a poem, wasn't it, really?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.120
 It was just a thing that he said, and it scam nicely.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.200
 And yeah.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 I just-- it wasn't really biologically accurate enough.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.720
 You want to be what float like a log?

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.760
 Like a log thing?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 And I could be-- it would be much like a boxer, yeah.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.640
 Imagine if a hoverdolly had a few pedantic friends like you

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.680
 and you know, when he was like, I've got this new line.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.280
 I'm not sure.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 Can we go for the log one?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.760
 I'm going to do the butterfly.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.360
 OK.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.760
 On your head, bit, now.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.800
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.000
 Early weather forecastes would steam on wet days,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.800
 on television.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.680
 What do you mean steam their maps?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.600
 No, their clothes would steam, gently.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.200
 Yeah.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.160
 I saw that, but I didn't understand why.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.360
 Was it the heat of the--

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.520
 No, it was the heat of the lights, because they

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 had been outdoors before.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.880
 Oh, they weren't like, it's going to be foggy tomorrow.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.440
 Just credit to give it a bit of atmosphere.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.520
 No, they would-- no, it was just on the hot lights

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.840
 in the BBC studios.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.520
 But I didn't know this either.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.280
 The Met Office is, or until recently,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.480
 was, part of the Ministry of Defense,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.440
 as a sort of affiliated body.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.040
 And so in the early days of weather forecast on the TV,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.600
 the weather charts were drawn up at what

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.320
 was called the air ministry.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.720
 And then they were rolled up, and they

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.200
 were put in a taxi to the BBC.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.480
 So you could have lost the weather, if you tried.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.760
 That's good.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.120
 I like this from George Cowling, who

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.760
 was the BBC's first weather forecaster, who

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.560
 said that there were a few breakthrough moments where he

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.520
 realized he was really nailing it, because weather forecaster

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.840
 were really, really boring before the '50s,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.960
 when he sort of transformed them.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.000
 And he said, there was one time, quite early,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240
 into weather forecasting, where he predicted the weather.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.600
 And he said, rain would reach north Wales

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.560
 in the northwest coast of England around lunchtime,

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.520
 the following day.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.880
 And he got a telegram from a viewer the next day saying,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.600
 well done, rain arrive Liverpool, one o'clock.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.720
 Slam dunk, mate.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.960
 Absolutely nailed that one.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.560
 There's a company called Celeb for a day, which

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.480
 offers on-demon paparazzi services

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.240
 that you pay up to one and a half grand.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.760
 And they'll just have a team of photographers

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.640
 wait outside, whichever venue you're going to that night,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.480
 and pretend that you're famous and shout out our questions

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.000
 for you.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 Oh, do that.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.480
 That's not weird.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.560
 I was at a minor ward so many once, and left,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.240
 as the paparazzi were there.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.160
 And you could kind of hear them all for about a millisecond,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.880
 start snapping their things, and then

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.000
 realise that I wasn't someone famous,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.760
 and it was like an audible--

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.720
 Scrooing back of lens caps, I think.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.280
 When Daniel Acliffe was performing in a play in the West End,

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.640
 he wore the same outfit as he left the theatre every night

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.160
 six months.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.080
 So the paparazzi's photos weren't worth anything,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600
 so they looked like they were the same.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.440
 I thought it was quite clever.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.560
 Oh, that's quite clever, yeah.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.560
 But they could report on how bad he was smelling.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.280
 More in the flies every night.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.680
 So a study was done this year that found

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.560
 that in 20% of scientific papers on genetics,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.680
 there are mistakes because Excel reformats gene names

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.760
 into dates.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.000
 Oh, my god.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.200
 That's great.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.040
 It's one-fifth of papers, and that's

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.560
 because genes have names like M-A-R-1, or D-E-C-1, or O-C-T-4.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.200
 So they all look to Excel like a date.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.360
 And so in one-fifth of papers, this is a mistake.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.800
 And also, you know that thing in Excel,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.200
 where if you try to undo it once it's reformatted it to a date,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.920
 it then corrects to how it stores dates internally.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.040
 So for instance, if you are dealing with gene, which

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.120
 is M-A-R-C-H-1, March 1, which is membrane-associated ring

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.440
 finger, C-3-H-C-4-1, as you all knew.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.960
 That's it.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
 It's a classic gene.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.920
 It is, it really is.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.520
 Excel reformats it to make it first of March.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.920
 And then if you hit undo, it then makes it 42430,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.240
 because that's how it stores the first of March in a state of Bay.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.520
 So all these poor geneticists are going,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.640
 no, it's a bloody gene.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.040
 And Excel's going, no, I think you mean the fifth of May.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.760
 One recent experiment I saw done with mice

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.800
 is they gave it a molecule called I-S-R-I-B,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.720
 and it makes them smarter.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.160
 And they reckon this might be a molecule

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.040
 you can give to humans to make them smarter.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.960
 OK, how can they tell that it makes them smarter?

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.800
 Because I've seen bitching in the scientific community

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.000
 about the fact that mice are the idiots of the rodent world

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.760
 to the genius of rats.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.120
 So are they trying to make them compete with rats?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.240
 In what way are they smarter?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.160
 In quiz.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.440
 In quiz environment.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.360
 No, it's the basic way of seeing how smarter

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.120
 mouse is by putting an underwater platform in a pool of water

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.320
 and then putting the mouse in and seeing how long it takes

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.920
 into finding the platform.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.720
 I see.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.240
 But that sounds very like testing for witches.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.480
 Yeah.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.800
 But then when it gets to the platform,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.880
 you do burn it as a witch.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.680
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.120
 There's a massive list of hundreds and hundreds of foods

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.600
 on Wikipedia that are named after people.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.280
 There's only two that really caught my eye.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.600
 One is that Van Gogh has a potato named after him.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.600
 Wow.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.680
 But also, Jesus has only one food.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.200
 Really?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.960
 And only one.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.360
 And we learned that Donald Trump has two named after him

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.400
 in his Thanksgiving dinner that he had last month.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.520
 Two of the dishes served were named after him.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.200
 Yeah.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.320
 It was a chocolate cake, wasn't it?

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.360
 Chocolate cake and a salad.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.860
 Yeah.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.040
 So he had the Trump salad and the massive racist chocolate

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.040
 cake.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.320
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.480
 Have you guys been about this guy, Claude Ruggeri?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.960
 No.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.440
 So Claude Ruggeri was an Italian who was living in Paris in 1806.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.640
 And according to Marshall Space Flight Center,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.600
 he used to send animals into space on balloons.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.560
 I think-- oh, no.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.160
 So he sent animals onto space in his own homemade rockets.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.960
 And then they were recovered by a parachute.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.160
 I don't know where they were when they were recovered.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.700
 They were really healthy, actually.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.880
 Apparently, French authorities halted

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.400
 Ruggeri's plans when they came to suggest

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.320
 launching a small boy using a rocket cluster.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.920
 You do see occasional stories of someone

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.640
 who's tied a lot of balloons to a chair and flies up.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.920
 You've washed up by picks up.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.000
 No, no, no, is that true?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.640
 Yeah, no, you see people trying it.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.200
 And then they shoot a balloon to bring themselves down again.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.360
 It's not inconceivable that he would have done that

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.840
 and assumed because he never saw them again.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.520
 They must have kept going out.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.040
 I mean, how long till the first person, who

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.520
 was just a normal person, worked out

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.560
 that when they let a balloon off into the air,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.840
 that it did pop and come back down,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.360
 you would just assume that I would assume.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.560
 It would just keep going.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.920
 They didn't really have balloons for quite a long time.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920
 No, that's true.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.420
 Yeah.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.000
 They had bladders.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.760
 They had bladders.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.600
 They have helium?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.600
 No, no, no, no.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
 I would be hot, I wouldn't know.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.080
 They would use their light fire on them.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.520
 Yeah, they didn't really isolate helium

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.120
 till quite late on.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.440
 OK, so there goes that theory.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.680
 Pop goes that, too.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.680
 [LAUGHS]

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680
 Ew.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.680
 More than words that I would use that you guys will never use.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.680
 Like, for instance, I would say,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.240
 Ginnel for a path between two houses.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.280
 And I would use that--

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.480
 I mean, I don't use it every day.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.000
 But every time I walk--

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 every time I walk through a Ginnel, I would use that word.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.920
 You would say-- because you constantly say out loud

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.040
 the things you're doing as you're doing.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.040
 Yeah.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040
 Yeah.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.000
 And I am from London.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.320
 I will constantly say things like liberal elite media

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.720
 bubble.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.160
 But not really, because it's like in the same way

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.760
 fish don't have a word for water.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760
 Yeah.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.520
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.080
 Just a little thing about the Guinness Book of Records.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.520
 That's been going for a long time.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.280
 It's first compiled by two brothers,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.440
 Norris and Ross McWirter.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.680
 And someone had a bet about what was the fastest bird.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.520
 And they decided to put down this group

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.880
 of older records in the world.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.880
 The first one, it took them 16 weeks.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.840
 And they sent loads of letters to experts

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.440
 and consultants around the world.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.200
 But the problem was that people would just

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.920
 exaggerate all the time.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.840
 And so they got a letter from the guy in Africa

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.080
 saying that they'd measured the flight of a fly at 820 miles

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.040
 an hour, twice the speed of seconds.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.520
 And this guy wanted them to put that in as the world's fastest

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.640
 flight.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.640
 Well, and they just heard the buzzing reach them

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.400
 10 minutes off of the fly at past.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.720
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.200
 Just one really interesting ecosystem that exists,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.400
 and that's really important, is whale fall.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.480
 So I didn't know about this, but whale carcasses

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.760
 are really important habitats as well to other creatures.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:18.960
 And not many of them have been found.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.600
 But basically, when whales die, then creatures

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.880
 live in them on the bottom of the ocean.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.680
 We haven't found many.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.120
 But when we do, we tend to find new species on them.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.520
 So first of all, a bunch of scavengers

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.160
 live inside the whale carcasses and eat all the flesh off them.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.840
 And then these bone-boring animals come along.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.840
 So for instance, we found a new species of bone-boring worm

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.200
 in 2005, living in a whale carcass.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.320
 And it's called the boneting snot flower, which--

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.160
 Yeah.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.120
 And it was really cool, because the reason it's called that

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.280
 is because it looks like a flower.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.600
 It's backside looks like a flower, as it pokes out of the bone,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.120
 as it's gnawing into it.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.880
 And then after the bones have been eaten, then bacteria

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.880
 comes along, and then other stuff comes and feeds on that.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.520
 So they create these really vital ecosystems, whale carcasses.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.240
 That's like, I was reading an article about ocean animals

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.160
 that live purely on land-based food.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.600
 So logs, when logs and plants go into the ocean,

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.760
 and 90% of the animals that are found in these logs

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.440
 aren't found anywhere else on any other bit of coral

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.880
 or wherever in the ocean, that's their living place.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.720
 90% so they just have to wait for another log to fall in.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:26.760
 And some of them are a really long way in the ocean.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.120
 They're not coastal, you know?

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:28.880
 It's mad, you know?

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.960
 You can see why people used to think that animals just

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.040
 came from nowhere, because you would find a log there,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.600
 and suddenly there were tons of animals.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.120
 Yes.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.240
 And people thought that they would just come from rotten logs

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.720
 or whatever.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.880
 So that's why, you know, the Tathanlyle image

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.520
 is the lion with a load of bees flying out of it.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.800
 Oh, that's the famous Tathanlyle image.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.560
 That's because they thought that bees

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.880
 would generate it spontaneously from lion coccasers.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.720
 The idiots.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.120
 I was reading about elephant penises,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.040
 and they sound very, very cool.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.480
 They use their penis to swat away flies.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.000
 Really?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.320
 Yeah, and also, if they have an itch on their belly,

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.680
 they'll just use their penis to itch their belly.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.000
 No, we all do that, Dan.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
 I can use it to itch.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.560
 You know, that bit of the back that you can't quite reach.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.240
 You can't, you can't.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:27.760
 Did you know, I just had no idea about this.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:32.000
 Colin Powell wanted to run for president in the '90s, in 1996,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.960
 and he decided not to, because his wife was too worried

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.520
 that he would be assassinated by white supremacists.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.040
 Yeah.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.800
 And that's the thing that Michelle Obama said,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.200
 she had to be really talked into when Obama wanted to run

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.600
 was the risk of being assassinated or harmed by white supremacists.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.320
 Yes.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:46.840
 Talk around.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.520
 And there was an assassination attempt on Obama,

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.040
 which barely anyone knows about, because the secret service

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.440
 didn't notice it until four days later.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.280
 And it wasn't even them who noticed.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.760
 It was one of the usherers, one of the house cleaning staff

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.600
 at the White House, when they saw that one of the windows

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.440
 had gun bullets fired through it.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.200
 No, one of the windows is smashed.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.960
 Yeah, and they had no idea.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.920
 And they eventually caught the guy.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.600
 He's in jail now, he's serving 25 years.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.880
 And they found bullet holes.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.360
 Yeah, in the White House, they had no idea.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.520
 In the whole days, it's a long time to go, nooo.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:30.680
 The man who developed the noise, the reversing noise,

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.000
 the beep, beep, beep.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.840
 The first.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.800
 The first, not that, actually, is the actual beep.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.080
 His name is Chris Hansen Abbot.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.040
 He developed it in the 1970s, and it's used all over the world now.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.880
 And he regrets that sound, and because he says

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.480
 that everyone finds it really annoying, and he hates it.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.240
 So he developed a new one, which is sort of,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.680
 and it sounds a bit like C wave's crashing in the sea,

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.640
 but in short bursts.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.360
 And now that he's trying to get that adopted,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.680
 and it's beginning to be used.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.920
 Surely the whole point of that is it's annoying.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.760
 Yeah, exactly.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.920
 You don't want to have your alarm going off in the morning,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.720
 and it's just beautiful, relaxing waves.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720
 No, this is it.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:03.920
 It's supposed to attract attention,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.840
 and it's easy to recognize and to work out

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.920
 where the sound is coming from.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.200
 But that's slightly different from being annoying.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.880
 So he regrets it, he made it too effective and too annoying,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.000
 and now he's trying to make one that does the same job,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.040
 but is less intrusive, enjoy it.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.160
 I think the speaking person is way more annoying.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160
 Real cool, reversive.

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.400
 Yeah, for me, that's, I know, that's what the beep has told me.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.520
 Or I like the ones where you've got the money trucks,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.600
 and they're like, please, help, help, I am under attack.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.400
 Please call the police.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.400
 Have you seen those?

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.400
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.920
 I've never heard the noise, though.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.960
 It's literally a person just shouting that,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.040
 and it's a recording of a person saying, help, help.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.880
 I am under attack.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.760
 So when you heard that was the thing being actually attacked.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.120
 Well, he was one trying to steal from me.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.960
 Yeah.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:49.240
 They also eat these cells, jellyfish.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.560
 In times of need, they eat their own bodies.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.440
 And because they can survive with a small portion of their bodies,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.040
 that's OK.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.480
 So I think a jellyfish of 18 centimeters

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.880
 can degrow to be 1.4 centimeters and then grow back again.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:03.640
 Wow.

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640
 It's cool, right?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.680
 Is it when they're stressed as well?

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.560
 Because octopus is true their own arms when they're really stressed.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.600
 It's not nice.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.400
 No, just when they're hungry, they're not very anxious creatures.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.760
 You wouldn't think there would be a net gain of eating yourself, though, would you?

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.440
 If I eat my finger, I'm still going to be the same weight as I was before I ate the finger.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.560
 But you won't be hungry.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.920
 But you won't be hungry.

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.520
 So it's a short-term strategy.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:39.120
 I've got one last thing that I really like,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.600
 which is the Lord of the Rings, the main characters of Lord of the Rings,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:47.160
 the actors in real life, to celebrate the amazing time that they had.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.440
 They all got a tattoo, which was of Elfish for nine.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.760
 Everyone got it except for Gimli, who didn't want to get it.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.880
 So he got his stunt double to get it instead.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.440
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.880
 And he did.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.360
 He's not at his stunt doubles like this random guy, he's a part of the character.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.640
 Have you seen my tattoo?

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.120
 Let me just bring him up, take a look.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:20.480
 One thing about Donald Trump as well.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.840
 So he-- you know, he's been the story in the papers this week.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.240
 He's made this enormous loss in his taxes.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.960
 The year he did this 1995, 2% of net operating losses

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.600
 occurred by American taxpayers in that year was Donald Trump.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:35.720
 Yes.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.240
 500,000 people declared a net operating loss,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.640
 and he was 2% of the entire sum.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.000
 Do you know that his-- that's why it makes sense

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.080
 that if you look at his tax records, which were published in The New York Times,

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.320
 the figures are a bit off-kilter.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.280
 So the first two digits are the 900 and something million.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.600
 They're extremely off-kilter.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.920
 That's because the tax software couldn't take a figure of that large.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.720
 So his accountant had to add it manually afterwards with a typewriter.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.240
 Wow.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.800
 Because it was not rigged to be working in the hundreds of millions in terms of losses.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:16.360
 It is one of the most dangerous jobs in America.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.400
 Assassinating a president.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.640
 No, being a president.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.200
 Well, also assassinating presidents, probably.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:21.720
 Yeah.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.360
 Quite a few of them got shot, didn't they?

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.160
 Yeah.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.840
 Yeah, yeah.

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.080
 You can't really say it's one of the most dangerous jobs in America.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.120
 Because it's quite different to what it was 150 years ago, isn't it?

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.720
 That's true.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:31.880
 That's true.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.760
 We wouldn't say being a troller man is one of the most dangerous jobs in the world.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.040
 And then for our evidence, use troller men from the 1400s.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.800
 No.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.160
 Although it is a very dangerous job.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.920
 Yes, it is.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.600
 It was actually quite a bad example for me to choose.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.080
 I should have written something that's a really safe job now,

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.000
 but was really dangerous in the 1400s.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.040
 Nonetheless, if there was one in 10 charts of me being shot at QI,

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.960
 I would resign immediately.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.200
 But there's not the one in 10 charts.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.800
 Well, there is a one in 10 charts of me being shot at QI actually.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.200
 That's only because of my brilliant points I keep on making.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:09.920
 So campuses weren't used to tell directions for many, many years

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.080
 after they were discovered, were they?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.360
 They were discovered in China in the 4th century BC, roughly,

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.360
 or first built in China in the 4th century BC.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.440
 And they were used for Feng Shui, essentially.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.200
 So they were used for spiritual reasons to decide where to build a house

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.000
 or where to put your furniture or where to have a tomb.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.960
 And yeah, it was many hundreds of years after that.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.400
 We learned that we can actually use it to find places.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.200
 A modern version.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.440
 So satellite dishes all point slightly east of south.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.440
 So if you get lost in the city, you can use a dish to work out where north is.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.640
 You've got a compass.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.720
 Yeah, although if you see someone walking past your house

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.280
 during your satellite dish, you do call the police

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.320
 and report a suspected robber in the area.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.760
 Which is last, my compass wasn't working.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.200
 My satellite dish method has led me to your house.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.280
 So your front door is gray.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.640
 Another thing in London, at least, and in other big cities.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.880
 In the morning, if you're lost, follow the crowd

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.840
 because they'll take you to a tube station.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.040
 And in the evening, go against the crowd

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.400
 because they're coming from a tube station.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.440
 Very good.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.920
 It's the other way round.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.280
 In the morning, everyone, in the centre of a city,

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.800
 everyone's walking away from the tube station.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.360
 So in the centre, yeah, I see.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.360
 I'm thinking, where am I going to be in the morning?

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.440
 Near my house.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.080
 But then, to be honest, I'm not lost in that situation, am I?

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.160
 But I frequently wake up in the middle of a city centre

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.440
 and don't know where I am.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.960
 What city is it?

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.800
 What if you're so lost, you can't tell the difference

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.440
 between the city centre and the outskirts.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.840
 So you don't know whether to go with the crowd or away from the crowd.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.160
 Just study the number of satellite dishes.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.920
 Yeah, that's why we have that back up.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.880
 So Newtron stars are trying to be heavy dense.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.680
 They weigh the same as half a million earths,

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.280
 but they would fit into a ball the size of Manhattan.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280
 Cool.

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.560
 They're so dense.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.440
 Have they not followed the sky then?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.960
 No.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.640
 They are the Rome.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.960
 This is really missing done on this podcast.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.840
 They are so far away that it's not a problem.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.880
 So those are neutron stars.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.600
 Magnetars are like super neutron stars.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.120
 They are a thousand times stronger.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.880
 We only know about 10 of them in our galaxy.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.160
 And the field strength is a thousand trillion times stronger

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.160
 than the Earth's magnetic field.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.400
 Thousand trillion.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.880
 I know that's just a very, very large number.

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:30.120
 Yeah, but what a number.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.040
 We can't really.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.560
 Yeah.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.400
 It's too big.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400
 We can't get it into your head.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400
 We can't be moving on.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.960
 But I really like-- so obviously a lot of people

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.600
 like to attack people who believe in astrology and so on.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:52.280
 And Dave Gorman did the comedian in Britain

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.200
 for anyone overseas.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.200
 Dave Gorman, he did a show where he tried

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.320
 to follow his horoscope completely to the word for 30 days.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.600
 It was a big experiment.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.320
 And he was using all sorts of different horoscopes.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.800
 But he was largely using the one by Jonathan Caner.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.520
 Jonathan Caner was a very famous astrologer for the sun.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.600
 I think it was.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.400
 Was it the male?

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.280
 Yeah.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.800
 So Gorman suddenly thought, hang on.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.800
 I think this guy has caught on onto my act here,

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.880
 because he just started finding that his particular horoscope

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.480
 reading was just a bit more advanced.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.920
 Did it say you're going to kill him tonight, Dave?

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.480
 Well, here's one that he had.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.600
 So he's a Pisces.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.520
 And on one of the days of the entries,

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.480
 during the experiment, when he knew

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.720
 that Gorman was doing this, because it was very much publicized,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.640
 this was the entry.

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.560
 Stand on one leg, place a bowl of cereal in your left hand

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:44.840
 and a tangerine in your right.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.320
 Balance three books on your head and jump up and down.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.560
 What do you mean this is difficult?

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.600
 I haven't finished yet.

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.120
 Sing the national anthem backwards

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.600
 and jump into a bucket of water.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.400
 While still on one leg, peel the tangerine

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.480
 and flick the segments into the bowl one at a time.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:56.960
 Why?

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.840
 What do you mean why?

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.440
 Why not?

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.720
 You seem happy enough to take a bunch of other daft orders

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.880
 for no good reason today?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.680
 And that was published in a newspaper.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.120
 And Gorman had to do that, because it was part of his experiment.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.960
 Absolutely.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.320
 Well, as part of his experiment.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.280
 It's very strange, because my mum is a Pisces,

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.480
 and we have always wondered about that morning.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.840
 That morning, what happened?

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.840
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:26.720
 There's an Aussie word that I use that's not translated over here,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.240
 which is Khan, C-A-R-N, Khan.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.840
 And Khan.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.560
 I've heard you say that.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:32.720
 I heard it meant come on.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.840
 It does, yeah, but it doesn't get used to,

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.880
 but back home, it does get used all the time.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.480
 But it also, it doesn't mean just come on

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.080
 in the sense of like, come on, we're late.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.160
 It also means come on as in like, oh, come on.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.720
 Like, you know, in the scene of the Titanic,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.600
 when the guy falls off and he hits the rudder on the way down,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.600
 his last word would have been, Khan.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.480
 Because that would be a lie.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.320
 I lost somethings up there, or that as well.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.800
 Yeah.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.560
 Falling to my death.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.400
 So, yeah, that's a big word that's not yet made out of it.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.200
 I haven't seen Titanic.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.040
 What?

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.680
 Well, that's a whole big conversation we don't have to do.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.960
 I know about the Titanic.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:04.120
 So, I mean, I figured it's like watching a long documentary

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.240
 about something I already know about.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.640
 I have also not seen it, but I think

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.120
 that I've seen enough spoofs of it

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.880
 that I pretty much know everything that happens.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.280
 Yeah.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.040
 OK, guys.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.960
 Aren't you guys cool?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.800
 Yeah.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.480
 There was, I've seen Titanic, too.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.240
 I've seen Titanic, too.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.240
 I'm waiting for Titanic, three.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.120
 I can't get enough.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.960
 He only watched Titanic, one, so he'd understand

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.400
 the plotline to Titanic, too.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.920
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:33.920
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.640
 You know, there's a group of, there's a species of B,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.760
 which only lives in abandoned snail shells.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.280
 Really?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.760
 Yeah, it's a solitary B, obviously.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.600
 It doesn't live in a hive.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:46.920
 So, yeah, it's called Ozmiya Bikola.

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.400
 And this is part of a group of bees called Helika Files,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.120
 or Shell Lovers.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.280
 And it's so sweet.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.680
 So the female lays an egg inside the shell.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.760
 And then it fills the rest of it with grains

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.960
 of sand and pebbles to act as a barricade against intruders.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.400
 And then she flies off, and she comes back

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.520
 with all these dried grass and twigs.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.280
 And she covers over this empty snail shell

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.640
 with her egg in it.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.960
 And she glues it together with saliva.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.960
 And she makes a little pyramid, basically,

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.920
 for the egg to rest inside.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.240
 And this is so cool.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.080
 So this is from a feature on Wired, I found this.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.800
 When she flies back holding a twig,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.160
 it does look like it's a bee riding a tiny broomstick.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.560
 It's amazing.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:31.320
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.280
 The coolest thing, I think, about snails,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.920
 sorry, just quickly, is that they can walk upside down on water.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.680
 And this is incredible.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.000
 We only just worked out how they do this.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.280
 But so essentially, most freshwater snails don't have gills.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.760
 They have lungs, so they need to be in open air

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.240
 to breathe rather than in water.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.600
 So some of them, like the apple snail,

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.760
 which is a common pet, have a little snorkel device,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:58.400
 which they shoot up to the surface, which gets air in.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.280
 But a lot of them have a lung, which

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.920
 they want to be exposed to at all times.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.760
 And so they float on top of the water with this lung exposed.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.320
 And what they can do is they can turn upside down

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.200
 and attach themselves to the under surface of the water.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.760
 And they use a combination of surface tension.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.480
 And then the viscous kind of drag from the slime

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.280
 that they exude.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.640
 And that's just the right balance.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.400
 That they can just crawl upside down along the surface

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.440
 of the under surface of the water.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.600
 That is amazing.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.360
 It's really cool.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.200
 And you reckon they come across other snails

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.440
 going on the other side.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.800
 And they're like, it's my reflection.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.200
 Oh, no, it's another thing.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.640
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.120
 Just wanted to let the Pokemon go.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.120
 Yeah.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.120
 A non-governmental agency in Bosnia

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.120
 has worn players to be aware of landmines

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.840
 while trying to have a catch Pokemon.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.920
 But also generally, just whenever, whatever you're doing,

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.000
 be aware of landmines.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.520
 That's true.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.960
 Yeah, I think the prop-- yeah, you're right.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.640
 Actually, you can genetically modify Crest

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.880
 so that when it's stressed going over landmines,

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.640
 it changes color.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.120
 And that's one way of finding landmines.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:57.640
 Really?

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640
 He's bringing it back to that.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.040
 But no help for Pokemon finding.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.160
 Yeah, no.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.920
 And finally, two men in California

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.480
 ignored warning signs and fell off a cliff when playing Pokemon.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480
 Yeah.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.480
 They're OK though, aren't they?

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.280
 It was a--

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.000
 That's all in CNN.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.320
 And it said that this happened.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.960
 And it said that they'd had injuries,

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.800
 but it was uncertain how bad their injuries were.

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.520
 But I think maybe it wasn't a massive cliff.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.920
 And I hope they're OK.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.760
 Oh, wow.

 What do you want?

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.720
 Because I don't know what about agencies.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.160
 I think so, yeah, I can do that.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.240
 I don't want to be--

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.040
 I don't-- I don't want to over-tell story or format.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.760
 But it's about caterpillars and silkworms.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.080
 Do you know about this?

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.720
 In the Byzantine Empire, they needed silk.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.640
 And it was ruinously expensive, but the silk was produced

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.200
 in China, and the trade was controlled by the Persians,

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.280
 who had choked it off.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.160
 And so Justinian, the first sent two monks to China

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.840
 to smuggle out some silkworm eggs, which they did.

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.280
 They had bamboo walking sticks, which are hollow, you know?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.160
 And they made full sort of things inside.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.120
 And they smuggled silkworm eggs in their bamboo staves.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:08.920
 And it took them two years to do it and destroyed the monopoly.

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:10.640
 And the whole of Byzantine economy

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.240
 was based on the silkworm industry

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.240
 from-- they brought back in their bamboo

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.360
 staves for the next 650 years.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.640
 No way.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.040
 And then the mulberry leaves that they eat

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.400
 had to be brought by a different path by some other people.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.680
 So it was a real major.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.320
 And you see, it's a proper sort of Jason Bourne style thriller,

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.120
 isn't it, really, being those two monks

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.440
 and trying to get them to bring a schlep them back

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440
 through all the Persians?

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.720
 Yeah, sort of.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.720
 Yeah, sort of.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.320
 It's a version of the Bourne Islands here in Jamaica.

 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.960
 I was reading a good article in a local Scottish newspaper

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.000
 about a DIY store in Sterling, which a hedge outside it,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.240
 a 30-foot hedge, have been taken over by caterpillars.

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.080
 And it's turned into this enormous web.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:51.840
 And you should look it up.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.800
 It is impressive.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.040
 And so they close it off, and they invited people

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.040
 to come and visit it as a tourist spot.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.840
 And the newspaper said that visitors from as far away

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.320
 as Motherwell have traveled to see the unusual light,

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.960
 which is, if you're interested, a 40-minute drive

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.800
 from Sterling.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.400
 Yeah.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.680
 That's a full 40-minute people travel.

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.920
 Yeah, it's quite a city.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.600
 A more than 40 minutes, you would sort of think.

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.760
 Is it, could I be bothered?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.640
 Yeah, we could have lunch.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.600
 Yeah.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.600
 Yeah.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.160
 The tobacco hawk moth caterpillar.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.240
 This is a cool caterpillar.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.280
 It has two different walking systems

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.840
 for different parts of its body.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.840
 So it walks normally with its legs.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.360
 But then it's gut, which is obviously

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:33.600
 on the base of it, walks a step out of sink.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.880
 Oh, I think you already do that.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.960
 It walks a step ahead.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.760
 Yeah, it's bizarre.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.960
 They think this is how caterpillars move.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.000
 Is their organs move in front of them?

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:40.840
 Isn't that amazing?

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:41.840
 It's so amazing.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.920
 This is in 2010.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.800
 They put them on a tiny treadmill.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:47.800
 And I can't find any images of the tiny treadmill

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.920
 they made for caterpillars.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.320
 So, and I, should we photograph this

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.800
 or we'll take a video for posterity?

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.680
 No.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.720
 Who'd want to see that?

00:28:53.720 --> 00:29:02.720
 We have the ability to tell the future,

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.880
 and we don't know why.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.320
 In 2012, this meta-analysis was done

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.080
 of studies from 1975 that looked at 26 experiments,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.200
 which show people a series of random images.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.600
 So in lots of experiments, they do that for various reasons.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.240
 And they'll suddenly put up a scary image,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.920
 like a slithering snake with big fangs.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.200
 And it found that people are able to tell

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.920
 between one and 10 seconds in advance

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.160
 when the snake image is going to come up totally at random.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.880
 So they're not primed in any way to tell that.

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.280
 It sounds completely insane.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.840
 People are going to get very angry, I'm saying this.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.040
 I know, it sounds like they're kind of shit,

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.040
 I usually say, but you do.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.560
 I don't, this doesn't sound very cruel.

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.120
 It sounds like nonsense, doesn't it?

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.040
 But look, they looked at these 26 experiments,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.120
 and they said at the end,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.080
 the cause of this anticipatory activity,

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.960
 which undoubtedly does lie within the realm

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.720
 of natural physical processes, remains undetermined.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.640
 So they said it's not supernatural, guys.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.960
 But actually, come on, we're able to predict

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.280
 what scary pictures are coming up.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.640
 Because my immediate thought is that the experimenter

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.880
 is giving something away.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.720
 Yeah.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.480
 Or the world, just fundamentally similar

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.040
 that the people who put the order in,

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.360
 you can kind of predict that just because you're both humans.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.760
 So you kind of, you naturally have it.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.600
 We naturally have it.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.680
 And unrandomizing kind of thing.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.320
 The other thing is, if you can predict it

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.400
 between one and 10 seconds, and they're coming up

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.240
 every couple of seconds, then you could say,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.760
 one's going to come, and you have five chances of it coming.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.160
 Yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.960
 I think, James, I think it's the guy who's doing the experiment

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.000
 doesn't realize he's going to hate this dragon.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.120
 Ready for your next one?

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.680
 Must stop these researchers from talking to themselves out loud.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.360
 But let's keep an open mind and say, maybe it is unexplained.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.840
 Yeah, open minds, people.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.840
 Yeah.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.420
 (upbeat music)

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:52.640
 There is a thing about Trump at the Secret Service,

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.480
 which is that during the election campaign,

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.760
 they paid him $1.6 million.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.600
 Have you heard this?

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.440
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.480
 So that they can fly on his plane.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.320
 Oh, yeah.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.920
 Well, yeah, when you're a candidate for one

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.960
 of the two big parties, you get a security detail,

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.840
 and they have to accompany you everywhere you go.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.400
 And they obviously pay for their tickets

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.480
 because they've got funding.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.160
 However, if you're traveling on a plane

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.560
 owned by the candidate, you have to pay him money.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.000
 Yeah, I have to say, though, I don't think

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.560
 that that is exclusive to Trump,

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.120
 because the Clintons did that as well.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.000
 And I think they've taken over $2 million

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.360
 from the Secret Service in terms of things that they've,

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.960
 yeah, taxed them for.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.120
 God, you don't want to be the candidate

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.680
 who doesn't rock up with your own personal airplane, do you?

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.520
 What do you do?

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.720
 You're just disqualified from applying.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.280
 You want to be the candidate who's also an Uber driver?

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.240
 Yeah.

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.200
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:53.800
 He also had the most amazing-looking helmet, which actually--

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.080
 What's your problem?

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.880
 W, sum it.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.760
 Double meaning.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.040
 OK, yeah, I'm not that familiar with that time, but thanks.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.840
 He also had a really lovely, moist, rounded helmet.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:20.520

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:22.240
 They've found some of the under-fell bones,

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.560
 and they've checked about the markings on them.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.560
 And some of them have evidence of cannibalism.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.160
 They've got teeth marks on them.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.280
 And then other ones have got scraping marks

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.480
 where you can see they've been made into kind

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.040
 of rudimentary tools.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.440
 So once their friends died, or the under-fell's died,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.560
 they would kind of turn them into tools and food.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.800
 That makes us so much sense.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.160
 Yeah, it's like an organization, yeah.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.240
 Would you like to be turned into a spade?

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:46.760
 Yeah.

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.240
 Well, I think my ribcage could be quite a nice tuckstack.

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.280
