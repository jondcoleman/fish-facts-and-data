00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.820
 Hello you lovely club fish members and welcome to this week's bit of bonus material.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.460
 What do we have for you this week? We have an episode of Meet the Elves.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.080
 So I am joined in Holborn today by Dan Schreiber who's just come off a train ride from hell

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.040
 which you might have heard about on the podcast this week I'm not sure.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.840
 Anna Tyshinski for whom I have no anecdote and a very special guest Molly Windust.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 Hello. Hello Molly. Hiya. How are you doing?

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:54.440
 Better than Dan I think. Yeah. And me. My epitaph is Anna Tyshinski for whom there is no anecdote.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.080
 The most boring woman alive. Wow. I'm sorry about that.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.520
 I think it's funny that Anna doesn't wear shoes in the office. Am I allowed to say that?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.080
 People are allowed to know that. People must not know that I have feet.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.040
 Oh my god. The wiki feet community will be on to us. She does have socks on though.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.760
 Oh yeah that's quite an important distinction. I do. Although we did a photo shoot recently

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.320
 for our tour by the way it was on sale and I just couldn't be able to put shoes on so we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.400
 did it without shoes and then our colleague was like was that on purpose and isn't the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000
 I just realized that in Abbey Road Paul McCartney doesn't wear shoes and that meant he was dead.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.520
 Oh so we're going to have conspiracy theories that's quite exciting. That's interesting.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240
 That's very funny. No wonder there's nothing to say about you. You're dead.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 Yeah exactly. And Anna Tyshinski who is an AI.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.800
 But also without you giving permission the first draft we saw of the poster they added shoes on

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.520
 to you because they were worried about the wiki feet. I did not see that.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.440
 What type of shoes? One was a clown shoe and the other one was an orthopedic shoe.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.320
 I thought it was a bit harsh actually. I do remember Alex saying that sorry it was Alex

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.480
 who did it wasn't it. Sorry as Anna was talking just then you literally ripped your socks off

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.960
 and threw them aside. What happened? I think this might come down to that I'm always very hot.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.760
 Anyway this isn't me the wiki feet community and Anna. This is me Molly who has shoes on.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.280
 Yes she does. And Molly you work in the production arm would you say?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.320
 Production leg. Okay production foot. Production toe. Yes I do.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.560
 Yes so you work in the production big toe of QI but for the moment you have a question for us.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.880
 I do. That you're going to ask and we're going to flail all around and try and answer in the next

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.560
 20 minutes and then you'll give us the answer that we failed to get. So what is your question?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.360
 Okay my question this week is why did a seventh floor London council flat travel one thousand

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:58.440
 miles? A seventh floor. Wow. Well the world is always rotating on its axis isn't it Molly and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.160
 going around the sun so it travels much more than one thousand miles. Yes and the sun is going around

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 Sagittarius A which is the black hole at the centre of our galaxy. Sure. So is that the answer?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.880
 Yeah I can clock off now. Close dismissed. No that's not the answer. Okay so it's a seventh

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.000
 floor London council flat apartment travel the thousand miles. Okay first of all why don't we

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.920
 work out what's a thousand miles from London? Yeah. That's clever. I felt like my house today

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.160
 given how long it took me to get in here. Am I right? I'm very bad at distances I can't judge

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.080
 them so let's see you're looking a thousand miles that probably looks like California.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.640
 I think that's a bit further. Is that quite a lot further? I think that's way further yeah.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.880
 I think a thousand miles probably wouldn't get you to the east coast of America. Does it not get you

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.640
 to the east coast? I don't think so. Distance is a funny old thing isn't it? I was in Margate recently

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.120
 and Leven Skyra came down. Oh yeah. Leven was standing next to me and he said do you know what's

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.920
 really weird? I'm closer to my home in Belgium right now than I am to London. Yeah okay. That's

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.280
 amazing. Took out his Google Maps and he looked at it and he measured the distance of both places

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.920
 and he said yeah. That's bizarre. We are really close to Europe. Well in some ways not politically.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:25.880
 There is a thing where if you draw a line from the center of America to the most

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.400
 westerly part of the UK and you go to the middle of that line you're still in North America you're

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.120
 in Canada. If you were to say in the center of North America did you say yeah? No center of the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.080
 United States of America which I think is the town cold center or something. Oh that's right yeah we

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.040
 did that yeah. Anyway this is not really... I would say North Africa is about a thousand miles is that

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:53.320
 right? Turkey? Yeah you're closer than California for sure. Is it a place that's a thousand miles

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.320
 away? Did it move or did it like go round and round and round the same neighborhood for a thousand

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.360
 miles and land in the same place? Or are we looking for a place that's a thousand miles away? You're

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.040
 looking for a place. I thought you're onto it there. I thought Seventh Floor was like a revolving

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.960
 restaurant so it was technically traveling. That's good. I'm not as elaborate as maybe some of the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.640
 other Elves. Okay so here's a question. The Simple Elf is what we taught you. Yeah I'm having a really

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:21.240
 tough time with it. I think a practical elf because we've already established you're in the production

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.840
 team and in the last series of QI you're kind of in charge of all the props right? Yeah I'm in

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.480
 charge of props. You're in charge of props so if you watch the next season which goes out in the

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.120
 winter and you see anything go wrong. That's me. That's all on Molly. Sandy would often ask for like

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.280
 on the day she goes oh wouldn't it be great to demonstrate this with a tennis ball that's cut

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.200
 in half and the show was in 15 minutes and I'm like I'll get you a tennis ball Sandy and I'll

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.360
 saw that in half. How did you saw it in half because in Kill Bill they throw one at the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.400
 monk and he just does it with a sword. Yeah I didn't have a sword that's against health and

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.320
 safety. I use my pen knife really slowly. Nice. Oh nice. Well I'm having a pen knife because

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.600
 actually I read recently that the latest edition of the pen knife has been released without a knife

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.880
 no way. So it's good that you didn't. That's a pen you bought. I've been deep. That's a two-thin. That's a two-thin.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:23.000
 That's a two-thin. Okay so here's a question. Yeah. Does the former or current inhabitant

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.200
 of this flat give us some clue to the answer to the question? No. In fact it's important to think

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.400
 about the fact that they had no choice in the matter. Okay because I was thinking like maybe

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 it was the flat that Engels lived in and you know the Soviets brought it over. Oh yeah because there

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.200
 was also Rosa Parks's house which they knocked down or they wanted to knock down and then Germany

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.320
 I think it was said no we'll have it and then they just relocated this entire house. Yeah and then

00:06:53.320 --> 00:07:00.520
 of course you got Dickens's flat pack with Chalet which is in Rochester. And someone tried

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.040
 to buy Shakespeare's house. I think there's an American who came over and tried to buy Shakespeare's

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.680
 house and there was a huge campaign against it in the 19th century. It got together and they bought

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:15.480
 him out. So is it a historic council block? Oh yes it is. Okay the only famous council block I can

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.320
 think of is the Barbican off the top of my head. But that's at the top of my head. Have you noticed

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.720
 a seventh floor flat missing from the Barbican? Does it have seven floors of Barbican? It has

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.880
 way more. Does it? Does it? The big towers have. Like Trelik Tower has more of course. Is it a whole

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.040
 floor or just one flat did you say? It's the seventh floor but two whole masonette flats.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:44.760
 So interestingly he said did you notice have you noticed a missing flat in the Barbican? We said no.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.360
 So does that mean that if we looked at this building today in London there is a gap where

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.920
 those flats used to be? In the specific time that it was taken there would have been two missing

00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:04.360
 flats but a clue is that the flats no longer exist. Oh the entire building. The entire block

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.360
 no longer exist. Because I was suddenly thinking do you remember there's that I place I can't remember

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.920
 if it's in Japan but where they had to put the train system through the building and so they had

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.040
 to remove the flats. A flight route went through the building so they had to remove one floor.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.160
 Downs Margate train. No no this in this in this case the flats still exist but they just knocked

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.800
 out the houses and the train literally goes through. Surely that's like in Mary Poppins like when you

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:35.400
 would all your china would go as the train came through. I think I think you should focus on where

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.440
 a thousand let's go back to the simple question of where a thousand miles. Okay that we've established

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:46.760
 so that is not a simple question. So it was closer to Turkey than it was to North America.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:53.640
 Is it Eastern Europe? No. Is it the Middle East? No. Are we going North? No. Are we going South?

00:08:53.640 --> 00:09:00.760
 Yes keep going. Italy. Yes okay Italy okay we got that. Well done. And this was a long time ago

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.360
 because it doesn't exist anymore or it was council flats so they didn't exist that long ago did

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:10.120
 they? Well it's you know mid 20th century it could be. It wasn't a long time ago. Oh right it just

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:15.480
 happens. I could have given you the date but I decided not to but I could. It's fine okay we can

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.640
 work this out. We can work this out. Yeah we can work out the date we had a very fun episode with

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:26.280
 Jack Chambers where we spent about four hours trying to work out the date. Exactly 1951 1952 1953.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:35.320
 It's of note because of architectural history in London and potentially political history around

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:39.880
 the demolition as previously spoken upon. Have we heard of is this like a really recognizable

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:47.240
 name the building name? Yes I could give you a clue to the name of the of the building. Yeah go on.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:56.040
 It's based on a mythical creature from the north of England. Oh Yeti towers. Sorry creatures quite

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.720
 are not really the right word. Loch Ness monster. Peter K. Loch Ness monster is in the north of

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:09.320
 England is it? Send your letters to the author. My version of history James. Creatures not the

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:16.760
 right word but mythical person. Oh King Arthur. Robin Hood towers or something. Well done Robin Hood

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:23.000
 gardens. Robin Hood gardens. Oh right. It's the name of the building. North of England. Sherwood

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.200
 Forest. I said north England. Yeah I would say north England. Well you would. Both of you.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.240
 But I can tell you a lot of people in the Newcastle area. So true. From where I'm sat.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.120
 Yes. Should we discuss where the line for north of England is because I always think above Birmingham

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.240
 which not he's not not again right. Well you see it on the road it says you're now entering the north.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.360
 Yeah. Yeah that's a big sign. That's a big wall isn't there. Yeah. And all those white walkers.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.320
 Okay. Shall I issue a formal apology. Are you intending to visit Newcastle in the next year

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:01.240
 or so? Not now. Listen Jordies do you want to widen your sphere or narrow it because James is

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.320
 implying that you just want to be part of your own tiny little enclave whereas I think surely you'd

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.800
 want more and more of it. That's right. Take back control of the north. Okay come on class back to

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.160
 the. Sorry. Robin Hood. Yes so. Okay well done. We've got the name of the. Robin Hood and it's in

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:20.040
 East London. And did some couldn't we get a bit more about the history of why someone wanted it.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.360
 Was it some weird Italian eccentric who thought I love this building. I'd like to take the seventh

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.360
 floor. I don't know if I can tell you that because that might give away. Oh I reckon I know what it

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.400
 is. Think about why it might be going to Italy. They got a housing shortage. I'm giving them some

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:40.520
 of our houses. It was one in a divorce. No. Because Paul Gasgrain moved from Spurs to Lazio

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:46.280
 and he wanted a bit of London to go with. Imagine if it was that. Yes. The demolition

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:55.080
 I think might help. Why might why might someone keep a part of a flat. Pair it back. It's slightly

00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.520
 more simple than. Okay. That. So it was just made by a famous person in the art. Was he

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.080
 architect Italian and they wanted to move it. But you're on the right line. The interior decorator.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.400
 Why would you why would someone put something on display in Italy. It's the pope. The pope

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:17.800
 lived in a council house in London 1950. Let's pause a sec and recalibrate because we're just

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.200
 yelling stuff at this point. Hey Frankie Boyle lives in a council flat doesn't he in Glasgow.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.240
 He lives in the top. This is going to help us is it. Well no I'm just suddenly thinking that's

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.480
 something that we've not not mentioned. Well you're a you're a comedian as well which is something

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.560
 that probably no one knows on a Meet the Elf level. Yeah do you think Helen Frankie are probably BFS.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.320
 No I'm trying I'm trying to cool my brain. I like to do this and meet the Elf where I

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:42.840
 take it away from the subject so in the background think of what's going on.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.480
 Are you doing Edinburgh this year. I'm going up for a week. I'm not I'm not I'm not doing a

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.360
 show. I'm just going to do I'm doing the cheeky thing of I go up for a week and do a few variety

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.120
 shows and tell everyone I'm exhausted and that it's a really challenging place to be to people

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.800
 who are doing proper one month shows. Yeah didn't you do one show last year. Yeah last year I did

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.640
 one night. Hannah what are we doing in Edinburgh this year. It's the perfect way to do it. That's

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:10.360
 a good point yeah we're on to we're on to a winner here. You don't spend any money you go for one

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.880
 night you tell everyone it's an exhausting place to be and you leave in the morning. Exactly what

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.640
 I'm going to do. But you do London comedy shows right. I know that Alex went to what is like a

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:26.680
 sketch night that you put on. Yeah it's sketch and short films and like alternative acts. I've

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.720
 really got into clowning recently so I've been trying to find as many clowns as you can in

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.320
 London. I just put on sort of really odd nights just in one car. Yeah all in one car all in one

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.160
 big shoe. Do you want to give us you can give us clues as the festival name. Okay give us give us

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:47.480
 make it cryptic. Okay fine oh yeah um okay um I just can't just feel people listening at home

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:54.920
 screaming at us. The idiot that um it's not quite the first syllable but roughly the first syllable

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:01.640
 is um a Spanish word. Is this the name of the festival? Yes it'd be good to know the name. Okay

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:13.800
 C. Keep going. Cue going. No I'm saying give me a cerveza. Bambuleo. No Spanish word you're

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:19.240
 going to give us more. Yeah Spanish word is the is the first sort of syllable of the name of the

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:29.400
 festival. Diaz. Buenos. Buenos notches. Come on. What's um come on come on kids. Come on uh what

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.960
 does a Spanish word mean? Um no that's cheating. We need to cheat. Don't we need to cheat. It means

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:45.880
 good. Buenos. Buena vista. No. Buena. You say very good how do you say very good. Bellissimo. No that's

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:51.960
 Italian. That's bad isn't it. Is this something like that? No we're going all Italian aren't we?

00:14:51.960 --> 00:15:02.600
 Spanish um. Buon. Buen. Yeah yeah yeah bueno no. Buon be. Okay when you say um very good it's muy bien.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:13.880
 The second half that is bien. Bien bien bien. Yes. Bien is Sumo. Okay I'm going to tell you. Yeah we

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:21.880
 don't know. It's the biennale. The biennale. You were so close. Yeah. Seen it written down. I always

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:30.440
 thought it was pronounced biennial. The biennial biennial. He was a different word. Biennial. Well

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.480
 that's very good to know. We're uncultured swine so but there is another bit. Well there's something

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.760
 special about the floor specifically. I'm never going to forget the bienness sumo. First of all

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:47.000
 I would always call the biennial. Sure um well the question is why did a seventh floor London

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.760
 council flat travel a thousand miles? To go to an architecture exhibition. And it was because

00:15:51.400 --> 00:16:01.960
 when it was demolished in 2018 these two slightly crazy artists bought via the VNA a seventh floor

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:09.000
 flat and kept it and then shipped it to the biennale in order to demonstrate to Italians

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:17.080
 how London people live. Oh wow. In 2018. Oh wow that's true. Which is quite random and it got a

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:23.880
 huge amount of backlash because the Robin Hood Garden flats were demolished and their council

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:30.600
 flats and in the demolition people were arguing that they should be listed and it failed to get

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.520
 listed so they got demolished and obviously it was a big comment on how Bruce List architecture

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.480
 doesn't quite work for housing. Well we just have such an oversupply of council flats in Britain

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.840
 anyway so we've got to be getting rid of them. And the VNA thought which I do think is bizarre.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:51.000
 Why don't we buy it and show it off in Venice in 2018 and that's exactly what they did.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.320
 Molly can I ask do you know the name of that couple who built that? Yeah I do um

00:16:55.320 --> 00:17:04.200
 they're called the Smithsons Alison and Peter and they built um. It's just such normal. Alison

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:13.480
 and Peter. And they built it in they built Robin Hood guns in 1974 and it was considered very

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.720
 revolutionary because all the bedrooms and main living areas faced the gardens so you could

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:24.600
 potentially have your kids playing in the gardens you wouldn't have to go down and be with them so

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.240
 it was meant to be like a really communal thing that you just drop your kids off but it didn't

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.360
 quite work. Drop your kids out the window. Yeah lob them out. The VNA now own them and the VNA is

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:41.400
 opening a new building where the Olympic Park is in Stratford and they're going to display them there

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:49.640
 which I think is even weirder to be like here's how London it's like I think we know. But yeah

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:54.360
 that's opening next year and it's like it's a but yeah it is about the architecture and about

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:59.960
 brutalism but I do I mean people who were like living there were like you don't need to show us

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.960
 the way we lived you know it's like I think that's a really interesting artistic idea.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.600
 It is interesting. It's got value in some way. Because I kind of think those brutalist buildings

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:14.280
 a lot of the importance of them is the fact that there's more than one flat. Actually there might

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:19.880
 be dozens of flats on top of each other and just taking them out of the huge buildings. It's also

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.480
 like I think it kind of it's a bit of a fetish I think people being obsessed with brutalism being

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.080
 obsessed with concrete and like it's often quite highly up academics who are like obsessed with

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:37.160
 who want these places like local busiers stuff to be kept and actually it doesn't work and the people

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.360
 living in them are experiencing mold and like bad heating and all this and they're like no no no but

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.240
 it's it's concrete and beautiful. It is interesting. If you want to if you want to hear the other

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.600
 arguments about that then buy John Grindred's books. Well true. Oh yes. He's a friend of ours

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.680
 and there's loads of books about brutalism. Yeah I studied it in my third year lots of stuff about

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:05.400
 how yeah these flats are often kind of idealized and it's like this these high up architects

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:12.360
 and in my first year I went to India because I got this lucky thing that I applied for this

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.000
 research grant that I didn't think I'd get and then I got it. I got to go to Chandigarh which is a

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.320
 city in India that Le Corbusier designed and in the north of India and it's a grid system and it's

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:30.760
 all concrete and it is so poorly designed like to get from one side to the other you just can't

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:37.240
 like you have to go around basically. The grid system just doesn't work and obviously in India

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:43.960
 there's like you know market stalls and like bazaars and stuff and they you attempt to do

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:49.800
 them in these gridded streets and it just doesn't work and no one can move and there's it's a really

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.160
 weird. There you go. There's the anti Corbusier PR there. I love it. On the plus side for you Anna

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:00.600
 because we learned today when we're talking about JBS Haldane if you go and live in India you don't

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.680
 have to wear socks so that's what he said. Yeah but the floor would be really hot because it's

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.760
 concrete and I'm quite claustrophobic so getting lost in that impenetrable grid system. Yeah the

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:19.960
 grid system is not for me. It was really a really weird trip. I got a plane and there were two people

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:25.000
 on the plane. It was a tiny plane. From one bit of India to another. Yeah I can't actually I think it

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.600
 must have been flying from Delhi but I don't really get scared and I was not a humble brag.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.840
 I don't I've never been scared. But I was in the plane and I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna die

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:41.080
 because it was so small. I've never been it was like me in the pilot. Like I might be like

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.560
 and I just booked it online. Like it wasn't like a special plane. I just booked it and got there and

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:50.520
 I was like that can't be it. It's smaller than a car and then it was it and I was in it and it was

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:55.000
 still went in. Rikety. Oh my god. Yeah because I was like I've got to go. Was he definitely in pilot?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.800
 Was he something like he'd made a website? Yeah. He was like can't believe someone fell for this.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.000
 Better read this first. It's a plane. Yeah it was so scary. At what point into the flight did you

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
 realise actually I am scared of something and it's this. It was the take off. No the take off. But

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.480
 you were fine. You sat in it going this is okay this is fine. No when I walked onto the tarmac I was

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.880
 like that isn't it. I can't walk onto that. It's so there was no steps up. I remember that. It was

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.960
 like one step and I was in the plane. I was like it's got to be higher than this. I'm really

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.000
 picturing like one of those toy planes you get outside supermarket. It was tiny. And also I'm

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.560
 really tall and I remember like my neck being like cricked the whole journey because I couldn't fit

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.040
 in the it was so small. That's so funny. It was so yeah. Was that designed by a corbusier as well?

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.160
 It would have been just a cuboid if it had been designed. Concrete cuboid plane.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.400
 Okay well thank you for your question. You're so welcome. Yeah very interesting. We

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.520
 as usual made the right rickets of trying to answer it but we got there in the end.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:59.720
 And I think we will let people know how we can how they can get in touch with us. So

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.720
 we know how to get in touch with Dan and and no anecdote Anna don't we. So Molly you're on social

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:13.000
 medias. My comedy account is run by my comedy partner called Mudfish. You can always follow

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.080
 that. I have no control over the content and I want to make that really clear. But if they if

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.760
 people go in there they might find out where to come and see your show. Yeah yeah yeah they could.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.520
 Yeah and you know she has no control over the content so it won't be a load of sort of anti

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:30.360
 brutalist. It won't be simple. It's not going to be simple stuff. It's not simple. The complex side

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.560
 of Mudfish. We'll be back again in two more weeks with another piece of bonus content. Who knows

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:49.640
 what it'll be and we'll see you then. Goodbye.
