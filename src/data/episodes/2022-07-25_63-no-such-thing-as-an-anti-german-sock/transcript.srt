 [MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:23,080
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,520
 And no such thing as a fish this week coming to you

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,160
 from the hay festival in hay.

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,040
 I'm sitting here with three other QILs.

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,760
 It's Anit Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,880
 And in a particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,800
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

12
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,600
 Yes, did you imagine that these are specifically

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,560
 literary facts?

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,680
 Absolutely.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
 You did mention it.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,120
 Yeah, because it's a literary festival, right?

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,080
 And that's why I said it.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
 That's why I thought you said it.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,800
 So my literary fact is that the first ever novel

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,040
 ended mid-sentence.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,800
 And this is a Japanese novel called The Tale of Genji.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,440
 It was written in the early 11th century.

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,040
 So probably 1008, I think.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,160
 And yeah, ended in the middle of a sentence.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,600
 Was it like a cliffhanger ending?

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,360
 Kind of.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,600
 I mean, not as melodramatic, but she's

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,280
 a character that's introducing another to character

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,240
 someone, and the end saying, caroo introduces him

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,480
 to the, you never find out who.

31
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
 And people don't know if that was intentional,

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,840
 or if she just died in the middle of gay guy.

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,200
 We've got bored of it.

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,720
 I think most critics think that it was intentional.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,800
 I heard another version, which is like,

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,960
 she just carried on.

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
 She was going to carry on a carry on until she couldn't

38
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,640
 do it anymore.

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,520
 Because there's quite a lot of book, isn't it?

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,560
 Yeah, I think it's about 1100 pages.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
 Yeah, 1100 pages.

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,080
 Yeah.

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,400
 Apparently, there's like 400 characters in there.

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:52,920
 Yeah.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
 And none of them have names.

46
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,040
 No, none of them have names.

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,960
 I read in one-- how do you do that?

48
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,760
 Well, yeah, it must have been so confusing.

49
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,720
 So there are 400 characters.

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,160
 And apparently, at the time, it was rude in Japanese.

51
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,880
 It's all about Japanese aristocratic society

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
 in the 12th century.

53
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,760
 And it was rude to refer to someone by name,

54
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,000
 because it was thought as being unnecessarily familiar.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,040
 So if a 400 characters, none of them

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,120
 would have to be referred to by name.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,600
 So they're all like your ex-an-see, your majesty,

58
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,320
 his highness.

59
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,200
 Oh, so they still have titles, OK.

60
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,800
 Yeah, but I mean, there are 75 his highnesses.

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
 [LAUGHTER]

62
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,320
 What's the way so it'd be like, oh, what's he doing here?

63
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,720
 It said him, the key knew what he meant about him.

64
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,560
 That's a very cool way to end it.

65
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
 I like it.

66
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
 Yeah, it is.

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,280
 So she's a bit like a pre-curse of Tristan Jandit.

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,280
 She seemed to have interesting things

69
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,120
 she did with the form of the Nuffel.

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,600
 Look at the form of the Nuffel, which she just invented.

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,120
 It's a really bold new kind of novel, actually.

72
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,240
 She defied the convention that she created 400 pages earlier.

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,320
 [LAUGHTER]

74
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
 Bye.

75
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,160
 There's one bit.

76
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,440
 So two thousand of the way through she

77
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,920
 killed off the main character about whom

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,000
 the whole thing is written, the tale of Genji, just dies.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,280
 And also, it doesn't really explain.

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,320
 He's been killed off.

81
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,120
 It's just that there's a blank chapter

82
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
 called "Vanished Into the Clouds" with no text in it.

83
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,760
 And then in the next chapter, it becomes apparent

84
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,320
 that the protagonist has died.

85
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
 Wow.

86
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,120
 Yeah.

87
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,520
 Does anyone know what the first e-book was?

88
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,040
 No.

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,120
 That's a thing where it's like there's a few different claims,

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,440
 but probably the most likely was a book called "Uncle Roger"

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
 by Judy Malai.

92
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,960
 And you can still see it online.

93
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,600
 It's like all hyperlinked.

94
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,920
 And you go in there, and it's like there's

95
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,560
 been a party, and it has all the characters.

96
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,560
 You can click on the character, and it gives you

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,320
 their little story.

98
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,040
 And then you click on the next character, and you do that.

99
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,800
 It's like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" books,

100
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,560
 those things that they use to have.

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,600
 They were amazing those books, but they used to be.

102
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 So good.

103
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,000
 And so reading that this was like "Choose Your Own Adventure"

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,640
 I thought I'd look into those.

105
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,360
 And apparently you can get adults to choose

106
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
 your own adventure books.

107
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,480
 Oh God.

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,760
 Yeah.

109
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,800
 And the two best sellers that I could find

110
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,240
 are called "Beer, Women, and Bad Decisions."

111
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,840
 [LAUGHTER]

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,360
 That's great.

113
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,400
 So it's good, doesn't it?

114
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,920
 It sounds like you're going to try and get the bad decisions.

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,560
 Yeah, it's like another point, or a position tonight.

116
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,080
 [LAUGHTER]

117
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,160
 That haven't worked.

118
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,560
 That's how most nights work.

119
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
 And the other best selling one I found

120
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
 is called "Night of a Thousand Boy Friends."

121
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,080
 [LAUGHTER]

122
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,080
 Night with a K.

123
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,680
 Oh.

124
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:38,640
 [LAUGHTER]

125
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,400
 So the first novel in the English language

126
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,080
 is obviously a different thing, because the tale of Genji

127
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,440
 is not in English.

128
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,800
 People often say it's Thomas Mallory's "Lomort D'Arso,"

129
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,120
 which I like the idea that the first

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,400
 novel written in English has a French title.

131
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,640
 [LAUGHTER]

132
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
 So I think it's actually this novel written in 1561

133
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
 called "Beware the Cat."

134
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,080
 [LAUGHTER]

135
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
 I think the main content of the first novel

136
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
 written in English is just by a printer's assistant

137
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,240
 called William Baldwin.

138
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,800
 It's kind of a horror novel about evil cats, really.

139
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,320
 It's about this-- for this guy, Eves drops on a cat.

140
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,800
 And he overhears a female cat on trial.

141
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,880
 And the female cat's called "Mal Slayer,"

142
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,960
 for obvious reasons.

143
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,160
 And she's having to explain to this court of other cats

144
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,960
 that she hasn't broken the cat's code of sexual conduct,

145
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,200
 which dictates that a female cat is not

146
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
 allowed to say no to any fewer than 10 male cats a night.

147
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
 So if you reject, you know, the 10th guy,

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,480
 you're up in court on trial.

149
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,520
 Anyway, here's over his list.

150
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
 Another point in this story, this first novel ever written,

151
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
 a priest slips on a cat and falls into a crowd.

152
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,840
 [LAUGHTER]

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

154
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,280
 Does he slip on the hat?

155
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,000
 Or does he slip on the hat?

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,840
 A cat!

157
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,840
 Oh, sorry.

158
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
 [LAUGHTER]

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,920
 He slipped on the hat.

160
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
 Sorry.

161
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,520
 And it's going to be Googling a book called

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
 "Be Where Are The Hats?"

163
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,840
 No, no, no, no, no.

164
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
 Oh, wait.

165
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,320
 What are these guys doing?

166
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,760
 Cats on trial.

167
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,280
 His priest does slip on it.

168
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,600
 And he ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy

169
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
 who out of fear.

170
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,280
 What?

171
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
 What kind of an excuse is that?

172
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,280
 I slipped on a cat's face.

173
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,720
 I mean, they were the 15th century governor of banana skins.

174
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,200
 Ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy who

175
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
 out of fear had to be shit himself.

176
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,400
 [LAUGHTER]

177
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,040
 First novel.

178
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,520
 Wow.

179
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,080
 Wow.

180
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,280
 That's the first novel.

181
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,480
 That is the first novel in English.

182
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,000
 Wow.

183
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,480
 Yeah.

184
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,920
 So I was seeing what was happening in Europe

185
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,480
 at the same time as this book was being written,

186
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,680
 this Japanese one.

187
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,320
 And in 1008, Bishop Birchard of Worms

188
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,200
 was writing books on canon law, a book

189
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,040
 that he called "Corrector et medicus."

190
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,800
 And the idea was he would give it to the bishops

191
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,440
 and give it to the priests, and it would give them

192
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,440
 the rules of the penance that they would give out to people.

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,640
 So if he did something wrong, it would be like Five Hail

194
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,760
 Mary's, or whatever.

195
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,800
 But quite a lot of it seems to be very strange.

196
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,440
 One of the things was, if a woman had smothered a live fish

197
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,560
 inside her vagina, and then served it to men,

198
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,400
 or a classic prank, I really got it

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,240
 with the old vagina fish tonight.

200
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,280
 He won't put cling film under my toilet again.

201
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:40,640
 Either that or needing bread on her naked buttocks,

202
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,240
 then she would get a penance of two to five years

203
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,400
 fasting on feast days according to this book.

204
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,560
 So we were on endings of books earlier.

205
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,840
 So the first version of Hamlet has a happy ending, which

206
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,880
 is nice.

207
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,280
 And it's called Amleth, which is Hamlet

208
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,160
 with the h at the other end.

209
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,640
 That's the soul change.

210
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
 It does move the h.

211
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,520
 Was that some kind of like copyright or bad news with him?

212
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
 We can't do anything with Amleth.

213
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
 Wait a minute.

214
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,800
 And it's the same.

215
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,080
 And it's right down to stabbing someone

216
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
 who's hiding behind an aris, all of that stuff.

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
 But then, at the end of it, he

218
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,160
 kills the usurper, so his father's brother, his uncle.

219
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,760
 Killed the usurper, goes to England,

220
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,760
 marries the sexy queen of Scots, returns with an army,

221
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,000
 and then becomes king.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
 And then he has two queens, one is his wife,

223
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,120
 and one is his mother, who was queen before.

224
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
 Wow.

225
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,520
 That's how it ends originally.

226
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,240
 I think they should redo it like that.

227
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:37,760
 Do we have it?

228
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,760
 Or we've just heard that it exists?

229
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,240
 I don't know.

230
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,160
 It's just about authors who sort of came up with something

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,640
 and then flipped into something else.

232
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,760
 Do you know how fear and loathing in Las Vegas started?

233
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,600
 Huntress Thompson's book.

234
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
 It was meant to be--

235
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
 and this is what he handed in when he handed in the majority

236
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,480
 of the book.

237
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,560
 It was actually originally meant to be a 250-word photo

238
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
 caption for sports illustrator.

239
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
 They wanted him to go cover a derby, and he started writing.

240
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,840
 And they were like, it's great.

241
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,640
 But we kind of needed a fit in here.

242
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,120
 Can you say the same stuff, but in there?

243
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,640
 Wow.

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,240
 That's amazing.

245
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,920
 What do they say?

246
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,800
 Bad news.

247
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,200
 We can't put that below as a caption.

248
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,560
 So we've had to just give you a book deal instead.

249
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,120
 No, no, no.

250
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,200
 They didn't like it at all, and he had to take it elsewhere.

251
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,680
 And of course they didn't like it at all.

252
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,200
 Read the mail online articles, and there's

253
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,320
 a one-line description of the photo.

254
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,600
 So and so turned up at a party looking nice.

255
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,480
 You don't want a 60,000-word novel there.

256
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
 OK, why don't we move on to our second fact,

257
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,680
 and that is James.

258
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,400
 OK, my fact this week is that JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis

259
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,280
 went to a party dressed as Polar Bears.

260
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
 It was not a fancy dress party.

261
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,800
 And then there's the average shame of turning up

262
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,000
 in the same thing as somebody else.

263
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,920
 So Tolkien and Lewis, they were really good friends, of course.

264
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,360
 Well, not always.

265
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
 No, not always.

266
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
 You'll probably get onto that in a few seconds.

267
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
 No, no, please.

268
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,440
 Sorry, do we know the circumstances of a fancy dress party?

269
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,440
 Or is that just amazing?

270
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,560
 No, really, it seems to-- I read it in a book.

271
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,080
 It was a biography of Tolkien.

272
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,560
 And it was like, here's one of the funny things

273
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,800
 that he used to do.

274
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,480
 He used to do that.

275
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,280
 He used to do that.

276
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,000
 Yeah, I know.

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,240
 But he used to like dressing up a lot.

278
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,160
 Yeah, he-- and not even when it was an fancy dress party,

279
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,600
 just in day-to-day life, really.

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,200
 Yeah, yeah.

281
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,960
 He apparently very famously dressed up

282
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,320
 as an axe-wielding Anglo-Saxon warrior

283
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,720
 and chased his neighbor down the road.

284
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,280
 So after they met for the very first time,

285
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,400
 C.S. Lewis wrote in his diary about Tolkien,

286
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,280
 "No harm in him.

287
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,960
 Only needs a smack or so."

288
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,040
 So they did-- they were very good friends for a long time.

289
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,960
 And then they had a rival relator.

290
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,400
 Tolkien, eventually, they had meetings

291
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,880
 of a group called The Inclins, which

292
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,040
 is a sort of famous literary salon in a pub in Oxford.

293
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,360
 And they would read out their stuff to each other.

294
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,920
 And eventually, Tolkien didn't even

295
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,760
 go along to meetings when he knew that C.S. Lewis

296
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,600
 was going to read out Narnia's stuff.

297
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,680
 That's how bad it got.

298
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,880
 He really did lie the allegory in Narnia.

299
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,080
 He said that writing an allegory, which Narnia--

300
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,600
 a lot of people say it is.

301
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,680
 Yeah, I think it is.

302
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,200
 He said that allegory was a very lazy form of writing,

303
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
 and he didn't really approve of it.

304
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,520
 So that's what it was.

305
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,040
 One of the things that The Inclins did

306
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,520
 is they would hold competitions

307
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,840
 to see who could read a particular lady's work without laughing.

308
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
 She was the worst writer.

309
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,760
 What?

310
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,560
 In the world.

311
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,840
 Was this a particular writer, or just

312
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,160
 did they find any woman awful?

313
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,680
 Oh, great.

314
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,520
 Look, because the lady said it.

315
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,120
 It just sounded like they were all massive sects.

316
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
 Yeah, it's true.

317
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,880
 It did sound like that.

318
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,360
 It still sounds pretty good.

319
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,760
 It does sound like that.

320
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,480
 So this lady was called Amanda McKittrick-Ross.

321
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,640
 She wrote lots of fiction, and here's

322
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,360
 some examples of things that she said.

323
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,920
 She refers to eyes as globes of glare.

324
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,440
 She refers to legs as bony supports.

325
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,000
 And she refers to pants as southern necessity.

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
 Well, that one's got assamence.

327
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,920
 The first one had litteration.

328
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,200
 I mean, this is like ticking all the literary boxes,

329
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
 as far as I can tell.

330
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,880
 OK.

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,400
 She called sweat globules of liquid lava.

332
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,240
 Lovely.

333
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,080
 That's great.

334
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,720
 This is a down good, similarly.

335
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,480
 OK.

336
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,200
 I'll be right there, so I'm not going to be sorry.

337
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
 One of the main reason--

338
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,440
 but I think the main reason actually

339
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,640
 is that Tolkien objected to C.S. Moses' allegory.

340
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
 And I just think this is quite interesting.

341
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,880
 It's not funny at all.

342
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,760
 But Tolkien was a strict Catholic.

343
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,200
 And he-- so for instance, when they started at the start

344
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,800
 of the 20th century, even in Catholic mass,

345
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,320
 they would start saying that in English,

346
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,360
 he would say the mass very loudly

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,560
 and let in in the middle of church.

348
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,920
 Well, they were saying in English to make clear his thoughts.

349
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,040
 But he didn't object.

350
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,680
 So C.S. Moses was an Anglican, so Tolkien--

351
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,240
 so he didn't really believe that the word of God

352
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
 should only be spoken through like priests and members

353
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,760
 of the clergy, whereas Tolkien did.

354
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,000
 So Tolkien thought that it wasn't C.S. Lewis's place

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
 to be telling people about religion,

356
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,000
 because he wasn't members of the clergy.

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,760
 It was just, you know, it was quite interesting.

358
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,040
 Also, Lewis nominated Tolkien for the Nobel Prize

359
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,360
 for Literature in 1961, and the committee rejected him.

360
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,760
 And they only recently have released the papers,

361
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
 which-- because they have a sort of 50-year rule

362
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,360
 on the committee's decisions.

363
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,480
 And they rejected Tolkien, saying that he was a bad storyteller.

364
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,640
 No, they said the storytelling area just

365
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,520
 not up to scratch.

366
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,880
 Wow.

367
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,240
 Yeah, cool.

368
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,400
 You know that Lord of the Rings--

369
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,280
 I don't know if this is really common knowledge,

370
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,320
 but the Beatles tried to option it to make it into a movie,

371
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,560
 and they approached Stanley Kubrick to make it.

372
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,680
 And what?

373
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,360
 I think everyone decided it was a bad idea.

374
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,280
 Once they all saw-- yeah, but--

375
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,240
 Yeah, that would have been amazing.

376
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
 They were going to play all the characters.

377
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
 They were going to play all the characters.

378
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
 We were going to play all the characters.

379
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
 The Beatles, Lord of the Rings.

380
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,080
 It would have been amazing.

381
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,520
 I think quite red is-- like, there are so many theories

382
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,600
 about why it was rejected.

383
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,080
 And I don't even know why they used to be a theory.

384
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,880
 It's quite obvious.

385
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,880
 But--

386
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,720
 We're going to do it.

387
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,880
 And then they were like, no, he's such a terrible writer.

388
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
 We love the Beatles.

389
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
 We love Kubrick and the Beatles.

390
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
 But you know--

391
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,760
 The top thing thing.

392
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,480
 I read one theory that it was because Paul and John were fighting

393
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,000
 over who got to play Gander.

394
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,360
 [LAUGHTER]

395
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,080
 Yeah, that was what a tourer did part of it.

396
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,640
 That's great.

397
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,320
 Some things on fancy dress.

398
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,840
 Yeah.

399
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,960
 Oh, we're here.

400
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,000
 There's a lady called Sharnie Christy, who lives in Kent.

401
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,600
 And she has a phobia of people in costumes,

402
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,360
 which the newspaper article called Metamphysomiophobia.

403
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,920
 And she works in theatre.

404
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,000
 [LAUGHTER]

405
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,520
 So she said, people think it's quite funny

406
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,840
 that I'm working in something that means I'm

407
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,720
 around people in costume all the time.

408
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,840
 I have to watch people get dressed in costume in order

409
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,000
 to reassure myself that I know who they are.

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,800
 So she has to watch them get changed,

411
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,560
 just so she knows it's not a fantastic excuse

412
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,400
 of being a pervert.

413
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,520
 I'm not saying that.

414
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,280
 Yeah.

415
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,080
 But also-- so she's not only got a fear of people in costume,

416
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,680
 she suddenly recognizes them as the character

417
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,320
 that they're playing.

418
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:27,840
 Yes.

419
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,080
 So she's like at the Lion King.

420
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,080
 She'll be like, hey, Mike, have a good Symbol.

421
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,440
 Let's evacuate to this.

422
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
 There's a Lion Loan.

423
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,680
 Is that the zoo?

424
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,280
 It's me.

425
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,840
 Yes, me again.

426
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,920
 Every night for the same.

427
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
 Hello, LemonZoo.

428
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,360
 There are a lot of cats everywhere.

429
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,480
 Do you say hats?

430
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
 No, cats.

431
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:59,800
 I want to know when people started dressing

432
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
 as really crazy things.

433
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,880
 Because they used to dress as aristocracy

434
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,840
 or people from different ancient Greeks.

435
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,160
 You would dress up as ancient Greeks or Trojans.

436
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,520
 And I think I've pinned down one early date

437
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,480
 in terms of dressing as crazy things, which was 1745.

438
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,040
 King Louis the 15th of France had a masked ball at Versailles.

439
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,200
 There were 15,000 guests.

440
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,560
 And everyone was in nice dresses and with masked.

441
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
 But he and several of his goughtiers turned up dressed

442
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
 as clipped "you" hedges.

443
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,000
 [LAUGHTER]

444
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,960
 Is that you?

445
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,080
 And I think that's the year 0 for dressing as stupid stuff.

446
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,040
 And just speaking of French, fancy dress.

447
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,920
 Do you know the Charles the Fourth of France,

448
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
 the story of the dance of the burning men, actually?

449
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,560
 This was a fancy dress party.

450
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,080
 And Charles the Fourth and the load of his goughtiers

451
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,400
 came dressed as sabbages, which meant they blacked up.

452
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,440
 And they covered themselves in pitch tar

453
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,040
 and they chained themselves together.

454
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,960
 And then when they arrived at the party, one of the other guests

455
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,920
 wanted to see have a good look at their costume.

456
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,360
 So he went up to them with a naked flame.

457
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,640
 And they were all wearing pitch tar.

458
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,800
 And they were all chained together.

459
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,600
 And they all went up.

460
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,280
 And I think two people were burned alive.

461
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,520
 Two people died within days of their injuries.

462
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,120
 And it really-- like he was pretty mad to self-ly,

463
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,640
 but that really ticked him, although.

464
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,480
 Wow.

465
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,280
 Fancy dresses are dangerous games.

466
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,520
 You shouldn't do it.

467
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,680
 Americans got really into fancy dress in the 19th century,

468
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,360
 didn't they?

469
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,400
 And they would dress up as European aristocracy and wear.

470
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,800
 So it was like--

471
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,720
 I think the general consensus is, because people weren't

472
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,800
 really doing it in Europe.

473
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,880
 The America didn't really have at that time

474
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720
 an aristocracy or a history of its own in terms of--

475
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,200
 you know, it didn't have a great nebility.

476
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,880
 It didn't have all these big families.

477
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,120
 And so it kind of-- what was the quote?

478
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,960
 It bought its own history.

479
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,160
 And so people would buy, like Mary Antoinette's,

480
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,320
 genuine jewels and costumes, and then go wearing them to parties.

481
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,520
 And you'd go to a party with like 1,200 guests,

482
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,680
 like the Vanderbilties to hold these amazing parties

483
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
 in the 19th century.

484
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
 And it would be a competition as to who

485
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,720
 had the most genuine artefacts that

486
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,920
 used to belong to a great British king or a great friend

487
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,280
 ruler or--

488
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,120
 Yeah, so it used to be a bigger deal than just buying

489
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,480
 a £10 plastic, which is costume, the local Scotland.

490
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,720
 Honebes.

491
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
 Oh, yeah.

492
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,600
 Honebes were in the original fact.

493
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,520
 That's what they were.

494
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,680
 Yeah, they dressed up as Honebes.

495
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,880
 This is just because I discovered coincidentally last week

496
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,000
 that pollution in the sea and then in the seas at the poles

497
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,320
 is contaminating various wildlife there.

498
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,040
 And Honebes' penises are getting weaker.

499
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,960
 Their penis bones are being shrunken.

500
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,640
 Well, they say that, but it is cold up there.

501
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,680
 They really don't need that expert skew.

502
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,880
 It's getting warmer though.

503
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,760
 And that's true.

504
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,040
 So the female polar bears are going, it's getting warmer.

505
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,560
 That's still nothing.

506
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,520
 Well, well, well, where is it?

507
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,560
 You've been promising me for two million years.

508
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,360
 And yet it's the pollutants.

509
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,160
 That's what they claim.

510
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880
 They don't know why quite a bit of us have penis bones,

511
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,600
 but they are getting smaller.

512
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,320
 And they think it's going to do some kind of damage.

513
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
 Most animals have penis bones, don't they?

514
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,280
 No, they don't.

515
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,280
 Most of us on this panel--

516
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,000
 Oh, most of animals have penis bones.

517
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,560
 Yes, yes.

518
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,880
 And in the Victorian times they wore badger penis bones

519
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,240
 as typums.

520
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,000
 Yeah.

521
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,760
 Have you seen a walrus penis bone?

522
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,440
 I've held one.

523
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,880
 They're extraordinary.

524
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,600
 I was thinking of the walrus at the time.

525
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:59,080
 When the walrus asks, just say no, Dan.

526
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:04,400
 I was out of fancy dress, and I was saying this was walrus.

527
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,240
 OK.

528
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,520
 Hey, very quickly, this is just to bring it back

529
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,000
 to Tolkien and CS Lewis.

530
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 CS Lewis died the same day as Aldous Hotsley.

531
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,560
 We lost two literary juggernauts that day.

532
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,120
 And it kind of really didn't register with anyone

533
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,400
 because someone else died that day, JFK.

534
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,160
 And they just completely--

535
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,520
 no one actually knows they're dead yet as a result, yeah.

536
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
 All right, so in the Guinness Book of Regals,

537
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
 we're all just writers.

538
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
 Yeah.

539
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,040
 [LAUGHTER]

540
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,360
 Hotsley in this.

541
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,920
 We need to move on because we're really

542
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,040
 running past our time here.

543
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,160
 OK, time for fact number three.

544
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,080
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

545
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,000
 My fact is about Agatha Christie.

546
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,720
 And it's that Agatha Christie thought

547
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,240
 that Hercules Poirot, her most famous creation,

548
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,320
 was a, quote, "detestable, bombastic, tiresome,

549
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,000
 egocentric little creep."

550
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,560
 She hated him from quite early on as well in her career.

551
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,680
 And she wrote an essay called Why I Got Fed Up With Poirot.

552
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,120
 And she really, really didn't like him.

553
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,360
 And she wrote his death story in 1945, which

554
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,280
 was 30 years before she died.

555
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,880
 So she wanted to write it quite early.

556
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,320
 And she left instructions that when she died,

557
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,600
 that story should be published.

558
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,800
 So she would take him down with her.

559
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,800
 Absolutely.

560
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,000
 And she even kept the manuscripts in a bank vault.

561
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 That's how much she disliked Poirot's character.

562
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,680
 And then when she was 85 with her own hell failing,

563
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,800
 she decided to publish it so that she would outlive him,

564
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,360
 I think, is what I think she wanted to do.

565
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,120
 But when she did publish the story,

566
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,800
 Poirot got a front page obituary in The New York Times,

567
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,680
 which I think is, might be, even more than she got.

568
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,720
 So really?

569
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,880
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

570
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,120
 I don't know why she was role news day, isn't it?

571
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,840
 It's the only fictional obituary they've ever published.

572
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,360
 Yeah.

573
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:02,160
 And so even in death, he was really, really famous.

574
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,920
 And she couldn't get away to properly block him on the head.

575
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,360
 Was it from page of the obituary section?

576
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:08,960
 Nope.

577
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,800
 It was from page of the paper.

578
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,680
 Of the paper.

579
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,200
 Yeah.

580
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
 Jesus.

581
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,600
 We say they're dumbing down today.

582
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,360
 That's what I was talking about.

583
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,160
 It is weird when you hear authors hating

584
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,600
 those central characters.

585
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
 Yeah.

586
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,960
 When you didn't know, don't they?

587
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,120
 Who was Sherlock Holmes?

588
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,200
 Yeah, Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock.

589
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
 And then, did you hear what chaos that created

590
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,120
 when he killed off Sherlock Holmes?

591
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,720
 I've got, yeah, I found a bunch of stuff.

592
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,080
 Basically, he just got, so he killed him off.

593
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,680
 And then all these letters came in, which one began,

594
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,680
 you brute, like they just treated it as if it was real.

595
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,160
 I'm like the trolling of its day.

596
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,160
 Yeah.

597
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,800
 It's a writer letter to someone saying,

598
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
 you brute.

599
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 Yeah.

600
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,920
 A lady picketed his house, fans wore black iron bands,

601
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,920
 20,000 people canceled their subscriptions to the strand

602
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,040
 magazine, which was being published as a periodical.

603
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,400
 And yeah, and then I guess he eventually brought it back.

604
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,480
 But that must have been a confusing time.

605
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,840
 So, A.M.L. really hated Winnie the Pooh.

606
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,360
 Winnie the Pooh, yeah.

607
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,760
 That's so cruel.

608
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,760
 Everyone hated Winnie the Pooh, didn't they?

609
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
 Did they?

610
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,360
 All of its creations.

611
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,520
 A.M.L hated Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin.

612
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,720
 Yeah, he well played.

613
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 So, I mean, his life was kind of ruined by the fact

614
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,720
 that he was Christopher Robin.

615
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,160
 And he always resented, I think that's it.

616
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
 So, how was Christopher Robin, A.M.L.?

617
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
 Sun, yeah.

618
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
 Yeah, he resented that.

619
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,800
 And the guy did the illustrations, who was fine by his name,

620
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,280
 but he said, E.H. Shepherd, ruined his life as well,

621
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,440
 ruined his career, everyone defined him by Winnie the Pooh.

622
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
 Did they all have meetings where they're going,

623
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,600
 not this shit again?

624
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,600
 If only we could stop doing it somewhere.

625
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,360
 And the other thing that Mill hated about it was that it made people think

626
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
 that he liked children.

627
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,280
 And he said, I have never felt in the least sentimental about them.

628
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,000
 So, but he did have a son.

629
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,360
 Yeah, I was taking dictations and he was really into that.

630
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,200
 Take a note, it's a crap.

631
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
 And yeah, the very difficult relationship with his side,

632
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,040
 which kind of, you know, seems to be explained by this sensation.

633
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,080
 And so, one thing you can do, if you really dislike your character,

634
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,440
 this is something that Agatha Christie did.

635
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
 I love this.

636
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,480
 She put a version of herself in her own books,

637
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,080
 a mystery novelist called Ariadne Oliver.

638
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,560
 And in the novels that Agatha Christie wrote,

639
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,440
 this fictional novelist, Ariadne Oliver,

640
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,600
 hates her most famous creation,

641
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,480
 who is a vegetarian, finished detective called Sven Herson,

642
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,120
 who, and she appears in six novels,

643
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,800
 this character who hates her, her main character.

644
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,400
 And she, Oliver says, if I ever met that bony, gangling,

645
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,480
 vegetable eating fin in real life,

646
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,920
 I'd do a better murder than any I've ever invented.

647
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,640
 That's a really good idea.

648
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,840
 This is how much she'd disliked it.

649
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,160
 It's a really good idea of putting yourself in novels,

650
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,040
 and then, like, and then the guy said,

651
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,920
 oh, easy jitter, idiot, something.

652
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,160
 Everything that you're annoyed with, you could put in your book.

653
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,120
 Another person who hates your creation now is Annie Prue,

654
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,640
 who wrote, broke that mountain.

655
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,360
 Oh, yeah, because of fan fiction.

656
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,960
 So she hates the fact now.

657
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,640
 So she was like nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

658
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,720
 She wrote this brilliant short story.

659
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,480
 And she says she wish she'd never done it,

660
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,160
 because she's plagued by fan fiction now,

661
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,120
 by people writing either sequels to broke that mountain

662
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,200
 or alternative endings to broke that mountain.

663
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,520
 And she said, the vast majority of them are people

664
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,880
 who, so the majority of them are people

665
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,240
 who start their letters with, I'm not gay, but.

666
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,600
 [LAUGHTER]

667
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
 And then go on to give an alternative ending,

668
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,520
 by the two male characters then, up together.

669
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,200
 I've written an intense searing homo-erotic series of, yeah, yeah.

670
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,600
 And I've never written anything before in my life.

671
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
 And that's not the point-- yeah, yeah.

672
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,640
 It's not weird.

673
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,160
 Oh, yeah.

674
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,040
 It's just every day, I'm more homo-erotic

675
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,000
 than to different people saying they're not gay.

676
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,960
 But it does-- yeah, there are, I think,

677
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,280
 more than 100 sequels to Pride and Prejudice.

678
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,560
 And obviously, it's been 200 years, so there's a lot.

679
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,960
 But in one of them, Elizabeth Darcy, as she becomes,

680
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,800
 is widowed, Darcy is dead.

681
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,480
 And then she has to defend England from invasion

682
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,000
 by Napoleon in a fleet of hot air balloons.

683
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,360
 And I've never tracked down this book.

684
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,600
 But if I do, I am reading the hell out of it.

685
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,800
 It sounds so good.

686
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
 [LAUGHTER]

687
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,240
 And we need to move on, guys, by the way.

688
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,040
 But if anyone-- does anyone have anything else?

689
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,240
 Nothing that's short enough.

690
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,480
 I've got-- I've got-- I've just one last thing, which

691
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 is I really like when, as you're saying,

692
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,640
 Poirot goes on the front page of newspapers.

693
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,920
 I love it when these characters seep into the real world.

694
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,240
 And there's a thing I read that, which is The Met.

695
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,840
 And all crime departments in Britain, or the police,

696
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,760
 they use a national computer system, which

697
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,560
 is developed, basically, for major crime inquiries.

698
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,840
 All the British forces use it.

699
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,640
 And it's called the Home Office Large Major Inquiry System.

700
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,240
 But everyone refers to it by acronym Homes.

701
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,320
 So quite nice.

702
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,400
 And there, as well, is a training program

703
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,960
 for it called Elementary.

704
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,360
 Should we move on to the final?

705
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,520
 Yeah, yeah.

706
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 OK.

707
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,560
 Time for our final fact of the show.

708
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,200
 And that is my fact.

709
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,040
 So we've been talking about books this whole time.

710
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,680
 So I thought I'd find a fact, which

711
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,920
 was about the enemy of the books, the television.

712
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,720
 So my fact is that before he invented the television,

713
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,640
 John Logie Baird invented a pair of socks

714
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
 to wear underneath your socks.

715
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,120
 [LAUGHTER]

716
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,160
 And who can say which history will judge the greater invention?

717
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,800
 I'm not calling it.

718
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,840
 I just-- I love that fact, because I just think that's--

719
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,960
 because if you look at the history of his inventions,

720
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,880
 as well, prior to the television, he invented, as well,

721
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,880
 a razor, which was rust proof.

722
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,760
 You could never make it rust, but it never ended up selling

723
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,240
 because it was made of glass, and it shattered on people's

724
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,440
 basis and ended up passing it.

725
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
 OK.

726
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,360
 He made a glass razor.

727
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,160
 It doesn't rust, but it slices your face off.

728
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,440
 It slices your face off, yeah.

729
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,000
 He made some pneumatic shoes that had balloons in them

730
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,120
 that he thought they'd pull your feet off.

731
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,760
 But just that's his history.

732
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,040
 And then suddenly, the television, it just makes no sense.

733
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,800
 But the socks were actually quite good, wasn't they?

734
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,440
 They were amazing.

735
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,240
 Yeah, how did they work?

736
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,440
 So they're not designed to protect against moisture

737
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,480
 from the outside.

738
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,920
 It's the moisture that your feet create

739
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,000
 when you're walking around the day.

740
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
 So they were for soldiers in the First World War,

741
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,880
 and they're sprinkled with a chemical called Borax,

742
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,120
 which absorbs the moisture from your foot.

743
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,240
 So you put it under your foot, facing upwards as a way.

744
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,520
 You put it on that way, then you put your sock over that,

745
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,760
 then your shoe over that.

746
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,760
 And soldiers in the trenches swore by it,

747
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,040
 and it made him a huge amount of money.

748
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,920
 It's what let him resign his job as an electrical engineer.

749
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
 Yeah.

750
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,520
 One soldier said, I find the bird on the socks

751
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,200
 keep my feet in splendid condition out here in France.

752
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,080
 Foot trouble is one of our worst enemies,

753
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,040
 but thanks to the bird on the sock,

754
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,440
 mine are in the pink.

755
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,280
 Now, we can just make an anti-jermen sock

756
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,920
 then put my father worst enemy in my house.

757
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,320
 [LAUGHTER]

758
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,680
 It's a joke.

759
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,040
 It does rather, yeah, the worst enemy being foot trouble is.

760
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,360
 That's a sense of letter.

761
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,080
 I would have changed it.

762
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,560
 And through the officers.

763
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,200
 But he advertised them in the newspaper

764
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,720
 and managed to sell one pair doing that.

765
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,800
 So initially it was a complete failure.

766
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,280
 And then he built a plywood tank

767
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,800
 and carried it around the streets of Glasgow

768
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,240
 with the bed under sock written on the side.

769
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,600
 And then he sold loads.

770
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,120
 Yeah.

771
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,680
 This was during the war, though, wasn't it?

772
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,880
 So like, a big tank going through the streets

773
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,360
 you got down through in the war.

774
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,600
 People look at scary.

775
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,840
 So he made these socks, and then he got ill for a while, didn't he?

776
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,560
 And then when he got better, he suddenly

777
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,480
 realized he had loads of money in his account

778
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,120
 because people had bought all these socks.

779
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:58,680
 Will he win us?

780
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,200
 That's what he was.

781
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,520
 Didn't he go away?

782
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,400
 Oh, gone away.

783
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,680
 But when he got all this money, he went to Trinidad.

784
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,520
 And he started up a jam factory.

785
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,680
 Unfortunately, the local insect life either ran off with the sugar

786
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,800
 or landed in the hot fats and boiling preserve.

787
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,400
 Wow.

788
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,320
 I think I read.

789
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,240
 And so it never took off, because it was just insects.

790
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,040
 Just full of insects.

791
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,280
 And so he lost a bit of money from that and then came back.

792
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,560
 And then it was when he invented television.

793
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,680
 When he came back before inventing television,

794
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,800
 he had the sock business and the--

795
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,560
 The razor?

796
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,000
 The jam and the razor.

797
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,240
 And he then had 200 quid left.

798
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,640
 He was really broke.

799
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,920
 So he decided to buy two tons of Australian honey, cheap,

800
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,760
 and selling it for people.

801
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,720
 And then he bought a ton of soap and he sold that.

802
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,240
 Wow.

803
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
 And then television.

804
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,720
 Complete out of no way.

805
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,840
 To be fair, the television thing was something

806
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,960
 that he really dreamed about making quite early on.

807
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,880
 And he couldn't do it.

808
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,160
 So he had all these other businesses that went along the way.

809
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,960
 So they were just kind of maybe a smoke screen.

810
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,400
 There's other inventions to throw people off the sand.

811
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,760
 They absolutely were in that, as well as when he would just

812
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,280
 make these other things.

813
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,800
 When he was making the TV, any time he had a photo

814
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,280
 where he was showing how he was making the TV,

815
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,080
 he would put in fake objects.

816
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,240
 So that no one who saw the photo could go, OK,

817
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,400
 so he's got that and got that.

818
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
 So he would misplace.

819
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

820
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,000
 He was so unique.

821
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,680
 OK, so it looks like he needs two tons of cheap Australian

822
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,920
 honey to get the TV to work.

823
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,120
 How has he done that?

824
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
 Where did the socks go?

825
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:38,960
 I don't know.

826
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,000
 He was saying about the electricity.

827
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,880
 When he was working in Glasgow, he decided

828
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,800
 to try and make artificial diamonds

829
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,400
 by passing electricity through a stick of graphite.

830
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,320
 And he put so much electricity through the stick of graphite

831
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,240
 that he caused a blackout over the whole of Glasgow.

832
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,760
 Wow.

833
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
 There's a weird coincidence in his life, as well.

834
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,960
 Just one of those tiny things that's actually--

835
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,120
 it's quite nice when you discover it.

836
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,840
 He went to school with a guy who was called--

837
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
 so this was his classmate.

838
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,920
 This is his actual classmate.

839
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,440
 He went to school with a guy called J.C.W. Rief,

840
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,120
 who we now know as Lord Rief.

841
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,520
 So basically, the inventor of the television

842
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,280
 went to school with the man who defined television

843
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,080
 for the BBC in England.

844
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,240
 That's an absolutely insane coincidence.

845
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,520
 And he got bullied by Lord Rief all the time.

846
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,880
 He just bullied the hell out of him.

847
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,080
 And Lord Rief's parents had to pull him out of school

848
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,600
 because he was just too much of a menace in that school.

849
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,880
 Wow, really?

850
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,280
 Lord Rief was a bit of a--

851
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,400
 He was a bully, yeah.

852
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
 Yeah, it's amazing.

853
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,880
 That's a jolly good thing.

854
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,880
 I'll get back at him.

855
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,040
 I'll invent something that's so good.

856
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,280
 He won't ever be able to take part in it.

857
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,360
 He'll have nothing.

858
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,520
 I've read-- I cannot believe this is true.

859
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,680
 That originally, when the BBC sent out experimental

860
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,920
 transmissions, which was in 1929, that John Lugabaird

861
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,160
 had to pay the BBC to transmit his images.

862
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,680
 Right, he's just so topsy to--

863
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,720
 Or be cut, yeah, but like Lord Rief.

864
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,520
 For as much as he's done for TV--

865
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,960
 and if you haven't heard the name Lord Rief,

866
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,480
 in this country, most people have him assuming.

867
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,520
 He's the guy who absolutely defined how

868
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,280
 BBC became the thing that it is.

869
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,720
 He hated television.

870
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,840
 Yeah, of course he did.

871
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,200
 Yeah, as you know, we know Baird, isn't it?

872
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,880
 His salary was £5,000 and a mean wedgie.

873
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 [LAUGHTER]

874
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,040
 Just on author's early inventions and early careers,

875
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,520
 before they did the thing that we know them for,

876
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,720
 can I tell you very quickly about Daniel DeFoe?

877
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,400
 Yes, please.

878
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,080
 OK, his early jobs--

879
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,320
 and obviously Robinson Crusoe and the general of the plague

880
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,480
 gear, all these incredible works.

881
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,160
 Before that, his early jobs included selling hosiery,

882
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,960
 dealing wine, investing in a diving bell

883
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,720
 to recover sunken treasure, and harvesting

884
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,040
 musk from the anal glands of cats.

885
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,520
 Did she say hats?

886
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,280
 No.

887
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 No.

888
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,080
 No.

889
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,080
 [LAUGHTER]

890
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,080
 It really happened with this.

891
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,600
 In 1692, he bought 70 civic cats, but 850 quid,

892
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,720
 because the Dutch made perfume using the musk, which

893
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,080
 they secrete as the base ingredient.

894
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,600
 And he hated them.

895
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,480
 And then to get the musk, an attendant

896
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,680
 had to put them in a special cage so they could only face one

897
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:29,880
 way.

898
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,280
 They couldn't turn around.

899
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,320
 And then, I'm quoting here, I used a spatula

900
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,760
 to scrape out the butter-like secretion

901
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,160
 that gathered in a pouch between the tail and the anus.

902
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,280
 And then he lost the cats, because he didn't even own them.

903
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,680
 He didn't taste them properly.

904
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,720
 He got them more money by borrowing it.

905
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,520
 And then, to keep them, he defrauded his own mothering

906
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,960
 law, who then sued him, like he was a disaster.

907
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,160
 But that was his-- yeah.

908
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,200
 So whose cat-- they were just wandering cats?

909
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,000
 No, they were owned by someone else.

910
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,320
 And he bought them with borrowed money.

911
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
 And then someone else said, no, I want my cats back.

912
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,360
 You can use them, but you don't own them.

913
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,000
 And also, where's their anal butter?

914
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
 [LAUGHTER]

915
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,640
 We've been stealing that.

916
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
 I can't believe it's not civic cat-able butter.

917
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,720
 [LAUGHTER]

918
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:25,200
 We're going to have to wrap up.

919
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
 OK, that's it.

920
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,360
 That's all of our facts.

921
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,000
