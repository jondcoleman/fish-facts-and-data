00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:23.080
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.520
 And no such thing as a fish this week coming to you

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.160
 from the hay festival in hay.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.280
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.040
 I'm sitting here with three other QILs.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 It's Anit Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.440
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.880
 And in a particular order, here we go.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.800
 Starting with you, Chazinski.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 Yes, did you imagine that these are specifically

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.560
 literary facts?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 Absolutely.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160
 You did mention it.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.120
 Yeah, because it's a literary festival, right?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.080
 And that's why I said it.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.520
 That's why I thought you said it.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.800
 So my literary fact is that the first ever novel

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.040
 ended mid-sentence.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.800
 And this is a Japanese novel called The Tale of Genji.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.440
 It was written in the early 11th century.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.040
 So probably 1008, I think.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.160
 And yeah, ended in the middle of a sentence.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.600
 Was it like a cliffhanger ending?

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.360
 Kind of.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.600
 I mean, not as melodramatic, but she's

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.280
 a character that's introducing another to character

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.240
 someone, and the end saying, caroo introduces him

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.480
 to the, you never find out who.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.040
 And people don't know if that was intentional,

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.840
 or if she just died in the middle of gay guy.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 We've got bored of it.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.720
 I think most critics think that it was intentional.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.800
 I heard another version, which is like,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.960
 she just carried on.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.800
 She was going to carry on a carry on until she couldn't

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.640
 do it anymore.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520
 Because there's quite a lot of book, isn't it?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.560
 Yeah, I think it's about 1100 pages.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.560
 Yeah, 1100 pages.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.080
 Yeah.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.400
 Apparently, there's like 400 characters in there.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 Yeah.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560
 And none of them have names.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.040
 No, none of them have names.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.960
 I read in one-- how do you do that?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.760
 Well, yeah, it must have been so confusing.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.720
 So there are 400 characters.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.160
 And apparently, at the time, it was rude in Japanese.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.880
 It's all about Japanese aristocratic society

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.800
 in the 12th century.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.760
 And it was rude to refer to someone by name,

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.000
 because it was thought as being unnecessarily familiar.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
 So if a 400 characters, none of them

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.120
 would have to be referred to by name.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.600
 So they're all like your ex-an-see, your majesty,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.320
 his highness.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.200
 Oh, so they still have titles, OK.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.800
 Yeah, but I mean, there are 75 his highnesses.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
 What's the way so it'd be like, oh, what's he doing here?

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.720
 It said him, the key knew what he meant about him.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.560
 That's a very cool way to end it.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.520
 I like it.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.520
 Yeah, it is.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.280
 So she's a bit like a pre-curse of Tristan Jandit.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.280
 She seemed to have interesting things

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 she did with the form of the Nuffel.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.600
 Look at the form of the Nuffel, which she just invented.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.120
 It's a really bold new kind of novel, actually.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.240
 She defied the convention that she created 400 pages earlier.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.320
 Bye.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.160
 There's one bit.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.440
 So two thousand of the way through she

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.920
 killed off the main character about whom

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 the whole thing is written, the tale of Genji, just dies.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.280
 And also, it doesn't really explain.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.320
 He's been killed off.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.120
 It's just that there's a blank chapter

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.160
 called "Vanished Into the Clouds" with no text in it.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.760
 And then in the next chapter, it becomes apparent

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.320
 that the protagonist has died.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320
 Wow.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.120
 Yeah.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.520
 Does anyone know what the first e-book was?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.040
 No.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.120
 That's a thing where it's like there's a few different claims,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.440
 but probably the most likely was a book called "Uncle Roger"

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.840
 by Judy Malai.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.960
 And you can still see it online.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.600
 It's like all hyperlinked.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.920
 And you go in there, and it's like there's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.560
 been a party, and it has all the characters.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.560
 You can click on the character, and it gives you

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.320
 their little story.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.040
 And then you click on the next character, and you do that.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.800
 It's like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" books,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.560
 those things that they use to have.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.600
 They were amazing those books, but they used to be.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 So good.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.000
 And so reading that this was like "Choose Your Own Adventure"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640
 I thought I'd look into those.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.360
 And apparently you can get adults to choose

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.440
 your own adventure books.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.480
 Oh God.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.760
 Yeah.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.800
 And the two best sellers that I could find

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.240
 are called "Beer, Women, and Bad Decisions."

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.360
 That's great.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.400
 So it's good, doesn't it?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.920
 It sounds like you're going to try and get the bad decisions.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.560
 Yeah, it's like another point, or a position tonight.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.160
 That haven't worked.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560
 That's how most nights work.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.440
 And the other best selling one I found

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.000
 is called "Night of a Thousand Boy Friends."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080
 Night with a K.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.680
 Oh.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.400
 So the first novel in the English language

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.080
 is obviously a different thing, because the tale of Genji

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.440
 is not in English.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.800
 People often say it's Thomas Mallory's "Lomort D'Arso,"

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.120
 which I like the idea that the first

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.400
 novel written in English has a French title.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.640
 [LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.640
 So I think it's actually this novel written in 1561

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.960
 called "Beware the Cat."

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 I think the main content of the first novel

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.080
 written in English is just by a printer's assistant

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.240
 called William Baldwin.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.800
 It's kind of a horror novel about evil cats, really.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.320
 It's about this-- for this guy, Eves drops on a cat.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.800
 And he overhears a female cat on trial.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.880
 And the female cat's called "Mal Slayer,"

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.960
 for obvious reasons.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.160
 And she's having to explain to this court of other cats

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.960
 that she hasn't broken the cat's code of sexual conduct,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.200
 which dictates that a female cat is not

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.880
 allowed to say no to any fewer than 10 male cats a night.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.240
 So if you reject, you know, the 10th guy,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.480
 you're up in court on trial.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.520
 Anyway, here's over his list.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.520
 Another point in this story, this first novel ever written,

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 a priest slips on a cat and falls into a crowd.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.680
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.280
 Does he slip on the hat?

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.000
 Or does he slip on the hat?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.840
 A cat!

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.840
 Oh, sorry.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.920
 He slipped on the hat.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:57.920
 Sorry.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.520
 And it's going to be Googling a book called

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520
 "Be Where Are The Hats?"

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.840
 No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840
 Oh, wait.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.320
 What are these guys doing?

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.760
 Cats on trial.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.280
 His priest does slip on it.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.600
 And he ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.440
 who out of fear.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.280
 What?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.800
 What kind of an excuse is that?

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.280
 I slipped on a cat's face.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.720
 I mean, they were the 15th century governor of banana skins.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.200
 Ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy who

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.200
 out of fear had to be shit himself.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.400
 [LAUGHTER]

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.040
 First novel.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.520
 Wow.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.080
 Wow.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.280
 That's the first novel.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.480
 That is the first novel in English.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.000
 Wow.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.480
 Yeah.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.920
 So I was seeing what was happening in Europe

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.480
 at the same time as this book was being written,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.680
 this Japanese one.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.320
 And in 1008, Bishop Birchard of Worms

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.200
 was writing books on canon law, a book

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.040
 that he called "Corrector et medicus."

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.800
 And the idea was he would give it to the bishops

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.440
 and give it to the priests, and it would give them

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.440
 the rules of the penance that they would give out to people.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.640
 So if he did something wrong, it would be like Five Hail

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.760
 Mary's, or whatever.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.800
 But quite a lot of it seems to be very strange.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.440
 One of the things was, if a woman had smothered a live fish

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.560
 inside her vagina, and then served it to men,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.400
 or a classic prank, I really got it

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.240
 with the old vagina fish tonight.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.280
 He won't put cling film under my toilet again.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:40.640
 Either that or needing bread on her naked buttocks,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.240
 then she would get a penance of two to five years

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.400
 fasting on feast days according to this book.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.560
 So we were on endings of books earlier.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.840
 So the first version of Hamlet has a happy ending, which

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.880
 is nice.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.280
 And it's called Amleth, which is Hamlet

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160
 with the h at the other end.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.640
 That's the soul change.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.640
 It does move the h.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.520
 Was that some kind of like copyright or bad news with him?

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.320
 We can't do anything with Amleth.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.040
 Wait a minute.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.800
 And it's the same.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.080
 And it's right down to stabbing someone

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.120
 who's hiding behind an aris, all of that stuff.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120
 But then, at the end of it, he

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:22.160
 kills the usurper, so his father's brother, his uncle.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.760
 Killed the usurper, goes to England,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.760
 marries the sexy queen of Scots, returns with an army,

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.000
 and then becomes king.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.240
 And then he has two queens, one is his wife,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.120
 and one is his mother, who was queen before.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.120
 Wow.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.520
 That's how it ends originally.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.240
 I think they should redo it like that.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.760
 Do we have it?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.760
 Or we've just heard that it exists?

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.240
 I don't know.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:46.160
 It's just about authors who sort of came up with something

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.640
 and then flipped into something else.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.760
 Do you know how fear and loathing in Las Vegas started?

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.600
 Huntress Thompson's book.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.240
 It was meant to be--

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.880
 and this is what he handed in when he handed in the majority

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.480
 of the book.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.560
 It was actually originally meant to be a 250-word photo

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.320
 caption for sports illustrator.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.320
 They wanted him to go cover a derby, and he started writing.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.840
 And they were like, it's great.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.640
 But we kind of needed a fit in here.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.120
 Can you say the same stuff, but in there?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.640
 Wow.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.240
 That's amazing.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:17.920
 What do they say?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.800
 Bad news.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.200
 We can't put that below as a caption.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.560
 So we've had to just give you a book deal instead.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.120
 No, no, no.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.200
 They didn't like it at all, and he had to take it elsewhere.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.680
 And of course they didn't like it at all.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.200
 Read the mail online articles, and there's

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.320
 a one-line description of the photo.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.600
 So and so turned up at a party looking nice.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.480
 You don't want a 60,000-word novel there.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.880
 OK, why don't we move on to our second fact,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.680
 and that is James.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.400
 OK, my fact this week is that JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.280
 went to a party dressed as Polar Bears.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.280
 It was not a fancy dress party.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.800
 And then there's the average shame of turning up

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.000
 in the same thing as somebody else.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.920
 So Tolkien and Lewis, they were really good friends, of course.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.360
 Well, not always.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.200
 No, not always.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.720
 You'll probably get onto that in a few seconds.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720
 No, no, please.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.440
 Sorry, do we know the circumstances of a fancy dress party?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.440
 Or is that just amazing?

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.560
 No, really, it seems to-- I read it in a book.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.080
 It was a biography of Tolkien.

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.560
 And it was like, here's one of the funny things

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.800
 that he used to do.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.480
 He used to do that.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.280
 He used to do that.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.000
 Yeah, I know.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.240
 But he used to like dressing up a lot.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.160
 Yeah, he-- and not even when it was an fancy dress party,

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.600
 just in day-to-day life, really.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.960
 He apparently very famously dressed up

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.320
 as an axe-wielding Anglo-Saxon warrior

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.720
 and chased his neighbor down the road.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.280
 So after they met for the very first time,

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.400
 C.S. Lewis wrote in his diary about Tolkien,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.280
 "No harm in him.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.960
 Only needs a smack or so."

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.040
 So they did-- they were very good friends for a long time.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.960
 And then they had a rival relator.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.400
 Tolkien, eventually, they had meetings

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.880
 of a group called The Inclins, which

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.040
 is a sort of famous literary salon in a pub in Oxford.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.360
 And they would read out their stuff to each other.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.920
 And eventually, Tolkien didn't even

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.760
 go along to meetings when he knew that C.S. Lewis

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.600
 was going to read out Narnia's stuff.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.680
 That's how bad it got.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.880
 He really did lie the allegory in Narnia.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.080
 He said that writing an allegory, which Narnia--

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.600
 a lot of people say it is.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.680
 Yeah, I think it is.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.200
 He said that allegory was a very lazy form of writing,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.360
 and he didn't really approve of it.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.520
 So that's what it was.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.040
 One of the things that The Inclins did

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.520
 is they would hold competitions

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.840
 to see who could read a particular lady's work without laughing.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.240
 She was the worst writer.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.760
 What?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.560
 In the world.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.840
 Was this a particular writer, or just

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.160
 did they find any woman awful?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:43.680
 Oh, great.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.520
 Look, because the lady said it.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.120
 It just sounded like they were all massive sects.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.000
 Yeah, it's true.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.880
 It did sound like that.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.360
 It still sounds pretty good.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.760
 It does sound like that.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.480
 So this lady was called Amanda McKittrick-Ross.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.640
 She wrote lots of fiction, and here's

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.360
 some examples of things that she said.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.920
 She refers to eyes as globes of glare.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.440
 She refers to legs as bony supports.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:12.000
 And she refers to pants as southern necessity.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.200
 Well, that one's got assamence.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.920
 The first one had litteration.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.200
 I mean, this is like ticking all the literary boxes,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.280
 as far as I can tell.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.880
 OK.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.400
 She called sweat globules of liquid lava.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.240
 Lovely.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.080
 That's great.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.720
 This is a down good, similarly.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.480
 OK.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:30.200
 I'll be right there, so I'm not going to be sorry.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.200
 One of the main reason--

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.440
 but I think the main reason actually

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.640
 is that Tolkien objected to C.S. Moses' allegory.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.520
 And I just think this is quite interesting.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.880
 It's not funny at all.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.760
 But Tolkien was a strict Catholic.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.200
 And he-- so for instance, when they started at the start

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.800
 of the 20th century, even in Catholic mass,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.320
 they would start saying that in English,

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.360
 he would say the mass very loudly

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.560
 and let in in the middle of church.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.920
 Well, they were saying in English to make clear his thoughts.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.040
 But he didn't object.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.680
 So C.S. Moses was an Anglican, so Tolkien--

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.240
 so he didn't really believe that the word of God

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.240
 should only be spoken through like priests and members

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.760
 of the clergy, whereas Tolkien did.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.000
 So Tolkien thought that it wasn't C.S. Lewis's place

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.160
 to be telling people about religion,

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.000
 because he wasn't members of the clergy.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.760
 It was just, you know, it was quite interesting.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:22.040
 Also, Lewis nominated Tolkien for the Nobel Prize

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.360
 for Literature in 1961, and the committee rejected him.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.760
 And they only recently have released the papers,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.760
 which-- because they have a sort of 50-year rule

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.360
 on the committee's decisions.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.480
 And they rejected Tolkien, saying that he was a bad storyteller.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.640
 No, they said the storytelling area just

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.520
 not up to scratch.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.880
 Wow.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.240
 Yeah, cool.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.400
 You know that Lord of the Rings--

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.280
 I don't know if this is really common knowledge,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.320
 but the Beatles tried to option it to make it into a movie,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.560
 and they approached Stanley Kubrick to make it.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.680
 And what?

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.360
 I think everyone decided it was a bad idea.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.280
 Once they all saw-- yeah, but--

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.240
 Yeah, that would have been amazing.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.240
 They were going to play all the characters.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
 They were going to play all the characters.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.240
 We were going to play all the characters.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.080
 The Beatles, Lord of the Rings.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080
 It would have been amazing.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.520
 I think quite red is-- like, there are so many theories

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.600
 about why it was rejected.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.080
 And I don't even know why they used to be a theory.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.880
 It's quite obvious.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.880
 But--

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.720
 We're going to do it.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.880
 And then they were like, no, he's such a terrible writer.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880
 We love the Beatles.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.520
 We love Kubrick and the Beatles.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.600
 But you know--

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.760
 The top thing thing.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.480
 I read one theory that it was because Paul and John were fighting

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.000
 over who got to play Gander.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.360
 [LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.080
 Yeah, that was what a tourer did part of it.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.640
 That's great.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.320
 Some things on fancy dress.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.840
 Yeah.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.960
 Oh, we're here.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.000
 There's a lady called Sharnie Christy, who lives in Kent.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.600
 And she has a phobia of people in costumes,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.360
 which the newspaper article called Metamphysomiophobia.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.920
 And she works in theatre.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.520
 So she said, people think it's quite funny

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.840
 that I'm working in something that means I'm

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.720
 around people in costume all the time.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.840
 I have to watch people get dressed in costume in order

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.000
 to reassure myself that I know who they are.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.800
 So she has to watch them get changed,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.560
 just so she knows it's not a fantastic excuse

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.400
 of being a pervert.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.520
 I'm not saying that.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.280
 Yeah.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.080
 But also-- so she's not only got a fear of people in costume,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.680
 she suddenly recognizes them as the character

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.320
 that they're playing.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:27.840
 Yes.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.080
 So she's like at the Lion King.

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.080
 She'll be like, hey, Mike, have a good Symbol.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.440
 Let's evacuate to this.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.040
 There's a Lion Loan.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.680
 Is that the zoo?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.280
 It's me.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.840
 Yes, me again.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.920
 Every night for the same.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.920
 Hello, LemonZoo.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.360
 There are a lot of cats everywhere.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.480
 Do you say hats?

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480
 No, cats.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:59.800
 I want to know when people started dressing

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.440
 as really crazy things.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.880
 Because they used to dress as aristocracy

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.840
 or people from different ancient Greeks.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.160
 You would dress up as ancient Greeks or Trojans.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.520
 And I think I've pinned down one early date

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.480
 in terms of dressing as crazy things, which was 1745.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.040
 King Louis the 15th of France had a masked ball at Versailles.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.200
 There were 15,000 guests.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.560
 And everyone was in nice dresses and with masked.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.120
 But he and several of his goughtiers turned up dressed

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.680
 as clipped "you" hedges.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.000
 [LAUGHTER]

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.960
 Is that you?

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.080
 And I think that's the year 0 for dressing as stupid stuff.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.040
 And just speaking of French, fancy dress.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.920
 Do you know the Charles the Fourth of France,

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:51.920
 the story of the dance of the burning men, actually?

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.560
 This was a fancy dress party.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.080
 And Charles the Fourth and the load of his goughtiers

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.400
 came dressed as sabbages, which meant they blacked up.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.440
 And they covered themselves in pitch tar

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.040
 and they chained themselves together.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.960
 And then when they arrived at the party, one of the other guests

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:11.920
 wanted to see have a good look at their costume.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.360
 So he went up to them with a naked flame.

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.640
 And they were all wearing pitch tar.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.800
 And they were all chained together.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600
 And they all went up.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.280
 And I think two people were burned alive.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.520
 Two people died within days of their injuries.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.120
 And it really-- like he was pretty mad to self-ly,

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.640
 but that really ticked him, although.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.480
 Wow.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.280
 Fancy dresses are dangerous games.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:36.520
 You shouldn't do it.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.680
 Americans got really into fancy dress in the 19th century,

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.360
 didn't they?

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.400
 And they would dress up as European aristocracy and wear.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.800
 So it was like--

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.720
 I think the general consensus is, because people weren't

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.800
 really doing it in Europe.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.880
 The America didn't really have at that time

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.720
 an aristocracy or a history of its own in terms of--

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.200
 you know, it didn't have a great nebility.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.880
 It didn't have all these big families.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.120
 And so it kind of-- what was the quote?

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.960
 It bought its own history.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.160
 And so people would buy, like Mary Antoinette's,

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.320
 genuine jewels and costumes, and then go wearing them to parties.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.520
 And you'd go to a party with like 1,200 guests,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.680
 like the Vanderbilties to hold these amazing parties

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.680
 in the 19th century.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.280
 And it would be a competition as to who

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.720
 had the most genuine artefacts that

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.920
 used to belong to a great British king or a great friend

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.280
 ruler or--

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.120
 Yeah, so it used to be a bigger deal than just buying

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.480
 a £10 plastic, which is costume, the local Scotland.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.720
 Honebes.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.600
 Honebes were in the original fact.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.520
 That's what they were.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.680
 Yeah, they dressed up as Honebes.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.880
 This is just because I discovered coincidentally last week

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:46.000
 that pollution in the sea and then in the seas at the poles

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.320
 is contaminating various wildlife there.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.040
 And Honebes' penises are getting weaker.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.960
 Their penis bones are being shrunken.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.640
 Well, they say that, but it is cold up there.

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.680
 They really don't need that expert skew.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.880
 It's getting warmer though.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.760
 And that's true.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.040
 So the female polar bears are going, it's getting warmer.

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.560
 That's still nothing.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.520
 Well, well, well, where is it?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:15.560
 You've been promising me for two million years.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.360
 And yet it's the pollutants.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.160
 That's what they claim.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.880
 They don't know why quite a bit of us have penis bones,

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.600
 but they are getting smaller.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.320
 And they think it's going to do some kind of damage.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.400
 Most animals have penis bones, don't they?

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.280
 No, they don't.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.280
 Most of us on this panel--

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.000
 Oh, most of animals have penis bones.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.560
 Yes, yes.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:39.880
 And in the Victorian times they wore badger penis bones

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.240
 as typums.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.000
 Yeah.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.760
 Have you seen a walrus penis bone?

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.440
 I've held one.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.880
 They're extraordinary.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.600
 I was thinking of the walrus at the time.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:59.080
 When the walrus asks, just say no, Dan.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:04.400
 I was out of fancy dress, and I was saying this was walrus.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.240
 OK.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.520
 Hey, very quickly, this is just to bring it back

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.000
 to Tolkien and CS Lewis.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
 CS Lewis died the same day as Aldous Hotsley.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.560
 We lost two literary juggernauts that day.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.120
 And it kind of really didn't register with anyone

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.400
 because someone else died that day, JFK.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.160
 And they just completely--

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.520
 no one actually knows they're dead yet as a result, yeah.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.960
 All right, so in the Guinness Book of Regals,

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.200
 we're all just writers.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200
 Yeah.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.360
 Hotsley in this.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.920
 We need to move on because we're really

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.040
 running past our time here.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.160
 OK, time for fact number three.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.080
 And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.000
 My fact is about Agatha Christie.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.720
 And it's that Agatha Christie thought

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.240
 that Hercules Poirot, her most famous creation,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.320
 was a, quote, "detestable, bombastic, tiresome,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.000
 egocentric little creep."

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.560
 She hated him from quite early on as well in her career.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.680
 And she wrote an essay called Why I Got Fed Up With Poirot.

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.120
 And she really, really didn't like him.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.360
 And she wrote his death story in 1945, which

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.280
 was 30 years before she died.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.880
 So she wanted to write it quite early.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.320
 And she left instructions that when she died,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.600
 that story should be published.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.800
 So she would take him down with her.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:26.800
 Absolutely.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.000
 And she even kept the manuscripts in a bank vault.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
 That's how much she disliked Poirot's character.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.680
 And then when she was 85 with her own hell failing,

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.800
 she decided to publish it so that she would outlive him,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.360
 I think, is what I think she wanted to do.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.120
 But when she did publish the story,

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.800
 Poirot got a front page obituary in The New York Times,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.680
 which I think is, might be, even more than she got.

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.720
 So really?

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.880
 Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.120
 I don't know why she was role news day, isn't it?

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.840
 It's the only fictional obituary they've ever published.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:58.360
 Yeah.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.160
 And so even in death, he was really, really famous.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.920
 And she couldn't get away to properly block him on the head.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.360
 Was it from page of the obituary section?

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:08.960
 Nope.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.800
 It was from page of the paper.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.680
 Of the paper.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:11.200
 Yeah.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.200
 Jesus.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.600
 We say they're dumbing down today.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.360
 That's what I was talking about.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.160
 It is weird when you hear authors hating

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.600
 those central characters.

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.600
 Yeah.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.960
 When you didn't know, don't they?

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.120
 Who was Sherlock Holmes?

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.200
 Yeah, Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.200
 And then, did you hear what chaos that created

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.120
 when he killed off Sherlock Holmes?

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.720
 I've got, yeah, I found a bunch of stuff.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.080
 Basically, he just got, so he killed him off.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.680
 And then all these letters came in, which one began,

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.680
 you brute, like they just treated it as if it was real.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.160
 I'm like the trolling of its day.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160
 Yeah.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.800
 It's a writer letter to someone saying,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800
 you brute.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800
 Yeah.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.920
 A lady picketed his house, fans wore black iron bands,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.920
 20,000 people canceled their subscriptions to the strand

00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.040
 magazine, which was being published as a periodical.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.400
 And yeah, and then I guess he eventually brought it back.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.480
 But that must have been a confusing time.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.840
 So, A.M.L. really hated Winnie the Pooh.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.360
 Winnie the Pooh, yeah.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.760
 That's so cruel.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 Everyone hated Winnie the Pooh, didn't they?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760
 Did they?

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.360
 All of its creations.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.520
 A.M.L hated Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.720
 Yeah, he well played.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.720
 So, I mean, his life was kind of ruined by the fact

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720
 that he was Christopher Robin.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.160
 And he always resented, I think that's it.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.160
 So, how was Christopher Robin, A.M.L.?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160
 Sun, yeah.

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160
 Yeah, he resented that.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.800
 And the guy did the illustrations, who was fine by his name,

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.280
 but he said, E.H. Shepherd, ruined his life as well,

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.440
 ruined his career, everyone defined him by Winnie the Pooh.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.200
 Did they all have meetings where they're going,

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.600
 not this shit again?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.600
 If only we could stop doing it somewhere.

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.360
 And the other thing that Mill hated about it was that it made people think

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.360
 that he liked children.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.280
 And he said, I have never felt in the least sentimental about them.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.000
 So, but he did have a son.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.360
 Yeah, I was taking dictations and he was really into that.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.200
 Take a note, it's a crap.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200
 And yeah, the very difficult relationship with his side,

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:12.040
 which kind of, you know, seems to be explained by this sensation.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.080
 And so, one thing you can do, if you really dislike your character,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.440
 this is something that Agatha Christie did.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440
 I love this.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.480
 She put a version of herself in her own books,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.080
 a mystery novelist called Ariadne Oliver.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.560
 And in the novels that Agatha Christie wrote,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.440
 this fictional novelist, Ariadne Oliver,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.600
 hates her most famous creation,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.480
 who is a vegetarian, finished detective called Sven Herson,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.120
 who, and she appears in six novels,

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:43.800
 this character who hates her, her main character.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.400
 And she, Oliver says, if I ever met that bony, gangling,

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.480
 vegetable eating fin in real life,

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.920
 I'd do a better murder than any I've ever invented.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.640
 That's a really good idea.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.840
 This is how much she'd disliked it.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.160
 It's a really good idea of putting yourself in novels,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.040
 and then, like, and then the guy said,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.920
 oh, easy jitter, idiot, something.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.160
 Everything that you're annoyed with, you could put in your book.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.120
 Another person who hates your creation now is Annie Prue,

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.640
 who wrote, broke that mountain.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.360
 Oh, yeah, because of fan fiction.

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.960
 So she hates the fact now.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.640
 So she was like nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.720
 She wrote this brilliant short story.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.480
 And she says she wish she'd never done it,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.160
 because she's plagued by fan fiction now,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.120
 by people writing either sequels to broke that mountain

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:26.200
 or alternative endings to broke that mountain.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.520
 And she said, the vast majority of them are people

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.880
 who, so the majority of them are people

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.240
 who start their letters with, I'm not gay, but.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.600
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.600
 And then go on to give an alternative ending,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.520
 by the two male characters then, up together.

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:42.200
 I've written an intense searing homo-erotic series of, yeah, yeah.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.600
 And I've never written anything before in my life.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.600
 And that's not the point-- yeah, yeah.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.640
 It's not weird.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.160
 Oh, yeah.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.040
 It's just every day, I'm more homo-erotic

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.000
 than to different people saying they're not gay.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.960
 But it does-- yeah, there are, I think,

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.280
 more than 100 sequels to Pride and Prejudice.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.560
 And obviously, it's been 200 years, so there's a lot.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.960
 But in one of them, Elizabeth Darcy, as she becomes,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.800
 is widowed, Darcy is dead.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.480
 And then she has to defend England from invasion

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.000
 by Napoleon in a fleet of hot air balloons.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.360
 And I've never tracked down this book.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.600
 But if I do, I am reading the hell out of it.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.800
 It sounds so good.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.240
 And we need to move on, guys, by the way.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.040
 But if anyone-- does anyone have anything else?

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.240
 Nothing that's short enough.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.480
 I've got-- I've got-- I've just one last thing, which

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.480
 is I really like when, as you're saying,

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.640
 Poirot goes on the front page of newspapers.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.920
 I love it when these characters seep into the real world.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.240
 And there's a thing I read that, which is The Met.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.840
 And all crime departments in Britain, or the police,

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.760
 they use a national computer system, which

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.560
 is developed, basically, for major crime inquiries.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.840
 All the British forces use it.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.640
 And it's called the Home Office Large Major Inquiry System.

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.240
 But everyone refers to it by acronym Homes.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.320
 So quite nice.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.400
 And there, as well, is a training program

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.960
 for it called Elementary.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.360
 Should we move on to the final?

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.520
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520
 OK.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.560
 Time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.200
 And that is my fact.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.040
 So we've been talking about books this whole time.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.680
 So I thought I'd find a fact, which

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.920
 was about the enemy of the books, the television.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.720
 So my fact is that before he invented the television,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.640
 John Logie Baird invented a pair of socks

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.520
 to wear underneath your socks.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.120
 [LAUGHTER]

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.160
 And who can say which history will judge the greater invention?

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.800
 I'm not calling it.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:40.840
 I just-- I love that fact, because I just think that's--

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.960
 because if you look at the history of his inventions,

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.880
 as well, prior to the television, he invented, as well,

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.880
 a razor, which was rust proof.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.760
 You could never make it rust, but it never ended up selling

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.240
 because it was made of glass, and it shattered on people's

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.440
 basis and ended up passing it.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440
 OK.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.360
 He made a glass razor.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.160
 It doesn't rust, but it slices your face off.

00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.440
 It slices your face off, yeah.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.000
 He made some pneumatic shoes that had balloons in them

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.120
 that he thought they'd pull your feet off.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.760
 But just that's his history.

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.040
 And then suddenly, the television, it just makes no sense.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.800
 But the socks were actually quite good, wasn't they?

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.440
 They were amazing.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.240
 Yeah, how did they work?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.440
 So they're not designed to protect against moisture

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.480
 from the outside.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.920
 It's the moisture that your feet create

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.000
 when you're walking around the day.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.320
 So they were for soldiers in the First World War,

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.880
 and they're sprinkled with a chemical called Borax,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.120
 which absorbs the moisture from your foot.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.240
 So you put it under your foot, facing upwards as a way.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.520
 You put it on that way, then you put your sock over that,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.760
 then your shoe over that.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
 And soldiers in the trenches swore by it,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.040
 and it made him a huge amount of money.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.920
 It's what let him resign his job as an electrical engineer.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:49.720
 Yeah.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.520
 One soldier said, I find the bird on the socks

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.200
 keep my feet in splendid condition out here in France.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.080
 Foot trouble is one of our worst enemies,

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:00.040
 but thanks to the bird on the sock,

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.440
 mine are in the pink.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.280
 Now, we can just make an anti-jermen sock

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.920
 then put my father worst enemy in my house.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.320
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.680
 It's a joke.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.040
 It does rather, yeah, the worst enemy being foot trouble is.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.360
 That's a sense of letter.

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.080
 I would have changed it.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.560
 And through the officers.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.200
 But he advertised them in the newspaper

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.720
 and managed to sell one pair doing that.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.800
 So initially it was a complete failure.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.280
 And then he built a plywood tank

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.800
 and carried it around the streets of Glasgow

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.240
 with the bed under sock written on the side.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:41.600
 And then he sold loads.

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.120
 Yeah.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.680
 This was during the war, though, wasn't it?

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.880
 So like, a big tank going through the streets

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.360
 you got down through in the war.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.600
 People look at scary.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.840
 So he made these socks, and then he got ill for a while, didn't he?

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.560
 And then when he got better, he suddenly

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.480
 realized he had loads of money in his account

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.120
 because people had bought all these socks.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:58.680
 Will he win us?

00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.200
 That's what he was.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.520
 Didn't he go away?

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.400
 Oh, gone away.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.680
 But when he got all this money, he went to Trinidad.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:08.520
 And he started up a jam factory.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:13.680
 Unfortunately, the local insect life either ran off with the sugar

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.800
 or landed in the hot fats and boiling preserve.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.400
 Wow.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.320
 I think I read.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.240
 And so it never took off, because it was just insects.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.040
 Just full of insects.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.280
 And so he lost a bit of money from that and then came back.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.560
 And then it was when he invented television.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:32.680
 When he came back before inventing television,

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.800
 he had the sock business and the--

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.560
 The razor?

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.000
 The jam and the razor.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.240
 And he then had 200 quid left.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.640
 He was really broke.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:45.920
 So he decided to buy two tons of Australian honey, cheap,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.760
 and selling it for people.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.720
 And then he bought a ton of soap and he sold that.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.240
 Wow.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.240
 And then television.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.720
 Complete out of no way.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.840
 To be fair, the television thing was something

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.960
 that he really dreamed about making quite early on.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.880
 And he couldn't do it.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.160
 So he had all these other businesses that went along the way.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.960
 So they were just kind of maybe a smoke screen.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.400
 There's other inventions to throw people off the sand.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.760
 They absolutely were in that, as well as when he would just

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.280
 make these other things.

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.800
 When he was making the TV, any time he had a photo

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.280
 where he was showing how he was making the TV,

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.080
 he would put in fake objects.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.240
 So that no one who saw the photo could go, OK,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.400
 so he's got that and got that.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.800
 So he would misplace.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.080
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.000
 He was so unique.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.680
 OK, so it looks like he needs two tons of cheap Australian

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:33.920
 honey to get the TV to work.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.120
 How has he done that?

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120
 Where did the socks go?

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.960
 I don't know.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:43.000
 He was saying about the electricity.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.880
 When he was working in Glasgow, he decided

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.800
 to try and make artificial diamonds

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.400
 by passing electricity through a stick of graphite.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.320
 And he put so much electricity through the stick of graphite

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.240
 that he caused a blackout over the whole of Glasgow.

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.760
 Wow.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.760
 There's a weird coincidence in his life, as well.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.960
 Just one of those tiny things that's actually--

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.120
 it's quite nice when you discover it.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.840
 He went to school with a guy who was called--

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.000
 so this was his classmate.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.920
 This is his actual classmate.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.440
 He went to school with a guy called J.C.W. Rief,

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.120
 who we now know as Lord Rief.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.520
 So basically, the inventor of the television

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.280
 went to school with the man who defined television

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.080
 for the BBC in England.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:28.240
 That's an absolutely insane coincidence.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.520
 And he got bullied by Lord Rief all the time.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.880
 He just bullied the hell out of him.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.080
 And Lord Rief's parents had to pull him out of school

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.600
 because he was just too much of a menace in that school.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.880
 Wow, really?

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.280
 Lord Rief was a bit of a--

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.400
 He was a bully, yeah.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.800
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.880
 That's a jolly good thing.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.880
 I'll get back at him.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.040
 I'll invent something that's so good.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.280
 He won't ever be able to take part in it.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.360
 He'll have nothing.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.520
 I've read-- I cannot believe this is true.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.680
 That originally, when the BBC sent out experimental

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.920
 transmissions, which was in 1929, that John Lugabaird

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.160
 had to pay the BBC to transmit his images.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.680
 Right, he's just so topsy to--

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.720
 Or be cut, yeah, but like Lord Rief.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.520
 For as much as he's done for TV--

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.960
 and if you haven't heard the name Lord Rief,

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.480
 in this country, most people have him assuming.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.520
 He's the guy who absolutely defined how

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.280
 BBC became the thing that it is.

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.720
 He hated television.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.840
 Yeah, of course he did.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.200
 Yeah, as you know, we know Baird, isn't it?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.880
 His salary was £5,000 and a mean wedgie.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.040
 Just on author's early inventions and early careers,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.520
 before they did the thing that we know them for,

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.720
 can I tell you very quickly about Daniel DeFoe?

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.400
 Yes, please.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.080
 OK, his early jobs--

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:46.320
 and obviously Robinson Crusoe and the general of the plague

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.480
 gear, all these incredible works.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.160
 Before that, his early jobs included selling hosiery,

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:54.960
 dealing wine, investing in a diving bell

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.720
 to recover sunken treasure, and harvesting

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.040
 musk from the anal glands of cats.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.520
 Did she say hats?

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.280
 No.

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280
 No.

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.080
 No.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:11.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080
 It really happened with this.

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:17.600
 In 1692, he bought 70 civic cats, but 850 quid,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.720
 because the Dutch made perfume using the musk, which

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.080
 they secrete as the base ingredient.

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.600
 And he hated them.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.480
 And then to get the musk, an attendant

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.680
 had to put them in a special cage so they could only face one

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:29.880
 way.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.280
 They couldn't turn around.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:34.320
 And then, I'm quoting here, I used a spatula

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.760
 to scrape out the butter-like secretion

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.160
 that gathered in a pouch between the tail and the anus.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.280
 And then he lost the cats, because he didn't even own them.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.680
 He didn't taste them properly.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.720
 He got them more money by borrowing it.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.520
 And then, to keep them, he defrauded his own mothering

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.960
 law, who then sued him, like he was a disaster.

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.160
 But that was his-- yeah.

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.200
 So whose cat-- they were just wandering cats?

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:59.000
 No, they were owned by someone else.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.320
 And he bought them with borrowed money.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.240
 And then someone else said, no, I want my cats back.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.360
 You can use them, but you don't own them.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.000
 And also, where's their anal butter?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.160
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.640
 We've been stealing that.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.640
 I can't believe it's not civic cat-able butter.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.720
 [LAUGHTER]

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:25.200
 We're going to have to wrap up.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.200
 OK, that's it.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.360
 That's all of our facts.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.000
