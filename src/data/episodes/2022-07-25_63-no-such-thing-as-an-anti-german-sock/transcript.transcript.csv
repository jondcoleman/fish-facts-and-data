00:00:03,00:00:23,"Hello, and welcome to another episode."
00:00:23,00:00:25,And no such thing as a fish this week coming to you
00:00:25,00:00:30,from the hay festival in hay.
00:00:30,00:00:31,My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:31,00:00:33,I'm sitting here with three other QILs.
00:00:33,00:00:35,"It's Anit Chazinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray."
00:00:35,00:00:37,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:37,00:00:40,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.
00:00:40,00:00:42,"And in a particular order, here we go."
00:00:42,00:00:45,"Starting with you, Chazinski."
00:00:45,00:00:47,"Yes, did you imagine that these are specifically"
00:00:47,00:00:48,literary facts?
00:00:48,00:00:49,Absolutely.
00:00:49,00:00:52,You did mention it.
00:00:52,00:00:54,"Yeah, because it's a literary festival, right?"
00:00:54,00:00:57,And that's why I said it.
00:00:57,00:00:58,That's why I thought you said it.
00:00:58,00:01:02,So my literary fact is that the first ever novel
00:01:02,00:01:06,ended mid-sentence.
00:01:06,00:01:09,And this is a Japanese novel called The Tale of Genji.
00:01:09,00:01:12,It was written in the early 11th century.
00:01:12,00:01:15,"So probably 1008, I think."
00:01:15,00:01:17,"And yeah, ended in the middle of a sentence."
00:01:17,00:01:18,Was it like a cliffhanger ending?
00:01:18,00:01:19,Kind of.
00:01:19,00:01:21,"I mean, not as melodramatic, but she's"
00:01:21,00:01:23,a character that's introducing another to character
00:01:23,00:01:26,"someone, and the end saying, caroo introduces him"
00:01:26,00:01:29,"to the, you never find out who."
00:01:29,00:01:31,"And people don't know if that was intentional,"
00:01:31,00:01:32,or if she just died in the middle of gay guy.
00:01:32,00:01:35,We've got bored of it.
00:01:35,00:01:38,I think most critics think that it was intentional.
00:01:38,00:01:40,"I heard another version, which is like,"
00:01:40,00:01:41,she just carried on.
00:01:41,00:01:43,She was going to carry on a carry on until she couldn't
00:01:43,00:01:44,do it anymore.
00:01:44,00:01:46,"Because there's quite a lot of book, isn't it?"
00:01:46,00:01:48,"Yeah, I think it's about 1100 pages."
00:01:48,00:01:49,"Yeah, 1100 pages."
00:01:49,00:01:50,Yeah.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"Apparently, there's like 400 characters in there."
00:01:52,00:01:52,Yeah.
00:01:52,00:01:54,And none of them have names.
00:01:54,00:01:56,"No, none of them have names."
00:01:56,00:01:58,I read in one-- how do you do that?
00:01:58,00:02:00,"Well, yeah, it must have been so confusing."
00:02:00,00:02:01,So there are 400 characters.
00:02:01,00:02:04,"And apparently, at the time, it was rude in Japanese."
00:02:04,00:02:05,It's all about Japanese aristocratic society
00:02:05,00:02:06,in the 12th century.
00:02:06,00:02:08,"And it was rude to refer to someone by name,"
00:02:08,00:02:12,because it was thought as being unnecessarily familiar.
00:02:12,00:02:14,"So if a 400 characters, none of them"
00:02:14,00:02:15,would have to be referred to by name.
00:02:15,00:02:17,"So they're all like your ex-an-see, your majesty,"
00:02:17,00:02:18,his highness.
00:02:18,00:02:20,"Oh, so they still have titles, OK."
00:02:20,00:02:22,"Yeah, but I mean, there are 75 his highnesses."
00:02:22,00:02:24,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:24,00:02:26,"What's the way so it'd be like, oh, what's he doing here?"
00:02:26,00:02:31,"It said him, the key knew what he meant about him."
00:02:31,00:02:33,That's a very cool way to end it.
00:02:33,00:02:34,I like it.
00:02:34,00:02:35,"Yeah, it is."
00:02:35,00:02:38,So she's a bit like a pre-curse of Tristan Jandit.
00:02:38,00:02:40,She seemed to have interesting things
00:02:40,00:02:42,she did with the form of the Nuffel.
00:02:42,00:02:45,"Look at the form of the Nuffel, which she just invented."
00:02:45,00:02:48,"It's a really bold new kind of novel, actually."
00:02:52,00:02:56,She defied the convention that she created 400 pages earlier.
00:02:56,00:02:59,[LAUGHTER]
00:02:59,00:03:00,Bye.
00:03:00,00:03:01,There's one bit.
00:03:01,00:03:02,So two thousand of the way through she
00:03:02,00:03:03,killed off the main character about whom
00:03:03,00:03:06,"the whole thing is written, the tale of Genji, just dies."
00:03:06,00:03:07,"And also, it doesn't really explain."
00:03:07,00:03:08,He's been killed off.
00:03:08,00:03:10,It's just that there's a blank chapter
00:03:10,00:03:13,"called ""Vanished Into the Clouds"" with no text in it."
00:03:13,00:03:14,"And then in the next chapter, it becomes apparent"
00:03:14,00:03:16,that the protagonist has died.
00:03:16,00:03:17,Wow.
00:03:17,00:03:18,Yeah.
00:03:18,00:03:20,Does anyone know what the first e-book was?
00:03:20,00:03:21,No.
00:03:21,00:03:23,"That's a thing where it's like there's a few different claims,"
00:03:23,00:03:27,"but probably the most likely was a book called ""Uncle Roger"""
00:03:27,00:03:29,by Judy Malai.
00:03:29,00:03:30,And you can still see it online.
00:03:30,00:03:32,It's like all hyperlinked.
00:03:32,00:03:33,"And you go in there, and it's like there's"
00:03:33,00:03:35,"been a party, and it has all the characters."
00:03:35,00:03:37,"You can click on the character, and it gives you"
00:03:37,00:03:38,their little story.
00:03:38,00:03:40,"And then you click on the next character, and you do that."
00:03:40,00:03:42,"It's like a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books,"
00:03:42,00:03:44,those things that they use to have.
00:03:44,00:03:46,"They were amazing those books, but they used to be."
00:03:46,00:03:47,So good.
00:03:47,00:03:51,"And so reading that this was like ""Choose Your Own Adventure"""
00:03:51,00:03:52,I thought I'd look into those.
00:03:52,00:03:54,And apparently you can get adults to choose
00:03:54,00:03:55,your own adventure books.
00:03:55,00:03:56,Oh God.
00:03:56,00:03:58,Yeah.
00:03:58,00:04:00,And the two best sellers that I could find
00:04:00,00:04:04,"are called ""Beer, Women, and Bad Decisions."""
00:04:04,00:04:07,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:07,00:04:08,That's great.
00:04:08,00:04:09,"So it's good, doesn't it?"
00:04:09,00:04:11,It sounds like you're going to try and get the bad decisions.
00:04:11,00:04:15,"Yeah, it's like another point, or a position tonight."
00:04:15,00:04:18,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:18,00:04:19,That haven't worked.
00:04:19,00:04:21,That's how most nights work.
00:04:21,00:04:23,And the other best selling one I found
00:04:23,00:04:26,"is called ""Night of a Thousand Boy Friends."""
00:04:26,00:04:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:29,00:04:30,Night with a K.
00:04:30,00:04:30,Oh.
00:04:30,00:04:38,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:38,00:04:40,So the first novel in the English language
00:04:40,00:04:43,"is obviously a different thing, because the tale of Genji"
00:04:43,00:04:44,is not in English.
00:04:44,00:04:47,"People often say it's Thomas Mallory's ""Lomort D'Arso,"""
00:04:47,00:04:49,which I like the idea that the first
00:04:49,00:04:51,novel written in English has a French title.
00:04:51,00:04:53,[LAUGHTER]
00:04:53,00:04:56,So I think it's actually this novel written in 1561
00:04:56,00:04:57,"called ""Beware the Cat."""
00:04:57,00:05:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:00,00:05:02,I think the main content of the first novel
00:05:02,00:05:04,written in English is just by a printer's assistant
00:05:04,00:05:05,called William Baldwin.
00:05:05,00:05:09,"It's kind of a horror novel about evil cats, really."
00:05:09,00:05:12,"It's about this-- for this guy, Eves drops on a cat."
00:05:12,00:05:15,And he overhears a female cat on trial.
00:05:15,00:05:17,"And the female cat's called ""Mal Slayer,"""
00:05:17,00:05:18,for obvious reasons.
00:05:18,00:05:23,And she's having to explain to this court of other cats
00:05:23,00:05:26,"that she hasn't broken the cat's code of sexual conduct,"
00:05:26,00:05:29,which dictates that a female cat is not
00:05:29,00:05:32,allowed to say no to any fewer than 10 male cats a night.
00:05:32,00:05:36,"So if you reject, you know, the 10th guy,"
00:05:36,00:05:38,you're up in court on trial.
00:05:38,00:05:40,"Anyway, here's over his list."
00:05:40,00:05:43,"Another point in this story, this first novel ever written,"
00:05:43,00:05:46,a priest slips on a cat and falls into a crowd.
00:05:46,00:05:47,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:47,00:05:49,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
00:05:49,00:05:51,Does he slip on the hat?
00:05:51,00:05:53,Or does he slip on the hat?
00:05:53,00:05:53,A cat!
00:05:53,00:05:54,"Oh, sorry."
00:05:54,00:05:55,[LAUGHTER]
00:05:55,00:05:56,He slipped on the hat.
00:05:56,00:05:57,Sorry.
00:05:57,00:05:59,And it's going to be Googling a book called
00:05:59,00:06:00,"""Be Where Are The Hats?"""
00:06:00,00:06:01,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:06:01,00:06:02,"Oh, wait."
00:06:02,00:06:04,What are these guys doing?
00:06:04,00:06:06,Cats on trial.
00:06:06,00:06:09,His priest does slip on it.
00:06:09,00:06:13,And he ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy
00:06:13,00:06:15,who out of fear.
00:06:15,00:06:16,What?
00:06:16,00:06:17,What kind of an excuse is that?
00:06:17,00:06:20,I slipped on a cat's face.
00:06:20,00:06:23,"I mean, they were the 15th century governor of banana skins."
00:06:23,00:06:26,Ends up with his face in the bare arse of a boy who
00:06:26,00:06:28,out of fear had to be shit himself.
00:06:28,00:06:29,[LAUGHTER]
00:06:29,00:06:34,First novel.
00:06:34,00:06:35,Wow.
00:06:35,00:06:37,Wow.
00:06:37,00:06:38,That's the first novel.
00:06:38,00:06:40,That is the first novel in English.
00:06:40,00:06:41,Wow.
00:06:41,00:06:41,Yeah.
00:06:41,00:06:43,So I was seeing what was happening in Europe
00:06:43,00:06:46,"at the same time as this book was being written,"
00:06:46,00:06:47,this Japanese one.
00:06:47,00:06:51,"And in 1008, Bishop Birchard of Worms"
00:06:51,00:06:54,"was writing books on canon law, a book"
00:06:54,00:06:57,"that he called ""Corrector et medicus."""
00:06:57,00:06:58,And the idea was he would give it to the bishops
00:06:58,00:07:00,"and give it to the priests, and it would give them"
00:07:00,00:07:03,the rules of the penance that they would give out to people.
00:07:03,00:07:05,"So if he did something wrong, it would be like Five Hail"
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Mary's, or whatever."
00:07:06,00:07:11,But quite a lot of it seems to be very strange.
00:07:11,00:07:16,"One of the things was, if a woman had smothered a live fish"
00:07:16,00:07:22,"inside her vagina, and then served it to men,"
00:07:22,00:07:27,"or a classic prank, I really got it"
00:07:27,00:07:30,with the old vagina fish tonight.
00:07:30,00:07:32,He won't put cling film under my toilet again.
00:07:32,00:07:40,"Either that or needing bread on her naked buttocks,"
00:07:40,00:07:43,then she would get a penance of two to five years
00:07:43,00:07:46,fasting on feast days according to this book.
00:07:46,00:07:48,So we were on endings of books earlier.
00:07:48,00:07:52,"So the first version of Hamlet has a happy ending, which"
00:07:52,00:07:53,is nice.
00:07:53,00:07:56,"And it's called Amleth, which is Hamlet"
00:07:56,00:07:58,with the h at the other end.
00:07:58,00:07:59,That's the soul change.
00:07:59,00:08:00,It does move the h.
00:08:00,00:08:04,Was that some kind of like copyright or bad news with him?
00:08:04,00:08:06,We can't do anything with Amleth.
00:08:06,00:08:08,Wait a minute.
00:08:08,00:08:09,And it's the same.
00:08:09,00:08:12,And it's right down to stabbing someone
00:08:12,00:08:15,"who's hiding behind an aris, all of that stuff."
00:08:15,00:08:16,"But then, at the end of it, he"
00:08:16,00:08:22,"kills the usurper, so his father's brother, his uncle."
00:08:22,00:08:23,"Killed the usurper, goes to England,"
00:08:23,00:08:26,"marries the sexy queen of Scots, returns with an army,"
00:08:26,00:08:28,and then becomes king.
00:08:28,00:08:30,"And then he has two queens, one is his wife,"
00:08:30,00:08:32,"and one is his mother, who was queen before."
00:08:32,00:08:33,Wow.
00:08:33,00:08:34,That's how it ends originally.
00:08:34,00:08:37,I think they should redo it like that.
00:08:37,00:08:37,Do we have it?
00:08:37,00:08:39,Or we've just heard that it exists?
00:08:39,00:08:41,I don't know.
00:08:41,00:08:46,It's just about authors who sort of came up with something
00:08:46,00:08:48,and then flipped into something else.
00:08:48,00:08:50,Do you know how fear and loathing in Las Vegas started?
00:08:50,00:08:52,Huntress Thompson's book.
00:08:52,00:08:54,It was meant to be--
00:08:54,00:08:56,and this is what he handed in when he handed in the majority
00:08:56,00:08:57,of the book.
00:08:57,00:09:00,It was actually originally meant to be a 250-word photo
00:09:00,00:09:04,caption for sports illustrator.
00:09:04,00:09:07,"They wanted him to go cover a derby, and he started writing."
00:09:07,00:09:08,"And they were like, it's great."
00:09:08,00:09:12,But we kind of needed a fit in here.
00:09:12,00:09:16,"Can you say the same stuff, but in there?"
00:09:16,00:09:16,Wow.
00:09:16,00:09:17,That's amazing.
00:09:17,00:09:17,What do they say?
00:09:17,00:09:18,Bad news.
00:09:18,00:09:21,We can't put that below as a caption.
00:09:21,00:09:23,So we've had to just give you a book deal instead.
00:09:23,00:09:24,"No, no, no."
00:09:24,00:09:26,"They didn't like it at all, and he had to take it elsewhere."
00:09:26,00:09:28,And of course they didn't like it at all.
00:09:28,00:09:30,"Read the mail online articles, and there's"
00:09:30,00:09:32,a one-line description of the photo.
00:09:32,00:09:34,So and so turned up at a party looking nice.
00:09:34,00:09:38,"You don't want a 60,000-word novel there."
00:09:38,00:09:40,"OK, why don't we move on to our second fact,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,and that is James.
00:09:43,00:09:48,"OK, my fact this week is that JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis"
00:09:48,00:09:51,went to a party dressed as Polar Bears.
00:09:51,00:09:53,It was not a fancy dress party.
00:09:53,00:09:59,And then there's the average shame of turning up
00:09:59,00:10:03,in the same thing as somebody else.
00:10:03,00:10:06,"So Tolkien and Lewis, they were really good friends, of course."
00:10:06,00:10:08,"Well, not always."
00:10:08,00:10:09,"No, not always."
00:10:09,00:10:10,You'll probably get onto that in a few seconds.
00:10:10,00:10:11,"No, no, please."
00:10:11,00:10:14,"Sorry, do we know the circumstances of a fancy dress party?"
00:10:14,00:10:15,Or is that just amazing?
00:10:15,00:10:17,"No, really, it seems to-- I read it in a book."
00:10:17,00:10:19,It was a biography of Tolkien.
00:10:19,00:10:21,"And it was like, here's one of the funny things"
00:10:21,00:10:22,that he used to do.
00:10:22,00:10:23,He used to do that.
00:10:23,00:10:24,He used to do that.
00:10:24,00:10:25,"Yeah, I know."
00:10:25,00:10:27,But he used to like dressing up a lot.
00:10:27,00:10:30,"Yeah, he-- and not even when it was an fancy dress party,"
00:10:30,00:10:31,"just in day-to-day life, really."
00:10:31,00:10:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:10:32,00:10:33,He apparently very famously dressed up
00:10:33,00:10:36,as an axe-wielding Anglo-Saxon warrior
00:10:36,00:10:39,and chased his neighbor down the road.
00:10:39,00:10:42,"So after they met for the very first time,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,"C.S. Lewis wrote in his diary about Tolkien,"
00:10:45,00:10:46,"""No harm in him."
00:10:46,00:10:49,"Only needs a smack or so."""
00:10:49,00:10:52,So they did-- they were very good friends for a long time.
00:10:52,00:10:56,And then they had a rival relator.
00:10:56,00:10:59,"Tolkien, eventually, they had meetings"
00:10:59,00:11:00,"of a group called The Inclins, which"
00:11:00,00:11:04,is a sort of famous literary salon in a pub in Oxford.
00:11:04,00:11:06,And they would read out their stuff to each other.
00:11:06,00:11:07,"And eventually, Tolkien didn't even"
00:11:07,00:11:10,go along to meetings when he knew that C.S. Lewis
00:11:10,00:11:12,was going to read out Narnia's stuff.
00:11:12,00:11:13,That's how bad it got.
00:11:13,00:11:15,He really did lie the allegory in Narnia.
00:11:15,00:11:19,"He said that writing an allegory, which Narnia--"
00:11:19,00:11:20,a lot of people say it is.
00:11:20,00:11:22,"Yeah, I think it is."
00:11:22,00:11:25,"He said that allegory was a very lazy form of writing,"
00:11:25,00:11:26,and he didn't really approve of it.
00:11:26,00:11:27,So that's what it was.
00:11:27,00:11:30,One of the things that The Inclins did
00:11:30,00:11:31,is they would hold competitions
00:11:31,00:11:35,to see who could read a particular lady's work without laughing.
00:11:35,00:11:37,She was the worst writer.
00:11:37,00:11:37,What?
00:11:37,00:11:38,In the world.
00:11:38,00:11:39,"Was this a particular writer, or just"
00:11:39,00:11:43,did they find any woman awful?
00:11:43,00:11:43,"Oh, great."
00:11:43,00:11:44,"Look, because the lady said it."
00:11:44,00:11:46,It just sounded like they were all massive sects.
00:11:46,00:11:47,"Yeah, it's true."
00:11:47,00:11:47,It did sound like that.
00:11:47,00:11:49,It still sounds pretty good.
00:11:49,00:11:50,It does sound like that.
00:11:50,00:11:53,So this lady was called Amanda McKittrick-Ross.
00:11:53,00:11:57,"She wrote lots of fiction, and here's"
00:11:57,00:11:59,some examples of things that she said.
00:11:59,00:12:02,She refers to eyes as globes of glare.
00:12:02,00:12:06,She refers to legs as bony supports.
00:12:06,00:12:12,And she refers to pants as southern necessity.
00:12:12,00:12:13,"Well, that one's got assamence."
00:12:13,00:12:14,The first one had litteration.
00:12:14,00:12:17,"I mean, this is like ticking all the literary boxes,"
00:12:17,00:12:18,as far as I can tell.
00:12:18,00:12:18,OK.
00:12:18,00:12:22,She called sweat globules of liquid lava.
00:12:22,00:12:23,Lovely.
00:12:23,00:12:24,That's great.
00:12:24,00:12:25,"This is a down good, similarly."
00:12:25,00:12:26,OK.
00:12:26,00:12:30,"I'll be right there, so I'm not going to be sorry."
00:12:30,00:12:32,One of the main reason--
00:12:32,00:12:33,but I think the main reason actually
00:12:33,00:12:36,is that Tolkien objected to C.S. Moses' allegory.
00:12:36,00:12:38,And I just think this is quite interesting.
00:12:38,00:12:39,It's not funny at all.
00:12:39,00:12:42,But Tolkien was a strict Catholic.
00:12:42,00:12:46,"And he-- so for instance, when they started at the start"
00:12:46,00:12:47,"of the 20th century, even in Catholic mass,"
00:12:47,00:12:49,"they would start saying that in English,"
00:12:49,00:12:51,he would say the mass very loudly
00:12:51,00:12:53,and let in in the middle of church.
00:12:53,00:12:56,"Well, they were saying in English to make clear his thoughts."
00:12:56,00:12:58,But he didn't object.
00:12:58,00:13:00,"So C.S. Moses was an Anglican, so Tolkien--"
00:13:00,00:13:03,so he didn't really believe that the word of God
00:13:03,00:13:05,should only be spoken through like priests and members
00:13:05,00:13:06,"of the clergy, whereas Tolkien did."
00:13:06,00:13:10,So Tolkien thought that it wasn't C.S. Lewis's place
00:13:10,00:13:12,"to be telling people about religion,"
00:13:12,00:13:14,because he wasn't members of the clergy.
00:13:14,00:13:18,"It was just, you know, it was quite interesting."
00:13:18,00:13:22,"Also, Lewis nominated Tolkien for the Nobel Prize"
00:13:22,00:13:26,"for Literature in 1961, and the committee rejected him."
00:13:26,00:13:28,"And they only recently have released the papers,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,which-- because they have a sort of 50-year rule
00:13:30,00:13:33,on the committee's decisions.
00:13:33,00:13:37,"And they rejected Tolkien, saying that he was a bad storyteller."
00:13:37,00:13:40,"No, they said the storytelling area just"
00:13:40,00:13:42,not up to scratch.
00:13:42,00:13:43,Wow.
00:13:43,00:13:45,"Yeah, cool."
00:13:45,00:13:47,You know that Lord of the Rings--
00:13:47,00:13:49,"I don't know if this is really common knowledge,"
00:13:49,00:13:53,"but the Beatles tried to option it to make it into a movie,"
00:13:53,00:13:56,and they approached Stanley Kubrick to make it.
00:13:56,00:13:57,And what?
00:13:57,00:14:01,I think everyone decided it was a bad idea.
00:14:01,00:14:03,"Once they all saw-- yeah, but--"
00:14:03,00:14:04,"Yeah, that would have been amazing."
00:14:04,00:14:05,They were going to play all the characters.
00:14:05,00:14:06,They were going to play all the characters.
00:14:06,00:14:07,We were going to play all the characters.
00:14:07,00:14:08,"The Beatles, Lord of the Rings."
00:14:08,00:14:10,It would have been amazing.
00:14:10,00:14:12,"I think quite red is-- like, there are so many theories"
00:14:12,00:14:13,about why it was rejected.
00:14:13,00:14:15,And I don't even know why they used to be a theory.
00:14:15,00:14:15,It's quite obvious.
00:14:15,00:14:17,But--
00:14:17,00:14:18,We're going to do it.
00:14:18,00:14:22,"And then they were like, no, he's such a terrible writer."
00:14:22,00:14:23,We love the Beatles.
00:14:23,00:14:25,We love Kubrick and the Beatles.
00:14:25,00:14:26,But you know--
00:14:26,00:14:28,The top thing thing.
00:14:28,00:14:32,I read one theory that it was because Paul and John were fighting
00:14:32,00:14:34,over who got to play Gander.
00:14:34,00:14:36,[LAUGHTER]
00:14:36,00:14:40,"Yeah, that was what a tourer did part of it."
00:14:40,00:14:40,That's great.
00:14:40,00:14:42,Some things on fancy dress.
00:14:42,00:14:42,Yeah.
00:14:42,00:14:43,"Oh, we're here."
00:14:43,00:14:47,"There's a lady called Sharnie Christy, who lives in Kent."
00:14:47,00:14:50,"And she has a phobia of people in costumes,"
00:14:50,00:14:55,which the newspaper article called Metamphysomiophobia.
00:14:55,00:14:56,And she works in theatre.
00:14:56,00:15:01,[LAUGHTER]
00:15:01,00:15:03,"So she said, people think it's quite funny"
00:15:03,00:15:05,that I'm working in something that means I'm
00:15:05,00:15:07,around people in costume all the time.
00:15:07,00:15:10,I have to watch people get dressed in costume in order
00:15:10,00:15:14,to reassure myself that I know who they are.
00:15:14,00:15:15,"So she has to watch them get changed,"
00:15:15,00:15:18,just so she knows it's not a fantastic excuse
00:15:18,00:15:19,of being a pervert.
00:15:19,00:15:20,I'm not saying that.
00:15:20,00:15:21,Yeah.
00:15:21,00:15:24,"But also-- so she's not only got a fear of people in costume,"
00:15:24,00:15:26,she suddenly recognizes them as the character
00:15:26,00:15:27,that they're playing.
00:15:27,00:15:27,Yes.
00:15:27,00:15:29,So she's like at the Lion King.
00:15:29,00:15:32,"She'll be like, hey, Mike, have a good Symbol."
00:15:32,00:15:33,Let's evacuate to this.
00:15:33,00:15:37,There's a Lion Loan.
00:15:37,00:15:37,Is that the zoo?
00:15:37,00:15:38,It's me.
00:15:38,00:15:40,"Yes, me again."
00:15:40,00:15:42,Every night for the same.
00:15:42,00:15:43,"Hello, LemonZoo."
00:15:43,00:15:46,There are a lot of cats everywhere.
00:15:46,00:15:47,Do you say hats?
00:15:47,00:15:48,"No, cats."
00:15:48,00:15:59,I want to know when people started dressing
00:15:59,00:16:01,as really crazy things.
00:16:01,00:16:06,Because they used to dress as aristocracy
00:16:06,00:16:08,or people from different ancient Greeks.
00:16:08,00:16:11,You would dress up as ancient Greeks or Trojans.
00:16:11,00:16:13,And I think I've pinned down one early date
00:16:13,00:16:17,"in terms of dressing as crazy things, which was 1745."
00:16:17,00:16:21,King Louis the 15th of France had a masked ball at Versailles.
00:16:21,00:16:23,"There were 15,000 guests."
00:16:23,00:16:26,And everyone was in nice dresses and with masked.
00:16:26,00:16:29,But he and several of his goughtiers turned up dressed
00:16:29,00:16:31,"as clipped ""you"" hedges."
00:16:31,00:16:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:16:35,00:16:37,Is that you?
00:16:37,00:16:41,And I think that's the year 0 for dressing as stupid stuff.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"And just speaking of French, fancy dress."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Do you know the Charles the Fourth of France,"
00:16:47,00:16:51,"the story of the dance of the burning men, actually?"
00:16:51,00:16:53,This was a fancy dress party.
00:16:53,00:16:56,And Charles the Fourth and the load of his goughtiers
00:16:56,00:17:00,"came dressed as sabbages, which meant they blacked up."
00:17:00,00:17:03,And they covered themselves in pitch tar
00:17:03,00:17:06,and they chained themselves together.
00:17:06,00:17:08,"And then when they arrived at the party, one of the other guests"
00:17:08,00:17:11,wanted to see have a good look at their costume.
00:17:11,00:17:14,So he went up to them with a naked flame.
00:17:14,00:17:16,And they were all wearing pitch tar.
00:17:16,00:17:18,And they were all chained together.
00:17:18,00:17:20,And they all went up.
00:17:20,00:17:23,And I think two people were burned alive.
00:17:23,00:17:26,Two people died within days of their injuries.
00:17:26,00:17:29,"And it really-- like he was pretty mad to self-ly,"
00:17:29,00:17:31,"but that really ticked him, although."
00:17:31,00:17:32,Wow.
00:17:32,00:17:34,Fancy dresses are dangerous games.
00:17:34,00:17:36,You shouldn't do it.
00:17:36,00:17:39,"Americans got really into fancy dress in the 19th century,"
00:17:39,00:17:40,didn't they?
00:17:40,00:17:44,And they would dress up as European aristocracy and wear.
00:17:44,00:17:45,So it was like--
00:17:45,00:17:47,"I think the general consensus is, because people weren't"
00:17:47,00:17:48,really doing it in Europe.
00:17:48,00:17:50,The America didn't really have at that time
00:17:50,00:17:54,an aristocracy or a history of its own in terms of--
00:17:54,00:17:56,"you know, it didn't have a great nebility."
00:17:56,00:17:57,It didn't have all these big families.
00:17:57,00:18:00,And so it kind of-- what was the quote?
00:18:00,00:18:01,It bought its own history.
00:18:01,00:18:04,"And so people would buy, like Mary Antoinette's,"
00:18:04,00:18:07,"genuine jewels and costumes, and then go wearing them to parties."
00:18:07,00:18:09,"And you'd go to a party with like 1,200 guests,"
00:18:09,00:18:11,like the Vanderbilties to hold these amazing parties
00:18:11,00:18:12,in the 19th century.
00:18:12,00:18:14,And it would be a competition as to who
00:18:14,00:18:16,had the most genuine artefacts that
00:18:16,00:18:19,used to belong to a great British king or a great friend
00:18:19,00:18:21,ruler or--
00:18:21,00:18:23,"Yeah, so it used to be a bigger deal than just buying"
00:18:23,00:18:29,"a £10 plastic, which is costume, the local Scotland."
00:18:29,00:18:30,Honebes.
00:18:30,00:18:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:31,00:18:33,Honebes were in the original fact.
00:18:33,00:18:34,That's what they were.
00:18:34,00:18:36,"Yeah, they dressed up as Honebes."
00:18:36,00:18:39,This is just because I discovered coincidentally last week
00:18:39,00:18:46,that pollution in the sea and then in the seas at the poles
00:18:46,00:18:49,is contaminating various wildlife there.
00:18:49,00:18:52,And Honebes' penises are getting weaker.
00:18:52,00:18:54,Their penis bones are being shrunken.
00:18:54,00:18:58,"Well, they say that, but it is cold up there."
00:18:58,00:19:02,They really don't need that expert skew.
00:19:02,00:19:03,It's getting warmer though.
00:19:03,00:19:05,And that's true.
00:19:05,00:19:08,"So the female polar bears are going, it's getting warmer."
00:19:08,00:19:09,That's still nothing.
00:19:09,00:19:12,"Well, well, well, where is it?"
00:19:12,00:19:15,You've been promising me for two million years.
00:19:15,00:19:19,And yet it's the pollutants.
00:19:19,00:19:20,That's what they claim.
00:19:20,00:19:21,"They don't know why quite a bit of us have penis bones,"
00:19:21,00:19:23,but they are getting smaller.
00:19:23,00:19:26,And they think it's going to do some kind of damage.
00:19:26,00:19:28,"Most animals have penis bones, don't they?"
00:19:28,00:19:31,"No, they don't."
00:19:31,00:19:33,Most of us on this panel--
00:19:33,00:19:35,"Oh, most of animals have penis bones."
00:19:35,00:19:36,"Yes, yes."
00:19:36,00:19:39,And in the Victorian times they wore badger penis bones
00:19:39,00:19:41,as typums.
00:19:41,00:19:43,Yeah.
00:19:43,00:19:46,Have you seen a walrus penis bone?
00:19:46,00:19:47,I've held one.
00:19:47,00:19:48,They're extraordinary.
00:19:48,00:19:50,I was thinking of the walrus at the time.
00:19:50,00:19:59,"When the walrus asks, just say no, Dan."
00:19:59,00:20:04,"I was out of fancy dress, and I was saying this was walrus."
00:20:04,00:20:05,OK.
00:20:05,00:20:07,"Hey, very quickly, this is just to bring it back"
00:20:07,00:20:10,to Tolkien and CS Lewis.
00:20:10,00:20:16,CS Lewis died the same day as Aldous Hotsley.
00:20:16,00:20:19,We lost two literary juggernauts that day.
00:20:19,00:20:22,And it kind of really didn't register with anyone
00:20:22,00:20:25,"because someone else died that day, JFK."
00:20:25,00:20:27,And they just completely--
00:20:27,00:20:30,"no one actually knows they're dead yet as a result, yeah."
00:20:30,00:20:31,"All right, so in the Guinness Book of Regals,"
00:20:31,00:20:33,we're all just writers.
00:20:33,00:20:34,Yeah.
00:20:34,00:20:35,[LAUGHTER]
00:20:35,00:20:37,Hotsley in this.
00:20:37,00:20:38,We need to move on because we're really
00:20:38,00:20:41,running past our time here.
00:20:41,00:20:43,"OK, time for fact number three."
00:20:43,00:20:46,And that is Andrew Hunter Murray.
00:20:46,00:20:49,My fact is about Agatha Christie.
00:20:49,00:20:51,And it's that Agatha Christie thought
00:20:51,00:20:54,"that Hercules Poirot, her most famous creation,"
00:20:54,00:20:58,"was a, quote, ""detestable, bombastic, tiresome,"
00:20:58,00:21:01,"egocentric little creep."""
00:21:01,00:21:05,She hated him from quite early on as well in her career.
00:21:05,00:21:08,And she wrote an essay called Why I Got Fed Up With Poirot.
00:21:08,00:21:10,"And she really, really didn't like him."
00:21:10,00:21:14,"And she wrote his death story in 1945, which"
00:21:14,00:21:16,was 30 years before she died.
00:21:16,00:21:17,So she wanted to write it quite early.
00:21:17,00:21:20,"And she left instructions that when she died,"
00:21:20,00:21:21,that story should be published.
00:21:21,00:21:25,So she would take him down with her.
00:21:25,00:21:26,Absolutely.
00:21:26,00:21:29,And she even kept the manuscripts in a bank vault.
00:21:29,00:21:32,That's how much she disliked Poirot's character.
00:21:32,00:21:34,"And then when she was 85 with her own hell failing,"
00:21:34,00:21:37,"she decided to publish it so that she would outlive him,"
00:21:37,00:21:40,"I think, is what I think she wanted to do."
00:21:40,00:21:43,"But when she did publish the story,"
00:21:43,00:21:46,"Poirot got a front page obituary in The New York Times,"
00:21:46,00:21:49,"which I think is, might be, even more than she got."
00:21:49,00:21:50,So really?
00:21:50,00:21:51,"Yeah, I'm not sure."
00:21:51,00:21:54,"I don't know why she was role news day, isn't it?"
00:21:54,00:21:57,It's the only fictional obituary they've ever published.
00:21:57,00:21:58,Yeah.
00:21:58,00:22:02,"And so even in death, he was really, really famous."
00:22:02,00:22:05,And she couldn't get away to properly block him on the head.
00:22:05,00:22:08,Was it from page of the obituary section?
00:22:08,00:22:08,Nope.
00:22:08,00:22:09,It was from page of the paper.
00:22:09,00:22:10,Of the paper.
00:22:10,00:22:11,Yeah.
00:22:11,00:22:12,Jesus.
00:22:12,00:22:13,We say they're dumbing down today.
00:22:13,00:22:15,That's what I was talking about.
00:22:15,00:22:18,It is weird when you hear authors hating
00:22:18,00:22:19,those central characters.
00:22:19,00:22:20,Yeah.
00:22:20,00:22:21,"When you didn't know, don't they?"
00:22:21,00:22:24,Who was Sherlock Holmes?
00:22:24,00:22:26,"Yeah, Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock."
00:22:26,00:22:30,"And then, did you hear what chaos that created"
00:22:30,00:22:32,when he killed off Sherlock Holmes?
00:22:32,00:22:33,"I've got, yeah, I found a bunch of stuff."
00:22:33,00:22:37,"Basically, he just got, so he killed him off."
00:22:37,00:22:40,"And then all these letters came in, which one began,"
00:22:40,00:22:43,"you brute, like they just treated it as if it was real."
00:22:43,00:22:45,I'm like the trolling of its day.
00:22:45,00:22:46,Yeah.
00:22:46,00:22:47,"It's a writer letter to someone saying,"
00:22:47,00:22:48,you brute.
00:22:48,00:22:49,Yeah.
00:22:49,00:22:52,"A lady picketed his house, fans wore black iron bands,"
00:22:52,00:22:55,"20,000 people canceled their subscriptions to the strand"
00:22:55,00:23:00,"magazine, which was being published as a periodical."
00:23:00,00:23:02,"And yeah, and then I guess he eventually brought it back."
00:23:02,00:23:06,But that must have been a confusing time.
00:23:06,00:23:08,"So, A.M.L. really hated Winnie the Pooh."
00:23:08,00:23:10,"Winnie the Pooh, yeah."
00:23:10,00:23:11,That's so cruel.
00:23:11,00:23:13,"Everyone hated Winnie the Pooh, didn't they?"
00:23:13,00:23:14,Did they?
00:23:14,00:23:16,All of its creations.
00:23:16,00:23:18,"A.M.L hated Winnie the Pooh, Christopher Robin."
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Yeah, he well played."
00:23:19,00:23:21,"So, I mean, his life was kind of ruined by the fact"
00:23:21,00:23:22,that he was Christopher Robin.
00:23:22,00:23:25,"And he always resented, I think that's it."
00:23:25,00:23:27,"So, how was Christopher Robin, A.M.L.?"
00:23:27,00:23:28,"Sun, yeah."
00:23:28,00:23:29,"Yeah, he resented that."
00:23:29,00:23:32,"And the guy did the illustrations, who was fine by his name,"
00:23:32,00:23:36,"but he said, E.H. Shepherd, ruined his life as well,"
00:23:36,00:23:38,"ruined his career, everyone defined him by Winnie the Pooh."
00:23:38,00:23:40,"Did they all have meetings where they're going,"
00:23:40,00:23:42,not this shit again?
00:23:42,00:23:44,If only we could stop doing it somewhere.
00:23:44,00:23:50,And the other thing that Mill hated about it was that it made people think
00:23:50,00:23:52,that he liked children.
00:23:52,00:23:58,"And he said, I have never felt in the least sentimental about them."
00:23:58,00:24:01,"So, but he did have a son."
00:24:01,00:24:04,"Yeah, I was taking dictations and he was really into that."
00:24:04,00:24:06,"Take a note, it's a crap."
00:24:06,00:24:08,"And yeah, the very difficult relationship with his side,"
00:24:08,00:24:12,"which kind of, you know, seems to be explained by this sensation."
00:24:12,00:24:15,"And so, one thing you can do, if you really dislike your character,"
00:24:15,00:24:16,this is something that Agatha Christie did.
00:24:16,00:24:17,I love this.
00:24:17,00:24:21,"She put a version of herself in her own books,"
00:24:21,00:24:25,a mystery novelist called Ariadne Oliver.
00:24:25,00:24:27,"And in the novels that Agatha Christie wrote,"
00:24:27,00:24:30,"this fictional novelist, Ariadne Oliver,"
00:24:30,00:24:32,"hates her most famous creation,"
00:24:32,00:24:37,"who is a vegetarian, finished detective called Sven Herson,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"who, and she appears in six novels,"
00:24:40,00:24:43,"this character who hates her, her main character."
00:24:43,00:24:47,"And she, Oliver says, if I ever met that bony, gangling,"
00:24:47,00:24:49,"vegetable eating fin in real life,"
00:24:49,00:24:52,I'd do a better murder than any I've ever invented.
00:24:52,00:24:53,That's a really good idea.
00:24:53,00:24:54,This is how much she'd disliked it.
00:24:54,00:24:57,"It's a really good idea of putting yourself in novels,"
00:24:57,00:25:00,"and then, like, and then the guy said,"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"oh, easy jitter, idiot, something."
00:25:02,00:25:05,"Everything that you're annoyed with, you could put in your book."
00:25:05,00:25:08,"Another person who hates your creation now is Annie Prue,"
00:25:08,00:25:09,"who wrote, broke that mountain."
00:25:09,00:25:12,"Oh, yeah, because of fan fiction."
00:25:12,00:25:13,So she hates the fact now.
00:25:13,00:25:15,So she was like nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
00:25:15,00:25:17,She wrote this brilliant short story.
00:25:17,00:25:19,"And she says she wish she'd never done it,"
00:25:19,00:25:21,"because she's plagued by fan fiction now,"
00:25:21,00:25:24,by people writing either sequels to broke that mountain
00:25:24,00:25:26,or alternative endings to broke that mountain.
00:25:26,00:25:28,"And she said, the vast majority of them are people"
00:25:28,00:25:29,"who, so the majority of them are people"
00:25:29,00:25:33,"who start their letters with, I'm not gay, but."
00:25:33,00:25:34,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:34,00:25:36,"And then go on to give an alternative ending,"
00:25:36,00:25:38,"by the two male characters then, up together."
00:25:38,00:25:42,"I've written an intense searing homo-erotic series of, yeah, yeah."
00:25:42,00:25:44,And I've never written anything before in my life.
00:25:44,00:25:46,"And that's not the point-- yeah, yeah."
00:25:46,00:25:47,It's not weird.
00:25:47,00:25:48,"Oh, yeah."
00:25:48,00:25:50,"It's just every day, I'm more homo-erotic"
00:25:50,00:25:53,than to different people saying they're not gay.
00:25:53,00:25:55,"But it does-- yeah, there are, I think,"
00:25:55,00:25:58,more than 100 sequels to Pride and Prejudice.
00:25:58,00:26:01,"And obviously, it's been 200 years, so there's a lot."
00:26:01,00:26:05,"But in one of them, Elizabeth Darcy, as she becomes,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"is widowed, Darcy is dead."
00:26:07,00:26:11,And then she has to defend England from invasion
00:26:11,00:26:15,by Napoleon in a fleet of hot air balloons.
00:26:15,00:26:16,And I've never tracked down this book.
00:26:16,00:26:18,"But if I do, I am reading the hell out of it."
00:26:18,00:26:19,It sounds so good.
00:26:19,00:26:21,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:21,00:26:23,"And we need to move on, guys, by the way."
00:26:23,00:26:26,But if anyone-- does anyone have anything else?
00:26:26,00:26:27,Nothing that's short enough.
00:26:27,00:26:29,"I've got-- I've got-- I've just one last thing, which"
00:26:29,00:26:31,"is I really like when, as you're saying,"
00:26:31,00:26:33,Poirot goes on the front page of newspapers.
00:26:33,00:26:36,I love it when these characters seep into the real world.
00:26:36,00:26:40,"And there's a thing I read that, which is The Met."
00:26:40,00:26:43,"And all crime departments in Britain, or the police,"
00:26:43,00:26:45,"they use a national computer system, which"
00:26:45,00:26:48,"is developed, basically, for major crime inquiries."
00:26:48,00:26:49,All the British forces use it.
00:26:49,00:26:53,And it's called the Home Office Large Major Inquiry System.
00:26:53,00:26:57,But everyone refers to it by acronym Homes.
00:26:57,00:26:58,So quite nice.
00:26:58,00:27:00,"And there, as well, is a training program"
00:27:00,00:27:04,for it called Elementary.
00:27:04,00:27:06,Should we move on to the final?
00:27:06,00:27:07,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:07,00:27:08,OK.
00:27:08,00:27:10,Time for our final fact of the show.
00:27:10,00:27:12,And that is my fact.
00:27:12,00:27:14,So we've been talking about books this whole time.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"So I thought I'd find a fact, which"
00:27:15,00:27:18,"was about the enemy of the books, the television."
00:27:18,00:27:22,"So my fact is that before he invented the television,"
00:27:22,00:27:25,John Logie Baird invented a pair of socks
00:27:25,00:27:27,to wear underneath your socks.
00:27:27,00:27:30,[LAUGHTER]
00:27:30,00:27:35,And who can say which history will judge the greater invention?
00:27:35,00:27:36,I'm not calling it.
00:27:36,00:27:40,"I just-- I love that fact, because I just think that's--"
00:27:40,00:27:42,"because if you look at the history of his inventions,"
00:27:42,00:27:46,"as well, prior to the television, he invented, as well,"
00:27:46,00:27:49,"a razor, which was rust proof."
00:27:49,00:27:52,"You could never make it rust, but it never ended up selling"
00:27:52,00:27:55,"because it was made of glass, and it shattered on people's"
00:27:55,00:27:57,basis and ended up passing it.
00:27:57,00:27:58,OK.
00:27:58,00:28:00,He made a glass razor.
00:28:00,00:28:03,"It doesn't rust, but it slices your face off."
00:28:03,00:28:05,"It slices your face off, yeah."
00:28:05,00:28:08,He made some pneumatic shoes that had balloons in them
00:28:08,00:28:11,that he thought they'd pull your feet off.
00:28:11,00:28:12,But just that's his history.
00:28:12,00:28:16,"And then suddenly, the television, it just makes no sense."
00:28:16,00:28:17,"But the socks were actually quite good, wasn't they?"
00:28:17,00:28:18,They were amazing.
00:28:18,00:28:20,"Yeah, how did they work?"
00:28:20,00:28:23,So they're not designed to protect against moisture
00:28:23,00:28:24,from the outside.
00:28:24,00:28:26,It's the moisture that your feet create
00:28:26,00:28:28,when you're walking around the day.
00:28:28,00:28:30,"So they were for soldiers in the First World War,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,"and they're sprinkled with a chemical called Borax,"
00:28:32,00:28:36,which absorbs the moisture from your foot.
00:28:36,00:28:38,"So you put it under your foot, facing upwards as a way."
00:28:38,00:28:40,"You put it on that way, then you put your sock over that,"
00:28:40,00:28:41,then your shoe over that.
00:28:41,00:28:43,"And soldiers in the trenches swore by it,"
00:28:43,00:28:45,and it made him a huge amount of money.
00:28:45,00:28:48,It's what let him resign his job as an electrical engineer.
00:28:48,00:28:49,Yeah.
00:28:49,00:28:52,"One soldier said, I find the bird on the socks"
00:28:52,00:28:56,keep my feet in splendid condition out here in France.
00:28:56,00:28:58,"Foot trouble is one of our worst enemies,"
00:28:58,00:29:00,"but thanks to the bird on the sock,"
00:29:00,00:29:02,mine are in the pink.
00:29:02,00:29:05,"Now, we can just make an anti-jermen sock"
00:29:05,00:29:07,then put my father worst enemy in my house.
00:29:07,00:29:10,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:10,00:29:13,It's a joke.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"It does rather, yeah, the worst enemy being foot trouble is."
00:29:17,00:29:18,That's a sense of letter.
00:29:18,00:29:21,I would have changed it.
00:29:21,00:29:22,And through the officers.
00:29:25,00:29:28,But he advertised them in the newspaper
00:29:28,00:29:30,and managed to sell one pair doing that.
00:29:30,00:29:32,So initially it was a complete failure.
00:29:32,00:29:35,And then he built a plywood tank
00:29:35,00:29:37,and carried it around the streets of Glasgow
00:29:37,00:29:40,with the bed under sock written on the side.
00:29:40,00:29:41,And then he sold loads.
00:29:41,00:29:42,Yeah.
00:29:42,00:29:43,"This was during the war, though, wasn't it?"
00:29:43,00:29:45,"So like, a big tank going through the streets"
00:29:45,00:29:47,you got down through in the war.
00:29:47,00:29:49,People look at scary.
00:29:49,00:29:52,"So he made these socks, and then he got ill for a while, didn't he?"
00:29:52,00:29:54,"And then when he got better, he suddenly"
00:29:54,00:29:56,realized he had loads of money in his account
00:29:56,00:29:58,because people had bought all these socks.
00:29:58,00:29:58,Will he win us?
00:29:58,00:29:59,That's what he was.
00:29:59,00:30:00,Didn't he go away?
00:30:00,00:30:01,"Oh, gone away."
00:30:01,00:30:05,"But when he got all this money, he went to Trinidad."
00:30:05,00:30:08,And he started up a jam factory.
00:30:08,00:30:13,"Unfortunately, the local insect life either ran off with the sugar"
00:30:13,00:30:16,or landed in the hot fats and boiling preserve.
00:30:16,00:30:17,Wow.
00:30:17,00:30:18,I think I read.
00:30:18,00:30:21,"And so it never took off, because it was just insects."
00:30:21,00:30:23,Just full of insects.
00:30:23,00:30:26,And so he lost a bit of money from that and then came back.
00:30:26,00:30:28,And then it was when he invented television.
00:30:28,00:30:32,"When he came back before inventing television,"
00:30:32,00:30:34,he had the sock business and the--
00:30:34,00:30:35,The razor?
00:30:35,00:30:37,The jam and the razor.
00:30:37,00:30:40,And he then had 200 quid left.
00:30:40,00:30:41,He was really broke.
00:30:41,00:30:45,"So he decided to buy two tons of Australian honey, cheap,"
00:30:45,00:30:48,and selling it for people.
00:30:48,00:30:50,And then he bought a ton of soap and he sold that.
00:30:50,00:30:51,Wow.
00:30:51,00:30:53,And then television.
00:30:53,00:30:54,Complete out of no way.
00:30:54,00:30:56,"To be fair, the television thing was something"
00:30:56,00:30:59,that he really dreamed about making quite early on.
00:30:59,00:31:00,And he couldn't do it.
00:31:00,00:31:04,So he had all these other businesses that went along the way.
00:31:04,00:31:05,So they were just kind of maybe a smoke screen.
00:31:05,00:31:08,There's other inventions to throw people off the sand.
00:31:08,00:31:12,"They absolutely were in that, as well as when he would just"
00:31:12,00:31:14,make these other things.
00:31:14,00:31:16,"When he was making the TV, any time he had a photo"
00:31:16,00:31:19,"where he was showing how he was making the TV,"
00:31:19,00:31:21,he would put in fake objects.
00:31:21,00:31:23,"So that no one who saw the photo could go, OK,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,so he's got that and got that.
00:31:24,00:31:25,So he would misplace.
00:31:25,00:31:27,"Oh, yeah, yeah."
00:31:27,00:31:28,He was so unique.
00:31:28,00:31:30,"OK, so it looks like he needs two tons of cheap Australian"
00:31:30,00:31:33,honey to get the TV to work.
00:31:33,00:31:37,How has he done that?
00:31:37,00:31:38,Where did the socks go?
00:31:38,00:31:38,I don't know.
00:31:38,00:31:43,He was saying about the electricity.
00:31:43,00:31:45,"When he was working in Glasgow, he decided"
00:31:45,00:31:47,to try and make artificial diamonds
00:31:47,00:31:51,by passing electricity through a stick of graphite.
00:31:51,00:31:54,And he put so much electricity through the stick of graphite
00:31:54,00:31:57,that he caused a blackout over the whole of Glasgow.
00:31:57,00:31:58,Wow.
00:31:58,00:32:00,"There's a weird coincidence in his life, as well."
00:32:00,00:32:02,Just one of those tiny things that's actually--
00:32:02,00:32:06,it's quite nice when you discover it.
00:32:06,00:32:09,He went to school with a guy who was called--
00:32:09,00:32:12,so this was his classmate.
00:32:12,00:32:12,This is his actual classmate.
00:32:12,00:32:16,"He went to school with a guy called J.C.W. Rief,"
00:32:16,00:32:19,who we now know as Lord Rief.
00:32:19,00:32:21,"So basically, the inventor of the television"
00:32:21,00:32:24,went to school with the man who defined television
00:32:24,00:32:26,for the BBC in England.
00:32:26,00:32:28,That's an absolutely insane coincidence.
00:32:28,00:32:31,And he got bullied by Lord Rief all the time.
00:32:31,00:32:32,He just bullied the hell out of him.
00:32:32,00:32:35,And Lord Rief's parents had to pull him out of school
00:32:35,00:32:37,because he was just too much of a menace in that school.
00:32:37,00:32:38,"Wow, really?"
00:32:38,00:32:40,Lord Rief was a bit of a--
00:32:40,00:32:42,"He was a bully, yeah."
00:32:42,00:32:43,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:32:43,00:32:44,That's a jolly good thing.
00:32:44,00:32:45,I'll get back at him.
00:32:45,00:32:47,I'll invent something that's so good.
00:32:47,00:32:50,He won't ever be able to take part in it.
00:32:50,00:32:52,He'll have nothing.
00:32:52,00:32:55,I've read-- I cannot believe this is true.
00:32:55,00:33:00,"That originally, when the BBC sent out experimental"
00:33:00,00:33:03,"transmissions, which was in 1929, that John Lugabaird"
00:33:03,00:33:07,had to pay the BBC to transmit his images.
00:33:07,00:33:08,"Right, he's just so topsy to--"
00:33:08,00:33:10,"Or be cut, yeah, but like Lord Rief."
00:33:10,00:33:12,For as much as he's done for TV--
00:33:12,00:33:14,"and if you haven't heard the name Lord Rief,"
00:33:14,00:33:17,"in this country, most people have him assuming."
00:33:17,00:33:19,He's the guy who absolutely defined how
00:33:19,00:33:21,BBC became the thing that it is.
00:33:21,00:33:22,He hated television.
00:33:22,00:33:23,"Yeah, of course he did."
00:33:23,00:33:28,"Yeah, as you know, we know Baird, isn't it?"
00:33:28,00:33:30,"His salary was £5,000 and a mean wedgie."
00:33:30,00:33:33,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:33,00:33:37,"Just on author's early inventions and early careers,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,"before they did the thing that we know them for,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,can I tell you very quickly about Daniel DeFoe?
00:33:40,00:33:41,"Yes, please."
00:33:41,00:33:43,"OK, his early jobs--"
00:33:43,00:33:46,and obviously Robinson Crusoe and the general of the plague
00:33:46,00:33:48,"gear, all these incredible works."
00:33:48,00:33:52,"Before that, his early jobs included selling hosiery,"
00:33:52,00:33:54,"dealing wine, investing in a diving bell"
00:33:54,00:33:57,"to recover sunken treasure, and harvesting"
00:33:57,00:34:01,musk from the anal glands of cats.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Did she say hats?
00:34:02,00:34:03,No.
00:34:03,00:34:04,No.
00:34:04,00:34:05,No.
00:34:05,00:34:11,[LAUGHTER]
00:34:11,00:34:13,It really happened with this.
00:34:13,00:34:17,"In 1692, he bought 70 civic cats, but 850 quid,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,"because the Dutch made perfume using the musk, which"
00:34:20,00:34:23,they secrete as the base ingredient.
00:34:23,00:34:24,And he hated them.
00:34:24,00:34:26,"And then to get the musk, an attendant"
00:34:26,00:34:29,had to put them in a special cage so they could only face one
00:34:29,00:34:29,way.
00:34:29,00:34:31,They couldn't turn around.
00:34:31,00:34:34,"And then, I'm quoting here, I used a spatula"
00:34:34,00:34:36,to scrape out the butter-like secretion
00:34:36,00:34:40,that gathered in a pouch between the tail and the anus.
00:34:40,00:34:43,"And then he lost the cats, because he didn't even own them."
00:34:43,00:34:44,He didn't taste them properly.
00:34:44,00:34:46,He got them more money by borrowing it.
00:34:46,00:34:49,"And then, to keep them, he defrauded his own mothering"
00:34:49,00:34:53,"law, who then sued him, like he was a disaster."
00:34:53,00:34:55,But that was his-- yeah.
00:34:55,00:34:57,So whose cat-- they were just wandering cats?
00:34:57,00:34:59,"No, they were owned by someone else."
00:34:59,00:35:00,And he bought them with borrowed money.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"And then someone else said, no, I want my cats back."
00:35:02,00:35:04,"You can use them, but you don't own them."
00:35:04,00:35:06,"And also, where's their anal butter?"
00:35:06,00:35:08,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:08,00:35:09,We've been stealing that.
00:35:09,00:35:11,I can't believe it's not civic cat-able butter.
00:35:11,00:35:13,[LAUGHTER]
00:35:13,00:35:25,We're going to have to wrap up.
00:35:25,00:35:26,"OK, that's it."
00:35:26,00:35:27,That's all of our facts.
00:35:27,00:35:29,Thank you so much for listening.
