00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:19,160
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,760
 to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,040
 My name is Dan Shriver, I'm sitting here with Anacizansky, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,400
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our board-favorite facts from

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,240
 the last seven days, and in no particular order, here we go.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,720
 Starting with you, Chazinsky.

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,500
 My fact is that Kaiser Wilhelm once lost a valuable arms contract for Germany because he

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,880
 slapped the King of Bulgaria on the bottom.

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,040
 This was the thing he did.

11
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,880
 He liked to slap people on the ass, so the King of Bulgaria was ferdinand at the time,

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,360
 and he visited, and apparently he was wearing his Colonel's uniform, which had been made

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,200
 when he was a bit slimmer, so he'd put on some extra weight, and he was leaning out of

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,280
 the palace window in Germany, and Kaiser Wilhelm noticed that his unmentionables were tight,

15
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,480
 and so he slapped him on the ass.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,440
 So his unmentionables are another way for trousers, aren't they?

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,160
 Well, I think it was, so the historian says, he noticed that his unmentionables were tight,

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,000
 so when he leaned out of the window, he presented a mark so tempting that the Emperor administered

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,280
 a resounding spank on the sacred seat of the King.

20
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,640
 Anyway, he was very, very angry, and he then awarded an arms contract to someone else

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,320
 that had been going to go to Germany as a result, so prank kind of backfired.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,240
 Yeah, but he did, so he was a big bottom slapper, wasn't he?

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
 He loved to slap bottoms, yes.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,360
 Yeah, I read that he had a secret society, the White Stagdining Club, so the idea behind

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,640
 that is that when you were trying to gain admission, you'd have to tell a vulgar joke,

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,560
 and then present your buck to the Kaiser, who would then slap it, and then you were allowed

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
 in.

28
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,240
 So I already smacked you on the bum with the flat of his sword, which is a bit important

29
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
 to get the flat.

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
 Yeah, absolutely.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:03,720
 Another death tonight of the White Stagdining Club, when the King cut yet another man into

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,120
 was with Ferdinand, was that with his hand, or was it?

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,720
 That was with his hand, so the flat of the sword was the White Stagdining Club, but just

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,120
 casually with acquaintances, it was the flat of the hand.

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,120
 So just explain Anna who Kaiser Philhelm was.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,720
 So, Kaiser Philhelm, as you correctly pronounce it, Kaiser Philhelm, the second, was Kaiser

37
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:29,960
 of Germany was King of Germany until 1918, when there was a revolution that eventually led

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,640
 to the rise of the Nazis, etc.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,640
 Yeah.

40
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,000
 Kaiser Philhelm, the second, was also the Colonel in Chief of the Royal Dragoons at the start

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,600
 of the First World War, and didn't turn up, obviously, for duty, because he was the Kaiser

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 of Germany.

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,360
 So there were lots of things like that, because the Royal families were so mixed up.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
 So he was the cousin of George V, the King.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,080
 Wasn't he the cousin of this guy who he slapped on the ass as well, or are they unrelated?

46
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,080
 Yeah.

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,080
 Well, Ferdinand.

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 Yeah.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,080
 Oh.

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,680
 He was the cousin of Nicholas II, the Zara of Russia.

51
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,560
 It was this incredible time when everyone was related to each other.

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
 Yeah.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,560
 Well, that's always been royal families in New York, isn't it?

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
 True.

55
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,920
 They love the old incest.

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
 He was.

57
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,560
 He cut some weird company, and he was into some quite camp activities.

58
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,880
 There was quite a famous incident when he was being entertained, so he liked to address

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,600
 like, he had like 400 different military uniforms, he liked to dress up, and he changed outfits

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,040
 four or five times a day.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,600
 He redesigned the German military uniform, something like 37 times in 17 years.

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,360
 He was just obsessed with it.

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
 Love dressing up.

64
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,960
 I love that idea that, you know, you get armies who don't really know if they're all on

65
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
 the same side.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
 Yeah.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
 Because they've had a redesign.

68
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
 Yeah.

69
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
 Wait, are we supposed to be killing you?

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
 What?

71
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
 Are you wearing March's collection?

72
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
 We're not wearing June.

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,000
 Apparently, whenever we get plum-pudding, he always wore the uniform of a British admiral.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,320
 He was insane.

75
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,800
 He was totally insane.

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,280
 And he hit other people as well in public.

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,960
 So he hit the Grand Duke Vladimir, who was a Russian Grand Duke, on the back with the

78
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,760
 Field Marshal's baton in 1904.

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,760
 Wow.

80
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,520
 I mean, he was quite wild, but he didn't really respect anything.

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,880
 One bum slapping, so for Chinese Lunar New Year, then Taoist visit this temple where they

82
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,160
 go to get a richly slapped or whipped.

83
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,320
 So men are slapped and women are whipped by the temple staff, and that means good luck all

84
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
 year round.

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,800
 And thousands of people go to this temple to get slapped every year on the bum.

86
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
 On the bottom.

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,320
 According to the church, it is an okay thing to slap your child's bop.

88
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
 Is it?

89
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,320
 Bop?

90
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 As long as you call it bop.

91
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
 Come here.

92
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
 Give us your bop.

93
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,320
 Bop.

94
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
 Wait, is thisâ€¦

95
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
 This was the pope.

96
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
 Yes, always the pope.

97
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,520
 But the pope was also said, "If you make fun of my mum, I'll punch you in the face."

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,520
 What?

99
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,520
 Yeah, he did.

100
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
 Didn't you see that?

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,520
 No.

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
 He said, "This was after the Charlie Hebdo thing."

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,040
 He said, "If you make fun of my mum, you can expect a bunch."

104
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 And then he sort of joshed with a cardinal, standing next to him, sort of miming hitting him

105
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
 on the face.

106
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,960
 Was it a metaphor for, if you make fun of religion, then people attack you?

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
 Yeah.

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,080
 So, Azda's buttock slap has been copyrighted, no trademark.

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,320
 So you know the adverts where they go, they have a little jingle and then someone slaps

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,320
 it.

111
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,320
 Like that.

112
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
 Yeah.

113
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
 Yeah.

114
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,280
 So, for the purposes of advertising meat, fish, poultry, game, coffee, tea, bread, agricultural,

115
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,440
 horticultural and forestry products and other items, you can't use a buttock slap unless

116
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
 you're Azda.

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
 Did you say forestry?

118
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
 Forestry product.

119
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,680
 You can't sell a tree with that.

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,440
 But we all know that's the best way to sell a tree.

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,440
 Please buy a tree.

122
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,320
 Can you fit it right in your back pocket?

123
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
 Is the slap suggesting you're hitting your wallet?

124
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,260
 Yeah, it's like, I've spent not that much money, so I still have some money left in my back

125
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
 pocket.

126
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,260
 I know I'm going to slap it.

127
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,400
 But also, I don't keep my money safely in a purse or wallet, I keep it in loose change

128
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
 in my pocket.

129
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
 Yes.

130
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
 That's the other implication.

131
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
 So it implies you're a bit fun as well.

132
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,680
 I never read into that second meaning, I have to say, I thought Dan asked him out the first

133
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
 meaning was quite obvious.

134
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,480
 I thought it was like a dad, so everyone at Azda has a fun ass.

135
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,480
 Yeah.

136
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,480
 I don't know.

137
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,240
 I just thought it was everyone needs a thing, you can't explain it sometimes.

138
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,000
 You ask a band why they called their band name that, they don't know.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,480
 I thought maybe Azda were like, we don't know why we're hitting, but it's working.

140
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:26,680
 Get complete rights on that, those dickheads trying to sell trees, get them away.

141
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
 This is ours.

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,600
 Gotta stop buying woodland from Azda.

143
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,720
 Okay, here's the thing about the Kaiser, so he had like an intimate circle of friends and

144
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 confidence.

145
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
 And apparently one count, they were quite sarcophantic, and so one count allowed himself

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
 to be led before the Kaiser, imitating a poodle with a marked rectal opening.

147
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,240
 I don't know what that is, I don't really know, and I actually, I don't really want to

148
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
 know.

149
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,320
 Is that that he's imitating the marked rectal opening of a poodle, or is it the rectal opening

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,880
 separate to the poodle imitation?

151
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,920
 There are some dogs where that you can see their bum's, yes, you know.

152
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,920
 Is that what it is?

153
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
 Do you think so?

154
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 The ones with their tails up.

155
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
 Yes, yes, though.

156
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,120
 But I wouldn't build that into a fancy dress costume.

157
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,120
 It just in case someone else comes to the poodle with a march rectal opening.

158
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,960
 Also, there wasn't really a mention of a costume, was there, it just says he was imitating.

159
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,840
 Is that a very broad spectrum of maybe?

160
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,400
 He also liked to sit on his horse behind his desk, because it made him feel like a warrior

161
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,040
 when he was doing his home work, or his tax return, or whatever you do.

162
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
 How could you do that?

163
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,400
 Yeah, did he have a high desk, or did he have a tiny horse, or did he just have a long

164
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
 pen?

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,440
 Was it the only options I could think of?

166
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,840
 He led military exercises, so you know, which is just training exercises for the whole army.

167
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,200
 But obviously whenever he did that, he was so hyper-masculine and so in charge that the

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,720
 commander on the other side had to basically throw the military exercise, say, "Oh, you've

169
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,600
 won again, Kaiser Willhelm."

170
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 Well done.

171
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
 Yeah.

172
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,400
 You know that really awesome character from history, Annie Oakley.

173
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,720
 Do you know the story about Annie Oakley?

174
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,400
 So she was part of the Buffalo Bill touring group, and she had the amazing shot.

175
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,940
 And she was asked to shoot off the ash of a cigarette that was being held in the hands of

176
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,880
 Kaiser Willhelm, and she did it.

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,560
 So from a distance, she took a shot, and she managed to knock the cigarettes in half in

178
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,460
 his hands, and people say that had she've killed him, that may have prevented World War

179
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,460
 One.

180
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,920
 And she actually wrote to him much later requesting a second shot when she found that out, but he didn't

181
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
 respond.

182
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,760
 When did this guy die?

183
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,600
 1941, I think.

184
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
 Yeah, it's kind of amazing that he got away.

185
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,600
 He managed to live through the rise of fascism, and he lived in, what country did he live in?

186
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,840
 He lived in the Netherlands in Exo for a while.

187
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
 And he kept writing to Hitler.

188
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:06,040
 First, he's already writing to Hitler congratulating him on winning various battles with my armies.

189
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,360
 In a sort of, look, we're on the same team, you're using my military, and Hitler was kind

190
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
 of like, what are you talking about?

191
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,600
 You've been missing for 20 years, I overthrew you, and eventually he got quite angry at it.

192
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,600
 So it's a bit like, I loosened the top of this Jamja led, and all you had to do was just

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 see.

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
 It was a lot of that.

195
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,800
 He ended up hating Hitler and the Nazis, and there was a thing about his funeral in which he

196
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,000
 wanted no swastikers at his funeral, but apparently his funeral was just completely surrounded.

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,640
 I think I might ask for that at my funeral, I was just going to say.

198
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,320
 Is that a box you can take when you're, but surely that's a surefire way of ensuring

199
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,960
 your funeral is stuffed with swastikers, so you wouldn't ask for no swastikers unless

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,120
 you wanted them to change.

201
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,120
 Yeah, that's true.

202
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,680
 I think guys, no birthday this year, I don't want a birthday.

203
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
 No birthday presents, please.

204
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
 Okay.

205
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,760
 Especially no swastika wrapping paper.

206
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,880
 Okay, time for fact number two, and that is Andrew Huntum Murray.

207
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,080
 My fact is that beware of pickpockets signs attract pickpockets.

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,120
 They shouldn't make them so pretty.

209
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,520
 They shouldn't festoon them with wallets and verses.

210
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,920
 So why would that happen?

211
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,800
 This is because they have them in public places.

212
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,680
 You've probably seen them wherever you live, is that they have big signs saying beware

213
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,840
 thieves operate in this area or beware they're pickpockets nearby.

214
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,720
 And pickpockets like to hang out near those signs, because as soon as someone sees that

215
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,640
 sign, they will immediately pat their pocket or their trousers or wherever they're keeping

216
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
 their personal money.

217
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
 Exactly.

218
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,640
 They're just filming asda adverts.

219
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:42,760
 Don't steer my stuff.

220
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,680
 And so then the thief knows exactly where your stuff is and he can follow you.

221
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
 Yeah.

222
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,480
 So if you see one of those signs, I think to do is not go, hey, let me just check my wallets

223
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
 still where it was.

224
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
 Oh, yeah.

225
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,960
 So pickpockets, one of the things they do is this has been studied by neuroscientists, who

226
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,720
 says basically what they do is totally overload you with information.

227
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,640
 It's not just about whether hands are, they're up close to you and they're distracting you,

228
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,160
 they're talking loudly to you, they're arguing with you, they're touching bits of your

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,520
 body, you know, which are not, they're totally slapping a bum.

230
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,880
 They just completely overload you.

231
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,560
 This is particularly with stage pickpockets, but the same principle applies.

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,560
 It's basically because our brains can't do more than one thing at once.

233
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,560
 So they, yeah, they, so if they're like touching your bum, you're like, why is he touching

234
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,360
 my bum and when you turn around, they've taken your hat off.

235
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
 Yeah, he's already in your jacket pocket or something.

236
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

237
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:33,640
 In 2009, a Russian bank employee gave over $80,000 of cash to a woman who had hypnotized

238
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,560
 her in the bank.

239
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,560
 Wow.

240
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
 I think that I am not sure about that.

241
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,960
 It feels like she might be the, the accomplice, do you think?

242
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,480
 No, I just think that I was hypnotized is often a very easy excuse for the mistakes that

243
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
 one has made.

244
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,960
 For work, so I was in the pub at the time.

245
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
 Yeah.

246
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
 I left the whole bank unattended.

247
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,920
 She hypnotized me to go to the pub and stay there all day.

248
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,760
 No, I don't know how she did it either.

249
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,920
 I read a great robbery story that was in the news, I think, a couple of days ago, which

250
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,280
 was a guy, he robbed a local grocery outlet and managed to get away.

251
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,280
 They kind of knew who he was, though, straight away, so they were chasing him.

252
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,280
 But when he was caught, the kind of defense of going, it wasn't me, it was totally knocked

253
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,600
 out by the fact that he was carrying the money that he stole in a canvas bag that he'd

254
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,680
 drawn a massive dollar bill sign.

255
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:31,480
 This is a huge classic, like, what are you, the riddler for 1960s Batman, who carries bags

256
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
 like that.

257
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 It's like a double bluff.

258
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
 Yeah.

259
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,400
 This is the last place the police pulled things to look.

260
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,960
 I hope in prison that they gave him a special outfit with arrows all over his head.

261
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,720
 There's apparently a school of the seven bells.

262
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
 Have you guys heard of this?

263
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 No.

264
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
 For which there's no actual verification because people don't admit to attending it, but it's

265
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,360
 rumoured to exist in Colombia and the final, it's called the School of the Seven Bells

266
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,520
 because the final exam tests the ability to noiselessly remove items from the pockets

267
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,520
 of a jacket rigged with bells to make sure that you can dirt without distracting anyone's

268
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
 attention.

269
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:13,040
 How do they know when it's time for another lesson at the School of the Seven Bells?

270
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,240
 Can I tell you briefly about this guy called Apollo Robbins?

271
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
 Yeah, go on.

272
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,840
 Okay, so he was the subject of this New Yorker piece and I'll put it up on my Twitter,

273
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:27,400
 which is Andrew Hunter M, which is, and he is a stage pick pocket and he can steal anything

274
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
 basically.

275
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,360
 So he met Penn of Penn and Teller and Penn said, "Okay, go on, steal something from

276
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,200
 me." And he wasn't wearing, at the time Penn was wearing a sleeveless outfit and some

277
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,440
 shorts, so that's quite hard, obviously, less clothing to steal from, there were fewer pockets.

278
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,960
 So he asked Penn, "Okay, take off your wedding ring, put it on a bit of paper and trace the

279
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,680
 outline with it, right?"

280
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,360
 So Penn takes off his ring, he puts it on the paper, he gets his pen out of his pocket

281
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,000
 and it won't write anything.

282
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,040
 The reason being Apollo Robbins is holding the cartridge from inside the pen.

283
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
 Wow.

284
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
 Yeah.

285
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
 You have an even better pick pocket than that guy.

286
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
 Go on.

287
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
 Are you ready?

288
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,560
 So this guy is called Wang Hongbo and he's from Zheng Zhu and he has been caught.

289
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,240
 Well, he's been caught, so I'm not that good, but he's been caught using chopsticks to pick

290
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,720
 pocket people, okay?

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,680
 And he was photographed lifting the phone from a woman's pocket with chopsticks while she

292
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
 was cycling.

293
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:31,120
 That is skillful, isn't it?

294
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
 Do you know cool pick pocket slang?

295
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
 No.

296
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,440
 So they have a whole range of terms and exciting ways to describe it, and some of that's mentioned

297
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,800
 in this New Yorker piece, actually.

298
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,800
 So kissing the dog, just making a mistake, not in a Kaiser Will Home poodle way.

299
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,960
 That's a mistake where you're letting the victim see your face.

300
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,320
 It's always a mistake and that is a Will Home bike.

301
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,800
 And the skinning the poke, we're just taking all the cash out of a wallet you've nicked

302
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,040
 and then you get rid of the fingerprints and you throw it away.

303
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,440
 And there's the teams are called Whizmob's, a team of pick pockets.

304
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
 It's called a Whizmob.

305
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
 The Whizmob.

306
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
 Yeah.

307
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
 Sounds good.

308
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
 Sounds like the head chug or something.

309
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,800
 It just sounds like a serious criminal organization.

310
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 Yeah.

311
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
 It's all quite Victorian, though.

312
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
 Yeah.

313
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,320
 There were some old Victorian or maybe Edwardian names for criminals.

314
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,080
 And for those, swaddlers was one which was people who were Methodist preachers, whose accomplices

315
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
 pick pocketed the congregation.

316
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,520
 They were known as swaddlers.

317
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,520
 What?

318
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 A few others.

319
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:35,040
 Bully Huff's would hang around brothels, surprising and threatening the customers by claiming

320
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,680
 that the woman they were in bed with was their wife.

321
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
 That's very clever.

322
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,160
 And then extract money from them that way.

323
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,280
 Tatmongers were card shops and body baskets were women posing as sellers of pornographic

324
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,080
 books to disguise their real game which was stealing lidon of washing lights.

325
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,280
 Well, it's an obvious disguise, isn't it?

326
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
 You come to the door.

327
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
 Would you like to buy some erotic literature?

328
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
 No.

329
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
 OK.

330
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,280
 Do you mind if I leave through your garden?

331
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:11,680
 In the 15th century, Ambrose Parrey, who was a famous doctor in the 15th century, saw

332
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,640
 a beggar in Paris who was begging him for money and who did so by, I don't actually know

333
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
 how to put this out.

334
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
 So gross.

335
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 Who did so by, she begged by lifting her skirts to reveal a pro-lapse rectum.

336
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,920
 It was a horrid sight, he says.

337
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,160
 It was over half a foot long, leaking post-light fluid over her legs and garments.

338
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,480
 But his companion then attacked the woman and said, "You're a big faker.

339
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
 You don't look sick enough to have a pro-lapse rectum."

340
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,480
 You had to be pretty confident that you're right if that's the choice.

341
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,320
 I know pro-lapse rectum and that madame... He picked this woman to the ground and eventually

342
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,480
 she was forced to reveal that it was actually the pro-lapse rectum of an ox.

343
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,480
 But it was actually a pro-lapse rectum.

344
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
 It was.

345
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
 It wasn't pro-lapse rectum.

346
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,080
 Well, but he felt pretty silly then, didn't he?

347
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,560
 That's not a human pro-lapse rectum.

348
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,480
 It was the pro-lapse rectum of an ox.

349
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,480
 And then she'd put up her own bonnet.

350
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,000
 I think you've gone to the trouble of doing that.

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,240
 I really think you've earned your 50 cents or whatever.

352
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,240
 Definitely.

353
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,080
 But the lifting of her skirts as well.

354
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,080
 She could just have a sign saying, "Pro-lapse rectum, please help."

355
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,280
 Wait, so if you saw someone with a sign, you'd say, "That's probably how she started."

356
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,280
 But she's like, "No one is buying this at all except Andy."

357
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
 I can show it to you.

358
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
 No need.

359
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
 Absolutely believe you.

360
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,280
 The thing is though, I would pay 50p not to see a pro-lapse rectum.

361
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
 That's a fair point.

362
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,280
 She should have done that.

363
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
 We should move on.

364
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
 I've just got a couple of police things.

365
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,280
 Police men in Grenada are now wearing their Twitter handles on their uniforms now.

366
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
 That's not very good protection at first.

367
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,280
 Weirdly, it's a kind of way of saying to the community that you were not going to allow us to get away with anything as much as we're not allowed.

368
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,280
 Yeah, so it's like a police officer having their own name or their number on a badge or something like that.

369
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,280
 So you can tweet them and you can tweet because everyone in the town now, the police cars now have their Twitter handles.

370
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
 They're starting to do this in American now.

371
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,280
 Cars with Twitter handles so that people can make direct contacts and just let it be such a beauty.

372
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
 I think they're all on Twitter though.

373
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,280
 Maybe there's like, get a Constable Harris on Twitter.

374
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
 That's true.

375
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:48,280
 And you can add them in so you can say, "I'm currently being beaten up by Constable Harris."

376
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:53,280
 Is there like a really old school cop called Nigel or something who has his fax number on his arm?

377
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,280
 Maybe a full postal address.

378
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,280
 One other thing is that Scotland's police force have had to ban a lot of words from their Facebook page.

379
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
 So this is where social media has gone against them slightly.

380
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,280
 So they have over 139 words that, you know, they don't appear now on their page.

381
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,280
 They swear words mostly.

382
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,280
 A lot of swear words, but then they include pigs.

383
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,280
 So if you have an issue with a pig, that actually won't make it onto the page.

384
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
 That's stolen by Bacon.

385
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,280
 If your name is Fanny, you can't write to them.

386
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
 Yeah, because Fanny is now a banned word.

387
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,280
 T-bag, banned word.

388
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,280
 Is this in Scotland?

389
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,280
 Yeah, lots of people call Fanny in Scotland.

390
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
 I know, it's a big issue.

391
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,280
 So basically the way to be a criminal in Scotland is to steal pigs off people called Fanny.

392
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,280
 There's nothing they can do.

393
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,280
 A cab is also banned. Sorry, it's all cops are bastards.

394
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,280
 And so is Baconfucker.

395
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
 God, they're so sensitive, aren't they?

396
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,280
 What about Mr. John Baconfucker, though?

397
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,280
 So that is why Fanny Baconfucker.

398
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,280
 And they're son T-bag.

399
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,280
 Okay, time for fact number three.

400
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
 And that's my fact.

401
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:17,280
 My fact this week is that no one is quite sure how to say the name Louis Armstrong, or Louis Armstrong.

402
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,280
 No one knows.

403
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
 All right, so it's either Louis or Louis.

404
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,280
 Yeah, we sure an Armstrong, though, right?

405
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
 We're sure an Armstrong.

406
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
 Yeah, but I mean, it's an insane thing that we don't know.

407
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,280
 I only found this out because I was on Louis slash Louis Armstrong's house.org.

408
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
 It's like a major website for him.

409
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,280
 And someone asked, how do you pronounce the name Louis or Louis?

410
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,280
 And they go into this whole reasoning where they say that he in songs used to say Louis.

411
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
 In interviews, they would say Louis.

412
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
 His friends would claim that he was called Louis.

413
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
 But then his wife used to call him Louis.

414
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,280
 And then things got really confused because you then got called satchmo and pot.

415
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
 No one knows. There's no agreed opinion.

416
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,280
 Despite the fact that we have so much footage of this guy.

417
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
 We have so many audio recordings.

418
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,280
 No one knows.

419
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,280
 But he never says it.

420
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
 He never breaks off from a solo, does he?

421
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
 By the way, it's Louis.

422
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,280
 But there's a famous song called Hello Dolly and he sings the line.

423
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
 This is Louis.

424
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
 So everyone was like, oh, so it's Louis.

425
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
 That makes sense.

426
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 But then later in the song, a waiter says, this is Louis.

427
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
 So suddenly everyone's Louis in the song.

428
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,280
 So that was the one bit that something in America.

429
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
 You would normally pronounce it Louis when you like St. Louis town and stuff like that.

430
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
 So it feels like it should be Louis to me.

431
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,280
 Oh, yeah.

432
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,280
 I don't know.

433
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,280
 One of his biographers said that he told him that only white people call him Louis.

434
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
 Right.

435
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
 And that...

436
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
 Well, his wife, his wife called him Louis.

437
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
 Was she white?

438
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
 Don't think so, no.

439
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,280
 Well, was this the wife he married a prostitute, didn't he?

440
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
 He did, yes, his...

441
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
 He had a couple of wives, I think.

442
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
 He had four.

443
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
 Oh, right.

444
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
 Yeah, but he had a couple of wives.

445
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,280
 Twice.

446
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,280
 There's another thing just with his name not being decided on.

447
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,280
 They also later found out that he wasn't born when he thought he was born.

448
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,280
 And so he thought he was born.

449
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,280
 Wait a minute, wait a minute.

450
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,280
 He thought he'd been born.

451
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
 He'd just come out of the womb.

452
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
 Yeah, and he was like, no, you've not been born.

453
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
 You've not been born, you know.

454
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,280
 Because he thought he was born on the 4th of July, 1900.

455
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,280
 But it turns out he was born August 4th, 1901.

456
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
 Oh, wow.

457
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,280
 Now all of his kind of big fan groups celebrate both birthday.

458
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
 So he's a bit like the Queen now.

459
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
 He's got more than one birthday per year.

460
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
 They just two different people.

461
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,280
 One of them is Louis, one of them is Louis.

462
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
 One is August.

463
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
 So we're both fantastic jazz players.

464
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
 Yeah.

465
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,280
 So he did only get married a couple of times.

466
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,280
 It's just the other guy who agreed a couple of times.

467
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:39,280
 He was obsessed with a particular laxative Louis Armstrong.

468
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
 It's called Swiss Chris.

469
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,280
 And it got sold by this American dietitian called Gaylord Hauser.

470
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,280
 And Louis Armstrong would give whole interviews about his diet

471
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
 and about how fantastic this laxative was.

472
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,280
 And he said the first time I tried it, it sounded like applause.

473
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,280
 He said I had to crawl back to bed.

474
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,280
 He would know what applause sounds like as well.

475
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,280
 And he would post fans cards.

476
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,280
 He had his diet advice printed on cards to post back to any fans

477
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
 who wrote to him asking about it.

478
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,280
 And then he had specially printed cards which had him on a toilet

479
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,280
 on the front of it, a picture of him on the toilet.

480
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,280
 And then holding the bottle of Swiss Chris in his hand.

481
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,280
 He would send it back with a free sample of Swiss Chris.

482
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
 And then I think there was a slogan on the cards, wasn't there?

483
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
 And he had this slogan printed saying,

484
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,280
 "Satch says, leave it all behind you."

485
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
 Yeah, that's right.

486
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,280
 And he never accepted a penny from endorsing them ever.

487
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
 Really?

488
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
 He was never paid.

489
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,280
 He just loved it.

490
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
 He loved it so much.

491
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,280
 He did it every day.

492
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
 He loved it every day.

493
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
 Yeah, every day.

494
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,280
 He took it every day.

495
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,280
 Okay, so the Voyager probes, which they sent up with a record

496
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,280
 on which contains sounds and images about Earth.

497
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
 That includes Louis Armstrong music.

498
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
 Does it?

499
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,280
 Yeah, it also has some Bach, Beethoven, Stravinsky.

500
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,280
 And it has a Peruvian wedding song, which sounds good.

501
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,280
 An address by UN Secretary General Kurt Valdhelm.

502
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,280
 And recording of the Azerbaijany Bagpipe Orchestra.

503
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
 Wow.

504
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
 Right.

505
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,280
 I hope they start with the Bach and the Beethoven.

506
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,280
 Hey, you haven't heard the Azerbaijany thing, have you?

507
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,280
 I've heard the Bach pipes.

508
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,280
 It was meant to as well have a Beatles song.

509
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
 And all the Beatles said yes to it going on.

510
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,280
 But the record label said no.

511
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,280
 And the rumor is they said no because they thought,

512
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,280
 "If suddenly there is life out there,

513
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,280
 we don't have rights to these planets that will then be using the song."

514
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,280
 Which is nuts.

515
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:40,280
 Yeah, I've seen contracts that say, like, in all universities

516
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,280
 and also rights.

517
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,280
 Do you think maybe when the aliens come down to invade

518
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
 the first thing they're going to do is go,

519
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,280
 "Yeah, can you take us to your Bachpipe orchestra please?"

520
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,280
 We are massive fans.

521
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,280
 So on mispronunciation of names.

522
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,280
 Yeah, yeah.

523
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,280
 Samuel Taylor-Coloridge.

524
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
 Great poet, obviously.

525
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,280
 He said the following of his name.

526
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,280
 And I can't tell whether he was taking the mic or not.

527
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,280
 I'm not sure.

528
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,280
 He said, "I think that the word 'college',"

529
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,280
 and he brackets, "Ampthymachron, long on both sides,

530
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
 has a noble verbal physiognomy.

531
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 It is one of the violous Beatles above cries of detraction

532
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:26,280
 to pronounce it 'college' or 'college' or even 'college'.

533
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,280
 And in his own poems, he rhymes it with polaridge,

534
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
 'college' and the whole ridge.

535
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
 So the whole ridge.

536
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,280
 That's a great nickname.

537
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
 It sounds like his wrestling name.

538
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,280
 So he's saying anything, he rhymes it with everything.

539
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
 Anything goes.

540
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,280
 He rung it with anything, but he also said,

541
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
 to say long on both sides, which are 'college' or no,

542
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
 but that's the third way he said, don't pronounce it.

543
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 Cool ridge.

544
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
 I've no idea how he wanted to pronounce it.

545
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,280
 Can I just say as well?

546
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,280
 Why is he putting his own name in his own poems?

547
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,280
 Oh, you know, for fun.

548
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
 It's like a rap artist.

549
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
 That's what you'll do there.

550
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,280
 So you know the word 'ask' or you might say 'ask'.

551
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 And then he has some people in London say 'ox'.

552
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
 Yeah, why is that?

553
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
 Did you 'ox' me?

554
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
 Apparently, people have been making that mispronunciation

555
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
 for more than a thousand years.

556
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
 What?

557
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
 It's not a modern thing at all.

558
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
 That's fantastic.

559
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,280
 How is it?

560
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,280
 What was there to ask people about back then?

561
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,280
 What was there to 'ox'?

562
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,280
 Would be like, let's say...

563
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,280
 Can I borrow your 'ox'?

564
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
 No, it's 'ox'.

565
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:33,280
 Can I mention something about trumpets very quickly?

566
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
 Please do.

567
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,280
 Okay, so obviously Louis Armstrong, just to wrap it back around,

568
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
 played trumpet very famously.

569
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
 They found a trumpet in 'toot and carvings grave'.

570
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,280
 So not only just his socks, that was that way previously?

571
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 That wasn't going to let 'toot'.

572
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,280
 It is dang.

573
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,280
 But yeah, they found a trumpet in 'toot and carvings grave'.

574
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,280
 I really like that.

575
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 Was it from that age or was it just something that was left there

576
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,280
 by the original 'ox'?

577
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
 What? How is louder?

578
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 How is louder when he broke in?

579
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
 Oh, we've got to go back, I like my trumpet.

580
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 When did you bring a trumpet?

581
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,280
 I was actually just coming to do a gig.

582
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,280
 I went to the wrong venue, turned out.

583
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
 You thought it was on the Pyramid stage, it blasted me.

584
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
 Oh my god.

585
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,280
 You know who else was a jazz star?

586
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
 Romano Mussolini.

587
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,280
 Which I think we might have mentioned on the show.

588
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,280
 Mussolini's son, that is right.

589
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
 Yeah, he was a jazz pianist.

590
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
 And he started under an assumed name, as you would,

591
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,280
 because it's such a drag, that he does this square fascistic data.

592
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 But then in the 1960s, his ensemble got a claim,

593
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
 and he reverted to his real name.

594
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
 And he probably...

595
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,280
 Oh, because the Mussolini name had been rehabilitated by...

596
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,280
 That's a terrible time to thrust that on your band members as well.

597
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,280
 You'll notice on the banner, I'm brought.

598
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,280
 A little tweaking I've done.

599
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,280
 The article I read about him...

600
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
 I mean, he played with Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington,

601
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,280
 and the article I read said,

602
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
 "Although he shied away from his heritage."

603
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
 "Shied away."

604
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,280
 He wrote a memoir called, in 2004, called,

605
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,280
 "Il Duce, my father."

606
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
 Yeah.

607
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
 He says that Mussolini was a caring father.

608
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
 Oh, really?

609
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
 Not that that makes a difference.

610
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
 I'd like to stress.

611
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,280
 Don't know, it's changed my opinion about him.

612
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:26,280
 Okay, time for a final fact of the show, and that is James.

613
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
 Okay, my fact this week is,

614
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,280
 "The man who holds the Guinness World Record for the lowest voice can hit notes that are so low,

615
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,280
 only elephants can hear them."

616
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,280
 How do we know?

617
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
 We can...

618
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,280
 Well, computers can hear them.

619
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
 So it was elephants.

620
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,280
 But yeah, actually other large animals would be able to hear them as well.

621
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
 But yeah, below human hearing range.

622
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,280
 He can hit a note which is eight octaves below the lowest G on a piano.

623
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
 Oh, my God.

624
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
 Oh, my God.

625
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
 I know.

626
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
 Did he say that he can't really hear them?

627
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
 He can't hear them at all, can he?

628
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,280
 No, he can't, but he can kind of feel a vibration through his body when he doesn't.

629
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
 That's amazing.

630
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
 Wow.

631
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
 How can he think so low?

632
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:16,280
 He has vocal chords which are about twice as long as a normal person.

633
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,280
 It's a normal person.

634
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,280
 That's sort of like 12 feet long.

635
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
 Yeah.

636
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:30,280
 Dangling behind and also thinking like, "Do I work straight?"

637
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:34,280
 No, sorry, those are my vocal chords.

638
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,280
 And he takes his money back.

639
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,280
 Yeah.

640
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,280
 So, yeah, he can feel it coming through his body.

641
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:47,280
 Which, actually, you will get that with astronauts in space.

642
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:54,280
 We can pick up sounds from people on the moon, but it's usually the vibrations going through the body of the astronaut

643
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,280
 because there's not enough atmosphere for the waves to propagate.

644
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,280
 Oh, so the vibration of the helmet brings the sound through.

645
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,280
 Wow.

646
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,280
 So they talk by touching helmets if they couldn't talk to each other via...

647
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
 I don't know if they do that, but I guess they could do that.

648
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
 Yeah.

649
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
 No, I don't think they have done that, I think.

650
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,280
 They could.

651
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:16,280
 It's the other thing is why you hear your voice differently from a recording to what you hear in real life.

652
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
 Because you hear it through your body.

653
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,280
 You're not hearing it as other people hear it, which is through your face.

654
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
 So does it sound deeper to you?

655
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
 It does sound a bit deeper to you.

656
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,280
 Because it's the vibration.

657
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,280
 Yeah.

658
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,280
 Yeah, because we do fancy...

659
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,280
 Like, we're attracted to people with deeper voices, aren't we?

660
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 Well, women are attracted to them with deeper voices, apparently, because it signifies a larger body size.

661
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,280
 And apparently, a study has shown men are attracted to women with higher voices, but I'm very skeptical about that.

662
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
 Well, there are a lot of women with very husky voices.

663
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,280
 Yeah, and people love that.

664
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:56,280
 Well, there was a study that found that men with lower pitch voices had higher numbers of sexual partners.

665
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:02,280
 But people with more attractive voices actually also have lower sperm quality.

666
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:08,280
 Actually, is that because they're putting all the effort into their voice?

667
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,280
 Inside the body, there's a guy going, "Yeah, don't worry about the sperm. Let's turn all the attention to the voice."

668
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:19,280
 Did you just do it like slight Italian accent, but the thing inside your body?

669
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
 The controls, you.

670
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,280
 Just an Italian guy. He feels like he has an Italian inside breaking out.

671
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,280
 I like to stress, it's not a Mussolini.

672
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,280
 So elephants can tell the difference between different human languages.

673
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:39,280
 So they could tell which language this guy was singing in, at his incredibly low thing.

674
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,280
 How do we know they can tell?

675
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,280
 They've tested two different ethnic groups on elephants.

676
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,280
 And those are the camber, they're basically farmers. They don't really hunt elephants.

677
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
 And the Masai, who often hunt elephants.

678
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
 And they're afraid of...

679
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,280
 Yeah, they're afraid of, and they were recorded saying the same phrase.

680
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,280
 Look over there, a group of elephants is coming, and then that was played to elephants.

681
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,280
 And when the Masai said it in their language, the elephants got spooked.

682
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,280
 But only Masai men, who are the guys who do the hunting,

683
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,280
 because women and children of either group, could be the way that they're saying it though.

684
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,280
 Because if you're a hunter of elephants, you're going to say, "Look over there, there's some elephants.

685
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,280
 We can hunt them." Whereas if you're a farmer, you're like, "Oh my god, look, there's some elephants coming."

686
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,280
 They're going to trample our crops.

687
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
 Yeah.

688
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,280
 There's some elephants coming.

689
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
 I hadn't thought of that.

690
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,280
 I think it's evidence, though.

691
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,280
 It sounds like a pretty good study, but that is a good point.

692
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:35,280
 But that also suggests that they understand the words that are being said as opposed to the tone.

693
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,280
 What they heard the word "elephant" ago, that's us.

694
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,280
 Oh, my ears are burning.

695
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:53,280
 They can also, elephants, they've recently discovered, can point, can't they?

696
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,280
 And they're the first animal that's not an ape or with the feet.

697
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
 They can recognize pointing of humans.

698
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,280
 So if a human points to a bucket that has food in it, then they'll go to that one rather than the other one.

699
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,280
 And they're the only animal who aren't apes who can do it, and lots of apes can't.

700
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
 But they think elephants might point with their trunks.

701
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,280
 So they thought that they're moving their trunks around is just, you know, for gags, shits and giggles.

702
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 But actually, it's thought that they might be pointing at each other with their trunks.

703
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,280
 That's fantastic.

704
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,280
 Yeah, that's cool.

705
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,280
 Elephants can also recognize themselves in the mirror, can't they?

706
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 And in fact, I think, sorry, this is what we don't think anything else can do that's not from the ape family.

707
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
 So I retract the last ape thing.

708
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,280
 But they can recognize themselves in a mirror.

709
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
 And if you put a dot on their forehead, then they will, and they see themselves in the mirror, their reflection.

710
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:39,280
 They will try and get the dot of their own forehead rather than like an idiot, like all other animals trying to get the dot of the forehead of the reflection in the mirror.

711
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,280
 Oh, okay.

712
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,280
 So well done, then.

713
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 Yeah, that's quite cool.

714
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 Also, do you remember that?

715
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,280
 Because they paint, don't they?

716
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,280
 And that was an incredible study.

717
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,280
 That's why he sold so few paintings to his own in his lifetime.

718
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,280
 It was very messy when he cut off his ear.

719
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 Sent in that huge package.

720
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:11,280
 There was this amazing footage that came out years ago of an elephant using a paintbrush painting an elephant.

721
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
 And basically, everyone was going, what the hell is this?

722
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
 And it turns out that they would be trained in very cruel ways to be able to do it.

723
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
 But they can do it and they can memorize every single movement that they need to do in order to paint this thing.

724
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
 Everyone thought this was a hoax.

725
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,280
 And I think it was Richard Dawkins who went out to find out about it because he thought this is impossible.

726
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
 And it's absolutely true.

727
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
 They've trained these elephants to hold a paintbrush and paint canvas drawings.

728
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 And you can buy elephant paintings online now that they do.

729
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
 They're extraordinary.

730
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 Don't buy them. Sounds like you'd be converting.

731
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
 It's cruelty. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,280
 It's massive cruelty. But like the video footage is extraordinary to watch an elephant doing something which such precision as well.

733
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 Amazing.

734
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:57,280
 I've got something about voices. So you know that the biggest hearing range of any creature, can you guess?

735
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 A bat.

736
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,280
 It's not a bat. It's a bat's prey creature though. It's a moth.

737
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,280
 It's the greater wax moth.

738
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
 It is the greater wax moth.

739
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,280
 How on earth did you know that?

740
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
 I just know stuff like that.

741
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,280
 Yeah, it's like it can hear something really.

742
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
 A noise that bats can't make or something.

743
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
 That's it.

744
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,280
 In the course of evolution, it has evolved a greater hearing range than the noise is bats make.

745
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:29,280
 So most of bats' prey creatures can't hear them because they just get eaten out of the air and they have no defense against it.

746
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,280
 But the moth has evolved such a massive hearing range that it not only can hear everything the bat does.

747
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,280
 It can talk to other wax moths in higher than bats' range. It's very cool.

748
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,280
 So good. That also feels like quite a good insult for some reason saying I can hear noises you can't even make.

749
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,280
 It's true in humans that you're hearing of high noises decreases as you get older.

750
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,280
 Which is why they had those mosquito sounds outside shops, which were to disperse teenagers, very, very high pitched sounds.

751
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,280
 But people of my age wouldn't be able to hear them because my little silai and my ears have died out.

752
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
 It's also useful if you want to talk about sex in front of your grandparent.

753
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,280
 You could just do it like this.

754
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,280
 How much do you like to go for a quick share right now?

755
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
 It's already caught here.

756
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,280
 Cool, the voices are really low, aren't they? They're 20 times lower than you'd expect from their body size.

757
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
 They're rather slow as an elephant's voice.

758
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,280
 And that's because they're organs that make this sound as an organ that no other animals have.

759
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,280
 I think they've got two vocal pouches instead of one, which most creatures have, two vocal folds.

760
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 They don't make whalers. They're just, yeah, they're really strong.

761
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
 They're not really strong.

762
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

763
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

764
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

765
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

766
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

767
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280

768
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

769
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

770
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

771
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

772
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

773
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

774
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280

775
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,280

777
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:15,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

778
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

779
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

780
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

781
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

782
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

783
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

784
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

785
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 They're not really strong, aren't they?

786
