WEBVTT

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hey everybody, welcome to this special bonus episode of no such thing as a fish recorded

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.760
 in the BBC during a live broadcast of the one show, a massive BBC show if you haven't heard of it

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.640
 overseas. We were in another room doing a live recording and all of our subjects matched what they

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.200
 were talking about live as the show was going out. You can actually go onto BBC iPlayer and watch

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.760
 that episode. You'll see footage of us, you'll see us giving them facts to talk about during the show,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.840
 but here's what we did during that show. Have a listen. If you're new to us, please go and listen

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.120
 to all our other episodes. If you're a regular, tomorrow there will be a normal episode and, uh,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 yeah, okay, on with the bonus episode.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast this week coming

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.240
 to you from the BBC Studios in central London for our one off, The One Show Special. My name is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.880
 Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Anna Chazinski, and Andy Murray. We'll also be

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.400
 joined for a quick cameo by hosts of The One Show, Alex Jones and Matt Baker. So here we go. We've

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.640
 once again gathered around the microphones this time to discuss topics featured on tonight's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.240
 episode of The One Show and in a very particular order here we go starting with you, James Harkin.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.800
 Okay. My fact is actually about The One Show and it is that the total number of hours people

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.160
 spent watching The One Show this year is the same as the total number of hours that have passed since

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.480
 humans left Africa. That's amazing. Wow. That's a lot of hours. How many hours? Yeah, how many is it?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.120
 Oh, come on. What's that in minutes? Sorry. So this has been a bit of a back of the envelope kind of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.480
 work that I did based on the idea that it's half hour show and would you say it took you more or

00:01:52.480 --> 00:02:00.400
 less longer than that to work it out? Well, that's what I had been doing all day. But yeah, about

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.640
 4.2 million viewers isn't the per show? Okay. It's on almost every day and that's the total number.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.160
 That's amazing. 60,000 years. That is astonishing. I got told a slightly similar thing a while ago.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 So John Lloyd, for those who you were listening, that's the creator of QI. He used to make a show back

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 in the day which starred Rowan Atkinson called Not the Nine o'clock News. A bunch of other people,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.560
 but Rowan Atkinson was in it. And they basically they did four series, 27 episodes and every episode

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.600
 had about 32 sketches in every episode. They were asked to make eight new episodes compiling all

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.040
 the best episodes. So John wanted to find out how many permutations there could be of that. So he

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.080
 asked a mathematician friend of his and the guy came back and he said, listen, it's quite a big number.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.880
 In fact, the number of come back with exceeds the number of particles in the observable universe.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.120
 That's how big that number was. That's why you never ask a mathematician anything.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.000
 It was just for the actual work here. It was 10 to the power of 82.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.640
 It's only just over the number of particles in the known universe, which I think is about 10 to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.560
 the 79. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You just casually know that. There's a thing happened to know

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.680
 all the number of particles. Have you counted them? That's awesome. So TV facts, I think that's... Well,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.120
 I wanted to... So I believe one of the presenters of the one show today used to present Blue Peter.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.120
 And I read a really good thing about Blue Peter. And I can only find it in one book that's called

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:34.160
 TV's Strangest Moments. But it's about Blue Peter in the 1970s. It was when it was being hosted by

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.000
 someone called Ben Folk. And... Oh, hang on. I'm just going to cut you for a second.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.680
 We're about to go live to the one show with the hosts Alex and Matt. Well, listen, if you do like a

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.720
 fact, you are in love tonight because watching the short live from the depths of the BBC are the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.800
 researchers from QI, also known as the QI elves. Now, they are obsessed with facts and will spend the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.760
 next half an hour adding their own weird and wonderful trivia to tonight's programme. And you'll

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.480
 be able to listen to what the elves actually have been up to via a podcast that'll be on the one show

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.960
 Facebook page. So we're going to interrupt them right now. James, if you can hear me, can we have a

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.880
 one show of facts, please? Hi there. Yes, you can. My fact in our podcast, in fact, is that the total

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.320
 number of hours people spent watching the one show this year is the same as the number of hours

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:37.040
 that have passed since humans left Africa. Okay, so I believe before that I was talking about

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.240
 blue Peter. So there was an episode of blue Peter in the 1970s and the special guest was an eagle

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.600
 owl and the piece was about how eagle owl, an eagle owl pet got along really well with this mouse

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.240
 and it befriended it and how like if you have an animal in captivity, then you know what you

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.960
 would have thought would be their instincts are overcome. And so the owner of the eagle owl brought it on

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.040
 and there was this apparently the script went the host was saying amazing so the eagle owl sitting

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.720
 there and it was playing with the mouse between its claws and the mouse was running around underneath

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.200
 its feet and the eagle owl was just looking down and the host said that's amazing because in the wild

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.200
 of course they would be natural enemies and then he was interrupted at that moment by the eagle

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:20.320
 owl throwing the mouse up into its mouth and swallowing it at which point apparently the producer just

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.120
 said okay take to blue Peter eagle owl without the mouse this time. I think this recorded it saying

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.080
 the mouse couldn't make it today but he's very good friends. That was there's an outtake a very famous

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.760
 David Adam Brow take where he's talking about the incredible sonar of bats and that it's impossible

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.080
 that a bat would ever find to your head and literally as he's saying a bat just smacked him in the face.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.880
 Can I tell you a very favorite recent TB fact of mine? Yes I read so a fan noticed this when they

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.360
 were watching TBS in America so one of my favorite shows is Seinfeld so obviously when you're doing

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.760
 TV shows adverts are the thing that makes your channel money and they decided very randomly to subtly

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.800
 speed up episodes of Seinfeld so they could fit more ads into the show so they sped it up by 7.5%

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.200
 and they managed to get two more minutes of ad space. But Seinfeld sounds like he's on helium the whole

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.120
 time. It's exactly every time you noticed. I am currently watching Seinfeld and Veep at the same time

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.880
 and I'm getting Julia Louis Dreyfus Whiplash because she's in both shows. So if you're watching them

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.920
 at the same time do you have to mute one while you're watching them at the same time. I'm watching

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.720
 an episode of Veep and then one of Seinfeld. I have a fact about early television and early

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:48.080
 development of television so the first ever TV show was in Selfridges in London. Yeah it was a

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.960
 demonstration by John Loughy Baird who invented the television in 1925 and the images that they

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:59.520
 depicted were called shadow graphs. How cool is that? He said the device was called a televisor

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.440
 where there are all sorts of amazing names from the early days of television that we don't have

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.920
 anymore. That shadow graph is cool we should still use that. Watching shadow graphs on the one show

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:14.640
 today. Actually on that Selfridges moment I love the fact that I think that was in 1928 and he was

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.400
 selling his televisions at the time and there was nothing to be watched on them because the first

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.800
 broadcast wasn't until 1929. But a bunch of people bought them so a bunch of people just bought

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.080
 televisions going I bet these will come in handy one day. It's a bit like when you used to buy

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.800
 3D TVs back in the day when they first came out and there was nothing on TV that was in 3D just like

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:41.040
 one thing. About old TVs you were just saying. The oldest British television that still works

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.520
 is called a Marconi phone. It was made in 1936 and they've got one version of it they found one

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.680
 and the great thing about it is it's got a volume up and down button. You can move the picture

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.320
 up and down but it has no channel changing button and that's because there was only one channel

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:04.080
 in those days. So there was no need for a channel changing. That's amazing guys we're going to have

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.200
 to move on we're keeping it pace with the one show that's going along and right now as we are talking

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.400
 their live talking about sinkholes so we're going to move to our second fact and that is you Chuzinski.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:22.640
 Yes my fight is that the largest object ever discovered is a hole. It's a whole what. It's just a

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:30.960
 hole. A hole no w. It's a hole in space. It's called the super void and it's 1.8 billion light years

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.960
 across which is a size that makes absolutely no sense to any of us. So isn't the universe 14

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:42.640
 billion years across isn't that how we know the. Right yes. How old the. Yeah. As in the distance

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.120
 from here to the edge of the observable universe. I was asked how it works. How is it 1.8 billion light

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.680
 years across. So more than a tenth of the width of the universe. It's large and it's sort of

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.760
 confounded science because it shouldn't scientifically exist so it doesn't accord with our theories of

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.920
 the shape of the universe and how it works. Oh and also the universe is infinite isn't it so it's

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.880
 not 14 billion years it's just that old. We're getting really deep. Yeah we've got half an hour

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.680
 for me to explain the size of the universe is going to be a bit much. Okay. But anyway it's this empty

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.520
 space it has far fewer galaxies than it's supposed to have in it so it's not completely empty it's

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.640
 just much less densely packed than it should be and physicists don't understand why it's missing

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.040
 an estimated 10,000 galaxies. So there are 10,000 galaxies missing if anyone knows where they are

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.640
 right into one show I guess. Much like Somerset in that respect and that it's so lovely there should

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.200
 be a lot more in it but it's still very it's still very unapobulated for how gorgeous the place is.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.240
 It's exactly like Somerset yes. Are you saying that Somerset is a whole? No I'm saying it's really nice.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.640
 I'm sure this bit of the universe is really nice. I have a fact about sinkholes. So sinkholes

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.760
 they open up under the ground when the ground underneath is eaten away sometimes it's by acidic

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:56.880
 rain or sometimes there's another collapse underground sinkholes there are about 32,000 in the UK

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.880
 and in 2011 a woman from Florida or basically all the Florida sinkholes up and down it's so prone

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.080
 to it. A woman in Florida called Carl Chapman fell into a sinkhole for the second time in two years.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.600
 Such bad luck. Was it the same sinkhole? No different sinkholes and she survived both times this is

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:21.040
 the nice thing because they're really dangerous you know. I was googling interesting holes on earth

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:28.560
 and he's now been added to a government list. Well I discovered a really exciting one which is

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.520
 located in Oregon in America it's called the Deluxe Mystery Hole. Now according to the owner

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:42.720
 and it's promoter. It's the owner an advertiser. Actually he sounds amazing the owner. He said that

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.560
 it's buried beneath his backyard it's an amazing archaeological site. It's been explored it's been

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:54.560
 explored via psychic archaeology. He's reveals wonders down there with names like the Black Obsidian Mirror

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.840
 of a higher truth and the door that's never been opened. Is this actually you just found some fiction

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.320
 haven't you? No. I'm sorry this is a pastor he's called Pastor Baron. What's it called again? It's

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:11.120
 called the Deluxe Mystery Hole. Yeah is there an economy mystery hole? Which is just a slightly

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:18.560
 smaller hole. This guy he runs a he calls himself the leader of the tunnel people and he's the head

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.280
 of the Universal Church of Oofun. Have you heard that? The Church Oofun. No but you know what?

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.520
 It sounds fun. It does. Yeah so that's to me that was my biggest interesting hole. I have a massive

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:38.720
 sinkhole. There's one on Mars which is 5,000 meters deep and it's 200 miles long and Mars is

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.480
 a lot smaller than Earth so actually it's a it's a really big proportion of the planet it's bigger

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.480
 than the Grand Canyon. But you wouldn't fall into that because you could definitely see it coming.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.680
 So I think if you were that woman in Florida. Carla Chapman if you're listening do not go to Mars.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:58.880
 Did you I find this really incredible the deepest man made hole on Earth is only nine inches across.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:05.760
 I love that I think it's not true. What about mines? Yeah this is much deeper than a mine. So this

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.080
 is the cola super deep borehole and it was made by the so very few people know that during the cold

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:15.280
 war there was a space race but there was also as importantly some would argue the digging race and

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.760
 we were competing the US was competing with the USSR to see you could dig further and the Soviet

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:25.840
 Union won and they dug this borehole that was nine inches diameter but it was over 12 kilometers deep

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.040
 and if you go to it now it's just like it looks like a little manhole cover it's just a rusting metal

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.000
 manhole cover nine inches wide because 12 kilometers deep so do not fall into that. You ain't getting

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.360
 out. These struggles fall into something that's been wouldn't you? But if you're out walking your pet

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:50.800
 weasel be careful. I actually find it totally extraordinary that speaking of that the man as a species

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:56.400
 we've reached 20 billion miles beyond the earth but only 7.5 miles but only 12 kilometers deep.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.720
 Well they're trying to go down now further aren't they? They are. But it is tougher to dig

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.960
 through than it is to go up. There's not a lot of molecules in there. There's a lot more molecules

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.880
 down. They're going to start doing it they're going to start doing it through the ocean so they're

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.320
 going to go to the bottom of the ocean and then start going down but they're really going to go down

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.680
 like thinner than a pencil's thickness to go down to the mantle. Because the crust is a lot thinner

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:24.000
 down there. It makes it easier. It's clever. It makes total sense. Did any of you guys sorry going?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.640
 No, no, no. Did any of you guys see I mean this is just a silly new story but that woman in

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.880
 a film a few months ago who fell into a sinkhole but it was outside a cafe and they'd surrounded

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:38.080
 it with cafe chairs and tables to warn people that the sinkhole was present. And she walked in.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.920
 The QI research team aka the QI elves are listening into tonight's show.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.040
 Yes so the idea is that they're using the one choice inspiration for an online radio programmer

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.560
 which you will be able to download later via our Facebook. Yeah they sort of part of our show

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.400
 on where you part of theirs. So shall we interrupt them to think? Yes that's a sinkhole. So how's John

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:06.480
 giving you any inspiration in any way? Oh yes he has. So you were saying that his new DVD is called

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.960
 Supersonic. Yeah. Now did you know that every time you pop a party balloon you are going supersonic

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.000
 as in you are breaking the speed of sound because the speed at which the latex retracts

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.400
 is faster than the speed of sound. So the bang you hear when a balloon pops is a sonic boom.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:31.760
 That's the reason I call it supersonic. So here's a thing so sinkholes can come at any time. They

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.080
 could just arrive. Another thing that could just come at any time is a kimbalite pipe and this could

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.640
 happen anywhere in the world at any time. It's more likely to happen in certain places admittedly

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.200
 but it could happen in your front room and it's just a little pipe that comes up from the middle of

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.000
 the ground and it's where diamonds come from. Most of the world's diamonds come from these things. Wow

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.080
 theoretically one could pop up from the ground any second. So keep an eye out everybody. Look at your

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.640
 feet at all times. Who's putting them into the pipes? It's a very eccentric way of giving away your

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.200
 wealth. James was planting them there just so you could say that facts. He lives into the future.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.240
 Yeah. No they're like magma little holes of magma which putt for a lot a lot of pressure and they

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.160
 get the carbon make it really really tight and turn it into diamonds and they pop up through these

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.720
 pipes. I have one more really quick sinkhole facts. Okay yeah which is that they're thought the sinkholes

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:27.680
 in Yorkshire in Ripon is it a thought to have inspired Alice in Wonderland how she gets down to Wonderland.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.320
 She falls into a hole by the base of a tree. It's thought that because of the landscape around there it's

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.440
 really sink holy. Wow. And then if you remember the book they call the fire engine and there's a

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.680
 rope and put it down and she is helped out again. There was a cafe table and chairs around the outside

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:47.760
 of the tree. A lady from Florida she first met. Okay it's time for the Kestrel's VT that they're

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.120
 about to do on the one show which brings us then to our third fact about Kestrel's and that's my

00:15:53.120 --> 00:16:00.720
 fact and my fact this week is that in 2012 a Kestrel was arrested in Turkey on suspicion of spying.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:08.800
 So it was amazing. What happened? Well I remember reading about this and it was it was in Turkey they

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.000
 thought it was an Israeli spy didn't they and then they I think they kept it in the in the case for a

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.160
 little while and then decided just to let it go. We've covered this a number of times on our show

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.760
 of inappropriate arrests on being the coconut and the moldeaves which was arrested. Arrested is

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.560
 wrong word actually it was detained and it was held in a cell for two hours where it was in yeah

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:34.960
 because where would you put the handcuffs? Exactly but it was it was visited by a the country's

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:40.000
 leading investigator slash magician and he came in and he questioned it for two hours came back

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.400
 out afterwards and went night and do it and they released it. They released the coconut back

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.840
 into the world. He could have said he's a tough nut to crack. I wish he had done. Oh that coconut

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:59.200
 is very shy. Oh my god. Wasted so many wasted opportunities. Kestrel's their name means little

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.440
 bell ringing falcon. It's so sweet. The left of them is Falco tinunculus because it makes a little

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.360
 key key key cry that's what it sounds like so it sounds like little bells ringing. Well do you

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.400
 know where the word Kestrel comes from? No. It's so it's very similar so Kestrel comes from the

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:20.800
 French word Kresel and that used to be the word for a leper's bell so you know in medieval times lepers

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.920
 used to carry bells and at first it was so that it was better for sort of begging purposes but then when

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.120
 things like the black death came then it became legal that lepers had to carry bells to sort of warn

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.880
 people to stay away from them because it was thought that even if you looked at a leper you could get

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.360
 leprosy. That's if there are some people think that that you know might not be why they had bells

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.880
 but lepers bells were a thing and Kestrel's a named after lepers bells because they make that

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:48.400
 sort of shrieking bell sound rattle sound. That's very cool. So in the VT that they were showing about

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:54.080
 Kestrel's they were showing how gliders were using their gliding their planes up there and how

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.480
 the Kestrel's kind of similar to it. I was looking a bit into teradactyls. The biggest of teradactyls

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.920
 was so large that they couldn't fly. Really? What they could do though was go to the top of a peak

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:09.280
 or a mountain and glider. John Paugh. Do you know sorry just speaking of gliders. George Kaley who

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.880
 is a British guy. He is like the father of aeronautics. When he was practicing flying his glider rather than

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.600
 put himself in it he put his coachman in. This guy called John Applebee and after the glider had

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.600
 successfully flown and John Applebee became the first person to fly in a man-made machine

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.400
 and landed safely. He approached his boss and said, "Please, George, I wish to give notice. I was

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.800
 hired to drive and not to fly." And he quit his job. Wow. Yeah. And then you put a small boy in a glider

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:42.800
 about 20 years later. I have a fact about gliders as well. So second world war in coldets the prisoners

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.240
 that built a glider in an escape attempt and they never got to fly it. I think the war ended before

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.560
 they got the chance. But it was an incredible thing. They built a false wall in the attic and they

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.440
 were in a castle with only one exit which has three heavily guarded gates. So they think, "Well,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:02.320
 we'll just fly out. It's fine." And they made it out of bedsheets and the struts inside were made

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.040
 of floorboards that they ripped up and they also had to coat the bedsheets in porridge to give it

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.200
 starchy qualities to make it stiffer. Are you sure you're not describing the sea called a home alone?

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:16.160
 No, I promise this is true. And they built it and they were planning to, if you like that,

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:21.280
 they were planning to build a runway on the castle roof and then to get up speed on the glider,

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.240
 they were going to fill a bathtub with concrete and run it down the runway, building up speed.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.960
 So the glider could get up enough speed to fly. And a team at Channel 4 in 2012 recreated it

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.040
 and it worked. But then the dummy pilot inside was decapitated.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.760
 He gave his notice immediately. Just back to Kestrel's. Yeah.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:48.720
 There were five in 2012 there were five babies in America given the name Kestrel,

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.160
 who are male and eight females who are given the word Kestrel. There are a few others in 2000,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.600
 but no other year on record have there been five people because I only have records of up to five

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:06.320
 people with that name, but no other year. So just 2012 and 2000. Wow. Big year for the Kestrel.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.200
 So it's still up for grabs whether it's male or female name? Yeah, exactly.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:16.160
 I did see a list called the Great Big List of bird names for girls and Kestrel was very low on the

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.240
 list. So maybe it's maybe it's rising 2012 though. That was topping that list. Yeah, exactly.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.040
 Listen, as we're as we're talking live, we are watching live footage from the one show of a VT

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.520
 about vans, the transit van, and that brings us to our fourth fact, our final fact of the show.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.680
 And that is you, Andy Murray. Okay, my fact is that the phrase van man predates the van.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.640
 They were just walking around going, what am I going to try? They had no idea.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.880
 Is this like when they bought those first television so they had no use for it? This is the same.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.480
 Oh, be your van man. You can put me up whenever we have a van. If you need a shadow graph moved,

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.160
 I'm available for that. So the word van used to mean a covered truck or a wagon.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.840
 Oh, like a caravan. Exactly. It comes from caravan. And the first use of the word van is in 1829.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:18.640
 And van man, a mere 50 years later, 1881 is the first use of the phrase van man. So that's definitely

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:26.160
 before vans were there. But the phrase white van man, that famous sort of social trope, is only in 1997.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.840
 That was invented really late. I'm actually, I have to say, I've never heard the phrase van man.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.560
 Is this a well-known thing people have been talking about behind my back?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:40.160
 Man man with van. Yeah, it's often used for vans. All people with vans.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.480
 Plural is men with men, which is what I say. No, I've heard of that.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.440
 Yeah, exactly. I see in a diagram that explains who they are.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:56.640
 So I was on Ford's website and they said that there are 3.4 million vans in the UK.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:04.720
 And they travel a total of 63 billion miles during 2014. What? Which sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:11.440
 That would get them to Pluto and back six and three quarter times, according to my calculation.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.720
 But loading is £10 extra. And you have to pay the fuel.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:24.480
 And the other thing which I found which is 63 billion miles is if you could uncoil all of the DNA

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.760
 within an adult's 100 trillion cells, it would extend to over 63 billion miles.

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:35.200
 Just some enormous numbers that are very difficult to comprehend that.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.440
 That Ford website is amazing, actually. If you have a ponch on for transit vans,

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.520
 go to lookup of transit van facts. It'll take you to the Ford website. It has the most amazing

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.040
 list of van facts and about 2,000 of them. So that include the fact that baby elephants were once

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.000
 transported in transit vans at Regent's Park Zoo. They need to move some baby elephants,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.600
 shove them in the back of a van. And there's a hilarious photo from 1973 where a transit van had to

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:06.640
 carry a 49 foot long fake dinosaur model from Kent up to Scotland. And it's going on the motorway.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.080
 And the transit van, the van is about an eighth the size of this dinosaur, which is just hanging over it.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:18.480
 That's great. That's amazing. There's been some big news in ice cream van news.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.280
 Yeah, well, I didn't realize that there was any ice cream van news to be had, but there is apparently,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.760
 they've had an extension on how long they're allowed to play their little chimes when they're

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.680
 coming into towns. I think it was about four seconds before, and they've extended it to 12 seconds now.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.280
 Yeah, that's right. It always cuts off after four seconds, because you're just getting into green

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:49.680
 sleeves or whatever it is. I've never seen anything like a copyright thing. They don't have PRS on ice cream

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:53.440
 but I had no idea what the reason was. I just knew it kind of like when you know when a pigeon cuts

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.040
 off really suddenly, you think it's about to go on. I think that's the same reason, yeah, because

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.920
 legally, they're not allowed to churp for more than, you know, they've had the time between

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.640
 chimes on ice cream vans reduced as well, haven't they? Yeah, every two minutes now, rather than three.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.200
 It's big, it's big exciting time in ice cream news, yeah. Do you know the third most popular ice cream

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.640
 van tune? So I think the most popular is green sleeves or something. The second most popular is

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.720
 another pop, you know, famous old classic tune. The third most popular tune they play is the match

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.680
 of the day theme tune, isn't it? Isn't that weird? Is it? I think I've heard the teddy bears picnic a lot.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:30.080
 Is that from ice cream vans? Will you just play that in your bedroom? No, that's the only one that

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.680
 there's local to me. Wow, much of the day. That's great. Yeah, there you go. Do you know that

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.360
 Tommy Cooper used to help his parents run their ice cream van? His dad used to be, yeah. Yeah,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.800
 and they used to go to fairs at the weekends and he would be vlogging ice creams. Is it not true,

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.640
 just speaking about ice creams about the Margaret Hatcher thing that she helped Mr. Whippy in the

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.440
 creation? That's not true, right? It's kind of true. She did, she was working for the company at the

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.560
 time and she was a chemist working with ice cream. Wow. But whether she actually did the specific

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:05.440
 Mr. Whippy thing, probably not. That's amazing. Calling back to gliders, there was that thing about

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:12.080
 Barbara Cartland, the author. She wrote, she helped design a glider that got towed into the air

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:20.000
 and that she did like a 200 kilometer trip in it. Wow, it's amazing. Yeah. Can I go back to transit

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.840
 vans? Yeah, of course, yeah. Okay, so when Ford are testing a transit van, they put it through

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:32.880
 an accelerated aging process. They plunge it through mud baths and salt baths and then the transit

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:39.360
 vans are forced to do figures of eight for a month. For a month? More driver. That's kind of

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.160
 very ridiculous. Yeah, they swap the drivers. Because that's putting the drivers through an accelerated

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:52.640
 aging process. So I just want to say one thing about a strong man called Salt Sinker who set a world

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:59.760
 record for pulling cars with his bare hands. He pulled 12 Ford cars, including a transit van,

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.960
 took him two hours and he had to pull it just five meters and then once he pulled it, they said,

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.040
 "Well, we won't give you the record until you turn around and pull it back the other way."

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.280
 And the reason was, they wanted to not think there was a slope there and they thought if there was

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:18.000
 a little slope that way, they'll be the same slope this way. Oh, I thought they just really wanted it

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.880
 parked back wherever it was originally. We're about to be interrupted one more time by the host of

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:31.280
 the show. Let's just quickly go to them. And John's stand-up DB D supersonic is out now. And thanks to

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.560
 the Kiwai elves, the one show special edition of a new such thing as a fish podcast would be available

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.600
 to download later on. Yes, and there are over a thousand more facts in the latest Kiwai book.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.480
 Yeah, and we'll see tomorrow with Andy Hamilton. Bye. Good night.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:52.400
 Okay, they're wrapping up our show. We should wrap up ours. Okay, that's it. That's all of our facts.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.680
 Thank you so much for listening. If you've heard us for the first time on the show as we say at the
