00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi guys, before we start this week's episode of Fish we have a few exciting

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.200
 announcements to make. Announcement number one is that we, no such thing as a fish,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.520
 are going on tour. We are going to be going around Scotland. We've got four

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.400
 dates in Scotland at the end of August and start of September. We're going to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.680
 Cardiff. We're also playing a gig in London. Now the London gig is sold out in

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.880
 the room but it's also streaming online. So effectively if you live anywhere in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.760
 the world and you're listening to this, you can access a fish gig, especially if

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.120
 you live in Scotland, to a certain extent if you live in Cardiff and also if you

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 live anywhere else. You can get a ticket by going to nosuchthingasafish.com/live.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.600
 All the information is up there. Yes it is. Information item number two is, if

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.200
 anything, even more exciting than that because chief gnome, our big boss, the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.160
 man who created us in our current form, Mr John Lloyd, all-round comedy legend. He

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.360
 also has a live show. That is going to the Edinburgh Festival and it looks to be

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.480
 absolutely fantastic. It's called Do You Know Who I Am? If you don't know who

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.440
 John Lloyd is then I don't know where you've been but he is the man behind all

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.400
 the great comedies really of the 80s and 90s from Black Hatter, Spitting Image, The

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.760
 News Quiz, Not the Nine O'Clock News, QI obviously. Episode 17 of No Such Thing as

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.200
 a Fish. I think that's the one he's most proud of yes. So the show format is

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 you go, you ask him absolutely anything you want to ask him from the meaning of

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.160
 life to his fingernail cutting regimen. So go to the Edinburgh Fringe website and

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.280
 check out how to get tickets for that. It's on from the 5th to the 15th of August.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.640
 And the final bit of information is that we have a special guest today on No Such

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.720
 Thing as a Fish. The guest is a really exciting person. He is none other than

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 Malcolm Gladwell. We're sure you've heard of Malcolm and if not maybe you've

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.440
 heard of the Time 100 Most Influential People list which he's been on which

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.280
 might well be a first for us. He's a brilliant writer and broadcaster. He's

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 written fabulous books like The Tipping Point and Blink. He's got a new book out

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.720
 called The Bomber Mafia and if you're a podcast listener which you probably are

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.720
 listening to this he also hosts the fabulous revisionist history which

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.720
 looks at overlooked and misunderstood things in that classic Gladwellian way.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.240
 This was so much fun to record we really hope you enjoy listening to it.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.120
 Check out Malcolm's other things as above. Okay on with the show. On with the podcast.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:32.800
 [Music]

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.920
 podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.920
 Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520
 very special guest it's Malcolm Gladwell and once again we have gathered

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.040
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.840
 and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one and that

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.960
 is Malcolm. My favorite fact is that no one has any

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.640
 clear idea about what growing up with a smartphone does.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.080
 So we I got into this because I was doing an episode of my podcast

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.480
 Origins History on what I called Magic Wand Experiments. Okay. Which is the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.680
 experiment you would do if you could wave a magic wand, right?

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.000
 Because to spend all laws of nature and yeah practical and ethical.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 So I called up to spend a minute and I said who is a psychologist and I said

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.040
 what's your magic wand? And he said oh I want to divide

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.800
 let's say a thousand or two thousand children at birth

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.400
 and one group, group one gets a blackberry for the first 25 years of

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.360
 their life. Actually he wanted to do for the first 50 years

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.560
 and group two gets an iPhone. I said well why would you want to do that? And he

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.080
 said well because we just don't know why did an iPhone.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.560
 Which I thought I found that just an exception. He was astonishing.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.600
 It wasn't that he was invested in blackberries and has been very disappointed

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.920
 there. So all so the blackberry is just your

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.440
 phone and email. So we right okay yeah it's clear that

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.120
 is doesn't affect your life in any dramatic way, right?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.120
 And the iPhone is all the other stuff. Well if you go through the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.560
 literature he's like you'll discover that there is no consensus or even

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.680
 understanding of what all that other stuff

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.320
 does to a child. So he gave me an example. I suppose we were all

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.000
 six years old and I and we're sitting around a table

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.120
 and I or eight years old and I say something deeply offensive to Anna.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.880
 It happens a lot actually. Anna has many options

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.000
 but she can express her displeasure directly to me in one form or another.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.440
 Yell at me, cut me down sarcastically, punch me,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.520
 ignore me. All very enticing. You've met Anna before, right?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.920
 I ain't got a sense. And all of these are are deeply

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320
 effective ways of educating me about the consequences of my actions.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.800
 Now, I suppose me and Anna are on our iPhones and I say the exact same thing

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.720
 only it's a text. Yes. So the only way Anna can respond now

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.800
 is with another text. So she used to have an enormous repertoire of

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600
 potentially powerful and instructive responses to my provocation.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.160
 Now all she has is a text. So let's replace the enormous repertoire of

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.880
 powerfully instructive responses over the course of

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.440
 25 years just with texts. The question is what happens to Malcolm?

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.120
 Does Malcolm do I just become oblivious? Do I just keep

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.120
 being offensive? Do I never learn the consequences of my actions?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.320
 If I accompany my text with some really angry emojis, I think it might be him.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.960
 But nothing is as instructive as the things I mentioned.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.560
 Now it may be that it doesn't matter. It also may be that it's hugely consequential.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.160
 We have no idea. Right. When will we find out? Is it going to be like a future

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.200
 presidential election where they're simply on their phone texting each other

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.480
 for podiums? Like is it going to be decades before

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.440
 any kind of research can come out about this? Well, you have to study it.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.600
 It feels like we must know a bit. We've had 10 years.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.920
 Surely there's someone like in text to look into this.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.440
 There's no control. I think that's the no control. Yeah. And that's the problem.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.400
 We do know. So we know some things that are worrisome.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.320
 We know that levels of depression and mental illness are higher among

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.080
 adolescents now than they've ever been in measured history.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.440
 So is that coming to do with technology? Maybe we don't know.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.440
 It certainly is a kind of prod to think that this might be

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.160
 an important subject. It's terrifying researching this fact.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.840
 It is. It really is. And you know, the most telling thing I suppose

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.440
 so far is the response of Silicon Valley and basically all the people at the top

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.520
 of tech who now have turned against it and who discouraged their children from

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.280
 having screen time. The schools don't have iPads and computers.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.800
 Silicon Valley schools. Yeah, they all, so many of them regret doing what they did.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.720
 I think the guy who invented infinite scroll, Aza Raskin, I think he says he

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
 regrets it more than anything else in his life. He said it led to dire consequences.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.560
 Right. What did he invent? Sorry?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.080
 The infinite scroll. So before you got,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.200
 he got annoyed when he was about 22 at the fact on Google, you have to click

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.400
 next page when you get to the bottom. And he said, wouldn't it be great if you

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.880
 could just go on and on? And now he says he understands the importance of that stop.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.920
 I've never considered that that was the, I was thinking when you said he invented it,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.880
 I was thinking what came before infinite scroll and of course that was it.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.520
 Pages. Pages, yeah. Pages, that's all right.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.720
 And I'm now wondering what my all-time record of how many tweets I have scrolled

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.400
 through at once is because there must have been a day where I did more than I

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.600
 had ever done before. But if I had to click at the end of 10 tweets and make a conscious choice,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.520
 you want to see another 10 of these?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.600
 On his tombstone, that he, you know, let's make scrolling finite again.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.080
 Is he just sick of talking about it? Because I think a lot of these people regret it

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.040
 just because everyone keeps requesting interviews about it.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.320
 I spoke to a guy.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.440
 There can't be that many interview requests for the guy who invented infinite scroll.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.280
 No offense to him. I mean, that's clearly a big adventure.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.960
 But I bet it comes up a lot more than it is.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.640
 It's how he's introduced. Does he, I wonder, as he introduced himself,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.080
 like when he meets someone in a coffee shop.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.080
 He keeps talking until he stops.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:13.440
 No, he is, he compares it to, he says there's a study where people are given bowls of soup

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.640
 and told to eat as much as they want. And then some of the bowls refill constantly from underneath.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.120
 And some don't and they have to put refills in. And the people who have the bowls that refill

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.920
 constantly, the magic bowls, eat 70% more soup. And they don't even know that they've done it.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.640
 So it's this like really subconscious addictive thing.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.560
 So he says it's like that.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.600
 It's like the fairy tale, you know, with the, with the, we have an info,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.120
 what's that one where you have an infinite number of reach in the bag and has always

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:46.000
 gold coins. That was presented to us as children, as a, as a kind of triumphant story.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.280
 In fact, it's a tragic story.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.040
 Yes, exactly.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.000
 It is, it ruins you.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.640
 This is the fairy tale version of infinite scroll.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.080
 Yeah. That's true.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.400
 Another of those guys, Justin Rosenstein, who helped invent the like button.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.040
 And I only helped invent, I didn't do the sole inventor, but you know, he was part of the team

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.240
 in there. He has now turned off all notifications on his phone. Yeah, because when you install the

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.880
 new app, it often comes with notifications pre included, doesn't it? And you have to go into

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.720
 the settings and then turn it off. And that, yeah, Tim Harford wrote a column recently.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.320
 He changed over his phone at some point and all the notification settings were left on.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.960
 And he got to live as if he had had them on, you know, all the way from buying a phone at the

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.680
 first place and just a constant stream of notifications, jingles, bells, whistles, updates.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.960
 Oh, what if every single one is on?

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.920
 Every single app on his phone had the notifications now on.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.240
 Yeah.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.840
 And it was a constant noise.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.480
 You know what's really, the other interesting you can do is turn off the color on your phone.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.280
 Have you done this? No.

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.400
 Yeah, black and white, yeah.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.200
 Go black and white for a while.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.840
 What?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:48.000
 Yeah.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.440
 It's a similar kind of detoxing.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.160
 I've tried that.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.560
 Yeah.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.760
 That's great.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.880
 It is. It's very good.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.320
 One thing I used to get, which I don't anymore, is that thing of phantom phone vibration.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.680
 It's like phantom limb pain.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.320
 Yeah, exactly.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.280
 But it's phantom phone.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.320
 Have you never heard this?

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.880
 Never heard this. This is the strangest.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.600
 It's really, I haven't.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.720
 Wow, really. You know, you get the buzz. You think, oh, great.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.600
 Finally.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.360
 Someone wants, someone has texted me or needs me in some way.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:17.360
 And it's turned on every notification on his phone apps and still nothing, just still dead.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.560
 Yeah. No, it is. It's a very strange sensation.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.760
 Well, if it's any consolation to anyone, they've obviously been kind of preliminary studies.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:31.360
 It's hard to know that much at the moment, but this looked at data from 72,000 people

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.280
 between the ages of 10 and 80.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.840
 And it asked them how much time they spent on social media.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:40.080
 So this was like specifically about if social media makes you unhappy.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.960
 And then it asked how satisfied they were with their lives,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.600
 which I don't know how 10 year olds answered that question, but they did.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:49.520
 And it basically found that there was a Goldilocks effect.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.000
 So most people, if they're using these things moderately,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.880
 they're using social media moderately, they're pretty much okay.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.960
 People who are using it way, way, way too much, they're at the far end, that end,

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.800
 they tend to be, you know, have much more anxiety, more unhappiness.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.840
 But also people who are at the other end, same thing.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.960
 You know, people aren't really using social media at all, like me.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.200
 In fact, that's why I'm so chronically depressed all the time.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.640
 Then they're also more likely to be unhappy, which makes sense.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.560
 If you're in your teenage years, then that's how all your friends are communicating.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.880
 And then you're kind of excluded from it.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.840
 There's a very good Washington Post piece about parents who restrict their kids from having phones.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.920
 And it's a really weird piece because I think it's meant to be about how phones are bad for

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.440
 teenagers and it's great to restrict them.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.680
 But all the kids interviewed say, "It's horrible.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.280
 I can't communicate with my friends.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.040
 I don't know what kind of plans they're making.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.720
 There are a lot of conversations at school, which spring from things that I don't know about

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.320
 because I'm not on any of the chats."

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.440
 I think they're at the same pace.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.200
 I think they were a bit more equivocal.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.000
 They said they could see a couple of advantages to it as well.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.880
 At the end of the piece, it rounded up with one of the girls saying,

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.280
 "Yeah, I guess it'll be okay. I won't regret it in the end."

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.120
 But you can't do it in isolation.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.640
 Right. So the real question is, if your entire school didn't have a phone,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.400
 your entire friend's circle and your family, how would your life be different?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.640
 Yeah.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.200
 So you can't, but if you're turning these children who don't use their phones into pariahs,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:13.920
 of course I'm not.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.720
 Yeah, exactly.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.760
 They use their phones.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.960
 I know. Well, we're trapped, aren't we?

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.840
 That's why my friend wanted to do this experiment.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:28.080
 He wanted to take entire towns and make them smartphone-free zones and see what happens.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.040
 That's a fun idea.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.760
 Yeah.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.840
 Okay. If you're listening and you live in a small town or a village

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.280
 and you think you'd all be up for it, contact us.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.240
 We'll pass it on to Malcolm.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.120
 We'll pass it on to his friend and we'll get it going.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.600
 Okay. Well, I did find one other thing which I quite like.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.560
 This is about injuries that mobile phone users suffer.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.840
 This is actual measurable physical harm suffered.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:55.920
 Injuries experienced by mobile phone users due to their phones are sought over the last 20 years.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.520
 Obviously, because 20 years ago,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.960
 people didn't have nearly as many phones.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.960
 But between 1998 and 2017, apparently 76,000 Americans were injured in some way by their phones.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:11.520
 60% of younger people said they dropped their phone on their own face

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.360
 while lying down and looking at it.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.320
 Oh, yeah. That'll happen.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.680
 Yeah. Okay. Two in that.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.160
 Yes, isn't it?

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.960
 And the other thing is sometimes children will have a phone dropped on them by their parents.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.880
 You could be injured by that.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.720
 How heavy are these phones?

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.800
 Well, I guess the child could be a small child,

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.280
 a big old 1980s style car phone.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.160
 Yeah, yeah.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.360
 It's a recipe for disaster.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.600
 Okay, it might be not that.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.720
 Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.040
 But it's, you know, there's peril there.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.360
 Were there injuries in earlier generations from books being dropped on children's heads?

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.440
 I mean, I need a control here.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.400
 Printing dresses.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.400
 You know, big fat Grimm's fairy tales.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.560
 Dropped on a three-year-old's head.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:07.200
 My fact is that in 1931, the USA launched an aircraft carrier which itself could fly.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.960
 Great stuff.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.400
 Was it transported inside another bigger flying aircraft carrier, aircraft carrier?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.920
 Oh, wow, like a Russian doll.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.440
 Sadly, it was not.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:21.600
 No, that was a more Soviet thing, the Matroshka aircraft carrier, which did.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.360
 So this was an airship which the U.S. Navy launched in 1931.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.720
 It was called the USS Akron, and it was an airship.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.000
 So that's a ship with a rigid frame, so blimps.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.680
 Like the Hindenburg, if you were picturing it slightly, right?

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.360
 Yeah, yeah, it's an airship.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.320
 Sorry, when you went for the description, I was just cutting out the middleman there.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:44.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.080
 Oh, I should also say where I got the fact.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.440
 I've been listening to a podcast called Black Box Down, which is great.

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:54.240
 It's all about aviation, mishaps, and catastrophes, and everything in between.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:02.480
 And so the Akron was this airship, and it was enormous, and it launched in 1931,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:08.640
 crashed in 1933, and the main selling feature of it, the thing that the Navy were interested in,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.920
 was that it was designed to be able to carry small fighter planes.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.560
 There were these planes called sparrow hawks, which were, I think, small,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.240
 I think they were bi-planes, but anyway, it could fit in at least three of them,

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.080
 and it was going to be redesigned so it could fit in five.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.000
 And the idea was that the USS Akron would fly overhead, lower a little

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.640
 hook from which the fighter plane is dangling, just retract the hook, plane flies off,

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.840
 and you know, launches three of these planes, and then they fly back,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:40.560
 snag onto the hook once again, and are retracted into the belly of the airship.

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.880
 Do you think you have to be really good at those fairground games,

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.800
 where you hook a duck onto a stick?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.040
 I imagine, yeah, it was quite a precise manoeuvre.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.680
 We did it work.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.880
 So, it worked that it could deploy these planes.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:58.480
 I think the hook facility did work, but there's a reason we're not using all these now,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.760
 basically, which is that the airships obviously went very far out of fashion.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.720
 This lasted two years before it crashed, and it killed over 70 people,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.520
 including one of the main advocates for airship development and expansion.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.520
 But it was the airship that didn't work.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.760
 We all know the airships had a bit of a rough ride,

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.560
 but the actual aircraft carrier element was quite good.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.680
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.480
 It worked.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:25.760
 I'm struck by the fact that the chief proponent for airships dies in the destruction of the airship

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.200
 as a kind of model for dealing with bad inventors.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.960
 It's the captain goes down with the ship model of us.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.080
 Yeah, it is.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.360
 Yeah, it really was, yeah, yeah.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.360
 But we still make ships after he dies.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.480
 You know, this is a...

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.000
 So, imagine, there's a famous Dick Gregory joke.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.440
 I'm now obsessed with Dick Gregory.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.000
 Are you?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:44.560
 I am.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.280
 He's amazing.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.960
 He's such an extraordinary character.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.640
 He talks about when he was in the army,

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.280
 he lost his rifle and they charged him $85.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.280
 He said, "I had no idea they were going to charge me.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.200
 Now I know why the captain goes down with the ship."

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.280
 That's great.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.600
 It was like the Segway guy, wasn't it?

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.240
 Yeah.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.360
 That's the modern day.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.040
 You know, the guy who invented the Segway went over a cliff on his Segway, didn't he?

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.760
 Sorry, I thought...

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.040
 Was it the inventor or the head of one of the big Segway companies?

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.680
 The head of one of the companies.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.880
 I don't think it was the actual invention.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.440
 Was it not?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.400
 I always thought it was the actual invention.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.720
 God, I was mishearing the word "Segway."

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.680
 I really thought you were going to say that we had, you know,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.840
 an inventor of the Segway, the conversational Segway.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.880
 The conversational Segway.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.600
 Shakespeare, actually.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.920
 He died halfway through trying to change the topic.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.680
 He was impaled on a tangent.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:37.680
 So, just one other thing about the acrobat.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.240
 One of the other features it had, and it wasn't unique to it,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.640
 this was actually a thing that had been invented a couple of decades before

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.440
 on other airships.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.120
 It had a spy basket.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.800
 I don't know if you guys read about this, but it's an observation basket

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.200
 that hangs beneath the body of the airship.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.080
 And the principle was, as you're flying your airship,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.880
 you want to be observing the ground but discreetly.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.480
 Airships are obviously huge.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.440
 So the idea was you'd hide the airship in a cloud,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.440
 lower the spy basket on a cable for several hundred meters in some cases,

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.760
 and there is someone sitting in the spy basket who watches the ground,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.040
 can radio back up, tell the airship itself where to go,

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.120
 or whether they're nearing the target or whatever.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.440
 Fun.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.680
 And the acrobat had one of these, and it was a disaster.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.800
 It was tested once with sandbags in it instead of a person.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.120
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:25.680
 But, you know...

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.640
 Well, no wonder it was a disaster.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.680
 What can sandbags tell you?

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.720
 It was so unstable, this little observation basket,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.600
 that it started swaying in the wind on this great long cable.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.480
 It swayed so much that it swayed up to the equator level

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.840
 of the entire airship.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.560
 Oh, my God.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.120
 So, you know, thank God no one was actually in it, because it was...

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.000
 Oh, that would be fun.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.440
 That would be like that ride at theme parks or on the boat, on the pirate ship.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.400
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.480
 It would have really, really given some of the best time.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.200
 I'm more fascinated that they were hiding in clouds.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760
 Because what is the speed of a cloud?

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.680
 Like, you'd have to maintain the speed, right?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.280
 So you don't pop out on the other side.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.880
 You could also go with the cloud, as in...

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:05.520
 You'd have to, yeah.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.600
 The cloud might not be flying towards your bombing target.

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.120
 Yeah, exactly.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.200
 Well, we had the bombs somewhere different today.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.120
 Clouds again, you know.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.840
 It only works in over-cloudy areas, too, right?

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:20.080
 So you're limited to military operations in Northern Europe,

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.320
 in, you know, parts of, you know...

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.200
 Yeah, yeah.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:23.920
 Here's the thing, though.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.680
 Manchester, if you really can't do this out in England that much.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.400
 Why not just disguise the blimp as a cloud?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:30.640
 Why not just put...

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.920
 Oh, that's a better idea, yeah.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.960
 Well, it's actually a comfortable world.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.320
 Yeah, it's a comfortable world.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.120
 Candy floss.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.600
 And then there's your fairground ride, as I did.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.840
 It's all... It springs up, speaking of impaling myself on a tangent.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.600
 Why do the internet people call the place

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.120
 where they store all your most valuable knowledge and data?

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:47.760
 The cloud.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.920
 Of all of the metaphors, this is the worst.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.560
 You're right.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.200
 Yes.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.960
 A cloud is a flighty thing.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.640
 Planes fly through them all the time.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.160
 Clouds are routinely violated by any other thing in the air.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.760
 They're totally ephemeral.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.040
 They are totally ephemeral.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.760
 That's the thing...

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.840
 We're going to call it a cloud.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.680
 They're all around a table.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.440
 They're saying, "What's the metaphor we want?

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:11.440
 For the safe place we put your data?"

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:14.640
 Somebody says...

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.360
 A bank?

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.480
 No.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.320
 Someone says, "Who now regrets that?"

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.480
 Who is now among the group?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.120
 Who's like...

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.440
 Yeah.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.480
 God, I called it the cloud.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.760
 He's giving it to you.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.920
 I should have called it the paper bag like I wanted to.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.240
 I'm not involved.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.160
 I mean, it's just unbelievable.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.040
 You're so right.

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.760
 They're flimsy.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.520
 They've got negative connotations.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.640
 They're very temporary.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.440
 No one likes them.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.320
 No one.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.160
 Yeah, thank God it's a cloudy day.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.920
 I was looking at military planes, generally,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.400
 and sort of air squadrons.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.280
 And I don't think we've talked about the Soviet night witches

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.720
 ever on this show.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.040
 But do you guys know about these?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:56.240
 They were a all-female air squadron in World War II.

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.120
 And they...

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:00.720
 I think it was one woman who, you know,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.640
 sort of pitched to the Soviet government and said,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.720
 "Look, lettuce flies in planes."

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.800
 They flew these incredibly light planes.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.560
 So they were made to fly very, very low.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.760
 So it's quite dangerous.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.840
 They were made of just plywood and canvas.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.280
 They had to be so light.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.520
 So they couldn't have any armor.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.840
 They couldn't have any parachutes, anything like that.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.160
 These women literally just took a map and a compass

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.280
 up in these planes.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.920
 And the key and the reason they had to be so light

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.480
 was because they could stall, I think,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.320
 quite a long way from their target

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.640
 and sort of drift close to the target,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.400
 which meant that they were very quiet.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.120
 Wow.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.400
 But what are they...

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.840
 Sorry, are they fighter planes?

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.560
 Are they bomber planes?

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.600
 Bomber planes, yeah.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.440
 Couldn't be a bomber plane if they're incredibly light.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.520
 Yeah, I mean, not letting them have a parachute,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.160
 but they're also...

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.880
 You're right.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.040
 They didn't carry bombs, so there was some weight.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.000
 The parachute, I'm afraid,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.680
 is just going to take the side of the edge.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.480
 Very light bombs.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.200
 Could you have one bomb fewer and give me a parachute?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.000
 Would that be...

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.360
 Bombs made of feathers.

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.360
 And completely harmless bombs, actually.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.000
 Wow.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.960
 I know, they dropped 23,000 tons of bombs in the war.

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.840
 Goodness.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.400
 The weird thing is, their name, The Night Witches,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.920
 as far as I can tell, and all the sources,

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.520
 even back to the time, say this,

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.200
 they were named The Night Witches by the Germans,

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.960
 the Naxahexen.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.520
 And apparently, they named them that

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.040
 because of the sound they made.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.080
 Because they were so quiet,

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.120
 they just sounded whooshing, like a broomstick.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.360
 So apparently, we are to believe

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.200
 that they weren't actually called The Night Witches

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.560
 because of their gender.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.080
 That's a complete coincidence.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.640
 Isn't that weird?

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.640
 Come on, that's like when Jay-Z said,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.200
 in 99 problems that a bitch ain't one,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.400
 was about his dog.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.760
 Like, it's not really with that.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.960
 Did he claim that?

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.200
 Well, you know, I got 99 problems with that.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.800
 No, I know the line, but I just haven't heard that.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:41.520
 He came out and said,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.200
 "No, it's not about women, it's about my dog."

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.360
 Yeah, sure, Jay-Z.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.360
 I guess the difference between Jay-Z and the Nazis here

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.320
 is that it does make sense

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.400
 because the Nazis couldn't see into the plane.

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.720
 So how would they have known that there were women flying them?

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.480
 The Nazis call them The Night Witches.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.560
 Yeah, they named them the sound they made swooping over.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.320
 And they also must have been so uncomfortable.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.440
 They had to wear men's clothes

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.320
 because they didn't have any pilot clothes for women.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.680
 Apparently, they tore up their bedding

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.280
 and stuffed it into the shoes they wore

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.160
 so they would fit.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.040
 What? Oh, wow.

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.280
 Yeah.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:16.000
 I mean, it's hard enough driving a car in Wellington boots, but...

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.600
 Well, firstly, we have to ask about that.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.360
 You know, if you're trying to drive a sensitive instrument

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.200
 in not very comfortable shoes,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.640
 I'm surprised they managed to get anything done.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.360
 Yeah, true.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.120
 Anna, when did you last drive your car in Wellies?

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:27.840
 Because I feel like...

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.440
 Hi, I love it.

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.600
 The one detail in this story that you're drawn to

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.760
 is the fact that they didn't have comfortable shoes.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.760
 I would imagine in the list of problems these women have,

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.280
 flying over enemy territory,

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:42.160
 blowing the ground in flimsy, canvas airplanes.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:50.560
 Chances of being killed gruesomely, first problem,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.600
 big shoe, second problem.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.200
 I think I don't actually do understand that

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.200
 because you know when you're meant to have a bigger problem,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.320
 but you can only focus on the fact

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.080
 you've got a stone in your shoe or something

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.320
 and that dominates your attention.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.360
 I'm very familiar with the sense

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.480
 of having much bigger problems,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.920
 but actually only able to focus on the fact

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.440
 there's one little thing that's wrong

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.640
 as a distraction method.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.000
 When I was doing the Bara Mafia, the book that I'm...

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.920
 One of the things that I was struck by all over again

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.360
 is what these pilots went through in the Second World War

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.360
 is just, in retrospect, completely unbelievable.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.560
 What we asked them to do.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.200
 Like...

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.200
 What do you mean, the danger or the discomfort?

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.160
 But don't just say that.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.920
 You take a 20-year-old kid,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.320
 you put him through X number of months of training,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.160
 you fly him over to, if he's an American,

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.600
 fly him over to Europe,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.560
 and he goes on these missions where statistically,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.920
 the chance of you surviving your term, your tour, is zero.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.040
 They know the death rates, right?

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.920
 They're...

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.920
 And you're up at 20,000 feet where it's freezing cold

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.160
 and these planes are not pressurized

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.880
 or heated or you're...

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.480
 The bombardier is sitting in this little thing

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.920
 that's exposed to...

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.000
 And German fighters are coming at...

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.520
 I mean, it's just like that,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.760
 that they all didn't have PTSD is astonishing to me.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.400
 And then you do a 12-hour whatever mission over Germany.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.640
 You fly back to some freezing cold,

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.320
 unheated air base in the South of England.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.400
 You get four hours of sleep and then you do it again.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.880
 And you keep doing it for like...

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.600
 I mean, it's just like insane to me that this...

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.840
 This is what we...

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.920
 I mean, maybe only a 20-year-old would put up with that kind of...

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.200
 I mean, that was the reason.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.600
 But planes, the importance that planes had,

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.320
 particularly in World War II, it's pretty staggering.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.360
 So at one point during 1939 to 1945,

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.280
 ally factories were building 633,000 aircraft in that time.

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.640
 So they were pumping them out at 288 aircraft per day.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.560
 And this was a time where they were just trying to work out

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.760
 how do we come up with a new kind of plane

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.760
 that's going to just be the game changer in this war.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.760
 So in this period as well,

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.760
 250 new designs were all tested, built and flown,

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.120
 just to see whether or not they could get one over on the enemy.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.880
 And it was one plane in particular,

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.960
 which was the P-51 Mustang,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.840
 which was the absolute game changer during war.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.440
 When that was designed and started flying,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.680
 the Americans started flying that in over Germany,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.800
 that was the moment where basically the Germans realized

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.240
 they were going to lose the war.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.680
 Göring said himself, he said,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.560
 "When I saw the Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up."

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.000
 He never...

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.720
 Göring did not say the phrase, the jig was up.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.680
 He did it.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.600
 He wouldn't have known the phrase, the jig is up.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.160
 He did, he said, "Otto Spaghetti Ol'."

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.080
 He really did.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.720
 Have you been going right until he said that?

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.240
 He had a quirky turn of phrase.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.720
 Clearly.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.400
 I'm speaking of Göring in World War II.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.040
 He said he's a real great guy.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.800
 Once again, impaling ourselves on a tin.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:59.680
 He had a quid for every time you'd said that.

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.440
 The only person I know about.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.640
 One of the RAF raids in World War II

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.080
 was specifically for the intention

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.600
 of interrupting one of his speeches.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.440
 So it wasn't necessary to do any bombing or anything.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.720
 This is in 1943,

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.480
 and it was a huge speech in Berlin

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.880
 to commemorate 10 years of Hitler being in power.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.520
 And Göring was going to make this big keynote speech.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.000
 And the plan was to fly a bunch of mosquitoes

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.680
 through the clouds above,

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.680
 really, really near to their microphones.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.920
 So that basically, while the speech was being broadcast,

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.920
 it would pick up the sound of the RAF

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.600
 sort of attacking the city.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:30.640
 That's kind of genius.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.840
 This is clever, isn't it?

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.320
 And it works.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.200
 Mosquitoes, unbelievable planes.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.640
 We should say they were made of plywood,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.520
 and they were made largely by carpenters in England.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.080
 That's actually what pissed him off so much.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.560
 When this happened, and they had to cut off his speech,

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.160
 because they thought this sounds really bad now.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.760
 He's shouting over invasion.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.360
 You know, he said something like,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.960
 "I can't believe these bloody Brits

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.240
 have got seven carpenters,

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.800
 and they've pieced these planes together out of some trees,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.320
 and we can't do anything like it."

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.080
 But yeah.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.440
 Did he say anything about the jig,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.040
 and where he thought it might be?

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.480
 Once again, the jig is up.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.720
 It's like a Scooby-Doo film.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.480
 Stop trying to make the jig work.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.280
 I read this other thing as well,

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.160
 just going back to psychology of the pilots

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.120
 that were being used.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.640
 There was a series of spy planes.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.400
 This is in the '60s, this is a bit later.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.520
 The Blackbird, which we've spoken about before on the show,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.000
 and the A-12, these were all high-flying spy planes

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.720
 that they really, really didn't tell many people about.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.840
 And there's a rumor that went around,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.000
 which quite a few historians have substantiated

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.040
 and said was true,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.800
 is that during the interview process,

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.360
 they would only hire pilots who were married

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.120
 so that they had a reason to come back,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.720
 because they had had a bunch of defectors at this point.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.120
 This is a very positive attitude towards marriage.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:51.040
 You could have easily spent it the other way.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:29:00.560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.920
 and that is my fact.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.040
 My fact this week is that there is a marathon in New York

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.880
 that takes so long to complete,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.600
 runners can go through up to 20 pairs of shoes

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.720
 while they're trying to run it.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.200
 And they're all too big for them, aren't they?

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.560
 They are stuffed with anything.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.840
 They're all they could think about, yeah.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.880
 This is an amazing thing, and Malcolm, you're a New Yorker,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.280
 so I wonder if you had ever heard of this.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.080
 I have, I have.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.280
 And you're a runner, aren't you?

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:30.160
 And a runner, so the self-transcendence 3,100-mile race,

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.720
 it's a race that goes around a single block in New York.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.680
 So in total, if you ran around this block distance,

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.600
 it's 0.54 miles, right?

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.160
 Okay.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.760
 But to complete this marathon,

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.680
 you need to run around this block 5,649 times.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.720
 You've got 52 days in which to complete it,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.400
 and runners will start at 6 a.m.,

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.400
 and they'll run all the way through to midnight.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.960
 They'll do an average of 59 kilometers,

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.120
 59 and a half kilometers per day.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.760
 And if you manage to complete

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.720
 what is the longest certified marathon in the world,

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.960
 you get an amazing prize,

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.120
 which is usually either a DVD or a t-shirt.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.040
 Sometimes a small trophy.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.680
 What DVD?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.440
 Depends on the movie.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.120
 Yeah, this is incredible.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.960
 Malcolm, have you ever...

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.920
 Been tempted to do that?

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.280
 Is that your question?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.680
 Have you been to the route?

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.800
 Because it's just one block in New York City.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:24.400
 It's one block in Queens, I think.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.440
 It is in Queens, yes.

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:25.920
 That's right.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.480
 A lot of strange things happen in Queens.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.800
 Dad, chief among them.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.320
 It's lunacy, let's be clear.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.600
 Even the normal marathon is lunacy.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.320
 Right.

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.120
 I've never done a marathon.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.160
 Have you done a marathon before?

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.640
 I would never.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:39.600
 It's nuts.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.520
 I mean, there's no part of it.

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.360
 Some random Greek, you know, thousands of years ago,

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.920
 completes this distance, dies at the end.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.000
 And then that...

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.640
 We've seized on this as the kind of ultimate running experience.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.600
 Every thing about marathoning strikes me.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.760
 I mean, I'm a very, very serious runner.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:01.600
 I just find it incomprehensible that anyone other than

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.640
 a kind of elite runner would ever even attempt it.

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.920
 So when you say you're a serious runner,

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.480
 do you do short distance sprinting runners?

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.320
 Normal, I run, you know, if I race,

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.480
 I run 5Ks or 10Ks or miles.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.000
 But the idea of going out there for hours on end,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.720
 inevitably injuring myself while preparing for it,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.600
 and sacrificing huge parts of my life

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.320
 so I can go for 20 mile runs on the weekend.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:24.960
 You know, it's just like...

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.840
 Yeah, it's very interesting.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.400
 Because I don't really run very much,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.440
 but I do think of running as a progression towards the marathon,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.760
 which I have stopped at a very early point in,

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.720
 as in I don't...

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.280
 I'm not making any more progress towards a marathon

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:38.080
 in the distances I run.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.240
 But you think of the marathon as the end goal...

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.200
 Sort of, yeah.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.280
 As you know, you do a 5K and then you do a 10K run,

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.720
 and then eventually you'll do a marathon.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.680
 Or you run 3,000 miles around a single block.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.800
 It is insane.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.760
 It's not like they shut it...

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.080
 Because I've been in New York when there's a marathon on,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.680
 and obviously, like anywhere else,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.280
 they shut the city roads down.

00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.240
 They have all sorts of people cheering on the sides.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.640
 These people just have to do it every day around New York.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.840
 Is someone checking them?

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.080
 I think so, yeah.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.600
 But it's a very low key.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.080
 There's basically a trestle table where the race headquarters is.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.360
 And I think it's just a couple of people.

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.880
 I don't know if they check the actual laps,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.080
 or if they're tagged or...

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.800
 How long is it last?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.560
 52 days, so yeah, a couple of months.

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.080
 So someone has to sit there from 6...

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.360
 From 6 in the morning to midnight.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.640
 They're the real hero of the story.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.080
 They're the real hero of the story.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.560
 They feel like 2 days.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.000
 How many pairs of trousers do they get?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.280
 Yeah, yeah.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.160
 I bet they've watched that DVD a bunch in that time, right?

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.800
 I find that person more interested in the person doing the running.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.320
 Who is this person who can be convinced to take that job?

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.440
 This is preposterous.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:41.920
 You're right.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.200
 interview that guy.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.640
 You're so right.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.480
 Do they ask him whether they're happily married?

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.720
 This is an extension of the same...

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.560
 Only married men can take this job.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.480
 You want to get away from the family for 52 days?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:54.800
 It is.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.920
 I think you need to sort of...

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.960
 You need an ultra-running CV even to enter the race.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.360
 Really?

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.440
 They don't just take any schlub who says...

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.680
 Who turns up and says, "I reckon I could do it."

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.320
 Because I can easily see if I was ever a good enough runner

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.920
 to even consider entering this.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.280
 I can see it getting a bit later.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.320
 You're like, "You miss a day."

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.320
 You think, "Oh, I'll catch up later."

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:12.800
 It's fine.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.560
 I've got 50 days to do it.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.080
 How long can it be to just, you know?

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:16.800
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:20.560
 My running friends and I have something we call the Kipchogi number.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.000
 Kipchogi being the world's greatest marathon.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.720
 Yeah.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.840
 The Kipchogi number is how long you could run with Kipchogi

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:30.240
 if Kipchogi was running at world record pace.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:30.640
 Cool.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.200
 Right.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.360
 So everyone in the world has a Kipchogi number.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.760
 Your Kipchogi number may be two feet, right?

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.600
 It's always...

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.880
 The rule about Kipchogi numbers is they are shorter than you think.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.720
 How lot do you know what your Kipchogi number is?

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.320
 My Kipchogi number is...

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.920
 If I'm very fit, it's probably 1200 meters.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.640
 That's decent.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.920
 That's pretty good.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.560
 I wish I had written this down related to this.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.280
 So there's the 5K park run, which I think is 5K.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.680
 Park run is about...

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.600
 It's a huge thing here.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.160
 Many hundreds of thousands of people have done it now.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.920
 And I think they looked at how many people over 5K

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.240
 in the park run at their pace would have beaten Kipchogi

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.920
 running his marathon pace.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.080
 So he was running that speed for 26 miles.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.560
 Yeah, exactly.

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.200
 And everyone...

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.760
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.720
 And I think it's like fewer than 100 people

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.680
 are over that amount, over that distance.

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.640
 They're seriously...

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.560
 You'd be very good to even keep up with Kipchogi.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.280
 He's good.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.000
 But it's this thing...

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.720
 It's not...

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.160
 Because I was watching the marathon yesterday

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.600
 at the World Championships.

00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.320
 You see these guys on the television

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.720
 and because they're all running at the same pace,

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.520
 there's an illusion that they're not running that fast.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.240
 Right, yeah.

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.120
 But you have to understand if you actually see them in person,

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.720
 it is astonishing.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:50.560
 So they're running at 445 mile pace for 26 consecutive miles.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.160
 So all this is to say, I don't lack respect for the achievement.

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:56.480
 Yeah.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.960
 I just think trying to do it is for...

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.200
 If you're not a professional, it's foolishness.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.560
 I do always find it amazing how many people

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.000
 they get to do the marathon each year.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.560
 So many thousands of people who are up for this.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.200
 I know.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:07.840
 Very difficult.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.280
 Very difficult for you of masochism, yeah.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.640
 And probably not that good for you.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.120
 It's weird.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:11.840
 Again, it's like...

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.080
 You know, I was talking earlier about the Goldilocks,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:16.640
 like for social media, moderate use is good.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.120
 Similarly, studies seem to show that moderate exercise,

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.640
 very good for you, obviously.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.040
 Extreme exercise, like ultramarathon running,

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.480
 doesn't seem to be that good for you.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.480
 It doesn't really confirm any more health benefits

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.320
 if you're running extremely long distances.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:31.520
 And people do have these unbelievable hallucinations.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.600
 They often collapse.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.400
 I think there was...

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.160
 Is this standard marathons you're talking about?

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.440
 Usually more like ultramarathons.

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.320
 Ultramarathons, okay, yeah.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.000
 So there was Jasmine Paris, you remember?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.240
 She is a champion fell runner.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.000
 And she...

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.560
 Anyway, she won the 2019 Montaigne spy race,

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.080
 which is a big up and down kind of mountain ultramarathon.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.040
 And she saw lots of hallucinations and still...

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.480
 But still managed to win it

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.960
 and was expressing breast milk along the way, I think.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.520
 Really?

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.320
 It's 268 miles, and she had a newborn baby.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:01.120
 Where was the baby?

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:01.520
 As in...

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:05.440
 The baby was being run alongside her by her partner,

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.120
 who actually deserves more credit.

00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.240
 That's amazing.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.960
 We should say about...

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.200
 This race is called the...

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.760
 What is it called?

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.160
 The...

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.200
 Self-transcendence.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.080
 Self-transcendence.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.360
 Who does your tip off right there?

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.360
 Yeah.

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.880
 Don't transcend yourself.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.680
 Don't do it.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.280
 So we should say the guy who...

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:23.840
 Oh, yes.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.360
 It's founded in his name.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:25.760
 Yeah.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.720
 Sri Chimnai.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.200
 Yeah.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.000
 So he was a...

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:28.640
 He's a guru.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:28.960
 Guru.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.440
 He's a guru, yeah.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.520
 There are Sri Chimnai races around the world.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:31.920
 Yeah.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:32.400
 Yeah, yeah.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.240
 And he was extraordinary.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:34.640
 Yeah.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.040
 As in...

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.320
 You read a bit about his life story.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.840
 So he expressed self-transcendence through fitness.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.640
 And as a result, did all these, you know, amazing feats.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.960
 He lifted extraordinary weights and...

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.600
 Plains.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.640
 He lifted planes, supposedly.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.120
 I know.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:47.840
 I'm slight.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.480
 Yeah, I can see...

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.000
 He was the original aircraft carrier.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.400
 He was.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.360
 But his really...

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.960
 Like the funniest thing he did was called

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.960
 "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness Heart."

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.080
 Okay, that's what it was called.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.600
 He went around the world bench pressing significant people.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:01.920
 Yeah.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:04.080
 Who've contributed to human history.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.600
 So he lifted 8,000 people around the world.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.440
 He lifted Nelson Mandela.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:09.840
 Wow.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.120
 Desmond Tutu.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.000
 Billie Jean King.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.280
 And then, I mean, it goes a bit like the list...

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.160
 Susan Sarandon.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.480
 Oh, come on.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.600
 That's Eddie Murphy.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.080
 Nickname.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:18.560
 Eddie Murphy.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.120
 Eddie Murphy.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.560
 Eddie Murphy, Yoko Rono.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.760
 Ravi Shankar.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.640
 Several heads of state.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.600
 Richard Gere.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.000
 Sting.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.960
 Jesse Jackson.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.960
 He's a wrestler, former wrestler.

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.000
 He's a biggie.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.280
 Jeff Goldblum.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.240
 Goldblum got a lift.

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:33.120
 Goldblum got a lift.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.600
 Wow.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.000
 It just feels like a...

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.280
 What a weird thing to do.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.840
 What a very strange club of people to get together.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.760
 But one time, he lifted a Republican and a Democrat

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.480
 at the same time.

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.440
 Oh, really?

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.200
 Yeah, just to express peace.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.640
 That is actually...

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:46.960
 Yeah.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.560
 That's cross-party, cross-island politics.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.360
 Where is he from?

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.720
 He was from India, I want to say.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.440
 I think he was.

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:53.920
 Yeah.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.000
 He worked for the Indian Consulate, certainly,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.560
 when he was...

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.000
 And that's why he moved to America.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.240
 So he moved there in 1964.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.600
 And yeah, he was just an extraordinary, as you say,

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.440
 kind of fitness character with a huge fan base.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:11.040
 Can I just quickly mention, I saw a photo of you,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:14.160
 a sort of younger college version of you doing a run

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.600
 on your blog.

00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.480
 And you were doing an attempt at the four-minute mile,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:18.880
 basically.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.640
 Or at least you were running a mile and you got a number.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.680
 That's close to it.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.640
 Yeah, it was high school, early days of high school,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.760
 and it was...

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.600
 I was running the 1500 meters, yes.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.600
 But I was nowhere close to a four-minute mile,

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.120
 which is a grown-up activity.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.920
 I think I ran a four-oh-something 1500 meters.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.720
 Oh, really?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.440
 Very different.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.920
 But not still, you got four-oh-something.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.960
 Four-oh-five.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.320
 And the 1500 meters.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.600
 Yeah, I was 14.

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.800
 Yeah, that's pretty quick.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.720
 I peaked as a runner at 14, which amazes me to this day

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.800
 when I think of the idea that there was something

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.120
 I could do at 14, which I can't do,

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.120
 which I could do better than at any other point in my life.

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.920
 Yeah.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.360
 It's kind of strange to think of that.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.720
 If only someone had told you then,

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.400
 so you could have appreciated it.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.200
 I'll stop.

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.320
 I'll stop, I'll give up.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.040
 Yeah.

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.720
 That's right.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:07.040
 Yeah.

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.240
 We've never mentioned Cliff Young.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.360
 Cliff Young?

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.080
 Long...

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:12.960
 He must have known Cliff...

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.480
 Australian hero, Cliff Young.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:15.040
 Never heard of him.

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.000
 So he ran the Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.680
 in its inaugural year, which was 1983.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.800
 Sydney to Melbourne.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.960
 Yep, it's 875 kilometers.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.440
 Wow.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.480
 And he ran...

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.400
 We traveled that journey and we flew.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.720
 So...

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.120
 We did.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.640
 Well, we had to get from one tour date

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.600
 to the other quite quickly,

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.400
 so it wouldn't have been practical actually for us to run it.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:33.360
 Otherwise we would have.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.440
 But anyway, so 1983, it's inaugurated.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.080
 The world's top runners go and say they'll try doing this run.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.760
 They've all got the training plan.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.760
 They've tried running those distances before.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.760
 And basically all the pros have established

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.920
 that you run 18 hours a day

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.000
 and you sleep for six hours a day

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.200
 and you'll do it in, I think, five, six, seven days,

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.720
 depending on how fast you go.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.040
 And so they all turn up and this guy turns up,

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.760
 who's a 61-year-old farmer called Cliff Young,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.320
 and he's wearing his Wellington boots

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.640
 and he's wearing like farming overalls.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.840
 And just before he starts,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.560
 he puts on the first ever pair of running shoes he's ever owned.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.000
 And he took out his teeth because...

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.200
 Let's stop it.

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.040
 They rattled when he ran.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.720
 So it's just so Australian, right?

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.800
 (laughter)

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.320
 And he put on his hat with the cork hanging down from it.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.720
 And he started...

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.040
 No, he started shuffling along incredibly slowly

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.680
 and everyone, like, left him in their dusk completely.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.800
 Super slowly.

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.160
 But he didn't sleep and he had a different strategy.

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:39.200
 He was a sheep farmer and he had 2,000 acres of land

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.120
 and he used to have to run across this land

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.400
 for days on end sometimes,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.920
 herding the sheep, chasing the sheep.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.360
 And he thought, "Well, I don't need to sleep

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.360
 when I run that three, four days, I don't sleep.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:48.720
 I'm just going to not sleep."

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.400
 And eventually, day two, day three,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.920
 started overtaking them all.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:55.280
 Are you sure you're not just telling us the hair and the tortoise story?

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:56.560
 This is all feeding a bit east off.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.000
 This is all this whole...

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.480
 Cliff Young, the tortoise, the pet tortoise.

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.480
 No, it was incredible.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.280
 Where does he win?

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.000
 He wins the race.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.640
 What?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.880
 He beats the nearest competitor by 10 hours.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.280
 He's way, way, way ahead, 61 years old.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.080
 And now, everyone does it his way,

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.840
 by sort of sleeping maybe one hour a night and shuffling.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.320
 Okay.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:20.800
 He's like...

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.520
 You know what he's like?

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.840
 He's like, "Do you remember David Burkhoff?"

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.160
 No.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.160
 "Burkhoff" is the Cliff Young of the backstroke.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.800
 Oh, really?

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.520
 Oh, yeah.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.960
 You're in the backstroke, you jump off,

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.520
 you dive into the water and then you surface

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.880
 and you go, "Whoop, whoop, whoop," right?

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:37.440
 Yeah.

00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.280
 Burkhoff realizes, "Oh, actually,

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.480
 it's faster to swim underwater than on top."

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.200
 So, Burkhoff starts, drives in and he doesn't surface

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:49.040
 until two-thirds of the way down.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.080
 Yeah, right.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.880
 And he breaks the world record and they eventually ban it.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.400
 Oh, my God, it does feel like cheating.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.440
 He's Cliff Young, though.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.200
 He realizes that there's a flaw in the way people are...

00:41:59.200 --> 00:41:59.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.000
 Hang on, can I just check about David Burkhoff?

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.080
 So, you said that was backstroke, right?

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:04.720
 Backstroke.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:08.000
 So, are you allowed to do another stroke underwater?

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.560
 No.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.840
 I could be wrong here.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:10.880
 I think you do a dolphin kick.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.160
 You do the dolphin kick, yeah.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.120
 And then dolphin kick.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.400
 But you're allowed to be on your front, aren't you?

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.360
 But you're allowed to be on your front.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.640
 You're not doing backstroke because you're on your back.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.240
 No, no, backstroke, you start in the water and you go back.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:20.720
 Yeah.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.360
 Oh, okay, okay.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.680
 So, he just stays underwater doing a dolphin kick.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.480
 Upside down.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:26.240
 Sorry, I got it, I got it.

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.440
 And surfaces later.

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:28.960
 It's called the Burkhoff blast off.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:29.520
 That's amazing.

00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.480
 It's not quicker.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.240
 I feel like I'd be really slow at that.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.120
 Why is it quicker?

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.400
 I've never understood why it's quicker.

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.600
 I don't know anything about swimming.

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.280
 Because you can't do it with your arms, can you?

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.160
 The up and down maneuvering must take a lot of the speed

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.120
 out of your forwards.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:41.760
 Yeah.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.160
 But it's doing the dolphin kick is faster than doing the backstroke.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:46.640
 Oh, I see.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.920
 It's the point of the backstroke.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.480
 Yeah, yeah.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.520
 Well, backstroke kicks.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:52.080
 So, we do the backstroke to move more slowly through the water.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:52.800
 Is that what we do?

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.160
 Well, yeah, it's like butterfly.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.360
 What's the point of that?

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.520
 So, he basically made the sport unwatchable

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.720
 because you're just watching.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.120
 He did.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:02.160
 Although, it's very thrilling to see where any surfaces.

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:06.000
 So, you're waiting, it turns it into a suspense film, right?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.640
 So, you watch it and you can't see anything.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.400
 It's just like the service of the water is unruffled.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.880
 We just see these strange things going on.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.920
 All of a sudden, burkoff.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:21.120
 I could see it.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:24.560
 I was, as a child, I was obsessed with burkoff.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.160
 He's this really brilliant guy.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.160
 But I just keep thinking he's going to do it again.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.120
 You know what I mean?

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.920
 Maybe he's an anesthesiologist and he's going to realize,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.520
 wait a minute, right?

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.800
 We don't have to keep them under for five minutes.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.160
 Keep them under for two hours.

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.600
 He'll be very burkoff-y.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.320
 He doesn't give your prescription as a doctor

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.560
 until you're in the car park going back to your car.

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.280
 And then he says, "Take two of these days."

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.360
 Don't you want to be inside burkoff's brain?

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.800
 Yeah, burkoff's brain.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.280
 Yeah.

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.640
 Yeah, it's so funny.

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.560
 Here's what I love about burkoff and Cliff Young.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.320
 It is that thousands of people do this thing

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:01.440
 and it never occurs to them to tinker with that particular.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.200
 So, on the ultramarathon,

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.800
 they're doing everything in their power

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.720
 to compete and train.

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.600
 And it never occurs to them, "Oh, what if I just slept?"

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:10.800
 I know. It's amazing, isn't it?

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.080
 They're all like in lockstep.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:14.560
 Do they wake each other up before Cliff Young came along

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.920
 and is like, "Ready to go now?"

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.000
 Like, "You're in a race?"

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:18.880
 In a race, yeah.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.480
 It just seems crazy.

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.000
 I know. It makes you think how many things

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.120
 are we taking for granted

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.720
 where we could be smashing it in life

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.400
 because there's an obvious loophole.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.760
 God, what a point.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.720
 What a terrifying point.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.440
 I could be way better at podcasting if I never slept.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.920
 For instance.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.640
 For instance.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.040
 Yeah.

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.080
 Maybe. Or worse.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.160
 Tudin next week and find out how Anna's experiment went.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:46.400
 Okay. It is time for our final fact of the show

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.080
 and that is Anna.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:50.480
 My fact this week is that, given the choice,

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.600
 most people would prefer to win $10 million

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.520
 rather than $100 billion.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:59.440
 Right? And so, let's see here, guys.

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.560
 I'm going to ask you all.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:01.120
 Yeah.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.320
 This was a University of Bath research

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.760
 and it's published in Nature

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:08.080
 and it asks 8,000 people across 33 countries

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.360
 so it's quite comprehensive.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.000
 And basically it said, "Imagine your ideal life

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.840
 and then consider how much money you want

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.120
 to lead that ideal life.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.320
 And then you've got a lottery that you can enter."

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.680
 And you're going to win it.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:20.960
 You've got a bunch of lotteries

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.800
 and you're probably going to win it.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.920
 And you've either got a lottery

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.480
 where the jackpot is $10,000.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.520
 So it's all American dollars

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.240
 but they adjusted it for currencies in the countries.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.640
 $10,000 and then it increased by multiples of 10.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.920
 So you've got $10,000, $100,000, million, $10 million

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.520
 and the highest was $100 billion.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.280
 What would you guys go for?

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.120
 $100 billion.

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.560
 Okay. You'll just straight up $100 billion.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:42.960
 Yeah.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.360
 Welcome.

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.520
 I totally agree. I $10 million.

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.200
 You're going to get $10 million.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:47.520
 Really?

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.000
 There you go.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.880
 The last thing you want to do is win $100 billion.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.520
 That is like a nightmare scenario.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:53.760
 Why?

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.720
 Do you understand what would happen?

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.040
 Listen, if I had that money,

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.040
 I'd see you if you ever spoke to me like that

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.160
 and then that time again.

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.920
 Every single part of your life

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.720
 gets more complicated by a thousand percent.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.240
 Oh, look at yellow musk.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.440
 He's having a great time.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.120
 Accusing people of things online.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.400
 He can't walk down the street.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:14.960
 That's true.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.840
 But you can't do that if you're famous regardless.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.120
 He's digging his own tunnel

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.960
 so he won't need to go down the street.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.760
 He'll be parachuted through a vacuum tube

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:24.880
 along under the street.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.360
 We can say with 100% certainty

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.520
 that you would be profoundly unhappy.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:29.840
 Okay.

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.960
 For a variety of reasons.

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:36.720
 One of the main ones is that the proliferation of decisions

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.520
 that you would have to make would overwhelm you.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.880
 So with money, this is the cost of wealth.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.160
 The hidden cost of wealth is that for most people,

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.280
 the decision about whether to do an activity

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.280
 is whether I can afford it.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.280
 When you have money, all of a sudden,

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.160
 cans turn into wants.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.720
 Do I want to do that?

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:03.680
 Do I want to do that is a much more complicated decision.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:03.920
 Yeah.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.720
 Human take choice.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.920
 It's too much endless choice.

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.320
 So you now have every decision in your life

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.360
 that used to be a can has now turned into a want.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.760
 So you are paralyzed.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.880
 Right now, you're going to have lunch after this place, right?

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.280
 Yeah.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:21.440
 You're not going to go and have lunch at Claridge's, are you?

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:21.520
 No.

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.160
 No.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.440
 Why?

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.040
 Well, for a number of reasons.

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.840
 But one is you don't want to track all the way over there.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:31.440
 Two, there's no point to spending 80 pounds on lunch.

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.120
 And three, why do you want to hang out with those people?

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:33.360
 Right?

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.000
 Those are your reasons.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:34.560
 Uh-huh.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.200
 Okay.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.280
 I have given you $100 billion.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.240
 I've removed...

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.280
 You have a driver now.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:42.080
 Nothing can you go to Claridge's.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.240
 You can go to the airport and get in your plane and fly to...

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.920
 You can have lunch in Paris if you want.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.960
 Do you want to have lunch in Paris?

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.280
 Yeah.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:47.600
 Do you want to?

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.320
 It's spiraled out of control.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:51.520
 And then you got to look...

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.080
 Sounds great.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:57.040
 You're going to have to be really going to struggle to get down

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.640
 to give an inch of this.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.120
 Oh, wait a second.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.160
 Are you trying to put me off it?

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.960
 It's a nightmare.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:08.800
 I've picked the most kind of anodyne choice that you would have today,

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.840
 where to have lunch.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.360
 And now I've given you an infinite set of options,

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:14.800
 just because you have $100 billion.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.120
 Yeah.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.080
 So you can't even...

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.680
 Lunch has now become a cognitive burden of the size.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.800
 No, but we even talked...

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.400
 There's a million other things that are going to happen today

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.200
 that we've even talked about.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.720
 For every single one of them has now been multiplied times thousands.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.760
 But I just want to use it specifically for eBay auctions,

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.400
 where I can just make sure I set the limit at $100 billion

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.160
 and never lose my auction.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.320
 The size of the Dick Gregory memorabilia market

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:40.720
 is going to go wildly out of proportion.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.760
 If you collect...

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.440
 Say, do you like to collect things?

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.000
 Yes, I do.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:44.560
 Okay, okay.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.000
 I have now removed 100% of the joy of collecting things.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:48.800
 There's no longer any constraint.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.520
 That's a really good point.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.960
 You no longer have to make any decision.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.160
 You can just buy everything.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.480
 Yeah.

00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.960
 Oh my God, you wouldn't treasure any of all that crap you have

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.960
 that no sane person would treasure anyway.

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.320
 You wouldn't because you could buy infinite quantities of it.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.000
 You could do five things.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.440
 It is really interesting.

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.680
 What would you do, Andy, sorry, since we got the others?

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.000
 Can I split the difference again?

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.040
 $100 million.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.320
 That's very unusual.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.160
 So interestingly in this study, it really peaks at $10 million.

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.520
 So most people ask for $10 million or below.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.560
 There are some countries like, I think, Russia and India

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.800
 where the majority choose $1 million or less.

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:27.760
 But I was looking at the graph and it peaks at $10 million.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.680
 And then there are quite a lot of people

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:32.000
 who still choose $100 billion, although not majority.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.880
 So it ranges between 8% of people in China

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.840
 to 39% of people in Indonesia choose $100 billion.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:41.120
 But between $10 million and $100 billion, it's hardly anyone.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.400
 I guess because $10 million seems to me like Malcolm saying,

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:47.920
 like a kind of reasonable amount where you could live a really nice life.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.720
 You have an incredible house and travel and see the world.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.000
 Whereas actually $100 million is a life deforming,

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.200
 like a substantially deforming amount of money.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.200
 You lose all of your friends at $100 million too.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.320
 Yeah, yeah.

00:49:58.320 --> 00:49:59.760
 Every relationship you have.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:02.160
 This is, once again, is this appeals?

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.080
 Down is unphased by us.

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.680
 I'm trying to get out of this hell hole.

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.840
 I'm a feature, not a bug.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.880
 What would I do, by the way?

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:11.760
 What would you do?

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.480
 What would you do?

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.800
 Well, what I find is always difficult with these

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.400
 is that the temptation is to say,

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.400
 "I'll have it all so that you can just give it all away."

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.160
 But then that's quite an arrogant, probably Western thing

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.160
 to think that I know better where to give money than governments

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:26.000
 or Bill Gates or whatever.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.120
 But I'd be tempted to do that.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.880
 I would spend all the money traveling the world

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.840
 lifting people I chose to be significant.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.640
 That's what I would do.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.200
 Because with $100 million, you can lift anyone in the world.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:35.440
 Yeah.

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:36.960
 Well, you mean just pick at your special.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.120
 I'm going to turn you into the president of East Timor or something.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:41.200
 No, I mean literally, like Street Chimnoi.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.320
 I just travel around the world.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:43.520
 Just lifting people up.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.400
 You're just picking people up.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:44.880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.520
 That trippied act.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:45.680
 Right.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.880
 That's Street Chimnoi tribute.

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.480
 Do 8001.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:48.880
 Yeah, yeah.

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.880
 It's lots of studies about the psychology of wealth.

00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.320
 So one of them, which I quite liked,

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:58.640
 is would you go public if you won the lottery?

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.040
 Yeah.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.440
 And again, I think I know what you're going to say, Malcolm.

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.000
 Disaster.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.960
 Yeah, disaster.

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:03.360
 Absolutely.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.280
 Well, public opinion is definitely in chime of that.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.600
 Only 2% of people say they would make public the fact they'd won.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.680
 But he invariably, here's the problem.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:15.360
 You can't not go public because every one of your choices

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.840
 is conspicuous at a hundred million, right?

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.960
 So something would be idling downstairs, right, with a driver.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:24.720
 You're not taking the two with a hundred billion.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.920
 This is driving me nuts.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.360
 You're not confronted the lunacy of your position yet.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:32.960
 You're not even here.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.800
 Wait, let me ask you a question.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.920
 Are you enjoying this right now?

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:36.480
 I love this.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:36.720
 Yeah.

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.440
 You enjoy your job.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:38.400
 Yeah.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400
 And you enjoy this afternoon.

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.120
 This taping session.

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:41.360
 Yeah, yeah.

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.560
 I mean, this bit's going to give it a test.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:42.560
 Yeah.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:45.760
 And have you enjoyed a cup of coffee?

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.720
 I did, is it?

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.520
 All of that's gone.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.720
 What are you doing?

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.840
 You have a hundred billion dollars.

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.960
 You don't do this job anymore.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:51.360
 What am I doing?

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:51.920
 What am I doing?

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:52.560
 Well--

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:53.760
 Dan is going to be in the--

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.880
 Dan is in the 59--

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:56.080
 59% of people, right?

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.760
 2% said they'd go public.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.640
 59% of people said they would remain anonymous

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.320
 and not even tell their friends.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.720
 And Dan thinks he's in this group of people who are going

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.400
 to turn-- next time I turn off outside Dan's house,

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.880
 there's a gold-plated Maserati outside.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.560
 Dan denies anything to do with him.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.520
 I'm just going to saving.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.160
 Yeah, you will.

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:16.080
 I would hire a replacement me to just take over this life.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.760
 Be the Dan Shriver, and I would go be Mr. Billionaire.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.120
 Well, we should definitely do that.

00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:21.360
 Yeah.

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:21.600
 Sorry.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.680
 We've neglected the single biggest drawback

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:27.120
 to having a hundred billion.

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.200
 And that is you have to hang out without a billionaires.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:29.920
 Oh, my god.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.600
 There's no way you have to do that.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.240
 No, that's true.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:32.880
 That's true.

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.600
 That is a nightmare.

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.160
 That is a nightmare.

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.600
 They're the only ones who understand you, I suppose.

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:36.720
 So, yeah.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:39.040
 There's one county--

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.280
 I believe it's in Wyoming or Montana,

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.040
 which has more billionaires than any other--

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:43.600
 Oh, wow.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.560
 --where they all live.

00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:45.280
 OK.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.160
 And they all have their personal offices there,

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.840
 which are their charities.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.760
 No one else is going to afford to live there.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.320
 They priced out everyone who serves the billionaire.

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.760
 So everyone who has to serve the billionaire

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.040
 has to drive like massive distances from one county.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.560
 And they all have these charitable offices.

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.360
 But of course, who are you spending your charitable dollars on

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.000
 if there's only billionaires in this?

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.400
 Yeah.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:06.960
 Right?

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.920
 It's this sort of endless--

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:10.800
 and it's this absurd existence that they live in this one.

00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:11.600
 That's where you get it.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.120
 That's where we'll find you.

00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:22.240
 This is another UGov survey, which tests a famous rap lyric.

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:24.880
 Do you think it is or is not true that the more money you have,

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.160
 the more problems you have?

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.960
 12% said it is true that more money, more problems.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.600
 That's not--

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.600
 60% said it's false that more money, more problems.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:32.400
 What's U-shaped?

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:33.760
 It's not a linear relationship.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.280
 It's a U-shaped relationship, sorry.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.160
 It's the Goldilocks thing.

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.360
 Studies tend to show, don't they,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.720
 that after a certain amount of wealth,

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.040
 then your happiness starts to decline again?

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:44.080
 I think the global average is--

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:50.080
 it's about 70,000 US dollars for emotional well-being.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.680
 And then it's 95 for--

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.200
 Sorry, is that income or wealth or is this--

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.000
 It's income, sorry.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.200
 So pay your salary, yes.

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.640
 But in terms of life satisfaction or life evaluation,

00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.160
 it's about 95.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:03.360
 So people feel prouder, I suppose,

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.500
 if they earn a little bit more, even though they'll

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.520
 be happy day to day with a bit less.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.400
 So what do you want?

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.760
 Do you want to be proud of how much you earn?

00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.120
 Or do you want to live a nice life?

00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.920
 But either way, it's not very bad.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.760
 I know what dad's going to ask for every single time.

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:18.000
 For the list of cockroaches that's staring me down,

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.400
 waited for my answer.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.960
 Poor misguided fool.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.440
 There was a really fun study done by a guy called Paul Piff,

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.920
 who looks into the effects of wealth on people

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.840
 and looks into how it actually kind of makes

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.280
 us meaner if we get richer.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:40.000
 He sent researchers to hide in a bush in California

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.160
 and look at cars that went by and then judge

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.760
 how expensive they are.

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.840
 And then there's a researcher further up the road,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.000
 I think, who is just crossing, is ever crossing back and forth.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.640
 And in California, you legally have

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.360
 to stop for people to cross, is ever crossing, like here.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.440
 And he clocks the types of car and then

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.480
 whether they stopped for the pedestrians.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.960
 And in the cheapest category of car,

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.640
 every single car stopped to let the pedestrians across,

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.360
 as you're supposed to do.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.880
 In the most expensive category of car,

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.440
 how many would you think would stop

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.400
 and how many would drive past?

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.640
 How many would stop out of the most expensive category?

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.000
 60%.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:14.720
 60%.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.640
 Do you-- you're close.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:16.760
 It was 50/50.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.320
 50% of the most expensive cars.

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:20.880
 Just drive-- just break the law and drive

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.880
 straight over the zebra crossing and don't let

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.680
 the person cross the road.

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.240
 That's you, Dan.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.600
 We now know who's in that car, yeah?

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.000
 I don't drive, so.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
 In your fancy car.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.200
 You'll have a world with your chauffeur

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.840
 about that on the train.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.360
 Mow him down.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.240
 Can I give you one more survey about how people react to wealth?

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.320
 I really like this one because it's a great question to ask.

00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:44.040
 If you accidentally paid 300 times more

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.640
 than your monthly salary, what would you be most likely to do?

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:51.000
 Say something and return the money.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.680
 Say nothing but return the money if asked.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.840
 Try and immediately spend or move the money.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.840
 But stay in your job.

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:03.800
 Or take the money and leave your job.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.480
 So I mean, open season.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:08.440
 Well, they're going to find out.

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.680
 They're going to find out, and then they're

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.280
 going to ask you to repay the money in three years' time

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:12.360
 when you've spent all the money.

00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.880
 And that's the worst of all worlds.

00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:14.600
 I'll give you the stats.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.160
 It's amazing.

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.920
 62% of people said they'd say something and return the money.

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.400
 20% of people said they'd say nothing but return the money

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.720
 if asked.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.520
 And then we get to the real optimists.

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.760
 3% of people would take the money and leave the job.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.400
 They said they would try and do that.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.640
 2% of people said they would take the money,

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.200
 try and immediately spend or move it,

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:37.080
 and also keep their job, which I just find so optimistic.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.320
 2% of people think they would get away with that.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.200
 That's nice rosy thinking.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.800
 The worst spy in American history

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.000
 was Aldrich Ames, CIA agent, intelligence officer who

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.760
 gave away the store to the Soviets, everything.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.760
 So all we need to say worst spy, you mean most effective?

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:58.560
 I did the most damage to American interests.

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:00.320
 Who was paid all this money.

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.000
 He worked for the Soviets for like 10 years.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.480
 He's paid all this money, and he starts to live it up.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.280
 And all of his colleagues know how much he makes.

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.360
 And he starts showing up.

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.440
 He buys a Jaguar, and his wife has a main code,

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.880
 and he has his fancy house, and he goes and he's like--

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:18.240
 and no one-- no one said it.

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.400
 No one-- it didn't click.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.520
 But they're spies.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.240
 He's option four, in other words.

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.560
 He's keep-- spend the money, keep the job.

00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.600
 Somehow he thinks that-- and he was right.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.440
 No one noticed.

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.600
 He gets caught in the end for some other complicated reason.

00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:36.280
 But the idea that he's like, it's growing around 20s.

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280
 Wow.

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.640
 That's so funny.

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640
 Incredible.

00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.320
 And no one notices for years.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.240
 It gets ever more extravagant.

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.440
 He's the only one in the parking lot of the CIA.

00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:46.480
 No one has a Jaguar.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.760
 They're government employees.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:50.160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the funniest thing.

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:52.360
 He started wearing his fancy European suits,

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.600
 and like, it's the most hilarious story.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.600
 It's a really glistens plate on his car.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:02.680
 He trips into Russia accidentally all the time.

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.160
 His colleagues just going, I must get better at saving.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160
 I don't understand.

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:12.640
 OK, that's it.

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:13.720
 That is all of our facts.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.160
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.040
 If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.840
 about the things that we've said over the course

00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:21.400
 of this podcast, we can be found on our Twitter accounts.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.840
 I'm on @Sriberland.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:23.360
 Andy.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.400
 @AndrewHunterM.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.080
 Malcolm, are you on social media?

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.600
 I am.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.960
 I'm-- what am I?

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:29.440
 I think I'm @Gladwell, probably.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.000
 @Gladwell, probably.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.120
 And, Adam, we've already established

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.080
 that you don't even know what it is.

00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.560
 No, but I'm probably with email.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:39.400
 You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.120
 Yep, where you can go to our group account, which

00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.480

 as of fish.com.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:46.280
 Check out all of our previous episodes.

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.800
 They are up there to be listened to.

00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.800
 We'll be back again next week with another episode.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.680
 We'll see you then.

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.240
 Goodbye.
