00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
 Hi guys, before we start this week's episode of Fish we have a few exciting

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,200
 announcements to make. Announcement number one is that we, no such thing as a fish,

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,520
 are going on tour. We are going to be going around Scotland. We've got four

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,400
 dates in Scotland at the end of August and start of September. We're going to

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,680
 Cardiff. We're also playing a gig in London. Now the London gig is sold out in

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,880
 the room but it's also streaming online. So effectively if you live anywhere in

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,760
 the world and you're listening to this, you can access a fish gig, especially if

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,120
 you live in Scotland, to a certain extent if you live in Cardiff and also if you

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,960
 live anywhere else. You can get a ticket by going to nosuchthingasafish.com/live.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,600
 All the information is up there. Yes it is. Information item number two is, if

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,200
 anything, even more exciting than that because chief gnome, our big boss, the

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,160
 man who created us in our current form, Mr John Lloyd, all-round comedy legend. He

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,360
 also has a live show. That is going to the Edinburgh Festival and it looks to be

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,480
 absolutely fantastic. It's called Do You Know Who I Am? If you don't know who

15
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,440
 John Lloyd is then I don't know where you've been but he is the man behind all

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,400
 the great comedies really of the 80s and 90s from Black Hatter, Spitting Image, The

17
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,760
 News Quiz, Not the Nine O'Clock News, QI obviously. Episode 17 of No Such Thing as

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:21,200
 a Fish. I think that's the one he's most proud of yes. So the show format is

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,680
 you go, you ask him absolutely anything you want to ask him from the meaning of

20
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,160
 life to his fingernail cutting regimen. So go to the Edinburgh Fringe website and

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,280
 check out how to get tickets for that. It's on from the 5th to the 15th of August.

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,640
 And the final bit of information is that we have a special guest today on No Such

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,720
 Thing as a Fish. The guest is a really exciting person. He is none other than

24
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,360
 Malcolm Gladwell. We're sure you've heard of Malcolm and if not maybe you've

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,440
 heard of the Time 100 Most Influential People list which he's been on which

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,280
 might well be a first for us. He's a brilliant writer and broadcaster. He's

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,120
 written fabulous books like The Tipping Point and Blink. He's got a new book out

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,720
 called The Bomber Mafia and if you're a podcast listener which you probably are

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,720
 listening to this he also hosts the fabulous revisionist history which

30
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 looks at overlooked and misunderstood things in that classic Gladwellian way.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,240
 This was so much fun to record we really hope you enjoy listening to it.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:19,120
 Check out Malcolm's other things as above. Okay on with the show. On with the podcast.

33
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:32,800
 [Music]

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,440
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,920
 podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
 Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,520
 very special guest it's Malcolm Gladwell and once again we have gathered

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,040
 around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,840
 and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one and that

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,960
 is Malcolm. My favorite fact is that no one has any

41
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,640
 clear idea about what growing up with a smartphone does.

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,080
 So we I got into this because I was doing an episode of my podcast

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,480
 Origins History on what I called Magic Wand Experiments. Okay. Which is the

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,680
 experiment you would do if you could wave a magic wand, right?

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
 Because to spend all laws of nature and yeah practical and ethical.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So I called up to spend a minute and I said who is a psychologist and I said

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,040
 what's your magic wand? And he said oh I want to divide

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,800
 let's say a thousand or two thousand children at birth

49
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,400
 and one group, group one gets a blackberry for the first 25 years of

50
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,360
 their life. Actually he wanted to do for the first 50 years

51
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
 and group two gets an iPhone. I said well why would you want to do that? And he

52
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,080
 said well because we just don't know why did an iPhone.

53
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,560
 Which I thought I found that just an exception. He was astonishing.

54
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,600
 It wasn't that he was invested in blackberries and has been very disappointed

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,920
 there. So all so the blackberry is just your

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,440
 phone and email. So we right okay yeah it's clear that

57
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,120
 is doesn't affect your life in any dramatic way, right?

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
 And the iPhone is all the other stuff. Well if you go through the

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
 literature he's like you'll discover that there is no consensus or even

60
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
 understanding of what all that other stuff

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,320
 does to a child. So he gave me an example. I suppose we were all

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
 six years old and I and we're sitting around a table

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,120
 and I or eight years old and I say something deeply offensive to Anna.

64
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,880
 It happens a lot actually. Anna has many options

65
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,000
 but she can express her displeasure directly to me in one form or another.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
 Yell at me, cut me down sarcastically, punch me,

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,520
 ignore me. All very enticing. You've met Anna before, right?

68
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,920
 I ain't got a sense. And all of these are are deeply

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,320
 effective ways of educating me about the consequences of my actions.

70
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
 Now, I suppose me and Anna are on our iPhones and I say the exact same thing

71
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
 only it's a text. Yes. So the only way Anna can respond now

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
 is with another text. So she used to have an enormous repertoire of

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,600
 potentially powerful and instructive responses to my provocation.

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
 Now all she has is a text. So let's replace the enormous repertoire of

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,880
 powerfully instructive responses over the course of

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,440
 25 years just with texts. The question is what happens to Malcolm?

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,120
 Does Malcolm do I just become oblivious? Do I just keep

78
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
 being offensive? Do I never learn the consequences of my actions?

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,320
 If I accompany my text with some really angry emojis, I think it might be him.

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,960
 But nothing is as instructive as the things I mentioned.

81
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,560
 Now it may be that it doesn't matter. It also may be that it's hugely consequential.

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
 We have no idea. Right. When will we find out? Is it going to be like a future

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,200
 presidential election where they're simply on their phone texting each other

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,480
 for podiums? Like is it going to be decades before

85
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,440
 any kind of research can come out about this? Well, you have to study it.

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
 It feels like we must know a bit. We've had 10 years.

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,920
 Surely there's someone like in text to look into this.

88
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,440
 There's no control. I think that's the no control. Yeah. And that's the problem.

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,400
 We do know. So we know some things that are worrisome.

90
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,320
 We know that levels of depression and mental illness are higher among

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,080
 adolescents now than they've ever been in measured history.

92
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,440
 So is that coming to do with technology? Maybe we don't know.

93
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 It certainly is a kind of prod to think that this might be

94
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,160
 an important subject. It's terrifying researching this fact.

95
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,840
 It is. It really is. And you know, the most telling thing I suppose

96
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,440
 so far is the response of Silicon Valley and basically all the people at the top

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
 of tech who now have turned against it and who discouraged their children from

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
 having screen time. The schools don't have iPads and computers.

99
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,800
 Silicon Valley schools. Yeah, they all, so many of them regret doing what they did.

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,720
 I think the guy who invented infinite scroll, Aza Raskin, I think he says he

101
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
 regrets it more than anything else in his life. He said it led to dire consequences.

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
 Right. What did he invent? Sorry?

103
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,080
 The infinite scroll. So before you got,

104
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,200
 he got annoyed when he was about 22 at the fact on Google, you have to click

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,400
 next page when you get to the bottom. And he said, wouldn't it be great if you

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,880
 could just go on and on? And now he says he understands the importance of that stop.

107
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,920
 I've never considered that that was the, I was thinking when you said he invented it,

108
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,880
 I was thinking what came before infinite scroll and of course that was it.

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,520
 Pages. Pages, yeah. Pages, that's all right.

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
 And I'm now wondering what my all-time record of how many tweets I have scrolled

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
 through at once is because there must have been a day where I did more than I

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,600
 had ever done before. But if I had to click at the end of 10 tweets and make a conscious choice,

113
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,520
 you want to see another 10 of these?

114
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,600
 On his tombstone, that he, you know, let's make scrolling finite again.

115
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,080
 Is he just sick of talking about it? Because I think a lot of these people regret it

116
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,040
 just because everyone keeps requesting interviews about it.

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
 I spoke to a guy.

118
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,440
 There can't be that many interview requests for the guy who invented infinite scroll.

119
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
 No offense to him. I mean, that's clearly a big adventure.

120
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,960
 But I bet it comes up a lot more than it is.

121
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,640
 It's how he's introduced. Does he, I wonder, as he introduced himself,

122
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,080
 like when he meets someone in a coffee shop.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,080
 He keeps talking until he stops.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,440
 No, he is, he compares it to, he says there's a study where people are given bowls of soup

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,640
 and told to eat as much as they want. And then some of the bowls refill constantly from underneath.

126
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,120
 And some don't and they have to put refills in. And the people who have the bowls that refill

127
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,920
 constantly, the magic bowls, eat 70% more soup. And they don't even know that they've done it.

128
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,640
 So it's this like really subconscious addictive thing.

129
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,560
 So he says it's like that.

130
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,600
 It's like the fairy tale, you know, with the, with the, we have an info,

131
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,120
 what's that one where you have an infinite number of reach in the bag and has always

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,000
 gold coins. That was presented to us as children, as a, as a kind of triumphant story.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
 In fact, it's a tragic story.

134
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,040
 Yes, exactly.

135
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,000
 It is, it ruins you.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
 This is the fairy tale version of infinite scroll.

137
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
 Yeah. That's true.

138
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,400
 Another of those guys, Justin Rosenstein, who helped invent the like button.

139
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,040
 And I only helped invent, I didn't do the sole inventor, but you know, he was part of the team

140
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,240
 in there. He has now turned off all notifications on his phone. Yeah, because when you install the

141
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,880
 new app, it often comes with notifications pre included, doesn't it? And you have to go into

142
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
 the settings and then turn it off. And that, yeah, Tim Harford wrote a column recently.

143
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,320
 He changed over his phone at some point and all the notification settings were left on.

144
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,960
 And he got to live as if he had had them on, you know, all the way from buying a phone at the

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,680
 first place and just a constant stream of notifications, jingles, bells, whistles, updates.

146
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,960
 Oh, what if every single one is on?

147
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,920
 Every single app on his phone had the notifications now on.

148
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,240
 Yeah.

149
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,840
 And it was a constant noise.

150
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,480
 You know what's really, the other interesting you can do is turn off the color on your phone.

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,280
 Have you done this? No.

152
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,400
 Yeah, black and white, yeah.

153
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
 Go black and white for a while.

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,840
 What?

155
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,000
 Yeah.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
 It's a similar kind of detoxing.

157
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,160
 I've tried that.

158
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,560
 Yeah.

159
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,760
 That's great.

160
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
 It is. It's very good.

161
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,320
 One thing I used to get, which I don't anymore, is that thing of phantom phone vibration.

162
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
 It's like phantom limb pain.

163
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,320
 Yeah, exactly.

164
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,280
 But it's phantom phone.

165
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,320
 Have you never heard this?

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,880
 Never heard this. This is the strangest.

167
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,600
 It's really, I haven't.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,720
 Wow, really. You know, you get the buzz. You think, oh, great.

169
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
 Finally.

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,360
 Someone wants, someone has texted me or needs me in some way.

171
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
 And it's turned on every notification on his phone apps and still nothing, just still dead.

172
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,560
 Yeah. No, it is. It's a very strange sensation.

173
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
 Well, if it's any consolation to anyone, they've obviously been kind of preliminary studies.

174
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,360
 It's hard to know that much at the moment, but this looked at data from 72,000 people

175
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,280
 between the ages of 10 and 80.

176
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,840
 And it asked them how much time they spent on social media.

177
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,080
 So this was like specifically about if social media makes you unhappy.

178
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,960
 And then it asked how satisfied they were with their lives,

179
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,600
 which I don't know how 10 year olds answered that question, but they did.

180
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,520
 And it basically found that there was a Goldilocks effect.

181
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,000
 So most people, if they're using these things moderately,

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,880
 they're using social media moderately, they're pretty much okay.

183
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,960
 People who are using it way, way, way too much, they're at the far end, that end,

184
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,800
 they tend to be, you know, have much more anxiety, more unhappiness.

185
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,840
 But also people who are at the other end, same thing.

186
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,960
 You know, people aren't really using social media at all, like me.

187
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,200
 In fact, that's why I'm so chronically depressed all the time.

188
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,640
 Then they're also more likely to be unhappy, which makes sense.

189
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,560
 If you're in your teenage years, then that's how all your friends are communicating.

190
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,880
 And then you're kind of excluded from it.

191
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,840
 There's a very good Washington Post piece about parents who restrict their kids from having phones.

192
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,920
 And it's a really weird piece because I think it's meant to be about how phones are bad for

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,440
 teenagers and it's great to restrict them.

194
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
 But all the kids interviewed say, "It's horrible.

195
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,280
 I can't communicate with my friends.

196
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,040
 I don't know what kind of plans they're making.

197
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,720
 There are a lot of conversations at school, which spring from things that I don't know about

198
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,320
 because I'm not on any of the chats."

199
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,440
 I think they're at the same pace.

200
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
 I think they were a bit more equivocal.

201
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,000
 They said they could see a couple of advantages to it as well.

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
 At the end of the piece, it rounded up with one of the girls saying,

203
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,280
 "Yeah, I guess it'll be okay. I won't regret it in the end."

204
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,120
 But you can't do it in isolation.

205
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,640
 Right. So the real question is, if your entire school didn't have a phone,

206
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,400
 your entire friend's circle and your family, how would your life be different?

207
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,640
 Yeah.

208
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,200
 So you can't, but if you're turning these children who don't use their phones into pariahs,

209
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,920
 of course I'm not.

210
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,720
 Yeah, exactly.

211
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,760
 They use their phones.

212
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,960
 I know. Well, we're trapped, aren't we?

213
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,840
 That's why my friend wanted to do this experiment.

214
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,080
 He wanted to take entire towns and make them smartphone-free zones and see what happens.

215
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,040
 That's a fun idea.

216
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,760
 Yeah.

217
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,840
 Okay. If you're listening and you live in a small town or a village

218
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,280
 and you think you'd all be up for it, contact us.

219
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,240
 We'll pass it on to Malcolm.

220
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,120
 We'll pass it on to his friend and we'll get it going.

221
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,600
 Okay. Well, I did find one other thing which I quite like.

222
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
 This is about injuries that mobile phone users suffer.

223
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,840
 This is actual measurable physical harm suffered.

224
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,920
 Injuries experienced by mobile phone users due to their phones are sought over the last 20 years.

225
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,520
 Obviously, because 20 years ago,

226
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,960
 people didn't have nearly as many phones.

227
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:06,960
 But between 1998 and 2017, apparently 76,000 Americans were injured in some way by their phones.

228
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,520
 60% of younger people said they dropped their phone on their own face

229
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,360
 while lying down and looking at it.

230
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,320
 Oh, yeah. That'll happen.

231
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
 Yeah. Okay. Two in that.

232
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,160
 Yes, isn't it?

233
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,960
 And the other thing is sometimes children will have a phone dropped on them by their parents.

234
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,880
 You could be injured by that.

235
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,720
 How heavy are these phones?

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
 Well, I guess the child could be a small child,

237
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,280
 a big old 1980s style car phone.

238
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,160
 Yeah, yeah.

239
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
 It's a recipe for disaster.

240
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,600
 Okay, it might be not that.

241
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,720
 Yeah. Yeah.

242
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
 But it's, you know, there's peril there.

243
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,360
 Were there injuries in earlier generations from books being dropped on children's heads?

244
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,440
 I mean, I need a control here.

245
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,400
 Printing dresses.

246
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
 You know, big fat Grimm's fairy tales.

247
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,200
 Yeah, absolutely.

248
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,560
 Dropped on a three-year-old's head.

249
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,960
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy.

250
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,200
 My fact is that in 1931, the USA launched an aircraft carrier which itself could fly.

251
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,960
 Great stuff.

252
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,400
 Was it transported inside another bigger flying aircraft carrier, aircraft carrier?

253
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,920
 Oh, wow, like a Russian doll.

254
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
 Sadly, it was not.

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
 No, that was a more Soviet thing, the Matroshka aircraft carrier, which did.

256
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,360
 So this was an airship which the U.S. Navy launched in 1931.

257
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
 It was called the USS Akron, and it was an airship.

258
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,000
 So that's a ship with a rigid frame, so blimps.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,680
 Like the Hindenburg, if you were picturing it slightly, right?

260
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
 Yeah, yeah, it's an airship.

261
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,320
 Sorry, when you went for the description, I was just cutting out the middleman there.

262
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:44,800
 Yeah, yeah.

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,080
 Oh, I should also say where I got the fact.

264
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,440
 I've been listening to a podcast called Black Box Down, which is great.

265
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,240
 It's all about aviation, mishaps, and catastrophes, and everything in between.

266
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:02,480
 And so the Akron was this airship, and it was enormous, and it launched in 1931,

267
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,640
 crashed in 1933, and the main selling feature of it, the thing that the Navy were interested in,

268
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,920
 was that it was designed to be able to carry small fighter planes.

269
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
 There were these planes called sparrow hawks, which were, I think, small,

270
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,240
 I think they were bi-planes, but anyway, it could fit in at least three of them,

271
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,080
 and it was going to be redesigned so it could fit in five.

272
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,000
 And the idea was that the USS Akron would fly overhead, lower a little

273
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,640
 hook from which the fighter plane is dangling, just retract the hook, plane flies off,

274
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,840
 and you know, launches three of these planes, and then they fly back,

275
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,560
 snag onto the hook once again, and are retracted into the belly of the airship.

276
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
 Do you think you have to be really good at those fairground games,

277
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
 where you hook a duck onto a stick?

278
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
 I imagine, yeah, it was quite a precise manoeuvre.

279
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,680
 We did it work.

280
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,880
 So, it worked that it could deploy these planes.

281
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,480
 I think the hook facility did work, but there's a reason we're not using all these now,

282
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,760
 basically, which is that the airships obviously went very far out of fashion.

283
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,720
 This lasted two years before it crashed, and it killed over 70 people,

284
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,520
 including one of the main advocates for airship development and expansion.

285
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
 But it was the airship that didn't work.

286
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,760
 We all know the airships had a bit of a rough ride,

287
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,560
 but the actual aircraft carrier element was quite good.

288
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,680
 Yeah, that's what I mean.

289
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,480
 It worked.

290
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,760
 I'm struck by the fact that the chief proponent for airships dies in the destruction of the airship

291
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,200
 as a kind of model for dealing with bad inventors.

292
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,960
 It's the captain goes down with the ship model of us.

293
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,080
 Yeah, it is.

294
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
 Yeah, it really was, yeah, yeah.

295
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
 But we still make ships after he dies.

296
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,480
 You know, this is a...

297
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
 So, imagine, there's a famous Dick Gregory joke.

298
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
 I'm now obsessed with Dick Gregory.

299
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,000
 Are you?

300
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,560
 I am.

301
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,280
 He's amazing.

302
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,960
 He's such an extraordinary character.

303
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,640
 He talks about when he was in the army,

304
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,280
 he lost his rifle and they charged him $85.

305
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
 He said, "I had no idea they were going to charge me.

306
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,200
 Now I know why the captain goes down with the ship."

307
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,280
 That's great.

308
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,600
 It was like the Segway guy, wasn't it?

309
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,240
 Yeah.

310
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,360
 That's the modern day.

311
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,040
 You know, the guy who invented the Segway went over a cliff on his Segway, didn't he?

312
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,760
 Sorry, I thought...

313
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,040
 Was it the inventor or the head of one of the big Segway companies?

314
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:11,680
 The head of one of the companies.

315
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
 I don't think it was the actual invention.

316
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,440
 Was it not?

317
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,400
 I always thought it was the actual invention.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
 God, I was mishearing the word "Segway."

319
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,680
 I really thought you were going to say that we had, you know,

320
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,840
 an inventor of the Segway, the conversational Segway.

321
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,880
 The conversational Segway.

322
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,000
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,600
 Shakespeare, actually.

324
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,920
 He died halfway through trying to change the topic.

325
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,680
 He was impaled on a tangent.

326
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,680
 So, just one other thing about the acrobat.

327
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,240
 One of the other features it had, and it wasn't unique to it,

328
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,640
 this was actually a thing that had been invented a couple of decades before

329
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,440
 on other airships.

330
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,120
 It had a spy basket.

331
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,800
 I don't know if you guys read about this, but it's an observation basket

332
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,200
 that hangs beneath the body of the airship.

333
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,080
 And the principle was, as you're flying your airship,

334
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,880
 you want to be observing the ground but discreetly.

335
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
 Airships are obviously huge.

336
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
 So the idea was you'd hide the airship in a cloud,

337
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,440
 lower the spy basket on a cable for several hundred meters in some cases,

338
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,760
 and there is someone sitting in the spy basket who watches the ground,

339
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,040
 can radio back up, tell the airship itself where to go,

340
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,120
 or whether they're nearing the target or whatever.

341
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,440
 Fun.

342
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,680
 And the acrobat had one of these, and it was a disaster.

343
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,800
 It was tested once with sandbags in it instead of a person.

344
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,120
 Oh, yeah.

345
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,680
 But, you know...

346
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,640
 Well, no wonder it was a disaster.

347
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,680
 What can sandbags tell you?

348
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,720
 It was so unstable, this little observation basket,

349
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,600
 that it started swaying in the wind on this great long cable.

350
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
 It swayed so much that it swayed up to the equator level

351
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,840
 of the entire airship.

352
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,560
 Oh, my God.

353
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,120
 So, you know, thank God no one was actually in it, because it was...

354
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,000
 Oh, that would be fun.

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,440
 That would be like that ride at theme parks or on the boat, on the pirate ship.

356
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,400
 Absolutely, yeah.

357
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,480
 It would have really, really given some of the best time.

358
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,200
 I'm more fascinated that they were hiding in clouds.

359
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
 Because what is the speed of a cloud?

360
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,680
 Like, you'd have to maintain the speed, right?

361
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,280
 So you don't pop out on the other side.

362
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,880
 You could also go with the cloud, as in...

363
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,520
 You'd have to, yeah.

364
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,600
 The cloud might not be flying towards your bombing target.

365
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,120
 Yeah, exactly.

366
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,200
 Well, we had the bombs somewhere different today.

367
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
 Clouds again, you know.

368
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
 It only works in over-cloudy areas, too, right?

369
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,080
 So you're limited to military operations in Northern Europe,

370
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
 in, you know, parts of, you know...

371
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,200
 Yeah, yeah.

372
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
 Here's the thing, though.

373
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,680
 Manchester, if you really can't do this out in England that much.

374
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,400
 Why not just disguise the blimp as a cloud?

375
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,640
 Why not just put...

376
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,920
 Oh, that's a better idea, yeah.

377
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
 Well, it's actually a comfortable world.

378
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,320
 Yeah, it's a comfortable world.

379
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,120
 Candy floss.

380
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,600
 And then there's your fairground ride, as I did.

381
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,840
 It's all... It springs up, speaking of impaling myself on a tangent.

382
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,600
 Why do the internet people call the place

383
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,120
 where they store all your most valuable knowledge and data?

384
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,760
 The cloud.

385
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,920
 Of all of the metaphors, this is the worst.

386
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,560
 You're right.

387
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,200
 Yes.

388
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,960
 A cloud is a flighty thing.

389
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,640
 Planes fly through them all the time.

390
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,160
 Clouds are routinely violated by any other thing in the air.

391
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
 They're totally ephemeral.

392
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,040
 They are totally ephemeral.

393
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,760
 That's the thing...

394
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,840
 We're going to call it a cloud.

395
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,680
 They're all around a table.

396
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,440
 They're saying, "What's the metaphor we want?

397
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
 For the safe place we put your data?"

398
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,640
 Somebody says...

399
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,360
 A bank?

400
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,480
 No.

401
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
 Someone says, "Who now regrets that?"

402
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
 Who is now among the group?

403
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,120
 Who's like...

404
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,440
 Yeah.

405
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,480
 God, I called it the cloud.

406
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,760
 He's giving it to you.

407
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,920
 I should have called it the paper bag like I wanted to.

408
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,240
 I'm not involved.

409
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,160
 I mean, it's just unbelievable.

410
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,040
 You're so right.

411
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,760
 They're flimsy.

412
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,520
 They've got negative connotations.

413
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
 They're very temporary.

414
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,440
 No one likes them.

415
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,320
 No one.

416
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,160
 Yeah, thank God it's a cloudy day.

417
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,920
 I was looking at military planes, generally,

418
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,400
 and sort of air squadrons.

419
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,280
 And I don't think we've talked about the Soviet night witches

420
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
 ever on this show.

421
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,040
 But do you guys know about these?

422
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,240
 They were a all-female air squadron in World War II.

423
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,120
 And they...

424
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,720
 I think it was one woman who, you know,

425
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
 sort of pitched to the Soviet government and said,

426
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,720
 "Look, lettuce flies in planes."

427
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,800
 They flew these incredibly light planes.

428
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,560
 So they were made to fly very, very low.

429
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,760
 So it's quite dangerous.

430
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,840
 They were made of just plywood and canvas.

431
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,280
 They had to be so light.

432
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,520
 So they couldn't have any armor.

433
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,840
 They couldn't have any parachutes, anything like that.

434
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,160
 These women literally just took a map and a compass

435
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,280
 up in these planes.

436
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,920
 And the key and the reason they had to be so light

437
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,480
 was because they could stall, I think,

438
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,320
 quite a long way from their target

439
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,640
 and sort of drift close to the target,

440
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
 which meant that they were very quiet.

441
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,120
 Wow.

442
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,400
 But what are they...

443
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
 Sorry, are they fighter planes?

444
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,560
 Are they bomber planes?

445
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,600
 Bomber planes, yeah.

446
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
 Couldn't be a bomber plane if they're incredibly light.

447
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
 Yeah, I mean, not letting them have a parachute,

448
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,160
 but they're also...

449
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,880
 You're right.

450
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,040
 They didn't carry bombs, so there was some weight.

451
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,000
 The parachute, I'm afraid,

452
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,680
 is just going to take the side of the edge.

453
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,480
 Very light bombs.

454
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,200
 Could you have one bomb fewer and give me a parachute?

455
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,000
 Would that be...

456
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,360
 Bombs made of feathers.

457
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,360
 And completely harmless bombs, actually.

458
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,000
 Wow.

459
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,960
 I know, they dropped 23,000 tons of bombs in the war.

460
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,840
 Goodness.

461
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
 The weird thing is, their name, The Night Witches,

462
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,920
 as far as I can tell, and all the sources,

463
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,520
 even back to the time, say this,

464
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,200
 they were named The Night Witches by the Germans,

465
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,960
 the Naxahexen.

466
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,520
 And apparently, they named them that

467
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,040
 because of the sound they made.

468
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
 Because they were so quiet,

469
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,120
 they just sounded whooshing, like a broomstick.

470
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,360
 So apparently, we are to believe

471
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,200
 that they weren't actually called The Night Witches

472
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,560
 because of their gender.

473
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,080
 That's a complete coincidence.

474
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,640
 Isn't that weird?

475
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 Come on, that's like when Jay-Z said,

476
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,200
 in 99 problems that a bitch ain't one,

477
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
 was about his dog.

478
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
 Like, it's not really with that.

479
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
 Did he claim that?

480
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,200
 Well, you know, I got 99 problems with that.

481
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,800
 No, I know the line, but I just haven't heard that.

482
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,520
 He came out and said,

483
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,200
 "No, it's not about women, it's about my dog."

484
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,360
 Yeah, sure, Jay-Z.

485
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
 I guess the difference between Jay-Z and the Nazis here

486
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,320
 is that it does make sense

487
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
 because the Nazis couldn't see into the plane.

488
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,720
 So how would they have known that there were women flying them?

489
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,480
 The Nazis call them The Night Witches.

490
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,560
 Yeah, they named them the sound they made swooping over.

491
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,320
 And they also must have been so uncomfortable.

492
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,440
 They had to wear men's clothes

493
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,320
 because they didn't have any pilot clothes for women.

494
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,680
 Apparently, they tore up their bedding

495
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,280
 and stuffed it into the shoes they wore

496
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,160
 so they would fit.

497
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,040
 What? Oh, wow.

498
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,280
 Yeah.

499
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,000
 I mean, it's hard enough driving a car in Wellington boots, but...

500
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,600
 Well, firstly, we have to ask about that.

501
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,360
 You know, if you're trying to drive a sensitive instrument

502
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
 in not very comfortable shoes,

503
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
 I'm surprised they managed to get anything done.

504
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,360
 Yeah, true.

505
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,120
 Anna, when did you last drive your car in Wellies?

506
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,840
 Because I feel like...

507
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,440
 Hi, I love it.

508
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,600
 The one detail in this story that you're drawn to

509
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,760
 is the fact that they didn't have comfortable shoes.

510
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,760
 I would imagine in the list of problems these women have,

511
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,280
 flying over enemy territory,

512
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,160
 blowing the ground in flimsy, canvas airplanes.

513
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:50,560
 Chances of being killed gruesomely, first problem,

514
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,600
 big shoe, second problem.

515
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,200
 I think I don't actually do understand that

516
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
 because you know when you're meant to have a bigger problem,

517
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,320
 but you can only focus on the fact

518
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,080
 you've got a stone in your shoe or something

519
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,320
 and that dominates your attention.

520
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,360
 I'm very familiar with the sense

521
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,480
 of having much bigger problems,

522
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
 but actually only able to focus on the fact

523
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,440
 there's one little thing that's wrong

524
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,640
 as a distraction method.

525
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,000
 When I was doing the Bara Mafia, the book that I'm...

526
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,920
 One of the things that I was struck by all over again

527
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,360
 is what these pilots went through in the Second World War

528
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,360
 is just, in retrospect, completely unbelievable.

529
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,560
 What we asked them to do.

530
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,200
 Like...

531
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
 What do you mean, the danger or the discomfort?

532
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,160
 But don't just say that.

533
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,920
 You take a 20-year-old kid,

534
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,320
 you put him through X number of months of training,

535
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,160
 you fly him over to, if he's an American,

536
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,600
 fly him over to Europe,

537
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,560
 and he goes on these missions where statistically,

538
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,920
 the chance of you surviving your term, your tour, is zero.

539
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,040
 They know the death rates, right?

540
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,920
 They're...

541
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,920
 And you're up at 20,000 feet where it's freezing cold

542
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,160
 and these planes are not pressurized

543
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,880
 or heated or you're...

544
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,480
 The bombardier is sitting in this little thing

545
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
 that's exposed to...

546
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,000
 And German fighters are coming at...

547
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,520
 I mean, it's just like that,

548
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,760
 that they all didn't have PTSD is astonishing to me.

549
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,400
 And then you do a 12-hour whatever mission over Germany.

550
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,640
 You fly back to some freezing cold,

551
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
 unheated air base in the South of England.

552
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,400
 You get four hours of sleep and then you do it again.

553
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,880
 And you keep doing it for like...

554
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,600
 I mean, it's just like insane to me that this...

555
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,840
 This is what we...

556
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,920
 I mean, maybe only a 20-year-old would put up with that kind of...

557
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,200
 I mean, that was the reason.

558
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,600
 But planes, the importance that planes had,

559
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,320
 particularly in World War II, it's pretty staggering.

560
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,360
 So at one point during 1939 to 1945,

561
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:51,280
 ally factories were building 633,000 aircraft in that time.

562
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,640
 So they were pumping them out at 288 aircraft per day.

563
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,560
 And this was a time where they were just trying to work out

564
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,760
 how do we come up with a new kind of plane

565
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
 that's going to just be the game changer in this war.

566
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
 So in this period as well,

567
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,760
 250 new designs were all tested, built and flown,

568
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,120
 just to see whether or not they could get one over on the enemy.

569
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
 And it was one plane in particular,

570
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
 which was the P-51 Mustang,

571
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,840
 which was the absolute game changer during war.

572
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,440
 When that was designed and started flying,

573
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,680
 the Americans started flying that in over Germany,

574
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,800
 that was the moment where basically the Germans realized

575
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,240
 they were going to lose the war.

576
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,680
 Göring said himself, he said,

577
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,560
 "When I saw the Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up."

578
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,000
 He never...

579
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,720
 Göring did not say the phrase, the jig was up.

580
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,680
 He did it.

581
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,600
 He wouldn't have known the phrase, the jig is up.

582
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,160
 He did, he said, "Otto Spaghetti Ol'."

583
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,080
 He really did.

584
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,720
 Have you been going right until he said that?

585
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
 He had a quirky turn of phrase.

586
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,720
 Clearly.

587
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
 I'm speaking of Göring in World War II.

588
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,040
 He said he's a real great guy.

589
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,800
 Once again, impaling ourselves on a tin.

590
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,680
 He had a quid for every time you'd said that.

591
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,440
 The only person I know about.

592
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
 One of the RAF raids in World War II

593
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
 was specifically for the intention

594
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,600
 of interrupting one of his speeches.

595
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,440
 So it wasn't necessary to do any bombing or anything.

596
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,720
 This is in 1943,

597
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
 and it was a huge speech in Berlin

598
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,880
 to commemorate 10 years of Hitler being in power.

599
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
 And Göring was going to make this big keynote speech.

600
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
 And the plan was to fly a bunch of mosquitoes

601
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,680
 through the clouds above,

602
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,680
 really, really near to their microphones.

603
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,920
 So that basically, while the speech was being broadcast,

604
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
 it would pick up the sound of the RAF

605
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,600
 sort of attacking the city.

606
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,640
 That's kind of genius.

607
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,840
 This is clever, isn't it?

608
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,320
 And it works.

609
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,200
 Mosquitoes, unbelievable planes.

610
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,640
 We should say they were made of plywood,

611
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,520
 and they were made largely by carpenters in England.

612
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,400
 Yeah, yeah.

613
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,080
 That's actually what pissed him off so much.

614
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,560
 When this happened, and they had to cut off his speech,

615
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,160
 because they thought this sounds really bad now.

616
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,760
 He's shouting over invasion.

617
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
 You know, he said something like,

618
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,960
 "I can't believe these bloody Brits

619
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,240
 have got seven carpenters,

620
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,800
 and they've pieced these planes together out of some trees,

621
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,320
 and we can't do anything like it."

622
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,080
 But yeah.

623
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
 Did he say anything about the jig,

624
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,040
 and where he thought it might be?

625
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,480
 Once again, the jig is up.

626
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,720
 It's like a Scooby-Doo film.

627
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
 Stop trying to make the jig work.

628
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,280
 I read this other thing as well,

629
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,160
 just going back to psychology of the pilots

630
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,120
 that were being used.

631
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,640
 There was a series of spy planes.

632
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,400
 This is in the '60s, this is a bit later.

633
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,520
 The Blackbird, which we've spoken about before on the show,

634
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,000
 and the A-12, these were all high-flying spy planes

635
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,720
 that they really, really didn't tell many people about.

636
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,840
 And there's a rumor that went around,

637
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,000
 which quite a few historians have substantiated

638
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,040
 and said was true,

639
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,800
 is that during the interview process,

640
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,360
 they would only hire pilots who were married

641
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,120
 so that they had a reason to come back,

642
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,720
 because they had had a bunch of defectors at this point.

643
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
 This is a very positive attitude towards marriage.

644
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,040
 You could have easily spent it the other way.

645
00:28:51,040 --> 00:29:00,560
 Okay, it is time for fact number three,

646
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,920
 and that is my fact.

647
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,040
 My fact this week is that there is a marathon in New York

648
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,880
 that takes so long to complete,

649
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,600
 runners can go through up to 20 pairs of shoes

650
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,720
 while they're trying to run it.

651
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,200
 And they're all too big for them, aren't they?

652
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,560
 They are stuffed with anything.

653
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,840
 They're all they could think about, yeah.

654
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,880
 This is an amazing thing, and Malcolm, you're a New Yorker,

655
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,280
 so I wonder if you had ever heard of this.

656
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
 I have, I have.

657
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,280
 And you're a runner, aren't you?

658
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,160
 And a runner, so the self-transcendence 3,100-mile race,

659
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,720
 it's a race that goes around a single block in New York.

660
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,680
 So in total, if you ran around this block distance,

661
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,600
 it's 0.54 miles, right?

662
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,160
 Okay.

663
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
 But to complete this marathon,

664
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,680
 you need to run around this block 5,649 times.

665
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,720
 You've got 52 days in which to complete it,

666
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,400
 and runners will start at 6 a.m.,

667
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
 and they'll run all the way through to midnight.

668
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,960
 They'll do an average of 59 kilometers,

669
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,120
 59 and a half kilometers per day.

670
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,760
 And if you manage to complete

671
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,720
 what is the longest certified marathon in the world,

672
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
 you get an amazing prize,

673
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
 which is usually either a DVD or a t-shirt.

674
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
 Sometimes a small trophy.

675
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,680
 What DVD?

676
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,440
 Depends on the movie.

677
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,120
 Yeah, this is incredible.

678
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,960
 Malcolm, have you ever...

679
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,920
 Been tempted to do that?

680
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,280
 Is that your question?

681
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,680
 Have you been to the route?

682
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,800
 Because it's just one block in New York City.

683
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
 It's one block in Queens, I think.

684
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,440
 It is in Queens, yes.

685
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,920
 That's right.

686
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,480
 A lot of strange things happen in Queens.

687
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,800
 Dad, chief among them.

688
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,320
 It's lunacy, let's be clear.

689
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,600
 Even the normal marathon is lunacy.

690
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,320
 Right.

691
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,120
 I've never done a marathon.

692
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,160
 Have you done a marathon before?

693
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,640
 I would never.

694
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,600
 It's nuts.

695
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,520
 I mean, there's no part of it.

696
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,360
 Some random Greek, you know, thousands of years ago,

697
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,920
 completes this distance, dies at the end.

698
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,000
 And then that...

699
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,640
 We've seized on this as the kind of ultimate running experience.

700
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,600
 Every thing about marathoning strikes me.

701
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,760
 I mean, I'm a very, very serious runner.

702
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,600
 I just find it incomprehensible that anyone other than

703
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,640
 a kind of elite runner would ever even attempt it.

704
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,920
 So when you say you're a serious runner,

705
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,480
 do you do short distance sprinting runners?

706
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,320
 Normal, I run, you know, if I race,

707
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,480
 I run 5Ks or 10Ks or miles.

708
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,000
 But the idea of going out there for hours on end,

709
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,720
 inevitably injuring myself while preparing for it,

710
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,600
 and sacrificing huge parts of my life

711
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,320
 so I can go for 20 mile runs on the weekend.

712
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,960
 You know, it's just like...

713
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,840
 Yeah, it's very interesting.

714
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,400
 Because I don't really run very much,

715
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,440
 but I do think of running as a progression towards the marathon,

716
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,760
 which I have stopped at a very early point in,

717
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,720
 as in I don't...

718
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,280
 I'm not making any more progress towards a marathon

719
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,080
 in the distances I run.

720
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,240
 But you think of the marathon as the end goal...

721
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,200
 Sort of, yeah.

722
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,280
 As you know, you do a 5K and then you do a 10K run,

723
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,720
 and then eventually you'll do a marathon.

724
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,680
 Or you run 3,000 miles around a single block.

725
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,800
 It is insane.

726
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,760
 It's not like they shut it...

727
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,080
 Because I've been in New York when there's a marathon on,

728
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,680
 and obviously, like anywhere else,

729
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,280
 they shut the city roads down.

730
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,240
 They have all sorts of people cheering on the sides.

731
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,640
 These people just have to do it every day around New York.

732
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,840
 Is someone checking them?

733
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,080
 I think so, yeah.

734
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,600
 But it's a very low key.

735
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,080
 There's basically a trestle table where the race headquarters is.

736
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,360
 And I think it's just a couple of people.

737
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,880
 I don't know if they check the actual laps,

738
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,080
 or if they're tagged or...

739
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,800
 How long is it last?

740
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,560
 52 days, so yeah, a couple of months.

741
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:22,080
 So someone has to sit there from 6...

742
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
 From 6 in the morning to midnight.

743
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,640
 They're the real hero of the story.

744
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
 They're the real hero of the story.

745
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,560
 They feel like 2 days.

746
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,000
 How many pairs of trousers do they get?

747
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
 Yeah, yeah.

748
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,160
 I bet they've watched that DVD a bunch in that time, right?

749
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,800
 I find that person more interested in the person doing the running.

750
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,600
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

751
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,320
 Who is this person who can be convinced to take that job?

752
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,440
 This is preposterous.

753
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,920
 You're right.

754
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,200
 interview that guy.

755
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,640
 You're so right.

756
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,480
 Do they ask him whether they're happily married?

757
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
 This is an extension of the same...

758
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,560
 Only married men can take this job.

759
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,480
 You want to get away from the family for 52 days?

760
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,800
 It is.

761
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,920
 I think you need to sort of...

762
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,960
 You need an ultra-running CV even to enter the race.

763
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,360
 Really?

764
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,440
 They don't just take any schlub who says...

765
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,680
 Who turns up and says, "I reckon I could do it."

766
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,320
 Because I can easily see if I was ever a good enough runner

767
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,920
 to even consider entering this.

768
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
 I can see it getting a bit later.

769
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,320
 You're like, "You miss a day."

770
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
 You think, "Oh, I'll catch up later."

771
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,800
 It's fine.

772
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
 I've got 50 days to do it.

773
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,080
 How long can it be to just, you know?

774
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,800
 Yeah, yeah.

775
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,560
 My running friends and I have something we call the Kipchogi number.

776
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,000
 Kipchogi being the world's greatest marathon.

777
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,720
 Yeah.

778
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,840
 The Kipchogi number is how long you could run with Kipchogi

779
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,240
 if Kipchogi was running at world record pace.

780
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:30,640
 Cool.

781
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,200
 Right.

782
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,360
 So everyone in the world has a Kipchogi number.

783
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,760
 Your Kipchogi number may be two feet, right?

784
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
 It's always...

785
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,880
 The rule about Kipchogi numbers is they are shorter than you think.

786
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,720
 How lot do you know what your Kipchogi number is?

787
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,320
 My Kipchogi number is...

788
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,920
 If I'm very fit, it's probably 1200 meters.

789
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,640
 That's decent.

790
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,920
 That's pretty good.

791
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,560
 I wish I had written this down related to this.

792
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,280
 So there's the 5K park run, which I think is 5K.

793
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:57,680
 Park run is about...

794
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,600
 It's a huge thing here.

795
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,160
 Many hundreds of thousands of people have done it now.

796
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,920
 And I think they looked at how many people over 5K

797
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,240
 in the park run at their pace would have beaten Kipchogi

798
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,920
 running his marathon pace.

799
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,080
 So he was running that speed for 26 miles.

800
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,560
 Yeah, exactly.

801
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,200
 And everyone...

802
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:15,760
 Okay, yeah, yeah.

803
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,720
 And I think it's like fewer than 100 people

804
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,680
 are over that amount, over that distance.

805
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,640
 They're seriously...

806
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,560
 You'd be very good to even keep up with Kipchogi.

807
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,280
 He's good.

808
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,000
 But it's this thing...

809
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,720
 It's not...

810
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,160
 Because I was watching the marathon yesterday

811
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,600
 at the World Championships.

812
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,320
 You see these guys on the television

813
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,720
 and because they're all running at the same pace,

814
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,520
 there's an illusion that they're not running that fast.

815
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,240
 Right, yeah.

816
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,120
 But you have to understand if you actually see them in person,

817
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,720
 it is astonishing.

818
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,560
 So they're running at 445 mile pace for 26 consecutive miles.

819
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,160
 So all this is to say, I don't lack respect for the achievement.

820
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:56,480
 Yeah.

821
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,960
 I just think trying to do it is for...

822
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,200
 If you're not a professional, it's foolishness.

823
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,560
 I do always find it amazing how many people

824
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,000
 they get to do the marathon each year.

825
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,560
 So many thousands of people who are up for this.

826
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,200
 I know.

827
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,840
 Very difficult.

828
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,280
 Very difficult for you of masochism, yeah.

829
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,640
 And probably not that good for you.

830
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,120
 It's weird.

831
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:11,840
 Again, it's like...

832
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,080
 You know, I was talking earlier about the Goldilocks,

833
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,640
 like for social media, moderate use is good.

834
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,120
 Similarly, studies seem to show that moderate exercise,

835
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,640
 very good for you, obviously.

836
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,040
 Extreme exercise, like ultramarathon running,

837
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,480
 doesn't seem to be that good for you.

838
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
 It doesn't really confirm any more health benefits

839
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,320
 if you're running extremely long distances.

840
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,520
 And people do have these unbelievable hallucinations.

841
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,600
 They often collapse.

842
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,400
 I think there was...

843
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,160
 Is this standard marathons you're talking about?

844
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
 Usually more like ultramarathons.

845
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,320
 Ultramarathons, okay, yeah.

846
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,000
 So there was Jasmine Paris, you remember?

847
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,240
 She is a champion fell runner.

848
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,000
 And she...

849
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
 Anyway, she won the 2019 Montaigne spy race,

850
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,080
 which is a big up and down kind of mountain ultramarathon.

851
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,040
 And she saw lots of hallucinations and still...

852
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,480
 But still managed to win it

853
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,960
 and was expressing breast milk along the way, I think.

854
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,520
 Really?

855
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,320
 It's 268 miles, and she had a newborn baby.

856
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,120
 Where was the baby?

857
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:01,520
 As in...

858
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,440
 The baby was being run alongside her by her partner,

859
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,120
 who actually deserves more credit.

860
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

861
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,240
 That's amazing.

862
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,960
 We should say about...

863
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,200
 This race is called the...

864
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,760
 What is it called?

865
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,160
 The...

866
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,200
 Self-transcendence.

867
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,080
 Self-transcendence.

868
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,360
 Who does your tip off right there?

869
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,360
 Yeah.

870
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,880
 Don't transcend yourself.

871
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,680
 Don't do it.

872
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,280
 So we should say the guy who...

873
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,840
 Oh, yes.

874
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,360
 It's founded in his name.

875
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:25,760
 Yeah.

876
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,720
 Sri Chimnai.

877
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,200
 Yeah.

878
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,000
 So he was a...

879
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,640
 He's a guru.

880
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:28,960
 Guru.

881
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,440
 He's a guru, yeah.

882
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
 There are Sri Chimnai races around the world.

883
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:31,920
 Yeah.

884
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,400
 Yeah, yeah.

885
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,240
 And he was extraordinary.

886
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,640
 Yeah.

887
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,040
 As in...

888
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,320
 You read a bit about his life story.

889
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,840
 So he expressed self-transcendence through fitness.

890
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,640
 And as a result, did all these, you know, amazing feats.

891
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,960
 He lifted extraordinary weights and...

892
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,600
 Plains.

893
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,640
 He lifted planes, supposedly.

894
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,120
 I know.

895
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,840
 I'm slight.

896
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,480
 Yeah, I can see...

897
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,000
 He was the original aircraft carrier.

898
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,400
 He was.

899
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,360
 But his really...

900
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,960
 Like the funniest thing he did was called

901
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
 "Lifting Up the World with a Oneness Heart."

902
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,080
 Okay, that's what it was called.

903
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,600
 He went around the world bench pressing significant people.

904
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:01,920
 Yeah.

905
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,080
 Who've contributed to human history.

906
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,600
 So he lifted 8,000 people around the world.

907
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,440
 He lifted Nelson Mandela.

908
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:09,840
 Wow.

909
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,120
 Desmond Tutu.

910
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,000
 Billie Jean King.

911
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,280
 And then, I mean, it goes a bit like the list...

912
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,160
 Susan Sarandon.

913
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,480
 Oh, come on.

914
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,600
 That's Eddie Murphy.

915
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,080
 Nickname.

916
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,560
 Eddie Murphy.

917
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,120
 Eddie Murphy.

918
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,560
 Eddie Murphy, Yoko Rono.

919
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
 Ravi Shankar.

920
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,640
 Several heads of state.

921
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,600
 Richard Gere.

922
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,000
 Sting.

923
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
 Jesse Jackson.

924
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
 He's a wrestler, former wrestler.

925
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,000
 He's a biggie.

926
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,280
 Jeff Goldblum.

927
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
 Goldblum got a lift.

928
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,120
 Goldblum got a lift.

929
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,600
 Wow.

930
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,000
 It just feels like a...

931
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,280
 What a weird thing to do.

932
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,840
 What a very strange club of people to get together.

933
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,760
 But one time, he lifted a Republican and a Democrat

934
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,480
 at the same time.

935
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,440
 Oh, really?

936
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,200
 Yeah, just to express peace.

937
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,640
 That is actually...

938
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:46,960
 Yeah.

939
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
 That's cross-party, cross-island politics.

940
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,360
 Where is he from?

941
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,720
 He was from India, I want to say.

942
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,440
 I think he was.

943
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:53,920
 Yeah.

944
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,000
 He worked for the Indian Consulate, certainly,

945
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,560
 when he was...

946
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,000
 And that's why he moved to America.

947
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
 So he moved there in 1964.

948
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,600
 And yeah, he was just an extraordinary, as you say,

949
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,440
 kind of fitness character with a huge fan base.

950
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
 Can I just quickly mention, I saw a photo of you,

951
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,160
 a sort of younger college version of you doing a run

952
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,600
 on your blog.

953
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,480
 And you were doing an attempt at the four-minute mile,

954
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,880
 basically.

955
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,640
 Or at least you were running a mile and you got a number.

956
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,680
 That's close to it.

957
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,640
 Yeah, it was high school, early days of high school,

958
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,760
 and it was...

959
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,600
 I was running the 1500 meters, yes.

960
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,600
 But I was nowhere close to a four-minute mile,

961
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,120
 which is a grown-up activity.

962
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,920
 I think I ran a four-oh-something 1500 meters.

963
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,720
 Oh, really?

964
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,440
 Very different.

965
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,920
 But not still, you got four-oh-something.

966
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
 Four-oh-five.

967
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,320
 And the 1500 meters.

968
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,600
 Yeah, I was 14.

969
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,800
 Yeah, that's pretty quick.

970
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,720
 I peaked as a runner at 14, which amazes me to this day

971
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,800
 when I think of the idea that there was something

972
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,120
 I could do at 14, which I can't do,

973
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,120
 which I could do better than at any other point in my life.

974
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
 Yeah.

975
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,360
 It's kind of strange to think of that.

976
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,720
 If only someone had told you then,

977
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,400
 so you could have appreciated it.

978
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,200
 I'll stop.

979
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,320
 I'll stop, I'll give up.

980
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,040
 Yeah.

981
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,720
 That's right.

982
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,040
 Yeah.

983
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,240
 We've never mentioned Cliff Young.

984
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
 Cliff Young?

985
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,080
 Long...

986
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,960
 He must have known Cliff...

987
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,480
 Australian hero, Cliff Young.

988
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,040
 Never heard of him.

989
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,000
 So he ran the Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon

990
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,680
 in its inaugural year, which was 1983.

991
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,800
 Sydney to Melbourne.

992
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
 Yep, it's 875 kilometers.

993
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,440
 Wow.

994
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,480
 And he ran...

995
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,400
 We traveled that journey and we flew.

996
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:26,720
 So...

997
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,120
 We did.

998
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,640
 Well, we had to get from one tour date

999
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,600
 to the other quite quickly,

1000
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,400
 so it wouldn't have been practical actually for us to run it.

1001
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,360
 Otherwise we would have.

1002
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,440
 But anyway, so 1983, it's inaugurated.

1003
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,080
 The world's top runners go and say they'll try doing this run.

1004
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,760
 They've all got the training plan.

1005
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
 They've tried running those distances before.

1006
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
 And basically all the pros have established

1007
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,920
 that you run 18 hours a day

1008
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,000
 and you sleep for six hours a day

1009
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,200
 and you'll do it in, I think, five, six, seven days,

1010
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,720
 depending on how fast you go.

1011
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,040
 And so they all turn up and this guy turns up,

1012
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,760
 who's a 61-year-old farmer called Cliff Young,

1013
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
 and he's wearing his Wellington boots

1014
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,640
 and he's wearing like farming overalls.

1015
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,840
 And just before he starts,

1016
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,560
 he puts on the first ever pair of running shoes he's ever owned.

1017
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,000
 And he took out his teeth because...

1018
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,200
 Let's stop it.

1019
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,040
 They rattled when he ran.

1020
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,720
 So it's just so Australian, right?

1021
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,800
 (laughter)

1022
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,320
 And he put on his hat with the cork hanging down from it.

1023
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,720
 And he started...

1024
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,040
 No, he started shuffling along incredibly slowly

1025
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,680
 and everyone, like, left him in their dusk completely.

1026
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,800
 Super slowly.

1027
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
 But he didn't sleep and he had a different strategy.

1028
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,200
 He was a sheep farmer and he had 2,000 acres of land

1029
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,120
 and he used to have to run across this land

1030
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,400
 for days on end sometimes,

1031
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,920
 herding the sheep, chasing the sheep.

1032
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
 And he thought, "Well, I don't need to sleep

1033
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
 when I run that three, four days, I don't sleep.

1034
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,720
 I'm just going to not sleep."

1035
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,400
 And eventually, day two, day three,

1036
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,920
 started overtaking them all.

1037
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,280
 Are you sure you're not just telling us the hair and the tortoise story?

1038
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,560
 This is all feeding a bit east off.

1039
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,000
 This is all this whole...

1040
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,480
 Cliff Young, the tortoise, the pet tortoise.

1041
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,480
 No, it was incredible.

1042
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,280
 Where does he win?

1043
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,000
 He wins the race.

1044
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,640
 What?

1045
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,880
 He beats the nearest competitor by 10 hours.

1046
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,280
 He's way, way, way ahead, 61 years old.

1047
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,080
 And now, everyone does it his way,

1048
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,840
 by sort of sleeping maybe one hour a night and shuffling.

1049
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,320
 Okay.

1050
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,800
 He's like...

1051
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,520
 You know what he's like?

1052
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,840
 He's like, "Do you remember David Burkhoff?"

1053
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,160
 No.

1054
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,160
 "Burkhoff" is the Cliff Young of the backstroke.

1055
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,800
 Oh, really?

1056
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,520
 Oh, yeah.

1057
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
 You're in the backstroke, you jump off,

1058
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,520
 you dive into the water and then you surface

1059
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,880
 and you go, "Whoop, whoop, whoop," right?

1060
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,440
 Yeah.

1061
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,280
 Burkhoff realizes, "Oh, actually,

1062
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,480
 it's faster to swim underwater than on top."

1063
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,200
 So, Burkhoff starts, drives in and he doesn't surface

1064
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,040
 until two-thirds of the way down.

1065
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,080
 Yeah, right.

1066
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,880
 And he breaks the world record and they eventually ban it.

1067
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
 Oh, my God, it does feel like cheating.

1068
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,440
 He's Cliff Young, though.

1069
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,200
 He realizes that there's a flaw in the way people are...

1070
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,000
 Hang on, can I just check about David Burkhoff?

1072
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,080
 So, you said that was backstroke, right?

1073
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,720
 Backstroke.

1074
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,000
 So, are you allowed to do another stroke underwater?

1075
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,560
 No.

1076
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,840
 I could be wrong here.

1077
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
 I think you do a dolphin kick.

1078
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,160
 You do the dolphin kick, yeah.

1079
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,120
 And then dolphin kick.

1080
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,400
 But you're allowed to be on your front, aren't you?

1081
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,360
 But you're allowed to be on your front.

1082
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,640
 You're not doing backstroke because you're on your back.

1083
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,240
 No, no, backstroke, you start in the water and you go back.

1084
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:20,720
 Yeah.

1085
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,360
 Oh, okay, okay.

1086
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,680
 So, he just stays underwater doing a dolphin kick.

1087
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,480
 Upside down.

1088
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,240
 Sorry, I got it, I got it.

1089
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,440
 And surfaces later.

1090
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,960
 It's called the Burkhoff blast off.

1091
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,520
 That's amazing.

1092
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,480
 It's not quicker.

1093
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,240
 I feel like I'd be really slow at that.

1094
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,120
 Why is it quicker?

1095
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,400
 I've never understood why it's quicker.

1096
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,600
 I don't know anything about swimming.

1097
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,280
 Because you can't do it with your arms, can you?

1098
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,160
 The up and down maneuvering must take a lot of the speed

1099
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,120
 out of your forwards.

1100
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,760
 Yeah.

1101
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,160
 But it's doing the dolphin kick is faster than doing the backstroke.

1102
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,640
 Oh, I see.

1103
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,920
 It's the point of the backstroke.

1104
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,480
 Yeah, yeah.

1105
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,520
 Well, backstroke kicks.

1106
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,080
 So, we do the backstroke to move more slowly through the water.

1107
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:52,800
 Is that what we do?

1108
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,160
 Well, yeah, it's like butterfly.

1109
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,360
 What's the point of that?

1110
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,520
 So, he basically made the sport unwatchable

1111
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:58,720
 because you're just watching.

1112
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,120
 He did.

1113
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,160
 Although, it's very thrilling to see where any surfaces.

1114
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,000
 So, you're waiting, it turns it into a suspense film, right?

1115
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,640
 So, you watch it and you can't see anything.

1116
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,400
 It's just like the service of the water is unruffled.

1117
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,880
 We just see these strange things going on.

1118
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,920
 All of a sudden, burkoff.

1119
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,120
 I could see it.

1120
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,560
 I was, as a child, I was obsessed with burkoff.

1121
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,160
 He's this really brilliant guy.

1122
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,160
 But I just keep thinking he's going to do it again.

1123
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,120
 You know what I mean?

1124
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,920
 Maybe he's an anesthesiologist and he's going to realize,

1125
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,520
 wait a minute, right?

1126
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,800
 We don't have to keep them under for five minutes.

1127
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,160
 Keep them under for two hours.

1128
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,600
 He'll be very burkoff-y.

1129
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,320
 He doesn't give your prescription as a doctor

1130
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,560
 until you're in the car park going back to your car.

1131
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,280
 And then he says, "Take two of these days."

1132
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,360
 Don't you want to be inside burkoff's brain?

1133
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,800
 Yeah, burkoff's brain.

1134
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,280
 Yeah.

1135
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,640
 Yeah, it's so funny.

1136
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,560
 Here's what I love about burkoff and Cliff Young.

1137
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,320
 It is that thousands of people do this thing

1138
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,440
 and it never occurs to them to tinker with that particular.

1139
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,200
 So, on the ultramarathon,

1140
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
 they're doing everything in their power

1141
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,720
 to compete and train.

1142
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,600
 And it never occurs to them, "Oh, what if I just slept?"

1143
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,800
 I know. It's amazing, isn't it?

1144
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,080
 They're all like in lockstep.

1145
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,560
 Do they wake each other up before Cliff Young came along

1146
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,920
 and is like, "Ready to go now?"

1147
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
 Like, "You're in a race?"

1148
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,880
 In a race, yeah.

1149
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,480
 It just seems crazy.

1150
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,000
 I know. It makes you think how many things

1151
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,120
 are we taking for granted

1152
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,720
 where we could be smashing it in life

1153
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,400
 because there's an obvious loophole.

1154
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,760
 God, what a point.

1155
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,720
 What a terrifying point.

1156
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,440
 I could be way better at podcasting if I never slept.

1157
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:31,920
 For instance.

1158
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,640
 For instance.

1159
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,040
 Yeah.

1160
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,080
 Maybe. Or worse.

1161
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,160
 Tudin next week and find out how Anna's experiment went.

1162
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:46,400
 Okay. It is time for our final fact of the show

1163
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,080
 and that is Anna.

1164
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,480
 My fact this week is that, given the choice,

1165
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,600
 most people would prefer to win $10 million

1166
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
 rather than $100 billion.

1167
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,440
 Right? And so, let's see here, guys.

1168
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,560
 I'm going to ask you all.

1169
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,120
 Yeah.

1170
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,320
 This was a University of Bath research

1171
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,760
 and it's published in Nature

1172
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,080
 and it asks 8,000 people across 33 countries

1173
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,360
 so it's quite comprehensive.

1174
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:12,000
 And basically it said, "Imagine your ideal life

1175
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,840
 and then consider how much money you want

1176
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,120
 to lead that ideal life.

1177
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,320
 And then you've got a lottery that you can enter."

1178
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,680
 And you're going to win it.

1179
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,960
 You've got a bunch of lotteries

1180
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,800
 and you're probably going to win it.

1181
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,920
 And you've either got a lottery

1182
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,480
 where the jackpot is $10,000.

1183
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,520
 So it's all American dollars

1184
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,240
 but they adjusted it for currencies in the countries.

1185
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,640
 $10,000 and then it increased by multiples of 10.

1186
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,920
 So you've got $10,000, $100,000, million, $10 million

1187
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,520
 and the highest was $100 billion.

1188
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,280
 What would you guys go for?

1189
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,120
 $100 billion.

1190
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,560
 Okay. You'll just straight up $100 billion.

1191
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:42,960
 Yeah.

1192
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,360
 Welcome.

1193
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,520
 I totally agree. I $10 million.

1194
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,200
 You're going to get $10 million.

1195
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,520
 Really?

1196
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,000
 There you go.

1197
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,880
 The last thing you want to do is win $100 billion.

1198
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,520
 That is like a nightmare scenario.

1199
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:53,760
 Why?

1200
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,720
 Do you understand what would happen?

1201
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,040
 Listen, if I had that money,

1202
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
 I'd see you if you ever spoke to me like that

1203
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,160
 and then that time again.

1204
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,920
 Every single part of your life

1205
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,720
 gets more complicated by a thousand percent.

1206
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,240
 Oh, look at yellow musk.

1207
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,440
 He's having a great time.

1208
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,120
 Accusing people of things online.

1209
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,400
 He can't walk down the street.

1210
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,960
 That's true.

1211
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,840
 But you can't do that if you're famous regardless.

1212
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,120
 He's digging his own tunnel

1213
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:20,960
 so he won't need to go down the street.

1214
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:23,760
 He'll be parachuted through a vacuum tube

1215
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,880
 along under the street.

1216
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,360
 We can say with 100% certainty

1217
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,520
 that you would be profoundly unhappy.

1218
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:29,840
 Okay.

1219
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,960
 For a variety of reasons.

1220
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,720
 One of the main ones is that the proliferation of decisions

1221
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,520
 that you would have to make would overwhelm you.

1222
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
 So with money, this is the cost of wealth.

1223
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,160
 The hidden cost of wealth is that for most people,

1224
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,280
 the decision about whether to do an activity

1225
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,280
 is whether I can afford it.

1226
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
 When you have money, all of a sudden,

1227
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,160
 cans turn into wants.

1228
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,720
 Do I want to do that?

1229
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,680
 Do I want to do that is a much more complicated decision.

1230
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:03,920
 Yeah.

1231
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,720
 Human take choice.

1232
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,920
 It's too much endless choice.

1233
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,320
 So you now have every decision in your life

1234
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,360
 that used to be a can has now turned into a want.

1235
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,760
 So you are paralyzed.

1236
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,880
 Right now, you're going to have lunch after this place, right?

1237
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,280
 Yeah.

1238
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,440
 You're not going to go and have lunch at Claridge's, are you?

1239
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:21,520
 No.

1240
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,160
 No.

1241
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,440
 Why?

1242
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,040
 Well, for a number of reasons.

1243
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,840
 But one is you don't want to track all the way over there.

1244
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,440
 Two, there's no point to spending 80 pounds on lunch.

1245
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,120
 And three, why do you want to hang out with those people?

1246
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,360
 Right?

1247
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,000
 Those are your reasons.

1248
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,560
 Uh-huh.

1249
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,200
 Okay.

1250
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,280
 I have given you $100 billion.

1251
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,240
 I've removed...

1252
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,280
 You have a driver now.

1253
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,080
 Nothing can you go to Claridge's.

1254
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,240
 You can go to the airport and get in your plane and fly to...

1255
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,920
 You can have lunch in Paris if you want.

1256
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,960
 Do you want to have lunch in Paris?

1257
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,280
 Yeah.

1258
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:47,600
 Do you want to?

1259
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,320
 It's spiraled out of control.

1260
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,520
 And then you got to look...

1261
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,080
 Sounds great.

1262
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:57,040
 You're going to have to be really going to struggle to get down

1263
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,640
 to give an inch of this.

1264
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,120
 Oh, wait a second.

1265
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,160
 Are you trying to put me off it?

1266
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,960
 It's a nightmare.

1267
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,800
 I've picked the most kind of anodyne choice that you would have today,

1268
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,840
 where to have lunch.

1269
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,360
 And now I've given you an infinite set of options,

1270
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,800
 just because you have $100 billion.

1271
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,120
 Yeah.

1272
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,080
 So you can't even...

1273
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,680
 Lunch has now become a cognitive burden of the size.

1274
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,800
 No, but we even talked...

1275
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,400
 There's a million other things that are going to happen today

1276
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,200
 that we've even talked about.

1277
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,720
 For every single one of them has now been multiplied times thousands.

1278
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,760
 But I just want to use it specifically for eBay auctions,

1279
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,400
 where I can just make sure I set the limit at $100 billion

1280
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,160
 and never lose my auction.

1281
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,320
 The size of the Dick Gregory memorabilia market

1282
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,720
 is going to go wildly out of proportion.

1283
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,760
 If you collect...

1284
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,440
 Say, do you like to collect things?

1285
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,000
 Yes, I do.

1286
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,560
 Okay, okay.

1287
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,000
 I have now removed 100% of the joy of collecting things.

1288
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,800
 There's no longer any constraint.

1289
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,520
 That's a really good point.

1290
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,960
 You no longer have to make any decision.

1291
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,160
 You can just buy everything.

1292
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,480
 Yeah.

1293
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,960
 Oh my God, you wouldn't treasure any of all that crap you have

1294
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,960
 that no sane person would treasure anyway.

1295
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,320
 You wouldn't because you could buy infinite quantities of it.

1296
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,000
 You could do five things.

1297
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,440
 It is really interesting.

1298
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,680
 What would you do, Andy, sorry, since we got the others?

1299
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,000
 Can I split the difference again?

1300
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,040
 $100 million.

1301
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,320
 That's very unusual.

1302
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,160
 So interestingly in this study, it really peaks at $10 million.

1303
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,520
 So most people ask for $10 million or below.

1304
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,560
 There are some countries like, I think, Russia and India

1305
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,800
 where the majority choose $1 million or less.

1306
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,760
 But I was looking at the graph and it peaks at $10 million.

1307
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,680
 And then there are quite a lot of people

1308
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,000
 who still choose $100 billion, although not majority.

1309
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,880
 So it ranges between 8% of people in China

1310
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,840
 to 39% of people in Indonesia choose $100 billion.

1311
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,120
 But between $10 million and $100 billion, it's hardly anyone.

1312
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,400
 I guess because $10 million seems to me like Malcolm saying,

1313
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,920
 like a kind of reasonable amount where you could live a really nice life.

1314
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,720
 You have an incredible house and travel and see the world.

1315
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,000
 Whereas actually $100 million is a life deforming,

1316
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,200
 like a substantially deforming amount of money.

1317
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,200
 You lose all of your friends at $100 million too.

1318
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,320
 Yeah, yeah.

1319
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,760
 Every relationship you have.

1320
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,160
 This is, once again, is this appeals?

1321
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,080
 Down is unphased by us.

1322
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,680
 I'm trying to get out of this hell hole.

1323
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,840
 I'm a feature, not a bug.

1324
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,880
 What would I do, by the way?

1325
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,760
 What would you do?

1326
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,480
 What would you do?

1327
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,800
 Well, what I find is always difficult with these

1328
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,400
 is that the temptation is to say,

1329
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
 "I'll have it all so that you can just give it all away."

1330
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,160
 But then that's quite an arrogant, probably Western thing

1331
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,160
 to think that I know better where to give money than governments

1332
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,000
 or Bill Gates or whatever.

1333
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,120
 But I'd be tempted to do that.

1334
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,880
 I would spend all the money traveling the world

1335
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,840
 lifting people I chose to be significant.

1336
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,640
 That's what I would do.

1337
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,200
 Because with $100 million, you can lift anyone in the world.

1338
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,440
 Yeah.

1339
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,960
 Well, you mean just pick at your special.

1340
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,120
 I'm going to turn you into the president of East Timor or something.

1341
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,200
 No, I mean literally, like Street Chimnoi.

1342
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,320
 I just travel around the world.

1343
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,520
 Just lifting people up.

1344
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,400
 You're just picking people up.

1345
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:44,880
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1346
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,520
 That trippied act.

1347
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:45,680
 Right.

1348
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,880
 That's Street Chimnoi tribute.

1349
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,480
 Do 8001.

1350
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:48,880
 Yeah, yeah.

1351
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,880
 It's lots of studies about the psychology of wealth.

1352
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,320
 So one of them, which I quite liked,

1353
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,640
 is would you go public if you won the lottery?

1354
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,040
 Yeah.

1355
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,440
 And again, I think I know what you're going to say, Malcolm.

1356
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,000
 Disaster.

1357
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,960
 Yeah, disaster.

1358
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,360
 Absolutely.

1359
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:05,280
 Well, public opinion is definitely in chime of that.

1360
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,600
 Only 2% of people say they would make public the fact they'd won.

1361
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,680
 But he invariably, here's the problem.

1362
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,360
 You can't not go public because every one of your choices

1363
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,840
 is conspicuous at a hundred million, right?

1364
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:20,960
 So something would be idling downstairs, right, with a driver.

1365
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,720
 You're not taking the two with a hundred billion.

1366
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,920
 This is driving me nuts.

1367
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,360
 You're not confronted the lunacy of your position yet.

1368
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,960
 You're not even here.

1369
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,800
 Wait, let me ask you a question.

1370
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,920
 Are you enjoying this right now?

1371
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,480
 I love this.

1372
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:36,720
 Yeah.

1373
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,440
 You enjoy your job.

1374
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,400
 Yeah.

1375
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,400
 And you enjoy this afternoon.

1376
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,120
 This taping session.

1377
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:41,360
 Yeah, yeah.

1378
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,560
 I mean, this bit's going to give it a test.

1379
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:42,560
 Yeah.

1380
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,760
 And have you enjoyed a cup of coffee?

1381
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,720
 I did, is it?

1382
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,520
 All of that's gone.

1383
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,720
 What are you doing?

1384
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:49,840
 You have a hundred billion dollars.

1385
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,960
 You don't do this job anymore.

1386
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,360
 What am I doing?

1387
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,920
 What am I doing?

1388
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:52,560
 Well--

1389
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,760
 Dan is going to be in the--

1390
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,880
 Dan is in the 59--

1391
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,080
 59% of people, right?

1392
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,760
 2% said they'd go public.

1393
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,640
 59% of people said they would remain anonymous

1394
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,320
 and not even tell their friends.

1395
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,720
 And Dan thinks he's in this group of people who are going

1396
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,400
 to turn-- next time I turn off outside Dan's house,

1397
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,880
 there's a gold-plated Maserati outside.

1398
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,560
 Dan denies anything to do with him.

1399
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,520
 I'm just going to saving.

1400
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,160
 Yeah, you will.

1401
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,080
 I would hire a replacement me to just take over this life.

1402
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,760
 Be the Dan Shriver, and I would go be Mr. Billionaire.

1403
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,120
 Well, we should definitely do that.

1404
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,360
 Yeah.

1405
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:21,600
 Sorry.

1406
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:22,640
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1407
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,680
 We've neglected the single biggest drawback

1408
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,120
 to having a hundred billion.

1409
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,200
 And that is you have to hang out without a billionaires.

1410
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:29,920
 Oh, my god.

1411
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,600
 There's no way you have to do that.

1412
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,240
 No, that's true.

1413
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:32,880
 That's true.

1414
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,600
 That is a nightmare.

1415
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,160
 That is a nightmare.

1416
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,600
 They're the only ones who understand you, I suppose.

1417
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:36,720
 So, yeah.

1418
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,040
 There's one county--

1419
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,280
 I believe it's in Wyoming or Montana,

1420
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,040
 which has more billionaires than any other--

1421
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:43,600
 Oh, wow.

1422
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,560
 --where they all live.

1423
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,280
 OK.

1424
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,160
 And they all have their personal offices there,

1425
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,840
 which are their charities.

1426
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,760
 No one else is going to afford to live there.

1427
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,320
 They priced out everyone who serves the billionaire.

1428
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,760
 So everyone who has to serve the billionaire

1429
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,040
 has to drive like massive distances from one county.

1430
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,560
 And they all have these charitable offices.

1431
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,360
 But of course, who are you spending your charitable dollars on

1432
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,000
 if there's only billionaires in this?

1433
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:06,400
 Yeah.

1434
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:06,960
 Right?

1435
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,920
 It's this sort of endless--

1436
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,800
 and it's this absurd existence that they live in this one.

1437
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,600
 That's where you get it.

1438
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,120
 That's where we'll find you.

1439
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,240
 This is another UGov survey, which tests a famous rap lyric.

1440
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,880
 Do you think it is or is not true that the more money you have,

1441
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,160
 the more problems you have?

1442
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,960
 12% said it is true that more money, more problems.

1443
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,600
 That's not--

1444
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,600
 60% said it's false that more money, more problems.

1445
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,400
 What's U-shaped?

1446
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,760
 It's not a linear relationship.

1447
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,280
 It's a U-shaped relationship, sorry.

1448
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,160
 It's the Goldilocks thing.

1449
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,360
 Studies tend to show, don't they,

1450
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,720
 that after a certain amount of wealth,

1451
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:41,040
 then your happiness starts to decline again?

1452
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,080
 I think the global average is--

1453
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,080
 it's about 70,000 US dollars for emotional well-being.

1454
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,680
 And then it's 95 for--

1455
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,200
 Sorry, is that income or wealth or is this--

1456
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,000
 It's income, sorry.

1457
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,200
 So pay your salary, yes.

1458
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,640
 But in terms of life satisfaction or life evaluation,

1459
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,160
 it's about 95.

1460
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,360
 So people feel prouder, I suppose,

1461
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,500
 if they earn a little bit more, even though they'll

1462
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,520
 be happy day to day with a bit less.

1463
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,400
 So what do you want?

1464
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,760
 Do you want to be proud of how much you earn?

1465
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,120
 Or do you want to live a nice life?

1466
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,920
 But either way, it's not very bad.

1467
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,760
 I know what dad's going to ask for every single time.

1468
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,000
 For the list of cockroaches that's staring me down,

1469
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,400
 waited for my answer.

1470
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,960
 Poor misguided fool.

1471
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:29,440
 There was a really fun study done by a guy called Paul Piff,

1472
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,920
 who looks into the effects of wealth on people

1473
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,840
 and looks into how it actually kind of makes

1474
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:36,280
 us meaner if we get richer.

1475
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,000
 He sent researchers to hide in a bush in California

1476
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,160
 and look at cars that went by and then judge

1477
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,760
 how expensive they are.

1478
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,840
 And then there's a researcher further up the road,

1479
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,000
 I think, who is just crossing, is ever crossing back and forth.

1480
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,640
 And in California, you legally have

1481
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,360
 to stop for people to cross, is ever crossing, like here.

1482
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,440
 And he clocks the types of car and then

1483
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,480
 whether they stopped for the pedestrians.

1484
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,960
 And in the cheapest category of car,

1485
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:03,640
 every single car stopped to let the pedestrians across,

1486
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:04,360
 as you're supposed to do.

1487
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,880
 In the most expensive category of car,

1488
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,440
 how many would you think would stop

1489
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,400
 and how many would drive past?

1490
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,640
 How many would stop out of the most expensive category?

1491
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,000
 60%.

1492
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,720
 60%.

1493
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,640
 Do you-- you're close.

1494
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,760
 It was 50/50.

1495
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,320
 50% of the most expensive cars.

1496
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,880
 Just drive-- just break the law and drive

1497
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
 straight over the zebra crossing and don't let

1498
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,680
 the person cross the road.

1499
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,240
 That's you, Dan.

1500
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,600
 We now know who's in that car, yeah?

1501
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:29,000
 I don't drive, so.

1502
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,000
 In your fancy car.

1503
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,200
 You'll have a world with your chauffeur

1504
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,840
 about that on the train.

1505
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,360
 Mow him down.

1506
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,240
 Can I give you one more survey about how people react to wealth?

1507
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,320
 I really like this one because it's a great question to ask.

1508
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,040
 If you accidentally paid 300 times more

1509
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,640
 than your monthly salary, what would you be most likely to do?

1510
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,000
 Say something and return the money.

1511
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,680
 Say nothing but return the money if asked.

1512
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,840
 Try and immediately spend or move the money.

1513
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,840
 But stay in your job.

1514
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,800
 Or take the money and leave your job.

1515
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,480
 So I mean, open season.

1516
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,440
 Well, they're going to find out.

1517
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,680
 They're going to find out, and then they're

1518
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
 going to ask you to repay the money in three years' time

1519
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,360
 when you've spent all the money.

1520
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,880
 And that's the worst of all worlds.

1521
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,600
 I'll give you the stats.

1522
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,160
 It's amazing.

1523
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,920
 62% of people said they'd say something and return the money.

1524
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:21,400
 20% of people said they'd say nothing but return the money

1525
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,720
 if asked.

1526
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,520
 And then we get to the real optimists.

1527
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,760
 3% of people would take the money and leave the job.

1528
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,400
 They said they would try and do that.

1529
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,640
 2% of people said they would take the money,

1530
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,200
 try and immediately spend or move it,

1531
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:37,080
 and also keep their job, which I just find so optimistic.

1532
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,320
 2% of people think they would get away with that.

1533
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,200
 That's nice rosy thinking.

1534
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,800
 The worst spy in American history

1535
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,000
 was Aldrich Ames, CIA agent, intelligence officer who

1536
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,760
 gave away the store to the Soviets, everything.

1537
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
 So all we need to say worst spy, you mean most effective?

1538
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,560
 I did the most damage to American interests.

1539
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,320
 Who was paid all this money.

1540
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,000
 He worked for the Soviets for like 10 years.

1541
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,480
 He's paid all this money, and he starts to live it up.

1542
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,280
 And all of his colleagues know how much he makes.

1543
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,360
 And he starts showing up.

1544
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,440
 He buys a Jaguar, and his wife has a main code,

1545
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,880
 and he has his fancy house, and he goes and he's like--

1546
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,240
 and no one-- no one said it.

1547
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,400
 No one-- it didn't click.

1548
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,520
 But they're spies.

1549
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,240
 He's option four, in other words.

1550
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,560
 He's keep-- spend the money, keep the job.

1551
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,600
 Somehow he thinks that-- and he was right.

1552
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,440
 No one noticed.

1553
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,600
 He gets caught in the end for some other complicated reason.

1554
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,280
 But the idea that he's like, it's growing around 20s.

1555
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,280
 Wow.

1556
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,640
 That's so funny.

1557
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,640
 Incredible.

1558
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,320
 And no one notices for years.

1559
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,240
 It gets ever more extravagant.

1560
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,440
 He's the only one in the parking lot of the CIA.

1561
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,480
 No one has a Jaguar.

1562
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,760
 They're government employees.

1563
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,160
 Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the funniest thing.

1564
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,360
 He started wearing his fancy European suits,

1565
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,600
 and like, it's the most hilarious story.

1566
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,600
 It's a really glistens plate on his car.

1567
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:02,680
 He trips into Russia accidentally all the time.

1568
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,160
 His colleagues just going, I must get better at saving.

1569
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,160
 I don't understand.

1570
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,640
 OK, that's it.

1571
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,720
 That is all of our facts.

1572
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:15,160

 @AndrewHunterM.

1579
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,080
 Malcolm, are you on social media?

1580
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:26,600
 I am.

1581
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:27,960
 I'm-- what am I?

1582
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,440
 I think I'm @Gladwell, probably.

1583
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,000
 @Gladwell, probably.

1584
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,120
 And, Adam, we've already established

1585
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,080
 that you don't even know what it is.

1586
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,560
 No, but I'm probably with email.
