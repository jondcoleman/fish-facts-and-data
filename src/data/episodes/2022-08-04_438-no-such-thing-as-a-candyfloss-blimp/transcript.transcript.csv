00:00:00,00:00:04,"Hi guys, before we start this week's episode of Fish we have a few exciting"
00:00:04,00:00:08,"announcements to make. Announcement number one is that we, no such thing as a fish,"
00:00:08,00:00:13,are going on tour. We are going to be going around Scotland. We've got four
00:00:13,00:00:16,dates in Scotland at the end of August and start of September. We're going to
00:00:16,00:00:20,Cardiff. We're also playing a gig in London. Now the London gig is sold out in
00:00:20,00:00:25,the room but it's also streaming online. So effectively if you live anywhere in
00:00:25,00:00:29,"the world and you're listening to this, you can access a fish gig, especially if"
00:00:29,00:00:33,"you live in Scotland, to a certain extent if you live in Cardiff and also if you"
00:00:33,00:00:38,live anywhere else. You can get a ticket by going to nosuchthingasafish.com/live.
00:00:38,00:00:43,"All the information is up there. Yes it is. Information item number two is, if"
00:00:43,00:00:48,"anything, even more exciting than that because chief gnome, our big boss, the"
00:00:48,00:00:54,"man who created us in our current form, Mr John Lloyd, all-round comedy legend. He"
00:00:54,00:00:58,also has a live show. That is going to the Edinburgh Festival and it looks to be
00:00:58,00:01:02,absolutely fantastic. It's called Do You Know Who I Am? If you don't know who
00:01:02,00:01:06,John Lloyd is then I don't know where you've been but he is the man behind all
00:01:06,00:01:11,"the great comedies really of the 80s and 90s from Black Hatter, Spitting Image, The"
00:01:11,00:01:16,"News Quiz, Not the Nine O'Clock News, QI obviously. Episode 17 of No Such Thing as"
00:01:16,00:01:21,a Fish. I think that's the one he's most proud of yes. So the show format is
00:01:21,00:01:24,"you go, you ask him absolutely anything you want to ask him from the meaning of"
00:01:24,00:01:30,life to his fingernail cutting regimen. So go to the Edinburgh Fringe website and
00:01:30,00:01:33,check out how to get tickets for that. It's on from the 5th to the 15th of August.
00:01:33,00:01:36,And the final bit of information is that we have a special guest today on No Such
00:01:36,00:01:41,Thing as a Fish. The guest is a really exciting person. He is none other than
00:01:41,00:01:45,Malcolm Gladwell. We're sure you've heard of Malcolm and if not maybe you've
00:01:45,00:01:50,heard of the Time 100 Most Influential People list which he's been on which
00:01:50,00:01:54,might well be a first for us. He's a brilliant writer and broadcaster. He's
00:01:54,00:01:58,written fabulous books like The Tipping Point and Blink. He's got a new book out
00:01:58,00:02:01,called The Bomber Mafia and if you're a podcast listener which you probably are
00:02:01,00:02:05,listening to this he also hosts the fabulous revisionist history which
00:02:05,00:02:09,looks at overlooked and misunderstood things in that classic Gladwellian way.
00:02:09,00:02:13,This was so much fun to record we really hope you enjoy listening to it.
00:02:13,00:02:19,Check out Malcolm's other things as above. Okay on with the show. On with the podcast.
00:02:19,00:02:32,[Music]
00:02:32,00:02:37,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly"
00:02:37,00:02:41,podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covent Garden. My name is Dan
00:02:41,00:02:45,"Schreiber. I am sitting here with Anna Tyshinski, Andrew Hunter Murray and our"
00:02:45,00:02:49,very special guest it's Malcolm Gladwell and once again we have gathered
00:02:49,00:02:53,around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:02:53,00:02:57,and in no particular order here we go starting with fact number one and that
00:02:57,00:03:02,is Malcolm. My favorite fact is that no one has any
00:03:02,00:03:06,clear idea about what growing up with a smartphone does.
00:03:06,00:03:10,So we I got into this because I was doing an episode of my podcast
00:03:10,00:03:14,Origins History on what I called Magic Wand Experiments. Okay. Which is the
00:03:14,00:03:17,"experiment you would do if you could wave a magic wand, right?"
00:03:17,00:03:22,Because to spend all laws of nature and yeah practical and ethical.
00:03:22,00:03:26,So I called up to spend a minute and I said who is a psychologist and I said
00:03:26,00:03:29,what's your magic wand? And he said oh I want to divide
00:03:29,00:03:32,let's say a thousand or two thousand children at birth
00:03:32,00:03:38,"and one group, group one gets a blackberry for the first 25 years of"
00:03:38,00:03:41,their life. Actually he wanted to do for the first 50 years
00:03:41,00:03:44,and group two gets an iPhone. I said well why would you want to do that? And he
00:03:44,00:03:48,said well because we just don't know why did an iPhone.
00:03:48,00:03:52,Which I thought I found that just an exception. He was astonishing.
00:03:52,00:03:55,It wasn't that he was invested in blackberries and has been very disappointed
00:03:55,00:03:57,there. So all so the blackberry is just your
00:03:57,00:04:01,phone and email. So we right okay yeah it's clear that
00:04:01,00:04:05,"is doesn't affect your life in any dramatic way, right?"
00:04:05,00:04:09,And the iPhone is all the other stuff. Well if you go through the
00:04:09,00:04:12,literature he's like you'll discover that there is no consensus or even
00:04:12,00:04:15,understanding of what all that other stuff
00:04:15,00:04:20,does to a child. So he gave me an example. I suppose we were all
00:04:20,00:04:24,six years old and I and we're sitting around a table
00:04:24,00:04:29,and I or eight years old and I say something deeply offensive to Anna.
00:04:29,00:04:32,It happens a lot actually. Anna has many options
00:04:32,00:04:38,but she can express her displeasure directly to me in one form or another.
00:04:38,00:04:41,"Yell at me, cut me down sarcastically, punch me,"
00:04:41,00:04:45,"ignore me. All very enticing. You've met Anna before, right?"
00:04:45,00:04:49,I ain't got a sense. And all of these are are deeply
00:04:49,00:04:54,effective ways of educating me about the consequences of my actions.
00:04:54,00:04:58,"Now, I suppose me and Anna are on our iPhones and I say the exact same thing"
00:04:58,00:05:02,only it's a text. Yes. So the only way Anna can respond now
00:05:02,00:05:06,is with another text. So she used to have an enormous repertoire of
00:05:06,00:05:11,potentially powerful and instructive responses to my provocation.
00:05:11,00:05:16,Now all she has is a text. So let's replace the enormous repertoire of
00:05:16,00:05:18,powerfully instructive responses over the course of
00:05:18,00:05:23,25 years just with texts. The question is what happens to Malcolm?
00:05:23,00:05:27,Does Malcolm do I just become oblivious? Do I just keep
00:05:27,00:05:31,being offensive? Do I never learn the consequences of my actions?
00:05:31,00:05:36,"If I accompany my text with some really angry emojis, I think it might be him."
00:05:36,00:05:40,But nothing is as instructive as the things I mentioned.
00:05:40,00:05:46,Now it may be that it doesn't matter. It also may be that it's hugely consequential.
00:05:46,00:05:50,We have no idea. Right. When will we find out? Is it going to be like a future
00:05:50,00:05:53,presidential election where they're simply on their phone texting each other
00:05:53,00:05:56,for podiums? Like is it going to be decades before
00:05:56,00:05:59,"any kind of research can come out about this? Well, you have to study it."
00:05:59,00:06:01,It feels like we must know a bit. We've had 10 years.
00:06:01,00:06:03,Surely there's someone like in text to look into this.
00:06:03,00:06:07,There's no control. I think that's the no control. Yeah. And that's the problem.
00:06:07,00:06:10,We do know. So we know some things that are worrisome.
00:06:10,00:06:14,We know that levels of depression and mental illness are higher among
00:06:14,00:06:18,adolescents now than they've ever been in measured history.
00:06:18,00:06:21,So is that coming to do with technology? Maybe we don't know.
00:06:21,00:06:25,It certainly is a kind of prod to think that this might be
00:06:25,00:06:28,an important subject. It's terrifying researching this fact.
00:06:28,00:06:31,"It is. It really is. And you know, the most telling thing I suppose"
00:06:31,00:06:35,so far is the response of Silicon Valley and basically all the people at the top
00:06:35,00:06:39,of tech who now have turned against it and who discouraged their children from
00:06:39,00:06:43,having screen time. The schools don't have iPads and computers.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"Silicon Valley schools. Yeah, they all, so many of them regret doing what they did."
00:06:46,00:06:50,"I think the guy who invented infinite scroll, Aza Raskin, I think he says he"
00:06:50,00:06:54,regrets it more than anything else in his life. He said it led to dire consequences.
00:06:54,00:06:56,Right. What did he invent? Sorry?
00:06:56,00:06:58,"The infinite scroll. So before you got,"
00:06:58,00:07:01,"he got annoyed when he was about 22 at the fact on Google, you have to click"
00:07:01,00:07:04,"next page when you get to the bottom. And he said, wouldn't it be great if you"
00:07:04,00:07:08,could just go on and on? And now he says he understands the importance of that stop.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"I've never considered that that was the, I was thinking when you said he invented it,"
00:07:11,00:07:14,I was thinking what came before infinite scroll and of course that was it.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Pages. Pages, yeah. Pages, that's all right."
00:07:17,00:07:20,And I'm now wondering what my all-time record of how many tweets I have scrolled
00:07:20,00:07:24,through at once is because there must have been a day where I did more than I
00:07:24,00:07:29,"had ever done before. But if I had to click at the end of 10 tweets and make a conscious choice,"
00:07:29,00:07:31,you want to see another 10 of these?
00:07:31,00:07:37,"On his tombstone, that he, you know, let's make scrolling finite again."
00:07:37,00:07:44,Is he just sick of talking about it? Because I think a lot of these people regret it
00:07:44,00:07:47,just because everyone keeps requesting interviews about it.
00:07:47,00:07:48,I spoke to a guy.
00:07:48,00:07:51,There can't be that many interview requests for the guy who invented infinite scroll.
00:07:51,00:07:53,"No offense to him. I mean, that's clearly a big adventure."
00:07:53,00:07:56,But I bet it comes up a lot more than it is.
00:07:56,00:08:00,"It's how he's introduced. Does he, I wonder, as he introduced himself,"
00:08:00,00:08:02,like when he meets someone in a coffee shop.
00:08:02,00:08:06,He keeps talking until he stops.
00:08:06,00:08:13,"No, he is, he compares it to, he says there's a study where people are given bowls of soup"
00:08:13,00:08:18,and told to eat as much as they want. And then some of the bowls refill constantly from underneath.
00:08:18,00:08:23,And some don't and they have to put refills in. And the people who have the bowls that refill
00:08:23,00:08:27,"constantly, the magic bowls, eat 70% more soup. And they don't even know that they've done it."
00:08:27,00:08:30,So it's this like really subconscious addictive thing.
00:08:30,00:08:32,So he says it's like that.
00:08:32,00:08:35,"It's like the fairy tale, you know, with the, with the, we have an info,"
00:08:35,00:08:39,what's that one where you have an infinite number of reach in the bag and has always
00:08:39,00:08:46,"gold coins. That was presented to us as children, as a, as a kind of triumphant story."
00:08:46,00:08:47,"In fact, it's a tragic story."
00:08:47,00:08:49,"Yes, exactly."
00:08:49,00:08:50,"It is, it ruins you."
00:08:50,00:08:52,This is the fairy tale version of infinite scroll.
00:08:52,00:08:54,Yeah. That's true.
00:08:54,00:08:58,"Another of those guys, Justin Rosenstein, who helped invent the like button."
00:08:58,00:09:03,"And I only helped invent, I didn't do the sole inventor, but you know, he was part of the team"
00:09:03,00:09:08,"in there. He has now turned off all notifications on his phone. Yeah, because when you install the"
00:09:08,00:09:12,"new app, it often comes with notifications pre included, doesn't it? And you have to go into"
00:09:12,00:09:16,"the settings and then turn it off. And that, yeah, Tim Harford wrote a column recently."
00:09:16,00:09:22,He changed over his phone at some point and all the notification settings were left on.
00:09:22,00:09:26,"And he got to live as if he had had them on, you know, all the way from buying a phone at the"
00:09:26,00:09:33,"first place and just a constant stream of notifications, jingles, bells, whistles, updates."
00:09:33,00:09:34,"Oh, what if every single one is on?"
00:09:34,00:09:37,Every single app on his phone had the notifications now on.
00:09:37,00:09:38,Yeah.
00:09:38,00:09:39,And it was a constant noise.
00:09:39,00:09:44,"You know what's really, the other interesting you can do is turn off the color on your phone."
00:09:44,00:09:45,Have you done this? No.
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Yeah, black and white, yeah."
00:09:46,00:09:47,Go black and white for a while.
00:09:47,00:09:47,What?
00:09:47,00:09:48,Yeah.
00:09:48,00:09:49,It's a similar kind of detoxing.
00:09:49,00:09:50,I've tried that.
00:09:50,00:09:50,Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:51,That's great.
00:09:51,00:09:52,It is. It's very good.
00:09:52,00:09:58,"One thing I used to get, which I don't anymore, is that thing of phantom phone vibration."
00:09:58,00:09:59,It's like phantom limb pain.
00:09:59,00:10:00,"Yeah, exactly."
00:10:00,00:10:01,But it's phantom phone.
00:10:01,00:10:02,Have you never heard this?
00:10:02,00:10:04,Never heard this. This is the strangest.
00:10:04,00:10:05,"It's really, I haven't."
00:10:05,00:10:08,"Wow, really. You know, you get the buzz. You think, oh, great."
00:10:08,00:10:09,Finally.
00:10:09,00:10:13,"Someone wants, someone has texted me or needs me in some way."
00:10:13,00:10:17,"And it's turned on every notification on his phone apps and still nothing, just still dead."
00:10:17,00:10:20,"Yeah. No, it is. It's a very strange sensation."
00:10:20,00:10:25,"Well, if it's any consolation to anyone, they've obviously been kind of preliminary studies."
00:10:25,00:10:31,"It's hard to know that much at the moment, but this looked at data from 72,000 people"
00:10:31,00:10:33,between the ages of 10 and 80.
00:10:33,00:10:35,And it asked them how much time they spent on social media.
00:10:35,00:10:40,So this was like specifically about if social media makes you unhappy.
00:10:40,00:10:42,"And then it asked how satisfied they were with their lives,"
00:10:42,00:10:45,"which I don't know how 10 year olds answered that question, but they did."
00:10:45,00:10:49,And it basically found that there was a Goldilocks effect.
00:10:49,00:10:54,"So most people, if they're using these things moderately,"
00:10:54,00:10:56,"they're using social media moderately, they're pretty much okay."
00:10:56,00:11:00,"People who are using it way, way, way too much, they're at the far end, that end,"
00:11:00,00:11:04,"they tend to be, you know, have much more anxiety, more unhappiness."
00:11:04,00:11:07,"But also people who are at the other end, same thing."
00:11:07,00:11:10,"You know, people aren't really using social media at all, like me."
00:11:10,00:11:13,"In fact, that's why I'm so chronically depressed all the time."
00:11:13,00:11:16,"Then they're also more likely to be unhappy, which makes sense."
00:11:16,00:11:20,"If you're in your teenage years, then that's how all your friends are communicating."
00:11:20,00:11:22,And then you're kind of excluded from it.
00:11:22,00:11:27,There's a very good Washington Post piece about parents who restrict their kids from having phones.
00:11:27,00:11:31,And it's a really weird piece because I think it's meant to be about how phones are bad for
00:11:31,00:11:33,teenagers and it's great to restrict them.
00:11:33,00:11:37,"But all the kids interviewed say, ""It's horrible."
00:11:37,00:11:39,I can't communicate with my friends.
00:11:39,00:11:41,I don't know what kind of plans they're making.
00:11:41,00:11:44,"There are a lot of conversations at school, which spring from things that I don't know about"
00:11:44,00:11:46,"because I'm not on any of the chats."""
00:11:46,00:11:47,I think they're at the same pace.
00:11:47,00:11:49,I think they were a bit more equivocal.
00:11:49,00:11:52,They said they could see a couple of advantages to it as well.
00:11:52,00:11:54,"At the end of the piece, it rounded up with one of the girls saying,"
00:11:54,00:11:57,"""Yeah, I guess it'll be okay. I won't regret it in the end."""
00:11:57,00:11:59,But you can't do it in isolation.
00:11:59,00:12:04,"Right. So the real question is, if your entire school didn't have a phone,"
00:12:04,00:12:08,"your entire friend's circle and your family, how would your life be different?"
00:12:08,00:12:08,Yeah.
00:12:08,00:12:13,"So you can't, but if you're turning these children who don't use their phones into pariahs,"
00:12:13,00:12:13,of course I'm not.
00:12:13,00:12:14,"Yeah, exactly."
00:12:14,00:12:15,They use their phones.
00:12:15,00:12:18,"I know. Well, we're trapped, aren't we?"
00:12:18,00:12:21,That's why my friend wanted to do this experiment.
00:12:21,00:12:28,He wanted to take entire towns and make them smartphone-free zones and see what happens.
00:12:28,00:12:29,That's a fun idea.
00:12:29,00:12:29,Yeah.
00:12:29,00:12:33,Okay. If you're listening and you live in a small town or a village
00:12:33,00:12:37,"and you think you'd all be up for it, contact us."
00:12:37,00:12:38,We'll pass it on to Malcolm.
00:12:38,00:12:41,We'll pass it on to his friend and we'll get it going.
00:12:41,00:12:43,"Okay. Well, I did find one other thing which I quite like."
00:12:43,00:12:46,This is about injuries that mobile phone users suffer.
00:12:46,00:12:49,This is actual measurable physical harm suffered.
00:12:49,00:12:55,Injuries experienced by mobile phone users due to their phones are sought over the last 20 years.
00:12:55,00:12:57,"Obviously, because 20 years ago,"
00:12:57,00:12:58,people didn't have nearly as many phones.
00:12:58,00:13:06,"But between 1998 and 2017, apparently 76,000 Americans were injured in some way by their phones."
00:13:06,00:13:11,60% of younger people said they dropped their phone on their own face
00:13:11,00:13:13,while lying down and looking at it.
00:13:13,00:13:14,"Oh, yeah. That'll happen."
00:13:14,00:13:15,Yeah. Okay. Two in that.
00:13:15,00:13:16,"Yes, isn't it?"
00:13:16,00:13:20,And the other thing is sometimes children will have a phone dropped on them by their parents.
00:13:20,00:13:22,You could be injured by that.
00:13:22,00:13:24,How heavy are these phones?
00:13:24,00:13:26,"Well, I guess the child could be a small child,"
00:13:26,00:13:29,a big old 1980s style car phone.
00:13:29,00:13:30,"Yeah, yeah."
00:13:30,00:13:31,It's a recipe for disaster.
00:13:31,00:13:33,"Okay, it might be not that."
00:13:33,00:13:34,Yeah. Yeah.
00:13:34,00:13:37,"But it's, you know, there's peril there."
00:13:37,00:13:41,Were there injuries in earlier generations from books being dropped on children's heads?
00:13:41,00:13:43,"I mean, I need a control here."
00:13:43,00:13:44,Printing dresses.
00:13:44,00:13:48,"You know, big fat Grimm's fairy tales."
00:13:48,00:13:49,"Yeah, absolutely."
00:13:49,00:13:50,Dropped on a three-year-old's head.
00:13:56,00:14:00,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is Andy."
00:14:00,00:14:07,"My fact is that in 1931, the USA launched an aircraft carrier which itself could fly."
00:14:07,00:14:08,Great stuff.
00:14:08,00:14:14,"Was it transported inside another bigger flying aircraft carrier, aircraft carrier?"
00:14:14,00:14:15,"Oh, wow, like a Russian doll."
00:14:15,00:14:17,"Sadly, it was not."
00:14:17,00:14:21,"No, that was a more Soviet thing, the Matroshka aircraft carrier, which did."
00:14:22,00:14:27,So this was an airship which the U.S. Navy launched in 1931.
00:14:27,00:14:30,"It was called the USS Akron, and it was an airship."
00:14:30,00:14:34,"So that's a ship with a rigid frame, so blimps."
00:14:34,00:14:37,"Like the Hindenburg, if you were picturing it slightly, right?"
00:14:37,00:14:39,"Yeah, yeah, it's an airship."
00:14:39,00:14:44,"Sorry, when you went for the description, I was just cutting out the middleman there."
00:14:44,00:14:44,"Yeah, yeah."
00:14:44,00:14:46,"Oh, I should also say where I got the fact."
00:14:46,00:14:49,"I've been listening to a podcast called Black Box Down, which is great."
00:14:49,00:14:54,"It's all about aviation, mishaps, and catastrophes, and everything in between."
00:14:54,00:15:02,"And so the Akron was this airship, and it was enormous, and it launched in 1931,"
00:15:02,00:15:08,"crashed in 1933, and the main selling feature of it, the thing that the Navy were interested in,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,was that it was designed to be able to carry small fighter planes.
00:15:11,00:15:16,"There were these planes called sparrow hawks, which were, I think, small,"
00:15:16,00:15:20,"I think they were bi-planes, but anyway, it could fit in at least three of them,"
00:15:20,00:15:22,and it was going to be redesigned so it could fit in five.
00:15:22,00:15:26,"And the idea was that the USS Akron would fly overhead, lower a little"
00:15:26,00:15:32,"hook from which the fighter plane is dangling, just retract the hook, plane flies off,"
00:15:32,00:15:35,"and you know, launches three of these planes, and then they fly back,"
00:15:35,00:15:40,"snag onto the hook once again, and are retracted into the belly of the airship."
00:15:40,00:15:42,"Do you think you have to be really good at those fairground games,"
00:15:42,00:15:44,where you hook a duck onto a stick?
00:15:44,00:15:47,"I imagine, yeah, it was quite a precise manoeuvre."
00:15:47,00:15:47,We did it work.
00:15:47,00:15:52,"So, it worked that it could deploy these planes."
00:15:52,00:15:58,"I think the hook facility did work, but there's a reason we're not using all these now,"
00:15:58,00:16:01,"basically, which is that the airships obviously went very far out of fashion."
00:16:01,00:16:04,"This lasted two years before it crashed, and it killed over 70 people,"
00:16:04,00:16:09,including one of the main advocates for airship development and expansion.
00:16:09,00:16:11,But it was the airship that didn't work.
00:16:11,00:16:13,"We all know the airships had a bit of a rough ride,"
00:16:13,00:16:16,but the actual aircraft carrier element was quite good.
00:16:16,00:16:17,"Yeah, that's what I mean."
00:16:17,00:16:18,It worked.
00:16:18,00:16:25,I'm struck by the fact that the chief proponent for airships dies in the destruction of the airship
00:16:25,00:16:29,as a kind of model for dealing with bad inventors.
00:16:29,00:16:32,It's the captain goes down with the ship model of us.
00:16:32,00:16:34,"Yeah, it is."
00:16:34,00:16:35,"Yeah, it really was, yeah, yeah."
00:16:35,00:16:37,But we still make ships after he dies.
00:16:37,00:16:38,"You know, this is a..."
00:16:38,00:16:42,"So, imagine, there's a famous Dick Gregory joke."
00:16:42,00:16:43,I'm now obsessed with Dick Gregory.
00:16:43,00:16:44,Are you?
00:16:44,00:16:44,I am.
00:16:44,00:16:45,He's amazing.
00:16:45,00:16:46,He's such an extraordinary character.
00:16:46,00:16:48,"He talks about when he was in the army,"
00:16:48,00:16:51,he lost his rifle and they charged him $85.
00:16:51,00:16:53,"He said, ""I had no idea they were going to charge me."
00:16:53,00:16:55,"Now I know why the captain goes down with the ship."""
00:16:55,00:16:59,That's great.
00:16:59,00:17:01,"It was like the Segway guy, wasn't it?"
00:17:01,00:17:02,Yeah.
00:17:02,00:17:03,That's the modern day.
00:17:03,00:17:07,"You know, the guy who invented the Segway went over a cliff on his Segway, didn't he?"
00:17:07,00:17:07,"Sorry, I thought..."
00:17:07,00:17:11,Was it the inventor or the head of one of the big Segway companies?
00:17:11,00:17:11,The head of one of the companies.
00:17:11,00:17:12,I don't think it was the actual invention.
00:17:12,00:17:13,Was it not?
00:17:13,00:17:14,I always thought it was the actual invention.
00:17:14,00:17:16,"God, I was mishearing the word ""Segway."""
00:17:16,00:17:19,"I really thought you were going to say that we had, you know,"
00:17:19,00:17:21,"an inventor of the Segway, the conversational Segway."
00:17:21,00:17:22,The conversational Segway.
00:17:22,00:17:24,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:17:24,00:17:25,"Shakespeare, actually."
00:17:25,00:17:27,He died halfway through trying to change the topic.
00:17:27,00:17:31,He was impaled on a tangent.
00:17:31,00:17:37,"So, just one other thing about the acrobat."
00:17:37,00:17:40,"One of the other features it had, and it wasn't unique to it,"
00:17:40,00:17:42,this was actually a thing that had been invented a couple of decades before
00:17:42,00:17:43,on other airships.
00:17:43,00:17:45,It had a spy basket.
00:17:45,00:17:48,"I don't know if you guys read about this, but it's an observation basket"
00:17:48,00:17:51,that hangs beneath the body of the airship.
00:17:51,00:17:54,"And the principle was, as you're flying your airship,"
00:17:54,00:17:56,you want to be observing the ground but discreetly.
00:17:56,00:17:58,Airships are obviously huge.
00:17:58,00:18:01,"So the idea was you'd hide the airship in a cloud,"
00:18:01,00:18:07,"lower the spy basket on a cable for several hundred meters in some cases,"
00:18:07,00:18:11,"and there is someone sitting in the spy basket who watches the ground,"
00:18:11,00:18:15,"can radio back up, tell the airship itself where to go,"
00:18:15,00:18:17,or whether they're nearing the target or whatever.
00:18:17,00:18:17,Fun.
00:18:17,00:18:21,"And the acrobat had one of these, and it was a disaster."
00:18:21,00:18:24,It was tested once with sandbags in it instead of a person.
00:18:24,00:18:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:18:25,00:18:25,"But, you know..."
00:18:25,00:18:26,"Well, no wonder it was a disaster."
00:18:26,00:18:27,What can sandbags tell you?
00:18:27,00:18:34,"It was so unstable, this little observation basket,"
00:18:34,00:18:37,that it started swaying in the wind on this great long cable.
00:18:37,00:18:40,It swayed so much that it swayed up to the equator level
00:18:40,00:18:41,of the entire airship.
00:18:41,00:18:42,"Oh, my God."
00:18:42,00:18:47,"So, you know, thank God no one was actually in it, because it was..."
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Oh, that would be fun."
00:18:48,00:18:51,"That would be like that ride at theme parks or on the boat, on the pirate ship."
00:18:51,00:18:52,"Absolutely, yeah."
00:18:52,00:18:54,"It would have really, really given some of the best time."
00:18:54,00:18:57,I'm more fascinated that they were hiding in clouds.
00:18:57,00:18:59,Because what is the speed of a cloud?
00:18:59,00:19:01,"Like, you'd have to maintain the speed, right?"
00:19:01,00:19:03,So you don't pop out on the other side.
00:19:03,00:19:04,"You could also go with the cloud, as in..."
00:19:04,00:19:05,"You'd have to, yeah."
00:19:05,00:19:07,The cloud might not be flying towards your bombing target.
00:19:07,00:19:09,"Yeah, exactly."
00:19:09,00:19:11,"Well, we had the bombs somewhere different today."
00:19:11,00:19:13,"Clouds again, you know."
00:19:13,00:19:15,"It only works in over-cloudy areas, too, right?"
00:19:15,00:19:20,"So you're limited to military operations in Northern Europe,"
00:19:20,00:19:22,"in, you know, parts of, you know..."
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Yeah, yeah."
00:19:23,00:19:23,"Here's the thing, though."
00:19:23,00:19:27,"Manchester, if you really can't do this out in England that much."
00:19:27,00:19:30,Why not just disguise the blimp as a cloud?
00:19:30,00:19:30,Why not just put...
00:19:30,00:19:31,"Oh, that's a better idea, yeah."
00:19:31,00:19:32,"Well, it's actually a comfortable world."
00:19:32,00:19:34,"Yeah, it's a comfortable world."
00:19:34,00:19:35,Candy floss.
00:19:35,00:19:37,"And then there's your fairground ride, as I did."
00:19:37,00:19:41,"It's all... It springs up, speaking of impaling myself on a tangent."
00:19:41,00:19:43,Why do the internet people call the place
00:19:43,00:19:47,where they store all your most valuable knowledge and data?
00:19:47,00:19:47,The cloud.
00:19:47,00:19:51,"Of all of the metaphors, this is the worst."
00:19:51,00:19:52,You're right.
00:19:52,00:19:53,Yes.
00:19:53,00:19:54,A cloud is a flighty thing.
00:19:54,00:19:56,Planes fly through them all the time.
00:19:56,00:20:00,Clouds are routinely violated by any other thing in the air.
00:20:00,00:20:01,They're totally ephemeral.
00:20:01,00:20:03,They are totally ephemeral.
00:20:03,00:20:03,That's the thing...
00:20:03,00:20:05,We're going to call it a cloud.
00:20:05,00:20:07,They're all around a table.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"They're saying, ""What's the metaphor we want?"
00:20:09,00:20:11,"For the safe place we put your data?"""
00:20:11,00:20:14,Somebody says...
00:20:14,00:20:15,A bank?
00:20:15,00:20:16,No.
00:20:16,00:20:18,"Someone says, ""Who now regrets that?"""
00:20:18,00:20:20,Who is now among the group?
00:20:20,00:20:21,Who's like...
00:20:21,00:20:21,Yeah.
00:20:21,00:20:22,"God, I called it the cloud."
00:20:22,00:20:23,He's giving it to you.
00:20:23,00:20:25,I should have called it the paper bag like I wanted to.
00:20:25,00:20:28,I'm not involved.
00:20:28,00:20:30,"I mean, it's just unbelievable."
00:20:30,00:20:31,You're so right.
00:20:31,00:20:31,They're flimsy.
00:20:31,00:20:33,They've got negative connotations.
00:20:33,00:20:34,They're very temporary.
00:20:34,00:20:35,No one likes them.
00:20:35,00:20:36,No one.
00:20:36,00:20:40,"Yeah, thank God it's a cloudy day."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"I was looking at military planes, generally,"
00:20:43,00:20:46,and sort of air squadrons.
00:20:46,00:20:49,And I don't think we've talked about the Soviet night witches
00:20:49,00:20:50,ever on this show.
00:20:50,00:20:53,But do you guys know about these?
00:20:53,00:20:56,They were a all-female air squadron in World War II.
00:20:56,00:20:57,And they...
00:20:57,00:21:00,"I think it was one woman who, you know,"
00:21:00,00:21:02,"sort of pitched to the Soviet government and said,"
00:21:02,00:21:04,"""Look, lettuce flies in planes."""
00:21:04,00:21:06,They flew these incredibly light planes.
00:21:06,00:21:08,"So they were made to fly very, very low."
00:21:08,00:21:09,So it's quite dangerous.
00:21:09,00:21:11,They were made of just plywood and canvas.
00:21:11,00:21:13,They had to be so light.
00:21:13,00:21:15,So they couldn't have any armor.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"They couldn't have any parachutes, anything like that."
00:21:17,00:21:20,These women literally just took a map and a compass
00:21:20,00:21:21,up in these planes.
00:21:21,00:21:23,And the key and the reason they had to be so light
00:21:23,00:21:26,"was because they could stall, I think,"
00:21:26,00:21:28,quite a long way from their target
00:21:28,00:21:30,"and sort of drift close to the target,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,which meant that they were very quiet.
00:21:32,00:21:33,Wow.
00:21:33,00:21:34,But what are they...
00:21:34,00:21:35,"Sorry, are they fighter planes?"
00:21:35,00:21:36,Are they bomber planes?
00:21:36,00:21:37,"Bomber planes, yeah."
00:21:37,00:21:39,Couldn't be a bomber plane if they're incredibly light.
00:21:39,00:21:41,"Yeah, I mean, not letting them have a parachute,"
00:21:41,00:21:42,but they're also...
00:21:42,00:21:42,You're right.
00:21:42,00:21:45,"They didn't carry bombs, so there was some weight."
00:21:45,00:21:46,"The parachute, I'm afraid,"
00:21:46,00:21:47,is just going to take the side of the edge.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Very light bombs.
00:21:48,00:21:51,Could you have one bomb fewer and give me a parachute?
00:21:51,00:21:52,Would that be...
00:21:52,00:21:53,Bombs made of feathers.
00:21:53,00:21:55,"And completely harmless bombs, actually."
00:21:55,00:21:56,Wow.
00:21:56,00:21:58,"I know, they dropped 23,000 tons of bombs in the war."
00:21:58,00:21:59,Goodness.
00:21:59,00:22:02,"The weird thing is, their name, The Night Witches,"
00:22:02,00:22:03,"as far as I can tell, and all the sources,"
00:22:03,00:22:05,"even back to the time, say this,"
00:22:05,00:22:09,"they were named The Night Witches by the Germans,"
00:22:09,00:22:10,the Naxahexen.
00:22:10,00:22:13,"And apparently, they named them that"
00:22:13,00:22:15,because of the sound they made.
00:22:15,00:22:16,"Because they were so quiet,"
00:22:16,00:22:19,"they just sounded whooshing, like a broomstick."
00:22:19,00:22:21,"So apparently, we are to believe"
00:22:21,00:22:23,that they weren't actually called The Night Witches
00:22:23,00:22:24,because of their gender.
00:22:24,00:22:26,That's a complete coincidence.
00:22:26,00:22:26,Isn't that weird?
00:22:26,00:22:28,"Come on, that's like when Jay-Z said,"
00:22:28,00:22:31,"in 99 problems that a bitch ain't one,"
00:22:31,00:22:32,was about his dog.
00:22:32,00:22:35,"Like, it's not really with that."
00:22:35,00:22:36,Did he claim that?
00:22:36,00:22:39,"Well, you know, I got 99 problems with that."
00:22:39,00:22:40,"No, I know the line, but I just haven't heard that."
00:22:40,00:22:41,"He came out and said,"
00:22:41,00:22:43,"""No, it's not about women, it's about my dog."""
00:22:43,00:22:45,"Yeah, sure, Jay-Z."
00:22:45,00:22:49,I guess the difference between Jay-Z and the Nazis here
00:22:49,00:22:50,is that it does make sense
00:22:50,00:22:52,because the Nazis couldn't see into the plane.
00:22:52,00:22:54,So how would they have known that there were women flying them?
00:22:54,00:22:56,The Nazis call them The Night Witches.
00:22:56,00:23:00,"Yeah, they named them the sound they made swooping over."
00:23:00,00:23:02,And they also must have been so uncomfortable.
00:23:02,00:23:03,They had to wear men's clothes
00:23:03,00:23:06,because they didn't have any pilot clothes for women.
00:23:06,00:23:07,"Apparently, they tore up their bedding"
00:23:07,00:23:09,and stuffed it into the shoes they wore
00:23:09,00:23:10,so they would fit.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"What? Oh, wow."
00:23:11,00:23:11,Yeah.
00:23:11,00:23:16,"I mean, it's hard enough driving a car in Wellington boots, but..."
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Well, firstly, we have to ask about that."
00:23:17,00:23:21,"You know, if you're trying to drive a sensitive instrument"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"in not very comfortable shoes,"
00:23:23,00:23:24,I'm surprised they managed to get anything done.
00:23:24,00:23:25,"Yeah, true."
00:23:25,00:23:27,"Anna, when did you last drive your car in Wellies?"
00:23:27,00:23:27,Because I feel like...
00:23:27,00:23:29,"Hi, I love it."
00:23:29,00:23:31,The one detail in this story that you're drawn to
00:23:31,00:23:33,is the fact that they didn't have comfortable shoes.
00:23:33,00:23:37,"I would imagine in the list of problems these women have,"
00:23:37,00:23:39,"flying over enemy territory,"
00:23:39,00:23:42,"blowing the ground in flimsy, canvas airplanes."
00:23:42,00:23:50,"Chances of being killed gruesomely, first problem,"
00:23:50,00:23:51,"big shoe, second problem."
00:23:51,00:23:53,I think I don't actually do understand that
00:23:53,00:23:55,"because you know when you're meant to have a bigger problem,"
00:23:55,00:23:56,but you can only focus on the fact
00:23:56,00:23:58,you've got a stone in your shoe or something
00:23:58,00:24:00,and that dominates your attention.
00:24:00,00:24:01,I'm very familiar with the sense
00:24:01,00:24:02,"of having much bigger problems,"
00:24:02,00:24:03,but actually only able to focus on the fact
00:24:03,00:24:05,there's one little thing that's wrong
00:24:05,00:24:06,as a distraction method.
00:24:06,00:24:10,"When I was doing the Bara Mafia, the book that I'm..."
00:24:10,00:24:13,One of the things that I was struck by all over again
00:24:13,00:24:17,is what these pilots went through in the Second World War
00:24:17,00:24:21,"is just, in retrospect, completely unbelievable."
00:24:21,00:24:22,What we asked them to do.
00:24:22,00:24:23,Like...
00:24:23,00:24:25,"What do you mean, the danger or the discomfort?"
00:24:25,00:24:26,But don't just say that.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"You take a 20-year-old kid,"
00:24:29,00:24:34,"you put him through X number of months of training,"
00:24:34,00:24:36,"you fly him over to, if he's an American,"
00:24:36,00:24:37,"fly him over to Europe,"
00:24:37,00:24:40,"and he goes on these missions where statistically,"
00:24:40,00:24:45,"the chance of you surviving your term, your tour, is zero."
00:24:45,00:24:47,"They know the death rates, right?"
00:24:47,00:24:47,They're...
00:24:47,00:24:51,"And you're up at 20,000 feet where it's freezing cold"
00:24:51,00:24:54,and these planes are not pressurized
00:24:54,00:24:56,or heated or you're...
00:24:56,00:25:00,The bombardier is sitting in this little thing
00:25:00,00:25:01,that's exposed to...
00:25:01,00:25:04,And German fighters are coming at...
00:25:04,00:25:05,"I mean, it's just like that,"
00:25:05,00:25:07,that they all didn't have PTSD is astonishing to me.
00:25:07,00:25:14,And then you do a 12-hour whatever mission over Germany.
00:25:14,00:25:16,"You fly back to some freezing cold,"
00:25:16,00:25:20,unheated air base in the South of England.
00:25:20,00:25:22,You get four hours of sleep and then you do it again.
00:25:23,00:25:24,And you keep doing it for like...
00:25:24,00:25:27,"I mean, it's just like insane to me that this..."
00:25:27,00:25:29,This is what we...
00:25:29,00:25:33,"I mean, maybe only a 20-year-old would put up with that kind of..."
00:25:33,00:25:37,"I mean, that was the reason."
00:25:37,00:25:39,"But planes, the importance that planes had,"
00:25:39,00:25:42,"particularly in World War II, it's pretty staggering."
00:25:42,00:25:45,"So at one point during 1939 to 1945,"
00:25:45,00:25:51,"ally factories were building 633,000 aircraft in that time."
00:25:51,00:25:54,So they were pumping them out at 288 aircraft per day.
00:25:54,00:25:58,And this was a time where they were just trying to work out
00:25:58,00:26:01,how do we come up with a new kind of plane
00:26:01,00:26:03,that's going to just be the game changer in this war.
00:26:03,00:26:05,"So in this period as well,"
00:26:05,00:26:09,"250 new designs were all tested, built and flown,"
00:26:09,00:26:13,just to see whether or not they could get one over on the enemy.
00:26:13,00:26:14,"And it was one plane in particular,"
00:26:14,00:26:16,"which was the P-51 Mustang,"
00:26:16,00:26:19,which was the absolute game changer during war.
00:26:19,00:26:21,"When that was designed and started flying,"
00:26:21,00:26:23,"the Americans started flying that in over Germany,"
00:26:23,00:26:26,that was the moment where basically the Germans realized
00:26:26,00:26:28,they were going to lose the war.
00:26:28,00:26:29,"Göring said himself, he said,"
00:26:29,00:26:32,"""When I saw the Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up."""
00:26:32,00:26:34,He never...
00:26:34,00:26:36,"Göring did not say the phrase, the jig was up."
00:26:36,00:26:37,He did it.
00:26:37,00:26:39,"He wouldn't have known the phrase, the jig is up."
00:26:39,00:26:42,"He did, he said, ""Otto Spaghetti Ol'."""
00:26:42,00:26:46,He really did.
00:26:46,00:26:48,Have you been going right until he said that?
00:26:48,00:26:50,He had a quirky turn of phrase.
00:26:50,00:26:50,Clearly.
00:26:50,00:26:54,I'm speaking of Göring in World War II.
00:26:54,00:26:55,He said he's a real great guy.
00:26:55,00:26:56,"Once again, impaling ourselves on a tin."
00:26:56,00:26:59,He had a quid for every time you'd said that.
00:26:59,00:27:01,The only person I know about.
00:27:01,00:27:04,One of the RAF raids in World War II
00:27:04,00:27:06,was specifically for the intention
00:27:06,00:27:07,of interrupting one of his speeches.
00:27:07,00:27:09,So it wasn't necessary to do any bombing or anything.
00:27:09,00:27:10,"This is in 1943,"
00:27:10,00:27:12,and it was a huge speech in Berlin
00:27:12,00:27:14,to commemorate 10 years of Hitler being in power.
00:27:14,00:27:17,And Göring was going to make this big keynote speech.
00:27:17,00:27:20,And the plan was to fly a bunch of mosquitoes
00:27:20,00:27:21,"through the clouds above,"
00:27:21,00:27:23,"really, really near to their microphones."
00:27:23,00:27:25,"So that basically, while the speech was being broadcast,"
00:27:25,00:27:27,it would pick up the sound of the RAF
00:27:27,00:27:29,sort of attacking the city.
00:27:29,00:27:30,That's kind of genius.
00:27:30,00:27:31,"This is clever, isn't it?"
00:27:31,00:27:32,And it works.
00:27:32,00:27:35,"Mosquitoes, unbelievable planes."
00:27:35,00:27:36,"We should say they were made of plywood,"
00:27:36,00:27:39,and they were made largely by carpenters in England.
00:27:39,00:27:40,"Yeah, yeah."
00:27:40,00:27:42,That's actually what pissed him off so much.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"When this happened, and they had to cut off his speech,"
00:27:44,00:27:46,because they thought this sounds really bad now.
00:27:46,00:27:47,He's shouting over invasion.
00:27:47,00:27:49,"You know, he said something like,"
00:27:49,00:27:50,"""I can't believe these bloody Brits"
00:27:50,00:27:52,"have got seven carpenters,"
00:27:52,00:27:54,"and they've pieced these planes together out of some trees,"
00:27:54,00:27:56,"and we can't do anything like it."""
00:27:56,00:27:58,But yeah.
00:27:58,00:27:59,"Did he say anything about the jig,"
00:27:59,00:28:01,and where he thought it might be?
00:28:01,00:28:02,"Once again, the jig is up."
00:28:02,00:28:06,It's like a Scooby-Doo film.
00:28:06,00:28:08,Stop trying to make the jig work.
00:28:08,00:28:11,"I read this other thing as well,"
00:28:11,00:28:14,just going back to psychology of the pilots
00:28:14,00:28:15,that were being used.
00:28:15,00:28:16,There was a series of spy planes.
00:28:16,00:28:18,"This is in the '60s, this is a bit later."
00:28:18,00:28:21,"The Blackbird, which we've spoken about before on the show,"
00:28:21,00:28:26,"and the A-12, these were all high-flying spy planes"
00:28:26,00:28:28,"that they really, really didn't tell many people about."
00:28:28,00:28:29,"And there's a rumor that went around,"
00:28:29,00:28:32,which quite a few historians have substantiated
00:28:32,00:28:33,"and said was true,"
00:28:33,00:28:34,"is that during the interview process,"
00:28:34,00:28:37,they would only hire pilots who were married
00:28:37,00:28:41,"so that they had a reason to come back,"
00:28:41,00:28:44,because they had had a bunch of defectors at this point.
00:28:44,00:28:47,This is a very positive attitude towards marriage.
00:28:47,00:28:51,You could have easily spent it the other way.
00:28:51,00:29:00,"Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:29:00,00:29:01,and that is my fact.
00:29:01,00:29:05,My fact this week is that there is a marathon in New York
00:29:05,00:29:06,"that takes so long to complete,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,runners can go through up to 20 pairs of shoes
00:29:09,00:29:10,while they're trying to run it.
00:29:10,00:29:13,"And they're all too big for them, aren't they?"
00:29:13,00:29:14,They are stuffed with anything.
00:29:14,00:29:15,"They're all they could think about, yeah."
00:29:15,00:29:20,"This is an amazing thing, and Malcolm, you're a New Yorker,"
00:29:20,00:29:23,so I wonder if you had ever heard of this.
00:29:23,00:29:24,"I have, I have."
00:29:24,00:29:25,"And you're a runner, aren't you?"
00:29:25,00:29:30,"And a runner, so the self-transcendence 3,100-mile race,"
00:29:30,00:29:34,it's a race that goes around a single block in New York.
00:29:34,00:29:37,"So in total, if you ran around this block distance,"
00:29:37,00:29:39,"it's 0.54 miles, right?"
00:29:39,00:29:40,Okay.
00:29:40,00:29:41,"But to complete this marathon,"
00:29:41,00:29:45,"you need to run around this block 5,649 times."
00:29:45,00:29:48,"You've got 52 days in which to complete it,"
00:29:48,00:29:50,"and runners will start at 6 a.m.,"
00:29:50,00:29:52,and they'll run all the way through to midnight.
00:29:52,00:29:54,"They'll do an average of 59 kilometers,"
00:29:54,00:29:57,59 and a half kilometers per day.
00:29:57,00:29:59,And if you manage to complete
00:29:59,00:30:02,"what is the longest certified marathon in the world,"
00:30:02,00:30:04,"you get an amazing prize,"
00:30:04,00:30:07,which is usually either a DVD or a t-shirt.
00:30:07,00:30:09,Sometimes a small trophy.
00:30:09,00:30:09,What DVD?
00:30:10,00:30:11,Depends on the movie.
00:30:11,00:30:15,"Yeah, this is incredible."
00:30:15,00:30:16,"Malcolm, have you ever..."
00:30:16,00:30:17,Been tempted to do that?
00:30:17,00:30:19,Is that your question?
00:30:19,00:30:21,Have you been to the route?
00:30:21,00:30:22,Because it's just one block in New York City.
00:30:22,00:30:24,"It's one block in Queens, I think."
00:30:24,00:30:25,"It is in Queens, yes."
00:30:25,00:30:25,That's right.
00:30:25,00:30:28,A lot of strange things happen in Queens.
00:30:28,00:30:30,"Dad, chief among them."
00:30:30,00:30:32,"It's lunacy, let's be clear."
00:30:32,00:30:35,Even the normal marathon is lunacy.
00:30:35,00:30:36,Right.
00:30:36,00:30:37,I've never done a marathon.
00:30:37,00:30:38,Have you done a marathon before?
00:30:38,00:30:38,I would never.
00:30:38,00:30:39,It's nuts.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"I mean, there's no part of it."
00:30:41,00:30:45,"Some random Greek, you know, thousands of years ago,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"completes this distance, dies at the end."
00:30:47,00:30:50,And then that...
00:30:50,00:30:52,We've seized on this as the kind of ultimate running experience.
00:30:52,00:30:55,Every thing about marathoning strikes me.
00:30:55,00:30:57,"I mean, I'm a very, very serious runner."
00:30:57,00:31:01,I just find it incomprehensible that anyone other than
00:31:01,00:31:04,a kind of elite runner would ever even attempt it.
00:31:04,00:31:05,"So when you say you're a serious runner,"
00:31:05,00:31:08,do you do short distance sprinting runners?
00:31:08,00:31:10,"Normal, I run, you know, if I race,"
00:31:10,00:31:12,I run 5Ks or 10Ks or miles.
00:31:12,00:31:16,"But the idea of going out there for hours on end,"
00:31:16,00:31:18,"inevitably injuring myself while preparing for it,"
00:31:18,00:31:21,and sacrificing huge parts of my life
00:31:21,00:31:24,so I can go for 20 mile runs on the weekend.
00:31:24,00:31:24,"You know, it's just like..."
00:31:24,00:31:25,"Yeah, it's very interesting."
00:31:25,00:31:28,"Because I don't really run very much,"
00:31:28,00:31:31,"but I do think of running as a progression towards the marathon,"
00:31:31,00:31:33,"which I have stopped at a very early point in,"
00:31:33,00:31:34,as in I don't...
00:31:34,00:31:37,I'm not making any more progress towards a marathon
00:31:37,00:31:38,in the distances I run.
00:31:38,00:31:40,But you think of the marathon as the end goal...
00:31:40,00:31:41,"Sort of, yeah."
00:31:41,00:31:43,"As you know, you do a 5K and then you do a 10K run,"
00:31:43,00:31:44,and then eventually you'll do a marathon.
00:31:44,00:31:47,"Or you run 3,000 miles around a single block."
00:31:47,00:31:50,It is insane.
00:31:50,00:31:51,It's not like they shut it...
00:31:51,00:31:54,"Because I've been in New York when there's a marathon on,"
00:31:54,00:31:55,"and obviously, like anywhere else,"
00:31:55,00:31:57,they shut the city roads down.
00:31:57,00:32:00,They have all sorts of people cheering on the sides.
00:32:00,00:32:02,These people just have to do it every day around New York.
00:32:02,00:32:03,Is someone checking them?
00:32:03,00:32:06,"I think so, yeah."
00:32:06,00:32:07,But it's a very low key.
00:32:07,00:32:12,There's basically a trestle table where the race headquarters is.
00:32:12,00:32:13,And I think it's just a couple of people.
00:32:13,00:32:14,"I don't know if they check the actual laps,"
00:32:14,00:32:16,or if they're tagged or...
00:32:16,00:32:16,How long is it last?
00:32:16,00:32:18,"52 days, so yeah, a couple of months."
00:32:18,00:32:22,So someone has to sit there from 6...
00:32:22,00:32:25,From 6 in the morning to midnight.
00:32:25,00:32:26,They're the real hero of the story.
00:32:26,00:32:28,They're the real hero of the story.
00:32:28,00:32:28,They feel like 2 days.
00:32:28,00:32:30,How many pairs of trousers do they get?
00:32:30,00:32:31,"Yeah, yeah."
00:32:31,00:32:34,"I bet they've watched that DVD a bunch in that time, right?"
00:32:34,00:32:36,I find that person more interested in the person doing the running.
00:32:36,00:32:37,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:32:37,00:32:40,Who is this person who can be convinced to take that job?
00:32:40,00:32:41,This is preposterous.
00:32:41,00:32:41,You're right.
00:32:41,00:32:43,interview that guy.
00:32:43,00:32:44,You're so right.
00:32:44,00:32:46,Do they ask him whether they're happily married?
00:32:46,00:32:48,This is an extension of the same...
00:32:48,00:32:50,Only married men can take this job.
00:32:50,00:32:54,You want to get away from the family for 52 days?
00:32:54,00:32:54,It is.
00:32:54,00:32:55,I think you need to sort of...
00:32:55,00:32:58,You need an ultra-running CV even to enter the race.
00:32:58,00:32:59,Really?
00:32:59,00:33:01,They don't just take any schlub who says...
00:33:01,00:33:03,"Who turns up and says, ""I reckon I could do it."""
00:33:03,00:33:06,Because I can easily see if I was ever a good enough runner
00:33:06,00:33:07,to even consider entering this.
00:33:07,00:33:09,I can see it getting a bit later.
00:33:09,00:33:10,"You're like, ""You miss a day."""
00:33:10,00:33:12,"You think, ""Oh, I'll catch up later."""
00:33:12,00:33:12,It's fine.
00:33:12,00:33:14,I've got 50 days to do it.
00:33:14,00:33:16,"How long can it be to just, you know?"
00:33:16,00:33:16,"Yeah, yeah."
00:33:16,00:33:20,My running friends and I have something we call the Kipchogi number.
00:33:20,00:33:22,Kipchogi being the world's greatest marathon.
00:33:22,00:33:22,Yeah.
00:33:22,00:33:27,The Kipchogi number is how long you could run with Kipchogi
00:33:27,00:33:30,if Kipchogi was running at world record pace.
00:33:30,00:33:30,Cool.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Right.
00:33:31,00:33:33,So everyone in the world has a Kipchogi number.
00:33:33,00:33:37,"Your Kipchogi number may be two feet, right?"
00:33:37,00:33:39,It's always...
00:33:39,00:33:42,The rule about Kipchogi numbers is they are shorter than you think.
00:33:42,00:33:44,How lot do you know what your Kipchogi number is?
00:33:44,00:33:46,My Kipchogi number is...
00:33:46,00:33:49,"If I'm very fit, it's probably 1200 meters."
00:33:49,00:33:50,That's decent.
00:33:50,00:33:51,That's pretty good.
00:33:51,00:33:54,I wish I had written this down related to this.
00:33:54,00:33:57,"So there's the 5K park run, which I think is 5K."
00:33:57,00:33:57,Park run is about...
00:33:57,00:33:59,It's a huge thing here.
00:33:59,00:34:02,Many hundreds of thousands of people have done it now.
00:34:02,00:34:05,And I think they looked at how many people over 5K
00:34:05,00:34:10,in the park run at their pace would have beaten Kipchogi
00:34:10,00:34:11,running his marathon pace.
00:34:11,00:34:14,So he was running that speed for 26 miles.
00:34:14,00:34:14,"Yeah, exactly."
00:34:14,00:34:15,And everyone...
00:34:15,00:34:15,"Okay, yeah, yeah."
00:34:15,00:34:18,And I think it's like fewer than 100 people
00:34:18,00:34:21,"are over that amount, over that distance."
00:34:21,00:34:22,They're seriously...
00:34:22,00:34:24,You'd be very good to even keep up with Kipchogi.
00:34:24,00:34:25,He's good.
00:34:25,00:34:28,But it's this thing...
00:34:28,00:34:28,It's not...
00:34:28,00:34:30,Because I was watching the marathon yesterday
00:34:30,00:34:31,at the World Championships.
00:34:31,00:34:34,You see these guys on the television
00:34:34,00:34:36,"and because they're all running at the same pace,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,there's an illusion that they're not running that fast.
00:34:39,00:34:40,"Right, yeah."
00:34:40,00:34:43,"But you have to understand if you actually see them in person,"
00:34:43,00:34:44,it is astonishing.
00:34:44,00:34:50,So they're running at 445 mile pace for 26 consecutive miles.
00:34:50,00:34:56,"So all this is to say, I don't lack respect for the achievement."
00:34:56,00:34:56,Yeah.
00:34:56,00:34:58,I just think trying to do it is for...
00:34:58,00:35:01,"If you're not a professional, it's foolishness."
00:35:01,00:35:02,I do always find it amazing how many people
00:35:02,00:35:04,they get to do the marathon each year.
00:35:04,00:35:06,So many thousands of people who are up for this.
00:35:06,00:35:07,I know.
00:35:07,00:35:07,Very difficult.
00:35:07,00:35:09,"Very difficult for you of masochism, yeah."
00:35:09,00:35:10,And probably not that good for you.
00:35:10,00:35:11,It's weird.
00:35:11,00:35:11,"Again, it's like..."
00:35:11,00:35:14,"You know, I was talking earlier about the Goldilocks,"
00:35:14,00:35:16,"like for social media, moderate use is good."
00:35:16,00:35:19,"Similarly, studies seem to show that moderate exercise,"
00:35:19,00:35:20,"very good for you, obviously."
00:35:20,00:35:23,"Extreme exercise, like ultramarathon running,"
00:35:23,00:35:24,doesn't seem to be that good for you.
00:35:24,00:35:26,It doesn't really confirm any more health benefits
00:35:26,00:35:28,if you're running extremely long distances.
00:35:28,00:35:31,And people do have these unbelievable hallucinations.
00:35:31,00:35:33,They often collapse.
00:35:33,00:35:34,I think there was...
00:35:34,00:35:36,Is this standard marathons you're talking about?
00:35:36,00:35:37,Usually more like ultramarathons.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"Ultramarathons, okay, yeah."
00:35:38,00:35:40,"So there was Jasmine Paris, you remember?"
00:35:40,00:35:42,She is a champion fell runner.
00:35:42,00:35:44,And she...
00:35:44,00:35:46,"Anyway, she won the 2019 Montaigne spy race,"
00:35:46,00:35:50,which is a big up and down kind of mountain ultramarathon.
00:35:50,00:35:53,And she saw lots of hallucinations and still...
00:35:53,00:35:54,But still managed to win it
00:35:54,00:35:56,"and was expressing breast milk along the way, I think."
00:35:56,00:35:57,Really?
00:35:57,00:36:00,"It's 268 miles, and she had a newborn baby."
00:36:00,00:36:01,Where was the baby?
00:36:01,00:36:01,As in...
00:36:01,00:36:05,"The baby was being run alongside her by her partner,"
00:36:05,00:36:07,who actually deserves more credit.
00:36:07,00:36:07,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:36:07,00:36:10,That's amazing.
00:36:10,00:36:10,We should say about...
00:36:10,00:36:13,This race is called the...
00:36:13,00:36:13,What is it called?
00:36:13,00:36:14,The...
00:36:14,00:36:15,Self-transcendence.
00:36:15,00:36:16,Self-transcendence.
00:36:16,00:36:17,Who does your tip off right there?
00:36:17,00:36:19,Yeah.
00:36:19,00:36:20,Don't transcend yourself.
00:36:20,00:36:21,Don't do it.
00:36:21,00:36:23,So we should say the guy who...
00:36:23,00:36:23,"Oh, yes."
00:36:23,00:36:25,It's founded in his name.
00:36:25,00:36:25,Yeah.
00:36:25,00:36:26,Sri Chimnai.
00:36:26,00:36:27,Yeah.
00:36:27,00:36:28,So he was a...
00:36:28,00:36:28,He's a guru.
00:36:28,00:36:28,Guru.
00:36:28,00:36:29,"He's a guru, yeah."
00:36:29,00:36:31,There are Sri Chimnai races around the world.
00:36:31,00:36:31,Yeah.
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:36:32,00:36:34,And he was extraordinary.
00:36:34,00:36:34,Yeah.
00:36:34,00:36:35,As in...
00:36:35,00:36:36,You read a bit about his life story.
00:36:36,00:36:39,So he expressed self-transcendence through fitness.
00:36:39,00:36:42,"And as a result, did all these, you know, amazing feats."
00:36:42,00:36:44,He lifted extraordinary weights and...
00:36:44,00:36:45,Plains.
00:36:45,00:36:46,"He lifted planes, supposedly."
00:36:46,00:36:47,I know.
00:36:47,00:36:47,I'm slight.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"Yeah, I can see..."
00:36:48,00:36:50,He was the original aircraft carrier.
00:36:50,00:36:50,He was.
00:36:50,00:36:53,But his really...
00:36:53,00:36:54,Like the funniest thing he did was called
00:36:54,00:36:56,"""Lifting Up the World with a Oneness Heart."""
00:36:56,00:36:58,"Okay, that's what it was called."
00:36:58,00:37:01,He went around the world bench pressing significant people.
00:37:01,00:37:01,Yeah.
00:37:01,00:37:04,Who've contributed to human history.
00:37:04,00:37:07,"So he lifted 8,000 people around the world."
00:37:07,00:37:09,He lifted Nelson Mandela.
00:37:09,00:37:09,Wow.
00:37:09,00:37:11,Desmond Tutu.
00:37:11,00:37:12,Billie Jean King.
00:37:12,00:37:15,"And then, I mean, it goes a bit like the list..."
00:37:15,00:37:16,Susan Sarandon.
00:37:16,00:37:16,"Oh, come on."
00:37:16,00:37:17,That's Eddie Murphy.
00:37:17,00:37:18,Nickname.
00:37:18,00:37:18,Eddie Murphy.
00:37:18,00:37:19,Eddie Murphy.
00:37:19,00:37:20,"Eddie Murphy, Yoko Rono."
00:37:20,00:37:21,Ravi Shankar.
00:37:21,00:37:22,Several heads of state.
00:37:22,00:37:23,Richard Gere.
00:37:23,00:37:24,Sting.
00:37:24,00:37:26,Jesse Jackson.
00:37:26,00:37:28,"He's a wrestler, former wrestler."
00:37:28,00:37:30,He's a biggie.
00:37:30,00:37:31,Jeff Goldblum.
00:37:31,00:37:32,Goldblum got a lift.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Goldblum got a lift.
00:37:33,00:37:33,Wow.
00:37:33,00:37:34,It just feels like a...
00:37:34,00:37:35,What a weird thing to do.
00:37:35,00:37:37,What a very strange club of people to get together.
00:37:37,00:37:41,"But one time, he lifted a Republican and a Democrat"
00:37:41,00:37:42,at the same time.
00:37:42,00:37:43,"Oh, really?"
00:37:43,00:37:45,"Yeah, just to express peace."
00:37:45,00:37:46,That is actually...
00:37:46,00:37:46,Yeah.
00:37:46,00:37:48,"That's cross-party, cross-island politics."
00:37:48,00:37:49,Where is he from?
00:37:49,00:37:52,"He was from India, I want to say."
00:37:52,00:37:53,I think he was.
00:37:53,00:37:53,Yeah.
00:37:53,00:37:56,"He worked for the Indian Consulate, certainly,"
00:37:56,00:37:56,when he was...
00:37:56,00:37:58,And that's why he moved to America.
00:37:58,00:38:00,So he moved there in 1964.
00:38:00,00:38:03,"And yeah, he was just an extraordinary, as you say,"
00:38:03,00:38:07,kind of fitness character with a huge fan base.
00:38:07,00:38:11,"Can I just quickly mention, I saw a photo of you,"
00:38:11,00:38:14,a sort of younger college version of you doing a run
00:38:14,00:38:15,on your blog.
00:38:15,00:38:18,"And you were doing an attempt at the four-minute mile,"
00:38:18,00:38:18,basically.
00:38:18,00:38:22,Or at least you were running a mile and you got a number.
00:38:22,00:38:23,That's close to it.
00:38:23,00:38:26,"Yeah, it was high school, early days of high school,"
00:38:26,00:38:27,and it was...
00:38:27,00:38:29,"I was running the 1500 meters, yes."
00:38:29,00:38:31,"But I was nowhere close to a four-minute mile,"
00:38:31,00:38:33,which is a grown-up activity.
00:38:33,00:38:37,I think I ran a four-oh-something 1500 meters.
00:38:37,00:38:38,"Oh, really?"
00:38:38,00:38:39,Very different.
00:38:39,00:38:41,"But not still, you got four-oh-something."
00:38:41,00:38:42,Four-oh-five.
00:38:42,00:38:44,And the 1500 meters.
00:38:44,00:38:45,"Yeah, I was 14."
00:38:45,00:38:46,"Yeah, that's pretty quick."
00:38:46,00:38:50,"I peaked as a runner at 14, which amazes me to this day"
00:38:50,00:38:52,when I think of the idea that there was something
00:38:52,00:38:55,"I could do at 14, which I can't do,"
00:38:55,00:38:57,which I could do better than at any other point in my life.
00:38:57,00:38:57,Yeah.
00:38:57,00:38:59,It's kind of strange to think of that.
00:38:59,00:39:00,"If only someone had told you then,"
00:39:00,00:39:02,so you could have appreciated it.
00:39:02,00:39:03,I'll stop.
00:39:03,00:39:04,"I'll stop, I'll give up."
00:39:04,00:39:05,Yeah.
00:39:05,00:39:06,That's right.
00:39:06,00:39:07,Yeah.
00:39:07,00:39:10,We've never mentioned Cliff Young.
00:39:10,00:39:11,Cliff Young?
00:39:11,00:39:12,Long...
00:39:12,00:39:12,He must have known Cliff...
00:39:12,00:39:14,"Australian hero, Cliff Young."
00:39:14,00:39:15,Never heard of him.
00:39:15,00:39:18,So he ran the Sydney to Melbourne Ultramarathon
00:39:18,00:39:19,"in its inaugural year, which was 1983."
00:39:19,00:39:20,Sydney to Melbourne.
00:39:20,00:39:22,"Yep, it's 875 kilometers."
00:39:22,00:39:23,Wow.
00:39:23,00:39:24,And he ran...
00:39:24,00:39:26,We traveled that journey and we flew.
00:39:26,00:39:26,So...
00:39:26,00:39:27,We did.
00:39:27,00:39:28,"Well, we had to get from one tour date"
00:39:28,00:39:29,"to the other quite quickly,"
00:39:29,00:39:32,so it wouldn't have been practical actually for us to run it.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Otherwise we would have.
00:39:33,00:39:37,"But anyway, so 1983, it's inaugurated."
00:39:37,00:39:40,The world's top runners go and say they'll try doing this run.
00:39:40,00:39:41,They've all got the training plan.
00:39:41,00:39:43,They've tried running those distances before.
00:39:43,00:39:45,And basically all the pros have established
00:39:45,00:39:47,that you run 18 hours a day
00:39:47,00:39:50,and you sleep for six hours a day
00:39:50,00:39:53,"and you'll do it in, I think, five, six, seven days,"
00:39:53,00:39:54,depending on how fast you go.
00:39:54,00:39:57,"And so they all turn up and this guy turns up,"
00:39:57,00:39:59,"who's a 61-year-old farmer called Cliff Young,"
00:39:59,00:40:02,and he's wearing his Wellington boots
00:40:02,00:40:04,and he's wearing like farming overalls.
00:40:04,00:40:05,"And just before he starts,"
00:40:05,00:40:08,he puts on the first ever pair of running shoes he's ever owned.
00:40:08,00:40:12,And he took out his teeth because...
00:40:12,00:40:13,Let's stop it.
00:40:13,00:40:15,They rattled when he ran.
00:40:15,00:40:16,"So it's just so Australian, right?"
00:40:16,00:40:20,(laughter)
00:40:20,00:40:24,And he put on his hat with the cork hanging down from it.
00:40:24,00:40:26,And he started...
00:40:26,00:40:29,"No, he started shuffling along incredibly slowly"
00:40:29,00:40:31,"and everyone, like, left him in their dusk completely."
00:40:31,00:40:32,Super slowly.
00:40:32,00:40:36,But he didn't sleep and he had a different strategy.
00:40:36,00:40:39,"He was a sheep farmer and he had 2,000 acres of land"
00:40:39,00:40:41,and he used to have to run across this land
00:40:41,00:40:42,"for days on end sometimes,"
00:40:42,00:40:43,"herding the sheep, chasing the sheep."
00:40:43,00:40:45,"And he thought, ""Well, I don't need to sleep"
00:40:45,00:40:47,"when I run that three, four days, I don't sleep."
00:40:47,00:40:48,"I'm just going to not sleep."""
00:40:48,00:40:50,"And eventually, day two, day three,"
00:40:50,00:40:51,started overtaking them all.
00:40:51,00:40:55,Are you sure you're not just telling us the hair and the tortoise story?
00:40:55,00:40:56,This is all feeding a bit east off.
00:40:56,00:40:58,This is all this whole...
00:40:58,00:41:00,"Cliff Young, the tortoise, the pet tortoise."
00:41:00,00:41:04,"No, it was incredible."
00:41:04,00:41:05,Where does he win?
00:41:05,00:41:06,He wins the race.
00:41:06,00:41:06,What?
00:41:06,00:41:08,He beats the nearest competitor by 10 hours.
00:41:08,00:41:13,"He's way, way, way ahead, 61 years old."
00:41:14,00:41:16,"And now, everyone does it his way,"
00:41:16,00:41:19,by sort of sleeping maybe one hour a night and shuffling.
00:41:19,00:41:20,Okay.
00:41:20,00:41:20,He's like...
00:41:20,00:41:21,You know what he's like?
00:41:21,00:41:25,"He's like, ""Do you remember David Burkhoff?"""
00:41:25,00:41:26,No.
00:41:26,00:41:30,"""Burkhoff"" is the Cliff Young of the backstroke."
00:41:30,00:41:30,"Oh, really?"
00:41:30,00:41:31,"Oh, yeah."
00:41:31,00:41:32,"You're in the backstroke, you jump off,"
00:41:32,00:41:35,you dive into the water and then you surface
00:41:35,00:41:36,"and you go, ""Whoop, whoop, whoop,"" right?"
00:41:36,00:41:37,Yeah.
00:41:37,00:41:39,"Burkhoff realizes, ""Oh, actually,"
00:41:39,00:41:42,"it's faster to swim underwater than on top."""
00:41:43,00:41:47,"So, Burkhoff starts, drives in and he doesn't surface"
00:41:47,00:41:49,until two-thirds of the way down.
00:41:49,00:41:50,"Yeah, right."
00:41:50,00:41:52,And he breaks the world record and they eventually ban it.
00:41:52,00:41:54,"Oh, my God, it does feel like cheating."
00:41:54,00:41:55,"He's Cliff Young, though."
00:41:55,00:41:59,He realizes that there's a flaw in the way people are...
00:41:59,00:41:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:59,00:42:02,"Hang on, can I just check about David Burkhoff?"
00:42:02,00:42:04,"So, you said that was backstroke, right?"
00:42:04,00:42:04,Backstroke.
00:42:04,00:42:08,"So, are you allowed to do another stroke underwater?"
00:42:08,00:42:08,No.
00:42:08,00:42:09,I could be wrong here.
00:42:09,00:42:10,I think you do a dolphin kick.
00:42:10,00:42:12,"You do the dolphin kick, yeah."
00:42:12,00:42:13,And then dolphin kick.
00:42:13,00:42:14,"But you're allowed to be on your front, aren't you?"
00:42:14,00:42:15,But you're allowed to be on your front.
00:42:15,00:42:16,You're not doing backstroke because you're on your back.
00:42:16,00:42:20,"No, no, backstroke, you start in the water and you go back."
00:42:20,00:42:20,Yeah.
00:42:20,00:42:21,"Oh, okay, okay."
00:42:21,00:42:23,"So, he just stays underwater doing a dolphin kick."
00:42:23,00:42:24,Upside down.
00:42:24,00:42:26,"Sorry, I got it, I got it."
00:42:26,00:42:27,And surfaces later.
00:42:27,00:42:28,It's called the Burkhoff blast off.
00:42:28,00:42:29,That's amazing.
00:42:29,00:42:30,It's not quicker.
00:42:30,00:42:32,I feel like I'd be really slow at that.
00:42:32,00:42:33,Why is it quicker?
00:42:33,00:42:34,I've never understood why it's quicker.
00:42:34,00:42:35,I don't know anything about swimming.
00:42:35,00:42:37,"Because you can't do it with your arms, can you?"
00:42:37,00:42:40,The up and down maneuvering must take a lot of the speed
00:42:40,00:42:41,out of your forwards.
00:42:41,00:42:41,Yeah.
00:42:41,00:42:46,But it's doing the dolphin kick is faster than doing the backstroke.
00:42:46,00:42:46,"Oh, I see."
00:42:46,00:42:47,It's the point of the backstroke.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:42:48,00:42:49,"Well, backstroke kicks."
00:42:49,00:42:52,"So, we do the backstroke to move more slowly through the water."
00:42:52,00:42:52,Is that what we do?
00:42:52,00:42:54,"Well, yeah, it's like butterfly."
00:42:54,00:42:55,What's the point of that?
00:42:55,00:42:57,"So, he basically made the sport unwatchable"
00:42:57,00:42:58,because you're just watching.
00:42:58,00:42:59,He did.
00:42:59,00:43:02,"Although, it's very thrilling to see where any surfaces."
00:43:02,00:43:06,"So, you're waiting, it turns it into a suspense film, right?"
00:43:06,00:43:08,"So, you watch it and you can't see anything."
00:43:08,00:43:12,It's just like the service of the water is unruffled.
00:43:12,00:43:14,We just see these strange things going on.
00:43:14,00:43:15,"All of a sudden, burkoff."
00:43:15,00:43:21,I could see it.
00:43:21,00:43:24,"I was, as a child, I was obsessed with burkoff."
00:43:24,00:43:26,He's this really brilliant guy.
00:43:26,00:43:28,But I just keep thinking he's going to do it again.
00:43:28,00:43:29,You know what I mean?
00:43:29,00:43:31,"Maybe he's an anesthesiologist and he's going to realize,"
00:43:31,00:43:33,"wait a minute, right?"
00:43:33,00:43:36,We don't have to keep them under for five minutes.
00:43:36,00:43:38,Keep them under for two hours.
00:43:38,00:43:39,He'll be very burkoff-y.
00:43:39,00:43:42,He doesn't give your prescription as a doctor
00:43:42,00:43:44,until you're in the car park going back to your car.
00:43:44,00:43:47,"And then he says, ""Take two of these days."""
00:43:47,00:43:49,Don't you want to be inside burkoff's brain?
00:43:49,00:43:50,"Yeah, burkoff's brain."
00:43:50,00:43:51,Yeah.
00:43:51,00:43:52,"Yeah, it's so funny."
00:43:52,00:43:54,Here's what I love about burkoff and Cliff Young.
00:43:54,00:43:58,It is that thousands of people do this thing
00:43:58,00:44:01,and it never occurs to them to tinker with that particular.
00:44:01,00:44:03,"So, on the ultramarathon,"
00:44:03,00:44:04,they're doing everything in their power
00:44:04,00:44:06,to compete and train.
00:44:06,00:44:09,"And it never occurs to them, ""Oh, what if I just slept?"""
00:44:09,00:44:10,"I know. It's amazing, isn't it?"
00:44:10,00:44:12,They're all like in lockstep.
00:44:12,00:44:14,Do they wake each other up before Cliff Young came along
00:44:14,00:44:15,"and is like, ""Ready to go now?"""
00:44:15,00:44:18,"Like, ""You're in a race?"""
00:44:18,00:44:18,"In a race, yeah."
00:44:18,00:44:20,It just seems crazy.
00:44:20,00:44:22,I know. It makes you think how many things
00:44:22,00:44:23,are we taking for granted
00:44:23,00:44:24,where we could be smashing it in life
00:44:24,00:44:26,because there's an obvious loophole.
00:44:26,00:44:27,"God, what a point."
00:44:27,00:44:28,What a terrifying point.
00:44:28,00:44:31,I could be way better at podcasting if I never slept.
00:44:31,00:44:31,For instance.
00:44:31,00:44:32,For instance.
00:44:32,00:44:33,Yeah.
00:44:33,00:44:34,Maybe. Or worse.
00:44:35,00:44:38,Tudin next week and find out how Anna's experiment went.
00:44:38,00:44:46,Okay. It is time for our final fact of the show
00:44:46,00:44:48,and that is Anna.
00:44:48,00:44:50,"My fact this week is that, given the choice,"
00:44:50,00:44:53,most people would prefer to win $10 million
00:44:53,00:44:55,rather than $100 billion.
00:44:55,00:44:59,"Right? And so, let's see here, guys."
00:44:59,00:45:00,I'm going to ask you all.
00:45:00,00:45:01,Yeah.
00:45:01,00:45:04,This was a University of Bath research
00:45:04,00:45:05,and it's published in Nature
00:45:05,00:45:08,"and it asks 8,000 people across 33 countries"
00:45:08,00:45:09,so it's quite comprehensive.
00:45:09,00:45:12,"And basically it said, ""Imagine your ideal life"
00:45:12,00:45:13,and then consider how much money you want
00:45:13,00:45:15,to lead that ideal life.
00:45:15,00:45:18,"And then you've got a lottery that you can enter."""
00:45:18,00:45:19,And you're going to win it.
00:45:19,00:45:20,You've got a bunch of lotteries
00:45:20,00:45:22,and you're probably going to win it.
00:45:22,00:45:23,And you've either got a lottery
00:45:23,00:45:26,"where the jackpot is $10,000."
00:45:26,00:45:27,So it's all American dollars
00:45:27,00:45:30,but they adjusted it for currencies in the countries.
00:45:30,00:45:32,"$10,000 and then it increased by multiples of 10."
00:45:32,00:45:35,"So you've got $10,000, $100,000, million, $10 million"
00:45:35,00:45:37,and the highest was $100 billion.
00:45:37,00:45:39,What would you guys go for?
00:45:39,00:45:41,$100 billion.
00:45:41,00:45:42,Okay. You'll just straight up $100 billion.
00:45:42,00:45:42,Yeah.
00:45:42,00:45:43,Welcome.
00:45:43,00:45:45,I totally agree. I $10 million.
00:45:45,00:45:47,You're going to get $10 million.
00:45:47,00:45:47,Really?
00:45:47,00:45:48,There you go.
00:45:48,00:45:50,The last thing you want to do is win $100 billion.
00:45:50,00:45:53,That is like a nightmare scenario.
00:45:53,00:45:53,Why?
00:45:53,00:45:56,Do you understand what would happen?
00:45:56,00:45:59,"Listen, if I had that money,"
00:45:59,00:46:01,I'd see you if you ever spoke to me like that
00:46:01,00:46:02,and then that time again.
00:46:02,00:46:05,Every single part of your life
00:46:05,00:46:08,gets more complicated by a thousand percent.
00:46:08,00:46:10,"Oh, look at yellow musk."
00:46:10,00:46:11,He's having a great time.
00:46:11,00:46:13,Accusing people of things online.
00:46:13,00:46:14,He can't walk down the street.
00:46:14,00:46:14,That's true.
00:46:14,00:46:17,But you can't do that if you're famous regardless.
00:46:17,00:46:19,He's digging his own tunnel
00:46:19,00:46:20,so he won't need to go down the street.
00:46:20,00:46:23,He'll be parachuted through a vacuum tube
00:46:23,00:46:24,along under the street.
00:46:24,00:46:27,We can say with 100% certainty
00:46:27,00:46:29,that you would be profoundly unhappy.
00:46:29,00:46:29,Okay.
00:46:29,00:46:30,For a variety of reasons.
00:46:30,00:46:36,One of the main ones is that the proliferation of decisions
00:46:36,00:46:39,that you would have to make would overwhelm you.
00:46:39,00:46:42,"So with money, this is the cost of wealth."
00:46:42,00:46:46,"The hidden cost of wealth is that for most people,"
00:46:46,00:46:49,the decision about whether to do an activity
00:46:49,00:46:53,is whether I can afford it.
00:46:53,00:46:55,"When you have money, all of a sudden,"
00:46:55,00:46:58,cans turn into wants.
00:46:59,00:47:00,Do I want to do that?
00:47:00,00:47:03,Do I want to do that is a much more complicated decision.
00:47:03,00:47:03,Yeah.
00:47:03,00:47:04,Human take choice.
00:47:04,00:47:05,It's too much endless choice.
00:47:05,00:47:08,So you now have every decision in your life
00:47:08,00:47:11,that used to be a can has now turned into a want.
00:47:11,00:47:13,So you are paralyzed.
00:47:13,00:47:16,"Right now, you're going to have lunch after this place, right?"
00:47:16,00:47:17,Yeah.
00:47:17,00:47:21,"You're not going to go and have lunch at Claridge's, are you?"
00:47:21,00:47:21,No.
00:47:21,00:47:22,No.
00:47:22,00:47:23,Why?
00:47:23,00:47:25,"Well, for a number of reasons."
00:47:25,00:47:27,But one is you don't want to track all the way over there.
00:47:27,00:47:31,"Two, there's no point to spending 80 pounds on lunch."
00:47:31,00:47:33,"And three, why do you want to hang out with those people?"
00:47:33,00:47:33,Right?
00:47:33,00:47:34,Those are your reasons.
00:47:34,00:47:34,Uh-huh.
00:47:34,00:47:35,Okay.
00:47:35,00:47:37,I have given you $100 billion.
00:47:37,00:47:38,I've removed...
00:47:38,00:47:39,You have a driver now.
00:47:39,00:47:42,Nothing can you go to Claridge's.
00:47:42,00:47:44,You can go to the airport and get in your plane and fly to...
00:47:44,00:47:45,You can have lunch in Paris if you want.
00:47:45,00:47:46,Do you want to have lunch in Paris?
00:47:46,00:47:47,Yeah.
00:47:47,00:47:47,Do you want to?
00:47:47,00:47:50,It's spiraled out of control.
00:47:50,00:47:51,And then you got to look...
00:47:51,00:47:52,Sounds great.
00:47:52,00:47:57,You're going to have to be really going to struggle to get down
00:47:57,00:47:58,to give an inch of this.
00:47:58,00:47:59,"Oh, wait a second."
00:47:59,00:48:00,Are you trying to put me off it?
00:48:00,00:48:02,It's a nightmare.
00:48:02,00:48:08,"I've picked the most kind of anodyne choice that you would have today,"
00:48:08,00:48:09,where to have lunch.
00:48:09,00:48:13,"And now I've given you an infinite set of options,"
00:48:13,00:48:14,just because you have $100 billion.
00:48:14,00:48:15,Yeah.
00:48:15,00:48:16,So you can't even...
00:48:16,00:48:19,Lunch has now become a cognitive burden of the size.
00:48:19,00:48:20,"No, but we even talked..."
00:48:20,00:48:22,There's a million other things that are going to happen today
00:48:22,00:48:23,that we've even talked about.
00:48:23,00:48:26,For every single one of them has now been multiplied times thousands.
00:48:26,00:48:29,"But I just want to use it specifically for eBay auctions,"
00:48:29,00:48:32,where I can just make sure I set the limit at $100 billion
00:48:32,00:48:34,and never lose my auction.
00:48:34,00:48:38,The size of the Dick Gregory memorabilia market
00:48:38,00:48:40,is going to go wildly out of proportion.
00:48:40,00:48:41,If you collect...
00:48:41,00:48:43,"Say, do you like to collect things?"
00:48:43,00:48:44,"Yes, I do."
00:48:44,00:48:44,"Okay, okay."
00:48:44,00:48:48,I have now removed 100% of the joy of collecting things.
00:48:48,00:48:48,There's no longer any constraint.
00:48:48,00:48:49,That's a really good point.
00:48:49,00:48:50,You no longer have to make any decision.
00:48:50,00:48:52,You can just buy everything.
00:48:52,00:48:52,Yeah.
00:48:52,00:48:54,"Oh my God, you wouldn't treasure any of all that crap you have"
00:48:54,00:48:56,that no sane person would treasure anyway.
00:48:56,00:49:00,You wouldn't because you could buy infinite quantities of it.
00:49:00,00:49:02,You could do five things.
00:49:02,00:49:03,It is really interesting.
00:49:03,00:49:05,"What would you do, Andy, sorry, since we got the others?"
00:49:05,00:49:08,Can I split the difference again?
00:49:08,00:49:09,$100 million.
00:49:09,00:49:10,That's very unusual.
00:49:10,00:49:14,"So interestingly in this study, it really peaks at $10 million."
00:49:14,00:49:17,So most people ask for $10 million or below.
00:49:17,00:49:20,"There are some countries like, I think, Russia and India"
00:49:20,00:49:22,where the majority choose $1 million or less.
00:49:23,00:49:27,But I was looking at the graph and it peaks at $10 million.
00:49:27,00:49:29,And then there are quite a lot of people
00:49:29,00:49:32,"who still choose $100 billion, although not majority."
00:49:32,00:49:34,So it ranges between 8% of people in China
00:49:34,00:49:37,to 39% of people in Indonesia choose $100 billion.
00:49:37,00:49:41,"But between $10 million and $100 billion, it's hardly anyone."
00:49:41,00:49:44,"I guess because $10 million seems to me like Malcolm saying,"
00:49:44,00:49:47,like a kind of reasonable amount where you could live a really nice life.
00:49:47,00:49:50,You have an incredible house and travel and see the world.
00:49:51,00:49:54,"Whereas actually $100 million is a life deforming,"
00:49:54,00:49:55,like a substantially deforming amount of money.
00:49:55,00:49:57,You lose all of your friends at $100 million too.
00:49:57,00:49:58,"Yeah, yeah."
00:49:58,00:49:59,Every relationship you have.
00:49:59,00:50:02,"This is, once again, is this appeals?"
00:50:02,00:50:04,Down is unphased by us.
00:50:04,00:50:05,I'm trying to get out of this hell hole.
00:50:05,00:50:07,"I'm a feature, not a bug."
00:50:07,00:50:10,"What would I do, by the way?"
00:50:10,00:50:11,What would you do?
00:50:11,00:50:12,What would you do?
00:50:12,00:50:14,"Well, what I find is always difficult with these"
00:50:14,00:50:16,"is that the temptation is to say,"
00:50:16,00:50:18,"""I'll have it all so that you can just give it all away."""
00:50:18,00:50:20,"But then that's quite an arrogant, probably Western thing"
00:50:20,00:50:24,to think that I know better where to give money than governments
00:50:24,00:50:26,or Bill Gates or whatever.
00:50:26,00:50:27,But I'd be tempted to do that.
00:50:27,00:50:28,I would spend all the money traveling the world
00:50:28,00:50:31,lifting people I chose to be significant.
00:50:31,00:50:32,That's what I would do.
00:50:32,00:50:35,"Because with $100 million, you can lift anyone in the world."
00:50:35,00:50:35,Yeah.
00:50:35,00:50:36,"Well, you mean just pick at your special."
00:50:36,00:50:39,I'm going to turn you into the president of East Timor or something.
00:50:39,00:50:41,"No, I mean literally, like Street Chimnoi."
00:50:41,00:50:42,I just travel around the world.
00:50:42,00:50:43,Just lifting people up.
00:50:43,00:50:44,You're just picking people up.
00:50:44,00:50:44,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:50:44,00:50:45,That trippied act.
00:50:45,00:50:45,Right.
00:50:45,00:50:46,That's Street Chimnoi tribute.
00:50:46,00:50:48,Do 8001.
00:50:48,00:50:48,"Yeah, yeah."
00:50:49,00:50:52,It's lots of studies about the psychology of wealth.
00:50:52,00:50:56,"So one of them, which I quite liked,"
00:50:56,00:50:58,is would you go public if you won the lottery?
00:50:58,00:50:59,Yeah.
00:50:59,00:51:01,"And again, I think I know what you're going to say, Malcolm."
00:51:01,00:51:02,Disaster.
00:51:02,00:51:02,"Yeah, disaster."
00:51:02,00:51:03,Absolutely.
00:51:03,00:51:05,"Well, public opinion is definitely in chime of that."
00:51:05,00:51:09,Only 2% of people say they would make public the fact they'd won.
00:51:09,00:51:11,"But he invariably, here's the problem."
00:51:11,00:51:15,You can't not go public because every one of your choices
00:51:15,00:51:17,"is conspicuous at a hundred million, right?"
00:51:17,00:51:20,"So something would be idling downstairs, right, with a driver."
00:51:20,00:51:24,You're not taking the two with a hundred billion.
00:51:24,00:51:27,This is driving me nuts.
00:51:27,00:51:31,You're not confronted the lunacy of your position yet.
00:51:31,00:51:32,You're not even here.
00:51:32,00:51:34,"Wait, let me ask you a question."
00:51:34,00:51:35,Are you enjoying this right now?
00:51:35,00:51:36,I love this.
00:51:36,00:51:36,Yeah.
00:51:36,00:51:37,You enjoy your job.
00:51:37,00:51:38,Yeah.
00:51:38,00:51:40,And you enjoy this afternoon.
00:51:40,00:51:41,This taping session.
00:51:41,00:51:41,"Yeah, yeah."
00:51:41,00:51:42,"I mean, this bit's going to give it a test."
00:51:42,00:51:42,Yeah.
00:51:42,00:51:45,And have you enjoyed a cup of coffee?
00:51:45,00:51:46,"I did, is it?"
00:51:46,00:51:47,All of that's gone.
00:51:47,00:51:48,What are you doing?
00:51:48,00:51:49,You have a hundred billion dollars.
00:51:49,00:51:50,You don't do this job anymore.
00:51:50,00:51:51,What am I doing?
00:51:51,00:51:51,What am I doing?
00:51:51,00:51:52,Well--
00:51:52,00:51:53,Dan is going to be in the--
00:51:53,00:51:54,Dan is in the 59--
00:51:54,00:51:56,"59% of people, right?"
00:51:56,00:51:57,2% said they'd go public.
00:51:57,00:52:00,59% of people said they would remain anonymous
00:52:00,00:52:02,and not even tell their friends.
00:52:02,00:52:04,And Dan thinks he's in this group of people who are going
00:52:04,00:52:06,"to turn-- next time I turn off outside Dan's house,"
00:52:06,00:52:08,there's a gold-plated Maserati outside.
00:52:08,00:52:10,Dan denies anything to do with him.
00:52:10,00:52:11,I'm just going to saving.
00:52:11,00:52:12,"Yeah, you will."
00:52:12,00:52:16,I would hire a replacement me to just take over this life.
00:52:16,00:52:19,"Be the Dan Shriver, and I would go be Mr. Billionaire."
00:52:19,00:52:21,"Well, we should definitely do that."
00:52:21,00:52:21,Yeah.
00:52:21,00:52:21,Sorry.
00:52:21,00:52:22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:52:22,00:52:25,We've neglected the single biggest drawback
00:52:25,00:52:27,to having a hundred billion.
00:52:27,00:52:29,And that is you have to hang out without a billionaires.
00:52:29,00:52:29,"Oh, my god."
00:52:29,00:52:31,There's no way you have to do that.
00:52:31,00:52:32,"No, that's true."
00:52:32,00:52:32,That's true.
00:52:32,00:52:33,That is a nightmare.
00:52:33,00:52:34,That is a nightmare.
00:52:34,00:52:35,"They're the only ones who understand you, I suppose."
00:52:35,00:52:36,"So, yeah."
00:52:36,00:52:39,There's one county--
00:52:39,00:52:41,"I believe it's in Wyoming or Montana,"
00:52:41,00:52:43,which has more billionaires than any other--
00:52:43,00:52:43,"Oh, wow."
00:52:43,00:52:44,--where they all live.
00:52:44,00:52:45,OK.
00:52:45,00:52:48,"And they all have their personal offices there,"
00:52:48,00:52:49,which are their charities.
00:52:49,00:52:51,No one else is going to afford to live there.
00:52:51,00:52:54,They priced out everyone who serves the billionaire.
00:52:54,00:52:55,So everyone who has to serve the billionaire
00:52:55,00:52:59,has to drive like massive distances from one county.
00:52:59,00:53:00,And they all have these charitable offices.
00:53:00,00:53:03,"But of course, who are you spending your charitable dollars on"
00:53:03,00:53:06,if there's only billionaires in this?
00:53:06,00:53:06,Yeah.
00:53:06,00:53:06,Right?
00:53:06,00:53:07,It's this sort of endless--
00:53:07,00:53:10,and it's this absurd existence that they live in this one.
00:53:10,00:53:11,That's where you get it.
00:53:11,00:53:17,That's where we'll find you.
00:53:17,00:53:22,"This is another UGov survey, which tests a famous rap lyric."
00:53:22,00:53:24,"Do you think it is or is not true that the more money you have,"
00:53:24,00:53:26,the more problems you have?
00:53:26,00:53:28,"12% said it is true that more money, more problems."
00:53:28,00:53:29,That's not--
00:53:29,00:53:31,"60% said it's false that more money, more problems."
00:53:31,00:53:32,What's U-shaped?
00:53:32,00:53:33,It's not a linear relationship.
00:53:33,00:53:35,"It's a U-shaped relationship, sorry."
00:53:35,00:53:36,It's the Goldilocks thing.
00:53:36,00:53:37,"Studies tend to show, don't they,"
00:53:37,00:53:38,"that after a certain amount of wealth,"
00:53:38,00:53:41,then your happiness starts to decline again?
00:53:41,00:53:44,I think the global average is--
00:53:44,00:53:50,"it's about 70,000 US dollars for emotional well-being."
00:53:50,00:53:51,And then it's 95 for--
00:53:51,00:53:53,"Sorry, is that income or wealth or is this--"
00:53:53,00:53:54,"It's income, sorry."
00:53:54,00:53:56,"So pay your salary, yes."
00:53:56,00:53:59,"But in terms of life satisfaction or life evaluation,"
00:53:59,00:54:01,it's about 95.
00:54:01,00:54:03,"So people feel prouder, I suppose,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,"if they earn a little bit more, even though they'll"
00:54:05,00:54:08,be happy day to day with a bit less.
00:54:08,00:54:09,So what do you want?
00:54:09,00:54:10,Do you want to be proud of how much you earn?
00:54:10,00:54:12,Or do you want to live a nice life?
00:54:12,00:54:13,"But either way, it's not very bad."
00:54:13,00:54:15,I know what dad's going to ask for every single time.
00:54:15,00:54:18,"For the list of cockroaches that's staring me down,"
00:54:18,00:54:21,waited for my answer.
00:54:21,00:54:22,Poor misguided fool.
00:54:22,00:54:29,"There was a really fun study done by a guy called Paul Piff,"
00:54:29,00:54:31,who looks into the effects of wealth on people
00:54:31,00:54:33,and looks into how it actually kind of makes
00:54:33,00:54:36,us meaner if we get richer.
00:54:36,00:54:40,He sent researchers to hide in a bush in California
00:54:40,00:54:42,and look at cars that went by and then judge
00:54:42,00:54:43,how expensive they are.
00:54:43,00:54:45,"And then there's a researcher further up the road,"
00:54:45,00:54:49,"I think, who is just crossing, is ever crossing back and forth."
00:54:49,00:54:50,"And in California, you legally have"
00:54:50,00:54:53,"to stop for people to cross, is ever crossing, like here."
00:54:53,00:54:56,And he clocks the types of car and then
00:54:56,00:54:58,whether they stopped for the pedestrians.
00:54:58,00:55:00,"And in the cheapest category of car,"
00:55:00,00:55:03,"every single car stopped to let the pedestrians across,"
00:55:03,00:55:04,as you're supposed to do.
00:55:04,00:55:06,"In the most expensive category of car,"
00:55:06,00:55:08,how many would you think would stop
00:55:08,00:55:10,and how many would drive past?
00:55:10,00:55:12,How many would stop out of the most expensive category?
00:55:12,00:55:14,60%.
00:55:14,00:55:14,60%.
00:55:14,00:55:15,Do you-- you're close.
00:55:15,00:55:16,It was 50/50.
00:55:16,00:55:18,50% of the most expensive cars.
00:55:18,00:55:20,Just drive-- just break the law and drive
00:55:20,00:55:22,straight over the zebra crossing and don't let
00:55:22,00:55:23,the person cross the road.
00:55:23,00:55:24,"That's you, Dan."
00:55:24,00:55:25,"We now know who's in that car, yeah?"
00:55:25,00:55:29,"I don't drive, so."
00:55:29,00:55:30,In your fancy car.
00:55:30,00:55:31,You'll have a world with your chauffeur
00:55:31,00:55:32,about that on the train.
00:55:32,00:55:35,Mow him down.
00:55:35,00:55:38,Can I give you one more survey about how people react to wealth?
00:55:38,00:55:41,I really like this one because it's a great question to ask.
00:55:41,00:55:44,If you accidentally paid 300 times more
00:55:44,00:55:48,"than your monthly salary, what would you be most likely to do?"
00:55:48,00:55:51,Say something and return the money.
00:55:51,00:55:54,Say nothing but return the money if asked.
00:55:54,00:55:58,Try and immediately spend or move the money.
00:55:58,00:56:00,But stay in your job.
00:56:00,00:56:03,Or take the money and leave your job.
00:56:03,00:56:07,"So I mean, open season."
00:56:07,00:56:08,"Well, they're going to find out."
00:56:08,00:56:09,"They're going to find out, and then they're"
00:56:09,00:56:11,going to ask you to repay the money in three years' time
00:56:11,00:56:12,when you've spent all the money.
00:56:12,00:56:13,And that's the worst of all worlds.
00:56:13,00:56:14,I'll give you the stats.
00:56:14,00:56:15,It's amazing.
00:56:15,00:56:18,62% of people said they'd say something and return the money.
00:56:18,00:56:21,20% of people said they'd say nothing but return the money
00:56:21,00:56:22,if asked.
00:56:22,00:56:24,And then we get to the real optimists.
00:56:24,00:56:26,3% of people would take the money and leave the job.
00:56:26,00:56:28,They said they would try and do that.
00:56:28,00:56:30,"2% of people said they would take the money,"
00:56:30,00:56:32,"try and immediately spend or move it,"
00:56:32,00:56:37,"and also keep their job, which I just find so optimistic."
00:56:37,00:56:41,2% of people think they would get away with that.
00:56:41,00:56:44,That's nice rosy thinking.
00:56:44,00:56:47,The worst spy in American history
00:56:47,00:56:52,"was Aldrich Ames, CIA agent, intelligence officer who"
00:56:52,00:56:54,"gave away the store to the Soviets, everything."
00:56:54,00:56:56,"So all we need to say worst spy, you mean most effective?"
00:56:56,00:56:58,I did the most damage to American interests.
00:56:58,00:57:00,Who was paid all this money.
00:57:00,00:57:02,He worked for the Soviets for like 10 years.
00:57:02,00:57:06,"He's paid all this money, and he starts to live it up."
00:57:06,00:57:09,And all of his colleagues know how much he makes.
00:57:09,00:57:10,And he starts showing up.
00:57:10,00:57:13,"He buys a Jaguar, and his wife has a main code,"
00:57:13,00:57:15,"and he has his fancy house, and he goes and he's like--"
00:57:15,00:57:18,and no one-- no one said it.
00:57:18,00:57:20,No one-- it didn't click.
00:57:20,00:57:21,But they're spies.
00:57:21,00:57:23,"He's option four, in other words."
00:57:23,00:57:27,"He's keep-- spend the money, keep the job."
00:57:27,00:57:29,Somehow he thinks that-- and he was right.
00:57:29,00:57:30,No one noticed.
00:57:30,00:57:33,He gets caught in the end for some other complicated reason.
00:57:33,00:57:36,"But the idea that he's like, it's growing around 20s."
00:57:36,00:57:37,Wow.
00:57:37,00:57:38,That's so funny.
00:57:38,00:57:39,Incredible.
00:57:39,00:57:41,And no one notices for years.
00:57:41,00:57:43,It gets ever more extravagant.
00:57:43,00:57:45,He's the only one in the parking lot of the CIA.
00:57:45,00:57:46,No one has a Jaguar.
00:57:46,00:57:47,They're government employees.
00:57:47,00:57:50,"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the funniest thing."
00:57:50,00:57:52,"He started wearing his fancy European suits,"
00:57:52,00:57:54,"and like, it's the most hilarious story."
00:57:54,00:57:56,It's a really glistens plate on his car.
00:57:56,00:58:02,He trips into Russia accidentally all the time.
00:58:02,00:58:05,"His colleagues just going, I must get better at saving."
00:58:05,00:58:06,I don't understand.
00:58:06,00:58:12,"OK, that's it."
00:58:12,00:58:13,That is all of our facts.
00:58:13,00:58:15,Thank you so much for listening.
00:58:15,00:58:17,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us
