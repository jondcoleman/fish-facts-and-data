00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 Hi everyone! Before we start the show we wanted to let you know that there's no

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,640
 down-tribe today, I'm afraid, but in good news there is our very own QI elf, Ethan

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,000
 Rupertelia. Filling in, he is brilliant, he does so much of the stuff behind the

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,720
 scenes on no such thing as a fish. You may well have heard him on Meet the Elf,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
 our special clubfish episodes where you get to meet the QI researchers. If you

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,200
 haven't heard those, you only have to join clubfish in order to do so. So enjoy

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,240
 some of Ethan's work in front of the scenes today. On with the show!

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:52,280
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,800
 coming to you from the QI officers in Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,560
 I'm here with James Harkin, Anatojinsky and special guest, Ethan Rupertelia.

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,120
 Hi Ethan! Hi Andy! And once again we've gathered around the microphones with our

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,240
 four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,280
 go! Starting with fact number one and that is Ethan! My fact this week is that

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,200
 in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, archers competed on top of a rubbish heap.

15
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,640
 Lovely! Yeah! That's interesting! And was there a kind of fun whimsical, like did

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,240
 they have to aim at a particular kind of coke? Yeah they had them all lined up in

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,600
 a row, they were the targets, yeah. No, so this is not a typical rubbish heap, it's

18
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,360
 not kind of compost heap in the back garden sort of thing. This is a whole

19
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,680
 artificial island made out of rubbish. So off the coast of Tokyo, in Tokyo Bay,

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,680
 there's an island called Yumenashima, which translates to Dream Island and it

21
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
 was created in the 1930s to begin with. So around Tokyo they were dredging up

22
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
 a lot of the bay to provide channels for ships to come through and accidentally

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,080
 formed a sandy island around the area. So Tokyo saw this and they're like great

24
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,440
 let's turn this into a new resort, but then there were typhoons and financial

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,200
 problems, so they closed it down and in 1957 Tokyo couldn't really keep up with

26
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,680
 the amount of waste that they were producing, they couldn't incinerate all

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,360
 of it, so instead they decided to make an artificial island lasagne sort of

28
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,960
 thing, so they would alternate layers of construction soil and food waste from

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:36,040
 households. And then nowadays it is a beautiful place to be. But it stinks of

30
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,920
 old rotting food. So not anymore, not anymore. So in the 1950s when they did

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,000
 have this initial load of landfill kind of household waste that came along, they

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,560
 didn't do a very good job of making sure it didn't smell horrendous, they were

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
 like loads of flies, there were loads of gases that were setting off

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,880
 spontaneous fires in the area. It sounds like actually I would say a more fun

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:06,920
 olympics thunderdome to have. Oh yeah. You're running 400 meters away from the

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,560
 flies. Maybe the archery just started as target practice for all the flies. I

37
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,640
 didn't actually see an archer online, he's an American guy called Byron

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,240
 Ferguson, who people call the world's greatest archer, this is his mates, but he

39
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,640
 is good. And anyway, I watched a video where he shot an aspirin out of the air.

40
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:31,640
 Stop it. Yeah, pretty cool. Really? How many attempts did that take? Because you always see these videos online, don't you,

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,320
 of these people doing amazing tricks and you think that's taken you four weeks to

42
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,240
 do that? How many aspirin were in the air? More than you're allowed to play at a chemist.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,400
 He shot an aspirin out of the air. Yeah, it's pretty cool. But then he was the

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,560
 greatest archer in the world. Right. Supposedly the greatest archer in

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,920
 history was a guy called Howard Hill, this is an American guy. And I now

46
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,560
 think he might not be the greatest archer in history because his main trick, you

47
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,720
 know how William Tell shot an apple off someone's head? His son's head. Yeah, that

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,120
 was the main part. It was the emotional jeopardy. Yeah, yeah. But this guy, he did

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,760
 do that like to show off, but he would also sometimes shoot a prune off someone's

50
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,960
 head. Wow, that's impressive. Now, it is, but if you put an aspirin on someone's

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,320
 head, I think that might be even more impressive. That's really good. You know

52
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,240
 that thing where the previous archer in the competition has got a bullseye, right?

53
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,840
 Yeah. How do you beat them? You have to split the arrow like Robin Hood. Exactly.

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,360
 Okay. In 2008, a 74 year old grandmother and archer whose name was Tilly Trotter.

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,360
 Great name. Incredible name. She split an arrow that was already in the target with

56
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,640
 another arrow, despite the fact that she was blind. Wow. So you get a little bit

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,360
 of assistance with the target, but not genuinely not much. So you... It's not

58
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
 someone standing next to the target with a bell. No, it's not done by cues. I think

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
 some of the people who did are partially sighted, but some of them are...

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,880
 Some blind doctor is not very sighted at all, and she would kind of insist on not

61
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,240
 getting too much help from her husband. He wouldn't say left or right when she was

62
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,280
 aiming. That's amazing. It was very, very cool. I think if you and I went to archery,

63
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,760
 Andy, and I hit a bullseye, and then you hit my arrow, split it in two, and also got

64
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,760
 a bullseye, I would probably argue that that means I've got two bullseyes now,

65
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:19,000
 and so I win the game. Well, that's why we never go down the butts. The butts.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 The butts, yeah, yeah. What do you mean, the butts? That's the archery butts. That's a...

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,360
 Is that the top? That's the training ground for archery, isn't it? I didn't know that.

68
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,600
 The butts full of the rubber sheep on the butts. I believe the butt is the name for

69
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,280
 the target, and it's what you're aiming towards, because in a fellow, he says,

70
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,080
 "Here is my journey's end. Here is my butt." Lovely. Nice. Lovely. And he's referring to

71
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,680
 the journey of an arrow. I know these roads, aren't they? The places that are called

72
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,640
 things like Butt Road, or... Oh, is that it? We come in a road... I can't remember where it is.

73
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,560
 Last to show, maybe it's called Butthole Lane, and... And it's where someone shot an arrow,

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,840
 and it went so far into the butt that it made a hole. I don't know what the hole is,

75
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,800
 but it definitely is. Like, this is the old archery ground, and people get confused

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,440
 and think it's Butthole Lane for another reason. We don't need to go into... Children.

77
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,920
 Children. The Robin Hood, actually, is called the Robin Hood, all one word,

78
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,760
 that move where you slice an arrow up from behind, and it's not that hard.

79
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:21,880
 Okay. It's not that hard. I'll see you down at the butts later, who can tell you theory.

80
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
 Okay, probably we couldn't do it, but I've been spending some time on archery forums,

81
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,720
 and it's not unheard of. I think it seems a little bit like getting a hat trick or something.

82
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,480
 So, people will say, "Oh, I just was down at the butts, and I did a Robin Hood. How amazing is

83
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,280
 that?" And people are responding, "Oh, yeah, a Robin Hood. Yeah, nice shooting. That's pretty cool."

84
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,760
 Oh, yeah. And one of these guys said, "Actually, a Robin Hood's mostly a hassle,

85
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,320
 because it just breaks your arrow, and you have to get a new one." So, a lot of guys use either

86
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,880
 pin knocks or uni bushings instead of arrows. No. A uni bushing. A uni bushing at the butt.

87
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,640
 A uni bushing. Yeah, that's right. No, I didn't bother looking at all those things. I think we

88
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,920
 can imagine. Actually, just on that, on breaking things, the official laws of archery, I was reading

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,760
 them, and there's an etiquette section, and it says, "A good archer does not leave litter."

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,920
 It says, "A good archer does not touch anyone else's equipment without permission,

91
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,000
 and if they break another's arrow through their own carelessness, they must pay for it

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,560
 in cash on the spot." Really? That's in the official laws of archery.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,200
 Do they accept contactless these days? Have you heard of Lottie Dodd? No, Lottie Dodd.

94
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:34,360
 She is actually quite brilliant. She was the youngest ever woman to win the Wimbledon Singles,

95
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,840
 15 years old, which is incredible, and then she went on to win it another four times,

96
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:42,760
 and then she was like, "Okay, I'm done. I'm going to try another sport." She went on to win the

97
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,800
 British Ladies' Gold Championship in 1904, played twice for England's national field hockey team,

98
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,360
 and then in the 1908 London Olympics, she commuted as an archer, won the silver medal alongside her

99
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,840
 brother, who got the gold and the men's, and they became the first brother-sister duo to win

100
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,920
 medals at the Olympics together. Really? Yeah, she's very cool. And then she went on,

101
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,360
 she worked as a nurse for the Red Cross in World War I, and then passed away at 88 in Bournemouth,

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,520
 listening to Wimbledon Commentaries on the radio. Did she? Very sweet, yeah.

103
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,920
 Just going, "I could have done that one." Have you heard of Target Panic?

104
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,600
 It's the, is there anything called the Yips? Yeah, it's called Archery Yips.

105
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,720
 It's basically, like Dart Titus. All the spinnies in gymnastics, I think it's quite

106
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,920
 a similar thing. Yeah, generally, spinnies. Simone Biles was like, in the past Olympics,

107
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,000
 there was a whole thing about how she might have the spinnies, because she ended up having to not

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 do a lot of the events that she was sent out for. And Dart Titus is where a darts player wants to

109
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,040
 throw the dart, but can't let it go. And they fly towards the dart. Holding onto the dart.

110
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,560
 But that is the thing. No, that's exactly it. So Archery, it's very, very similar. Basically,

111
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,600
 you either loose the bow as soon as you see the target, you kind of premature fire arrow.

112
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,640
 Look, it's very common. It's a very common problem.

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,640
 Or you freeze up and you can't release it at all. There's no way of saying this without

114
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,440
 making it sound penis-y, can we just... Yeah, and it's basically, like, it's a cast.

115
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,760
 And some people get it and they never shoot again. And it's really, and it's, you know,

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 lots of artists get it from time to time and then get over it. And it might be just

117
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,760
 in the mind, but there is a theory. It's called vocal dystonia. It's a condition

118
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,480
 where you have a, right, you have a particular movement. You're doing again and again and again,

119
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,600
 right? Like firing an arrow or firing a dart. And the neurons in your brain devoted to that

120
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,120
 get worn out from overuse. How weird is that? Like, there are sort of four cells that have

121
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,080
 been doing all the firing for you. I wonder how long it takes for the podcasting neurons to wear down.

122
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,960
 Do you guys know about the archer's paradox? Oh, I don't think so.

123
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,360
 Is it the same as Zeno's paradox? Is the tortoise in the arrow?

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,760
 Not to be confused with Zeno's archer's paradox. So Zeno's arrow paradox is that movement is

125
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,480
 impossible. Because he says at any one moment that an arrow is traveling, it's not moving because...

126
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,160
 It's like if you say we're 10 meters away, then in half the time you'll be five meters away.

127
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,560
 No, that's a different one. Oh, is it? Yeah, I thought that was Zeno's paradox.

128
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,720
 That's the tortoise in the arrow one. That is a Zeno's paradox. That's another Zeno's paradox.

129
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,720
 He's got a few paradoxes. He didn't have much on. He's spent his time making up these pointless

130
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,440
 minds. How's it going, Zeno? Yeah, pretty good. We're kind of a really good new paradox.

131
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,720
 But actually, I feel really bad about it. I'll come down to the pub in a minute. Well,

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,720
 I'd love to come to the pub, but movement is impossible. So you could just bring me a drink.

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,120
 Guys, what a shame. Zeno's not coming to the pub again. Oh yeah, shit. Well, nine minutes.

134
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,840
 Anyway, so he has the arrow paradox, which he uses an arrow to prove that motion is impossible.

135
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,920
 But that's not what the archer's paradox is. The archer's paradox is this thing where...

136
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,160
 So imagine you're shooting a bird and arrow. If you point it at the target,

137
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,160
 then you let go of it. Can you describe how the arrow travels?

138
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:09,320
 It forwards quickly through the air. Like an arc, maybe? Like you have to aim slightly above.

139
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:17,080
 A word of this so badly, it's extraordinary that I write QI scripts. Basically, they wobble,

140
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,320
 and they have to wobble, and there's nothing to stop them wobbling. And if you imagine that you've

141
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,360
 got an arrow and it's against the wood of the bow, the curved wood, when you release it as it

142
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,720
 rubs against the wood as it's going forward, that wood forces it a bit to the left if you're

143
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,360
 shooting a right-handed bow and arrow, forces it a bit to the left. But then the arrow wobbles

144
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,520
 back round to the right, so it snakes towards the target. And it's basically, it's explicable by

145
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,080
 some physics. Oh, thank you, Professor Brian Cox.

146
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:54,360
 I'm just waiting for my science podcast to really take off. It's because arrows can bend,

147
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,640
 so because they're not pointed straight, they'll bend around, so it bends around the bow.

148
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,480
 But whenever an arrow shoots towards the target, the only reason it can hit the target is because

149
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,880
 it wobbles around and snakes like a snake. And if it didn't wobble around, it would just

150
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:10,840
 go off on a diagonal every single time. Okay. It's not as good as Zeno's. Me and Zeno's sitting

151
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,280
 around not being invited to the pub. I get it. The oldest arrows ever found, guess how old they are?

152
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:23,000
 What, like 5,000 years? Yeah. Older. 50,000. That's a crazy increase, Hannah, but yeah,

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,960
 it's about 65,000. Just stunning. They were found, they're often found in peat bogs. So the oldest

154
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,520
 ones found in the UK are actually only 6,000 years old, give or take. It was a found in a peat

155
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:45,000
 bog, I think it's Scotland called Rotten Bottom. Guys, do you know that the person who was ranked

156
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,440
 ninth in the archery world cup in 2006, and actually went on to live in Japan and broke a

157
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,040
 bunch of Japanese archery records? I feel like I'm going to know this. I just have a hunch.

158
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,640
 Is Erika Eiffel? And who is Erika Eiffel? Descendant of the Gustav Eiffel? No, but

159
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,240
 related. She was in the news in 2007. She was sort of the first person who brought object

160
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,840
 sexuality to the headlines of the strong word. She married the Eiffel Tower.

161
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:21,560
 Famous for marrying the Eiffel Tower, she had a career as a great archer before that.

162
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,720
 That's brilliant. It's incredible. Apparently, she lost all of her sponsors after admitting

163
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,480
 to a relationship with her beau. Wait, I'm saying beau. How are you spelling beau?

164
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:43,640
 Okay, it's time for our second fact of the show, and that's my fact. My fact this week is that the

165
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,200
 man who invented the electric blanket also invented a device to electrocute squirrels

166
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,520
 to keep them off his bird feeder. Oh, very nice. So, are we saying he's a good guy from history?

167
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,960
 Yeah. Oh, you don't like squirrels, do you not? Not much. He didn't kill the squirrels. I think

168
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:05,080
 it was just a little shock to get them off. I think it was a one-volt shock. But if you can't

169
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,400
 tell the current, you don't know how harsh it's going to be on the body. I mean, you did use the

170
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,440
 word just because I couldn't feel James getting upset inside. You did use the word electrocute.

171
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:23,160
 Yep. You meant electrify. I meant zap. So, this is a guy called George Crowley or Crowley,

172
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,280
 and he's the one who invented, before you all start writing in, the first modern electric blanket.

173
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,880
 There have been a few before that. They've been used before for patients in sanatoriums and things

174
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,920
 like that, and they were small and very expensive and not very good. And George Crowley was alive

175
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,240
 and working at the time of the Second World War and had worked as an engineer on the idea of

176
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,960
 electrically heated flying suits for pilots. Ah, when you say flying suits.

177
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,280
 Suits that they would be flying in, rather than suits that make you fly.

178
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,600
 As in, sorry, you're like Iron Man. No, I think his work was secret, but not that secret.

179
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,920
 Sorry, yes. Rather than your kind of biggles style sheepskin leather jacket, he was working on

180
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,320
 how pilots could stay warm, because lots of pilots were just open to the air, it turns out,

181
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,280
 in early ball planes. It was so, so, so cold. So, they had to wrap up warm, and he worked on making

182
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,080
 electric suits for them. And I think that gave them an idea of how to make an electric blanket.

183
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,560
 Yeah, they were freezing in the war, weren't they? And you could, it was quite risky, because

184
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,520
 your hands, I think, could get stuck to metal equipment, like frozen to metal equipment. I'll

185
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,080
 add dumb and dumber. Very embarrassing and quite dangerous in the air. Apparently, pilots would

186
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,000
 have to get dressed at the last minute, so as not to get their clothes wet with sweat, because you

187
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,480
 had to put on very, very warm clothes if you're going up in a plane. But if you put them on too

188
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,280
 soon, then you're going to sweat those, because you're boiling, and then as soon as you go up in

189
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,800
 the plane, you'll sweat all freezes, and you've got a coat made of ice. Oh, gosh.

190
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,640
 Rough gigs. Wow, yeah. I looked into some of Crowley's other inventions. Oh, yeah. Right.

191
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,120
 So, he works for General Electric, so there are a lot of patterns that he kind of put out as part

192
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,120
 of his job. There was a golf ball painter, so if your balls become a bit too dirty, stop it.

193
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,520
 You would tip them into a vending machine, and then it would blast like a little jet of air,

194
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,120
 to hold it in the air, and then spray paint it. That's very clever. Just kind of like a hover

195
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,680
 painting. Yeah, exactly. That's pretty cool. It's very cool. That seems unnecessary.

196
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,280
 Well, how else are you going to paint the last bit? Exactly. Yeah, because if you're holding it,

197
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,360
 you can hold the ball in the top and the bottom. How are you going to paint the bit on your fingers?

198
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,920
 That's the Achilles story. Instead of Achilles, it's a golf ball. Yeah. It's like the Zeno golf ball

199
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,200
 paradox. Yeah. The golf ball isn't possible to paint. He also did a heater for shaving cream,

200
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,640
 I guess, if your shaving cream is just a bit too cold, needs to heat up, and a ball bouncer,

201
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,360
 which would be to test and kind of standardize the effectiveness of a ball's bounce after being

202
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,880
 kept in storage. But then he quickly abandoned the idea because he realized you could just do it

203
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:55,080
 as easily by hand. That was like to test tennis balls, right? To make sure that they all bounce

204
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,800
 evenly. I think so, yes. That's pretty good. Because it sounds like you'd be a kid just being

205
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,680
 like, "Should we go out and bounce the ball?" And we're like, "No, my ball bouncer's doing it."

206
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,840
 And the squirrel electrifier, Zappa, apparently according to his son-in-law David Scott, he

207
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,800
 abandoned it when he began to feel bad for the squirrels. There you go. So he had a conscience.

208
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,360
 Yeah. Did he feel bad for the birds that were then starving to death?

209
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,480
 When he was a child, he invented a device that warned him when his parents were coming into

210
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:31,880
 his room. Brilliant. Useful in the teenage years. Yeah. Don't come in. I'm a lecture teacher.

211
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:42,760
 He was six years old when he invented that. Yeah. Very cool. And then at 12 years old,

212
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,960
 he set up a light sensor in the dining room door so that if his mum passed by with like an arm

213
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:52,520
 full of dirty dishes, it would open for her. He wired up the living room curtains so a light

214
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,760
 switch so when you switch the light on at night, the curtains would close. He basically built like

215
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:03,240
 the first smart home. It was like Kevin from Home Lights. Yeah. I really thought you meant

216
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,400
 Kevin from Kevin and Perry Go Large and only masturbating in your room. Another attempt

217
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,520
 to truly shake off the international listener. Yeah, I suppose so. And when he was in his prime

218
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,440
 at work, he was brought in as a witness in quite a lot of court cases. What it would be is people

219
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,120
 would have a fire in their bedroom and they'd say that their electric blanket had set on fire

220
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,800
 and he would always come in and say, yeah, it's absolutely impossible that that's happened because

221
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:38,440
 his improvement was the thermostat. Okay. When we say modern blankets, the ones before you couldn't

222
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,760
 really set them, they just got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter, but his like had a limit.

223
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,520
 It would always turn out that someone was smoking in bed. Because that always used to be the fear.

224
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,840
 I had an electric blanket when I was a kid at some point. I was desperate for one. I went to

225
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,920
 stay at my grandma's house who had one and I was like, well, this is the tree. I wanted a Sony

226
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,160
 PlayStation when I was a kid. To be fair, the reason I brought this fact to the attention of

227
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,280
 the table in the first places I recently slept in bed for the first time, which had an electric

228
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,520
 blanket, a game changer. I got mine for the first time this winter. Yeah. It's amazing. I don't know

229
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,480
 how I've ever lived without it. Yeah. But I thought they were very much for your granny, basically.

230
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,320
 Well, they are. You're getting out of that age now. They're a new PlayStation.

231
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,560
 But there was always the fear of dropping water on it and you'd somehow

232
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:32,520
 electrocute yourself. I think that is very unlikely, but I did when I was checking if that could

233
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:37,160
 happen. I did come across a Sun article where the headline was, "You've been using your electric

234
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:50,360
 blanket all wrong." It's always all wrong in those headlines, isn't it? It's never you've

235
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,040
 been slightly misusing it or you've been slightly tricking it. There might be something you've

236
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,240
 occasionally done. What are you meant to do? You're meant to turn off when you get into bed,

237
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,520
 so you don't keep cooking yourself overnight. Yeah. You're meant to do that, everyone. Is that,

238
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
 don't fold it? Why would you fold it? It's just on your bed all the time.

239
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,960
 That is actually a good point, and that's what I think Crowley actually solved with the thermostats,

240
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,480
 so the thermostats for turning things on and off, but also local hotspots, because if you fold it

241
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,840
 or bunch it up, you'd get all these heating filaments getting closer and closer to each

242
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,480
 other, so they wouldn't spread out the heat uniformly, and so you would get too hot in

243
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,800
 certain places. Hot patches, I can microwave. Exactly. Sorry, this is question for Ethan,

244
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,400
 who's a physicist? If you had these electrical wires going around you and you folded it

245
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,560
 around yourself, would you become magnetic? Have you seen, you know, the X-mine, James? Oh yeah.

246
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,800
 Magneto, he originally had his powers after it, he gets tangled up in an electrical line.

247
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,640
 You never see what's under that cape of his, do you? No. So you're running a current through it.

248
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:53,640
 It's going to be a relatively low current, because it'll be high resistivity to give off more heat,

249
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,680
 but also it's not straight wires going around in a coil. It's actually like lots of different ones,

250
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,720
 so there'll be lots of interference, lots of different magnetic flux cancelling each other out,

251
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,160
 so I don't think you'd be... Net. Magnetic. Sorry, James. Sorry. What's happened to all my spoons?

252
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,040
 Do you want to hear about an electric blanket owner who did use it? All wrong.

253
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,200
 Occasionally, I think that there are risky ones, like if they're very old, you should be

254
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,280
 really careful around them and all that. Do be careful around them. But this happened in 2006,

255
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:29,640
 which was a Burmese python called Houdini, living in California. Don't call your python Houdini,

256
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:38,040
 honestly. Call it, like, happily caged. They're always called Houdini, aren't they? Every animal

257
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,880
 that escapes. That's because you've just stumbled upon the reason why. It's the problem that there's

258
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,760
 no one super, super famous for not having escaped. The man of the iron mask. Just call your python,

259
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:55,960
 yeah. The snake of Monte Cristo. Lots of... Anyway. You obviously didn't get very far into Monte

260
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,920
 Cristo, did you? It was so boring. It was just in prison for ages, so I gave up. Great. In 2006,

261
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:09,560
 Houdini, in California, mistook a queen-size electric blanket for a rabbit. He was halfway through

262
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,560
 eating. So his owner had given him a rabbit, right, to eat, and left it in his tank. But then Houdini,

263
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,640
 for some reason, was able to access the electric blanket too, unplugged it from the wall, in many

264
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,520
 ways, the most impressive bit of the whole procedure. And the rabbit was kind of tangled

265
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,960
 up in the blanket, and I guess was white and fluffy. And Houdini then just ate the entire queen-size

266
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,520
 electric blanket. It just sort of kept going. Like, he'd started... You know, when you start to eat a long,

267
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,920
 like a bit of patroil or something, you think, "Oh, I started to all finish." Yeah. So they had to...

268
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,760
 So relatable. I'm not taking reasonable from Mr. Cat Evian over here.

269
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:54,040
 So why? And the good news is, there's a happy ending to the story. Oh. She can still use the

270
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:59,080
 electric blanket in this one. It was used as like a doorstopper.

271
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,320
 No, that's where we're able to get it out. That's good news. Jenny really,

272
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,760
 the snake made a recovery. The first made an incision and very, very, very slowly removed

273
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,200
 the entire electric blanket, which must have been a magic trick for the ages as well.

274
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,720
 And she must have gone back to her fellow snake saying, "I had this unbelievably hot rabbit."

275
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,040
 James, you mentioned getting too hot with electric blankets. Yeah. So I wouldn't have

276
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,360
 an electric blanket because I like to be cold in there. I actually agree. And I went off my

277
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,840
 electric blanket very fast when I realized that. But you definitely wouldn't have liked this then.

278
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,920
 So the precursor to Crowley's electric blanket was some less good electric costumes. And in World

279
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,040
 War I, the French and US military made electric suits, in fact, for pilots. But they weren't that

280
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,960
 effective. They'd short out in the middle of a flight, so the pilot would be freezing cold.

281
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,160
 Or sometimes the power came from a windmill that was attached to the outside of the plane.

282
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,680
 That's amazing. That was the Dutch Air Force, wasn't it?

283
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:02,120
 Terrible news, all the tulips have gone from the wings where we were growing them.

284
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,800
 No, they just get quite hot because if you're playing one into a dive,

285
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,520
 probably not the main thing you're worried about if you're playing goes into a dive.

286
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,760
 The windmill obviously starts going quite a lot faster and your suit gets incredibly hot.

287
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,160
 That's very funny that, again, well done Crowley for inventing that thermostat.

288
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,360
 More dangerous for the little boy who's being used as a fuel cap. Give his finger in the hole.

289
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:33,400
 Anyway, don't stare at times. I've been working on something about the tail

290
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,480
 having holes in it already because it's made of edam. But it's not ready. It's not ready to be rolled out.

291
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:45,400
 Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna.

292
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,080
 My fact this week is that there's a sea harbour in Uzbekistan

293
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,040
 that's 150 kilometres from the sea.

294
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,880
 How can it be Zeno's harbour?

295
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:06,120
 This is the town of Moinak in Uzbekistan, technically in the autonomous republic of

296
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,800
 Karakal-Pakstan. And it used to be on the sea. It used to be on the Aral Sea.

297
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,480
 And the Aral Sea was the world's fourth largest inland sea, so really sort of a lake.

298
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,320
 And it's now shriveled to about 10%, less than 10% of its size.

299
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,920
 But there is this amazing place and you might have seen pictures of it.

300
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,680
 Heard of people who've sort of done that disaster tourism thing of going to visit it.

301
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,840
 Basically there's a harbour which still has a bunch of the old boats still in it.

302
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,640
 I think it's got 12 or 13 boats that are all rusted and just lingering there.

303
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,720
 But it's 150 kilometres to the sea at this point. So they're just marooned.

304
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,160
 And there's a lighthouse. That's a lighthouse, that's very spooky.

305
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,160
 Yeah, haunting place.

306
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,480
 There was when Geographical Magazine went to visit, apparently there's a local joke

307
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,200
 that if every tourist, journalist and scientist who visits brought a bucket of water with them,

308
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,520
 the entire Aral Sea would be replenished by now.

309
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,880
 So the Aral Sea is a very, it's kind of interesting, it is an ecological disaster zone.

310
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,080
 So it's not very cheery to read about, but it is kind of fascinating.

311
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,680
 So I didn't really, you hear about the fourth largest lake in the world and you think,

312
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,800
 well, probably quite big. It was half the size of England. It's so big.

313
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,560
 Or the size of Scotland, if you don't want to be so Anglo-centric.

314
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:27,480
 Or a third of the size of the United Kingdom, top to bottom. Brilliant.

315
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,680
 Oh, but nothing for the Welsh in here, I see.

316
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,360
 They always have the size of Wales, don't they?

317
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,280
 They've got the amounts of the Amazon being cut down and they should be happy with that.

318
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,600
 You never see the size of it. But anyway, imagine that.

319
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,320
 It's so big. All water thriving with fish. And it was just kind of botched.

320
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,720
 And it was a very quick botch during the 20th century because it used to be,

321
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,280
 the water was always slightly drained off in a couple of rivers that fed it.

322
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:01,000
 And the water was traditionally controlled by the Mirabs, who were the water masters in the area.

323
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,760
 And they ensured that farms in the area got enough water to irrigate their crops,

324
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,160
 but not too much, basically. But then during the Soviet times,

325
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,520
 because both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were part of the Soviet Union,

326
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,680
 and the RLC kind of straddled both, that was all centralized.

327
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,160
 And also there was a mega drive to farm cotton in Uzbekistan.

328
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,000
 And cotton is a very, very thirsty crop.

329
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,640
 And they diverted the rivers so much that this entire sea just started receding disasterously.

330
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,880
 And it was so fast, wasn't it?

331
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:38,040
 So it was 1960, essentially, the Soviets launched their big sort of redirecting the main feeder rivers.

332
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:44,040
 And by 1970, then, in fact, I thought this was really interesting because it's a

333
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,560
 measure of saltiness of water, which I didn't really realize existed.

334
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,680
 But by 1970, it was officially brackish.

335
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,400
 Oh, so my souls could live there.

336
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,960
 Exactly, mangroves can live there.

337
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,760
 I don't think they had time to set up shop.

338
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,040
 So the freshwater fish started dying, but it was officially salt water by 1987,

339
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,560
 which is another level above.

340
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,880
 And it became officially, do you know what the last designation of saltiness is in 1996?

341
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
 Super saline.

342
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,880
 Oh, that's good.

343
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,800
 That's a more common word.

344
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,160
 Oh, really?

345
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,800
 Salty.

346
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,680
 Yeah, briny.

347
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,720
 Oh, briny.

348
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,640
 Didn't realize, brackish salt water, briny.

349
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,800
 So only nematodes and microbes can survive.

350
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,520
 But also awfully, it's split in two, the RLC, so the North Aral and the South Aral.

351
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,320
 And the North Aral levels actually stabilized.

352
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,880
 The water levels stabilized about 1988.

353
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,960
 But by then it got quite salty and saltwater species has started to thrive in it.

354
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:42,280
 And then it started sort of getting a bit fresher again, replenishing a little bit.

355
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,120
 So all the saltwater species died out.

356
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,440
 Oh, no.

357
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,000
 One of the problems that they had was basically Moscow kept saying to these stands,

358
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,720
 "Okay, you've made this much cotton this year.

359
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,680
 Next year you need to make 5% more or 10% more."

360
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,120
 And they went, "All right, yeah, fine."

361
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,880
 And so then they would divert some river.

362
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,080
 And then they say, "Okay, well, next year we need 10% more."

363
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,120
 And they keep doing that.

364
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,360
 And they keep doing that and keep doing that.

365
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,000
 And in Russia it's known as the Uzbek skoyedila, which is like the Uzbek business.

366
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,920
 Because even once the RLC disappeared, they still kept saying,

367
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,840
 "Well, we need another 5% next year."

368
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,320
 And the people would be like, "Yeah, fine, that'd be all right."

369
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,320
 And they just kept saying that they were creating all this cotton, but they weren't making it.

370
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,600
 And so they...

371
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,720
 They sound like me.

372
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,160
 They sound like me at work.

373
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,280
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got that covered."

374
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,880
 Exactly, you can imagine.

375
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,960
 In 1983, they claimed that 981,000 tons of cotton were being harvested

376
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,320
 that were not being harvested.

377
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,080
 And then when Brezhnev died and Andropov came in,

378
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,240
 Andropov decided he wanted to do this sort of big anti-corruption drive.

379
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,080
 And they picked on...

380
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,320
 Because there was corruption happening everywhere, obviously,

381
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,000
 but they picked on this in particular.

382
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,600
 And it was so huge that Sharif Rashidov, who had been in charge of Uzbekistan,

383
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,520
 until then, he'd been buried in some huge place in the middle of Tashkent.

384
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,840
 They exhumed his body and buried him in like a normal grave.

385
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,760
 That's how much of a big deal it was.

386
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,040
 What did punish him for the fact that he'd lied about using all this cotton?

387
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,000
 Isn't that amazing?

388
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,240
 And then in 1991, when Uzbekistan became its own country and Islam Karimov came in,

389
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,160
 the first thing he did was just pardon everyone.

390
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,680
 So anyone who'd been in prison about any of this stuff,

391
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,040
 he said, "Oh, well, it was just Soviets being Soviets, so it's not your fault."

392
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,920
 Wow.

393
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,680
 That was, I mean, you know, a bit of reconciliation with the past.

394
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,720
 Probably a good thing as you come in.

395
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,880
 I know Islam Karimov was not a great president.

396
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,400
 It depends who you are.

397
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,960
 Yeah, that's true.

398
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,240
 If you're one of the security apparatus, you're a great guy.

399
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,080
 Yeah.

400
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,400
 So the Aral Sea, just quickly, one more thing on that.

401
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,680
 This is a really cool thing about it.

402
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,160
 And it's a reason that you, James, might want to go there.

403
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,040
 Well, I do.

404
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,720
 Well, you could be, James, the first person on Earth

405
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,160
 to map the Aral Desert as it now is.

406
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,160
 You're doing your impression of the watermen again.

407
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,360
 Yeah, I don't know what that's about.

408
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,240
 Yeah, yeah, it's just sort of like feel very connected to it.

409
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,680
 No, there is a theory that this is the last land surface on Earth that is not mapped.

410
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,400
 Satellites have taken pictures of it from a very long way away,

411
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,000
 but no one has done on-the-ground cartography because it's new land.

412
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,440
 Would I have to train as a cartographer before I do this mapping?

413
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,080
 I think so.

414
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,400
 I just do it on a piece of paper.

415
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,080
 I mean, what kind of cartographer do you want to be?

416
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
 Do you want to be a 17th century one?

417
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
 What do you tell them and say, "I'm naming that after my wife?"

418
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,400
 That after my wife.

419
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,280
 Well, you said I could do it.

420
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:32,840
 You could do it.

421
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,480
 I mean, you could do a very, very amateurish cartography show.

422
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:41,640
 But I love that theory that this desert, the desert is so cool, like you, new land.

423
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,040
 It's the Aralcom Salt Desert.

424
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,360
 It's known as today, and it's five million hectares, which is bigger than Denmark.

425
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
 Wow.

426
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,960
 No idea how it is compared to Wales, I'm wondering.

427
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,760
 But yeah, that's mega.

428
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,880
 Yeah, wow.

429
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,360
 OS Maps app wouldn't work there is what you're saying.

430
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,760
 No.

431
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,320
 And I don't think those Google cars have quite got to the salt flats.

432
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,000
 Your Uber is 17 days away.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,120
 Oh my God.

434
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,480
 No, he's 18 days away.

435
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,240
 Just one more very quick thing about Minak, which is the town.

436
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:24,120
 When they, Aralsea first began to really deplete and the Soviet Union still existed around that

437
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:30,200
 time, they weren't on the coast, but they had all these factories that were for canning fish.

438
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,480
 And so what the Soviet Union did is that they would transport fish all the way from the Pacific

439
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,120
 to Minak so that the townspeople could still work in the factories canning fish,

440
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,040
 even though they were nowhere near the sea anymore.

441
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,920
 Wow.

442
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,800
 Isn't that amazing?

443
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,520
 Oh my God.

444
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,080
 That's very cool.

445
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,520
 At some point they must have thought this is not a very sustainable line of work.

446
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,440
 I'm sure they did think that.

447
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,960
 The Mirabs would have thought, sorry.

448
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,840
 The Mirab.

449
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,480
 Thank you.

450
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,160
 Wow.

451
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:57,880
 It's interesting.

452
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,840
 And the other thing about Aralsea is that there's an island there, which in Russia is

453
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,080
 known as Vosrezhdenia, which means rebirth.

454
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,600
 And it's where it's mentioned in Call of Duty Black Ops, which I believe is a video game.

455
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,000
 It is.

456
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,800
 Certainly is your honor.

457
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,800
 But it was also a place where they had a biological weapons research facility

458
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,200
 and where a big cloud of smallpox was released in 1971.

459
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,920
 Tremendous.

460
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,040
 A happy place.

461
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,720
 Did they dump the stuff in the water?

462
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,360
 Did they dump?

463
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,160
 They didn't dump it.

464
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:34,120
 It just kind of, there was an explosion, a load of smallpox when and then it's landed.

465
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,840
 So when I'm making my map and say there's Polina Hill and there's Polina Valley and stuff,

466
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,720
 I need to watch out for smallpox because it might still be there.

467
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,280
 And the big, big problem about that is now that it's not a lake anymore,

468
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,840
 animals can just wander to this island, which they never would be able to do before.

469
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,320
 So it means that if there are any biological things on that island,

470
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,040
 we're going to get mutant animals who can take over the world.

471
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,000
 We're going to get bears on wings.

472
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,120
 Precisely what I'm saying.

473
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,840
 Yes.

474
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,320
 Yeah.

475
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,880
 Or just sort of smallpox deer spreading it.

476
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,760
 All that, yeah.

477
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,880
 That's actually, I thought it was quite interesting reading about that chemical weapons testing

478
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,400
 area because the area where it happens, in fact, the capital of Karakal-Pakstan,

479
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:25,880
 which is the region this is in, is called Nukas, which feels like a very dangerous name to give

480
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,120
 yourself middle of the Cold War when you've got some military stuff going on, doesn't it?

481
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,920
 Oh, Nukas.

482
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,400
 Yeah.

483
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,080
 I thought you were saying it sounds a bit like Newcastle.

484
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,640
 That's what I thought.

485
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,720
 I never realized that Newcastle sounds like Nukasol.

486
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:45,720
 All the makums, all the people from Sunderland are going, yeah, well, we've had that in our head

487
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,200
 for a long time.

488
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,560
 Yeah, we wish.

489
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,840
 Just one more thing about the Aral Sea, which I thought was very interesting because I looked

490
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,680
 in some newspaper archives, sort of what people had said about it before it got all depressing,

491
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,640
 and whenever it's mentioned in the 18th and 19th centuries, in the early 20th century,

492
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,440
 it is mentioned as a sea which keeps on disappearing.

493
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,760
 So it was very shallow, and actually there are all these articles, like there's a travellers

494
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,800
 report from 1910 that says it's so shallow that if a strong wind picks up, it blows the sea away,

495
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,920
 as far as the eye can see.

496
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,760
 Annoying.

497
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,960
 That's amazing.

498
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,280
 What did the fish do?

499
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,520
 I guess they got blown away.

500
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,400
 I'm sorry, kids, we've come to a beach where it was a bit windy and the sea's blown away.

501
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,480
 What can you do?

502
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,200
 That's amazing.

503
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,160
 Come go home.

504
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,960
 It's so funny.

505
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,960
 Yeah, and they kept saying there was an 1890 newspaper article about it saying

506
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,400
 it's undergoing a process of desiccation that makes it seem like it's going to disappear

507
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,120
 all together.

508
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,160
 How interesting.

509
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,520
 So maybe because it was very shallow, it was susceptible to that.

510
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,400
 It was clearly, and it had happened entirely, almost entirely, I think in the 14th century,

511
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,080
 there are documents which show it basically fully dried up, and they're still finding,

512
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,160
 as it dries up, it recedes and it reveals old sites of medieval settlements.

513
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,840
 Oh, that's really cool.

514
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,480
 Yeah, so maybe 600 years from now, it'll be back.

515
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,680
 Fingers crossed.

516
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,480
 Maybe, yeah.

517
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,040
 Unless we think it was a Soviet or Russian problem, the Great Salt Lake in America has

518
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:14,520
 lost 73% of its water and is unable to sustain a lot of wildlife because local people are using

519
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,800
 so much of the water around there.

520
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,960
 And the Colorado River, which used to reach the gulf, doesn't reach the gulf anymore.

521
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,600
 It just dries off and it hasn't since 1988.

522
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:22,920
 What?

523
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,800
 Yeah.

524
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,320
 A river just sort of ends?

525
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,960
 Yeah, it just dries.

526
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,160
 So it's like, it becomes a river, becomes a river, becomes a river.

527
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,000
 People in California, they're using the water so much that it just dries up.

528
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,880
 That's awful.

529
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,560
 It's a problem all around the world.

530
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:37,960
 Oh, yeah.

531
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,680
 That's terrible.

532
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:43,800
 So I was kind of looking at other landlocked countries that kind of had a very strong kind

533
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,240
 of association with the sea, despite obviously not being next to it.

534
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:54,840
 And I read into Bolivia, which is landlocked, and they're so obsessed with the sea.

535
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,800
 So it goes back to the War of the Pacific, which was in like 1879, 1884.

536
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,720
 Bolivia and Peru were up against Chile, and Chile ended up winning and annexed about 149 miles

537
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,320
 of the coastline and stopped Bolivia being able to access it.

538
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,480
 That's a real dickhead bit to annex.

539
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,280
 I know, I know.

540
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,800
 And Bolivia just haven't forgotten about it 140 years later.

541
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,360
 So they made a peace treaty in 1904, which granted Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean.

542
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,760
 But it meant that they still had to go through lots of checks, and it was still, you know,

543
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,720
 subject to loads of fairs.

544
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,840
 What are the checks doing there?

545
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:34,360
 They put an official plea with the Hague in 2013, but it was rejected that they didn't have to do

546
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:34,760
 anything.

547
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,440
 But the kind of culture that sprung up around it is really funny.

548
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,160
 So on the 23rd of March, every year, Bolivia celebrates the national day of the sea.

549
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,800
 And that date was chosen because it's the day that one of Bolivia's kind of iconic war heroes

550
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,680
 from the time, Eduardo Abaroa, was shot down by Chile.

551
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,560
 And his reported dying words were, "Surrender!

552
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,840
 Your grandmother should surrender!

553
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,400
 You fuck!"

554
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,800
 But yeah, they have a navy as well.

555
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,880
 They've got 500 troops in their navy.

556
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
 They have, like, Titicaca, don't they?

557
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,800
 Exactly.

558
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,000
 So is that where they do it?

559
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:07,400
 They do it.

560
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,840
 They do a lot of their training around there.

561
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,120
 They put, you know, patrol the area.

562
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,560
 They also patrol the Amazonian rivers that they have in Bolivia.

563
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,440
 Oh, yeah.

564
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,720
 And yeah, helpful.

565
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,680
 Yeah, and the official motto is, "The sea is ours by right.

566
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,360
 To take it back is our duty."

567
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,320
 Wow.

568
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,440
 And would they--

569
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,560
 I mean, let it go?

570
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,040
 I know.

571
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,600
 No, no, no.

572
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,480
 Get it back, get it back.

573
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,200
 All right, Elsa.

574
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,760
 Kling desperately on.

575
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,720
 That's my version of the time.

576
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,800
 I was reading-- what was I reading?

577
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,080
 I was reading the article about the re-measuring the Amazon.

578
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,360
 Because they once proved that the Amazons longer.

579
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,600
 And they're going to travel from the new source that they found, which is in Peru.

580
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,880
 And they're going to travel down.

581
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,520
 Because you're saying about, like, the Navy are there.

582
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,800
 Do you know what is the most dangerous animal that they might meet?

583
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,840
 Is it mad?

584
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,280
 It is.

585
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,760
 How is it?

586
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,080
 Mad.

587
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,360
 Is it, like, the remote communities?

588
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,280
 Or maybe the indigenous people that haven't been--

589
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,000
 You know what?

590
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,600
 There's some of that, but actually, it's loggers.

591
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,320
 Loggers, yeah.

592
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,040
 Ah, OK.

593
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,680
 Oh.

594
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,880
 I was so primed to like the guys who were doing logging in the Amazon rainforest.

595
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
 But now you've said that they're harmful.

596
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,240
 I like them even less.

597
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,480
 Yeah.

598
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,520
 There was a bit of good news on land blockery.

599
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,480
 So half a dozen landlocked countries in Africa

600
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,200
 are going to get their own coastline before long.

601
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,600
 Oh, nice.

602
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,560
 This is really interesting.

603
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:23,080
 So Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, the DRC, Malawi, and Zambia,

604
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,800
 between five and 10 million years from now,

605
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,800
 as the Somalian-Newbian tectonic plates move apart from the Arabian plate,

606
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,560
 cracks keep appearing.

607
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:37,240
 In Ethiopia in 2005, a big crack just appeared in the desert.

608
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,720
 Terrifying.

609
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,280
 So now I was reading an article about this on Quartz.

610
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,520
 I just want to read you the last sentences.

611
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,200
 This also means, as well as getting seaside, great news.

612
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,520
 "These countries can finally be directly connected

613
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,360
 to subsea internet cables.

614
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,080
 If that technology will not have been bypassed by them,

615
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,840
 assuming that millions of years down the line,

616
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,400
 nation states will still exist in the form that they do now."

617
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,720
 So actually just on the internet in Uzbekistan.

618
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,280
 So there's a lot of issues in Monday with corruption and cheating and exams.

619
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,760
 You've got about 400,000 students each year competing

620
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,000
 for about 50,000 university places.

621
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,360
 And so they have loads of different kind of ways of cheating to try and,

622
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,520
 you know, get them into uni.

623
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,720
 So they bribe invigilators to turn blind eye to phone use

624
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,320
 and people will use the parachute technique.

625
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,200
 Well, if they...

626
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,840
 Can I have a guess?

627
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,640
 Go on, go on, yeah.

628
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,240
 Parachutes are very tightly folded, aren't they?

629
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,560
 Oh, yeah.

630
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,760
 They're very tightly folded.

631
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
 So have you folded up?

632
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,480
 And you pull a card and a huge bit of cloth with all the answers comes up.

633
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,120
 Yeah, you've sort of written incredibly tiny writing

634
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,800
 on a very tightly folded bit of silk.

635
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,200
 I love that. It's not, I'm afraid.

636
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,440
 It's basically they just chuck it out the window to somebody below

637
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,080
 who then just corrects the answer.

638
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,120
 The exam paper out the window to correct the answer and they just chuck it back up.

639
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
 No, sorry, what?

640
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,620
 Yeah.

641
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,800
 How did they chuck it back up?

642
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,880
 So, hang on, you're doing your exam?

643
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,200
 Yeah.

644
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,760
 You have to find a way of going, "Oh, no! Why is that in the window?"

645
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,360
 And then you also have to find a way of unfolding the paper aeroplane in a way that no one notices.

646
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,680
 Yeah, basically now the telecoms companies, the three major kind of network providers,

647
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,800
 all very conveniently have technical difficulties that they need to solve for like this five-hour

648
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,320
 period where everybody's taking exams.

649
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,160
 But it's, yeah, it's just mad.

650
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,840
 Oh, another way that people would do, they would hide notes in, I quote,

651
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,760
 "renaissance style hairstyles."

652
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,800
 So they're just kind of crib cheeks stuffed in there.

653
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:36,280
 If you have a big enough ruff, you can just write the answer and spin it round to whatever bit of the

654
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,960
 curriculum they ask about.

655
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,320
 There we go, very nice, very nice.

656
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,880
 James, did you ever see those landlocked, I'm asking James specifically,

657
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,720
 the landlocked population of sharks in Australia?

658
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,040
 Oh, no, I haven't seen, are they on a golf course?

659
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,520
 They're on a golf course.

660
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,800
 Yeah, I am aware of them.

661
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

662
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,280
 And they washed in in the 90s.

663
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:54,840
 That's right.

664
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,560
 And for years they were like the nessie of this golf course,

665
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,240
 because there wasn't a big lake on the golf course.

666
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,040
 It's called the Carburett Golf Club in Queensland.

667
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,800
 How did they wash in?

668
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,720
 Well, exactly, the area floods every now and again.

669
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,160
 It's prone to flooding.

670
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:13,480
 So every several years they might have a really big flood, which sort of connects the sea to the...

671
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,640
 And bull sharks are very good at living in water of mixed salinity.

672
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,040
 So they...

673
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:18,920
 Brackish, like you say.

674
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,120
 Brackish.

675
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,920
 Not rainy.

676
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,120
 They're a home in the Brack.

677
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,760
 They have special, fun fact, rectal glands, which allow them to excrete salt.

678
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,720
 So they can survive in saltier water or they can survive in less salty water.

679
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,440
 Do they do it as like table salt or like mold and flakes?

680
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,400
 So what are we talking about?

681
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,600
 No.

682
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,440
 That's the third pot on the table, isn't it?

683
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,480
 Shark, ain't a salt.

684
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,520
 It'll catch on.

685
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,600
 Yeah, and so someone went there.

686
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,200
 A golfer named Scott Wagstaff said,

687
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,080
 "I'm going to prove that this Aussie nessie is down here."

688
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,400
 He went down there with a camera and some meat.

689
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,280
 And he got them, he got them on film.

690
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,280
 And yeah, they haven't been seen since 2015.

691
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,360
 And the area did flood again in 2013.

692
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,880
 So it's possible they washed out.

693
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,760
 That's interesting.

694
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,320
 I once went to a restaurant where there was sharks.

695
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,240
 Well, it was...

696
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,800
 Where was it?

697
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,960
 It was Dr. Evil's secret letter.

698
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,680
 It was like that.

699
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,520
 I think it was in Mauritius and you were beyond tables

700
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,880
 and the tables were floating on the sea.

701
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,080
 Sharks swimming around.

702
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,800
 And then the...

704
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,520
 Did they have signs like,

705
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,360
 "Do not feed the sharks under the table like a dog"?

706
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,880
 Yeah, yeah, you weren't allowed to feed them.

707
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,520
 But the waiters would come round.

708
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,320
 They would bring some meat and they would throw little bits of meat into the water next to you.

709
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,640
 And then the sharks would come up and snap, snap, snap, snap.

710
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,120
 But what?

711
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,880
 And then you'd eat the rest of your meal.

712
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,360
 That's an incredible restaurant to go to.

713
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:36,840
 Isn't it?

714
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,160
 So if you were the waiter and someone really annoyed you,

715
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,560
 could you accidentally spill a tray of meat on them

716
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,240
 so they'd be devoured by the sharks?

717
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,920
 The shark would have to be able to jump out.

718
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,680
 It would have to be like one of those make-o sharks

719
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,160
 that can jump out of the water, but I don't think they were those.

720
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,880
 So, but aren't you...

721
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,240
 Sorry, you're sitting with your waists.

722
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,800
 There's water.

723
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,320
 No, no, you're on an island.

724
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,040
 You're on an island.

725
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:56,840
 You're on an island.

726
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,480
 No, no, no, no, no.

727
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,320
 Right, what I got is that you're on an island.

728
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,520
 You're floating.

729
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,920
 You're on a floating island where the table is.

730
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,160
 The table must have a platform underneath it, right?

731
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,520
 Because you don't have the tables floating.

732
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,360
 So you're not saying that you're way deeper water

733
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,320
 and there are sharks in here, right?

734
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:09,960
 Because that's what I am.

735
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,960
 That's what I was guessing at the time.

736
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,360
 I mean, you wouldn't go twice, would you?

737
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:17,320
 You're very cold and you're very tense.

738
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,800
 Oh, and that huge tip.

739
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:20,920
 Was the food good?

740
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:21,400
 Yeah.

741
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:21,720
 Yeah.

742
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,280
 It was good.

743
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,320
 Did it cost an arm and a leg?

744
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:34,280
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James.

745
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,840
 OK, my fact this week is that wombat burrows can be explored

746
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,600
 by a special robot called a wombot.

747
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:47,480
 Oh, it's so good.

748
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,280
 So why are we exploring wombat burrows?

749
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:50,600
 Yes.

750
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,960
 I feel like it's none of our business.

751
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,760
 Well, you might want to learn stuff about wombats.

752
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,480
 None of my business.

753
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,360
 With that, the spirit of the Enlightenment died for that.

754
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:04,840
 Does it look, is it a fake wombat?

755
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,600
 Would a wombat be able to know that it was a wombot?

756
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,160
 No, it doesn't look like a wombat.

757
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,640
 OK.

758
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,000
 It looks like a small black box with tank wheels.

759
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:13,560
 OK.

760
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,320
 Caterpillar tracks.

761
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,280
 Oh, nice.

762
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:16,600
 OK.

763
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:21,320
 And this was something I read on the improbable website,

764
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
 run by our friends at the Ig Nobel Prizes.

765
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,240
 And it was made by Scott Carver and Robert Ross.

766
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,000
 And I think an honest student called Elizabeth Brown has worked.

767
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,040
 Yeah, that's right.

768
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,520
 But this was at the University of Tasmania.

769
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:39,880
 And this is a really interesting thing, right?

770
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:45,560
 So I've written to Dr. Carver, and he's given me lots of information.

771
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
 And this is incredible.

772
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,240
 So wombat burrows are really difficult to get in,

773
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,200
 because they're quite small.

774
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,480
 They're the size of a wombat.

775
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,080
 Wombat's quite big.

776
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,680
 I've seen a wombat in the zoo.

777
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,720
 They're big, but they're smaller than you, for instance.

778
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,760
 Yeah, OK.

779
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,120
 It'd be tough for you to get in.

780
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:02,680
 Yeah, yeah.

781
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,800
 But it would be possible for, say, a 13 or 14-year-old boy to get in.

782
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,760
 OK.

783
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:15,480
 And until Scott Carver and Robert Ross and Elizabeth Brown

784
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,200
 and their friends made this machine, the only information we had

785
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,520
 about wombat burrows was from a schoolboy called Peter Nicholson,

786
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:31,480
 who in the 1960s, with a torch and a spade, went into wombat burrows

787
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,760
 and made observations of the wombats that he encountered.

788
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,800
 It's so good.

789
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:36,680
 It's so good.

790
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,920
 Literally, he wrote up his account in the school magazine.

791
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,520
 And until the last few years, this was the best information we had

792
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,040
 about wombat burrows.

793
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,000
 I'm so jealous.

794
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,560
 He's so cool.

795
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,240
 That's a childhood fantasy.

796
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,160
 You crawl into a badger set and you find them all drinking tea on the ground.

797
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,640
 So I read, there was a documentary by ABC,

798
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,240
 so the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,

799
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,680
 and they kind of interviewed Peter Nicholson.

800
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,920
 So he was at Timotop boarding school in Victoria,

801
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,080
 and he and a friend stumbled upon the burrows.

802
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,240
 He was, I think, nine stone and six feet tall.

803
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,200
 So he was, you know, skinny enough that he could shuffle down.

804
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,000
 He was chased out by a female wombat at the time, a wild dog.

805
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,760
 But chased out forwards or backwards.

806
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,040
 I think he probably ended up shuffling backwards and out, sort of, you know, feet first.

807
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:20,760
 Well, exactly.

808
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,080
 That's scary if you can't, if you have to.

809
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,240
 Also, and if they tilt down, you'll have to climb backwards and upwards.

810
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,520
 Oh, God, you've taken me right back to a very upsetting experience I had

811
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,640
 in an underground car park in Slovenia, where I had to reverse out.

812
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,960
 Oh, my God, Andy, enough about your travel-adding, though.

813
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,240
 It's Jesus Christ.

814
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,320
 Oh, you're ever talking about...

815
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,240
 Oh, it was the first time I'd driven for years.

816
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,760
 And it was right down, like, very steep ramp down to the barrier,

817
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,560
 which was then closed for whatever reason.

818
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,160
 And I had completely forgotten how to do a reverse hill start.

819
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,280
 And that was the most stressful 20 minutes of that year.

820
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,000
 It was horrible.

821
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,520
 And there was sharks swimming under it.

822
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,920
 There was no agreed female wombat outside of the barrier, which would have made it worse.

823
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,400
 They weren't all, like, horrible wombats, though.

824
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,440
 He did become friends with one wombat in particular.

825
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,960
 So when he would go down there, and he would go to genuinely,

826
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,240
 he would go down and he would just sit with the wombat for a while.

827
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,200
 Sometimes if the wombat would grunt, he'd grunt back just to try and,

828
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,280
 you know, kind of replicate what he was doing.

829
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,120
 The wombat would come over and sniff him, or pour on him.

830
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:28,920
 Even followed him out on a cloudy day, because they're normally nocturnal,

831
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,800
 so they would stay inside during the day, but he came out on one day.

832
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,320
 And they just sat together outside, him and this friendly wombat.

833
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,120
 It's incredible.

834
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,400
 That is a beautiful story.

835
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:37,960
 Yeah, yeah.

836
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,440
 It's a kids book and it makes you believe it.

837
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,200
 But anyway, now we can do it with robots.

838
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,160
 So kids, get out of the bar.

839
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,920
 And the wombat is fitted with lasers,

840
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,360
 and it can eliminate any wombat it comes across.

841
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:54,040
 Well, they have to, like, for instance, because of your problem, Andy,

842
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,080
 they have to have, like, cameras on the front and the back,

843
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,800
 because so often you have to reverse and you can't turn around.

844
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,040
 So that's one problem that they had.

845
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,200
 They tied a rope to it just in case they got completely stuck

846
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,400
 and they could just drag it out.

847
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,320
 So that's kind of a lo-fi way of dealing with it.

848
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,280
 And they found something really important,

849
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:15,400
 which is wombats have been getting this parasite.

850
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,320
 It's like a scabies kind of thing.

851
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,960
 And it's been very, very bad for the wombat.

852
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,760
 And they found, thanks to their wombat,

853
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,560
 that mites can survive much longer inside the burrows,

854
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:29,080
 which people didn't realize before.

855
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,920
 People thought the mites would just die.

856
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,880
 But now we know that if your wombat leaves a burrow,

857
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,680
 and then another wombat goes in, which happens quite often,

858
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:41,160
 that's a way that this disease can spread from one wombat to another wombat.

859
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:41,480
 That's interesting.

860
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,920
 And that's something we didn't know before.

861
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:43,880
 That's very cool.

862
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,600
 James, just quickly.

863
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,320
 That vision of the wombat with a rope tied around it

864
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,480
 is kind of like an Australian version of the theseus and the minotaur myth, isn't it?

865
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,640
 That's exactly what I thought of weirdly when you said that.

866
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,800
 One of my favorite facts about theseus and the minotaur.

867
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,880
 So a ball of string was called C-L-E-W, a clue.

868
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,560
 And essentially, that's where our modern word for "clu" comes from.

869
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:03,880
 Really?

870
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,680
 You're following a clue backwards out of a maze.

871
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,200
 So it's a "lea", essentially.

872
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:08,680
 Yeah.

873
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:09,480
 That's so good.

874
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,440
 That is so cool.

875
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,160
 Yeah, it's really fun.

876
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,880
 But I also know something about wombats,

877
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,200
 and that is that they are fluorescent under UV light, but so are scabies.

878
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,240
 However, the wombats glow blue, but scabies glow green.

879
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,040
 So if you were to shine a black light at a wombat,

880
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,720
 you could tell if it's got scabies,

881
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,200
 if it's got little kind of green flecks coming through the glitter.

882
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:30,920
 Question.

883
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,160
 Yeah.

884
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,480
 If there is a bit of a scabies outbreak in the UK at the moment, apparently,

885
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,920
 and if I went to a nightclub, as I haven't done for 10 years,

886
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,680
 but if I was to go to a nightclub,

887
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,520
 would I be able to know that someone talking to me had scabies

888
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,360
 because they would glow?

889
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:53,080
 There would be like little green kind of areas where they are on the scene.

890
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,680
 If you get up close and take their clothes off,

891
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,280
 which often people do in nightclubs anyway.

892
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,880
 People are incredibly glad, yeah.

893
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,000
 Yeah, easy.

894
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,920
 Okay, that's public service.

895
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,560
 So yeah, so thank you to Dr. Carver

897
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,560
 for sending me all this information.

898
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,720
 If you want to learn more, then you can go to his Twitter,

899
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:13,160
 which is @scot_s_carver.

900
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,040
 And the last question I asked him was,

901
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,520
 "Do you know that there's a US zoo

902
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:21,080
 which claims to have had the world's oldest wombat?"

903
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,520
 And it was called Carver.

904
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,280
 Huh, lovely.

905
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,400
 Isn't that amazing?

906
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:25,880
 I thought--

907
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,440
 Did you know that?

908
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,400
 I said, "I just thought you'd be interested in that coincidence."

909
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,680
 And he said, "Cool fact.

910
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,000
 That wombat is a southern hairy-nosed wombat,

911
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,720
 whereas our work has been bare-nosed wombat."

912
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,280
 You must have felt so stupid when he's so young, yeah.

913
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,400
 Oh my god.

914
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,000
 And apparently, to the best of his knowledge,

915
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,880
 the oldest bare-nosed wombat is captivity,

916
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,320
 is in Japan and is called Wayne.

917
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,200
 So that put me in my place, yeah.

918
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,440
 Yeah, here's a riddle for you all.

919
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,160
 "What animal is the biggest user of a wombat burrow?"

920
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,840
 Wombat.

921
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,040
 Yes!

922
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,400
 Thank goodness someone's fallen into my cunningly laid trap.

923
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,760
 Australian teenage boys.

924
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,240
 That's it.

925
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,200
 Okay, so something else uses wombat burrows.

926
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,240
 Is it going to be something of a similar size to a wombat?

927
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,000
 Sounds like it's going to be bigger, doesn't it?

928
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,480
 Is it?

929
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,040
 Oh, hold on.

930
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:22,440
 No, no, no, no, no. I'm not sure it's that heavy.

931
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,960
 I've misunderstood the question.

932
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,280
 It was unfigurously worded, and I thought you meant biggest in size.

933
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,920
 You know, like maybe a wallaby sneaks in there.

934
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,880
 She's got it.

935
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,480
 She's, I don't know how you've done it.

936
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:34,200
 How the hell did she get that?

937
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,360
 The most frequent user of wombat burrows is the flip-flip.

938
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,600
 To be fair, Ada, I did notice she'd throw a piece of paper out of the window just before.

939
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:45,720
 The black-footed rock wallaby.

940
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,120
 But wombats will tolerate other animals in their burrows

941
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,960
 if there's something like a fire going on above ground.

942
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,400
 There was a story that went kind of viral

943
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,960
 that the wombats were rounding up other animals.

944
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,520
 Rounding them up and then sort of assassinating them in the burrows.

945
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:58,520
 No, protecting them from the wildfires.

946
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,480
 Oh, right, sorry.

947
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,400
 And they're amazing thermal buffers.

948
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,320
 You know, it can be incredibly hot above ground.

949
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,280
 Even if there's not a fire in it, it's just, obviously, it's very, very hot underground.

950
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,040
 Level temperatures.

951
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,000
 Good to know.

952
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,280
 Look out for a wombat burrow.

953
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,360
 Last resort.

954
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,480
 Just on robots and mimic animals.

955
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,640
 Biomimicry.

956
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,760
 Biomimicry.

957
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:24,600
 Apparently, we are soon going to have zoos full of robots instead of animals.

958
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,000
 This is the great suggestion.

959
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,360
 And they've started making robots that look exactly like certain animals.

960
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:35,240
 So that when you go to a zoo, rather than keeping, I don't know,

961
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,440
 a panda captive or a cheetah or something, you just look at a robot.

962
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,840
 And they've actually, they've got Del the Dolphin was one that I discovered.

963
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,760
 Delboy.

964
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,200
 Also, but the Delphin.

965
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,840
 So Del the Dolphin is designed by one of the creative directors at Disney, in fact,

966
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:56,360
 who is now working on this and the person who made Free Willy,

967
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,320
 which we talked about recently.

968
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,440
 They're more cost effective because obviously you don't have to feed them.

969
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,960
 But then you can't really do feeding time,

970
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,520
 which is part of the fun of the zoo, I suppose, I guess.

971
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,120
 Well, unless you're feeding them a robot fish, that's probably fine.

972
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,040
 Yeah, although then that stops being cost effective, I suppose,

973
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,840
 when you've got to generate a hundred robot fish every day.

974
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:16,360
 But yeah, apparently rather than having animals, we'll just have robots.

975
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,240
 I think that sounds great.

976
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:17,560
 Yeah.

977
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,040
 There is a temple in India which has replaced its elephant with a robo elephant.

978
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,600
 And that's again, on grounds of animal stress levels,

979
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,120
 because lots of temples in India have live elephants.

980
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,040
 So the Irringidapili Shri Krishna temple now has an 11 foot tall robo nearly.

981
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,920
 Gosh, good.

982
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,600
 I don't know what it, I don't know what it can do.

983
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,120
 I don't know if it can amusingly hoover up a peanut.

984
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,880
 This is the touch of Roomba to its trunk.

985
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,800
 Yeah.

986
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,120
 Here's one more thing.

987
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,800
 In America, they have a problem with poaching some places.

988
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:00,520
 And one way that they deal with it is they put lures out to the poachers.

989
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,720
 But you don't really want to lure with a real animal.

990
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,640
 So they started doing it with robots.

991
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:08,840
 And the idea is you would get a robotic, say, bear.

992
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,120
 And the poacher would shoot it.

993
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,640
 And then as soon as they did it, you could arrest them for shooting bears.

994
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,360
 Brilliant.

995
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,640
 Even though they didn't technically shoot a real bear, the intention was there.

996
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,040
 The problem is that poachers kind of get used to it.

997
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,480
 And so you have to make them more and more and more realistic each time

998
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,240
 so that they think it's real.

999
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,800
 And so the latest thing they've done, this guy in America called Volslagle,

1000
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,400
 who makes these props, has invented a deer which picks up its tail and poos out brown M&Ms.

1001
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,200
 So the poachers sit there thinking, that animal hasn't poohed for a while.

1002
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,120
 I think it might be a robot.

1003
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,640
 And then the M&Ms come out and they go, I got it.

1004
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,440
 And they shoot it.

1005
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,720
 And apparently this guy in Volslagle, who made it, has three kids.

1006
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,360
 And they get to eat all of the other coloured M&Ms.

1007
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:02,840
 Brilliant.

1008
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,560
 And then he buys them.

1009
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,840
 Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

1010
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,560
 So that's cool.

1011
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,200
 And that's why Van Halen wants it to have no brown M&Ms on the ride.

1012
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,080
 They knew they were needed for the robot.

1013
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:18,200
 Okay, that's it.

1014
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,920
 That's all of our facts.

1015
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,120
