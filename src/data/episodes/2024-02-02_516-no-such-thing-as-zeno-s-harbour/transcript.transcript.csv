00:00:00,00:00:03,Hi everyone! Before we start the show we wanted to let you know that there's no
00:00:03,00:00:09,"down-tribe today, I'm afraid, but in good news there is our very own QI elf, Ethan"
00:00:09,00:00:14,"Rupertelia. Filling in, he is brilliant, he does so much of the stuff behind the"
00:00:14,00:00:18,"scenes on no such thing as a fish. You may well have heard him on Meet the Elf,"
00:00:18,00:00:24,our special clubfish episodes where you get to meet the QI researchers. If you
00:00:24,00:00:28,"haven't heard those, you only have to join clubfish in order to do so. So enjoy"
00:00:28,00:00:34,some of Ethan's work in front of the scenes today. On with the show!
00:00:34,00:00:52,"Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:52,00:00:56,coming to you from the QI officers in Hoban. My name is Andrew Hunter Murray and
00:00:56,00:01:01,"I'm here with James Harkin, Anatojinsky and special guest, Ethan Rupertelia."
00:01:01,00:01:05,Hi Ethan! Hi Andy! And once again we've gathered around the microphones with our
00:01:05,00:01:09,"four favourite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order, here we"
00:01:09,00:01:14,go! Starting with fact number one and that is Ethan! My fact this week is that
00:01:14,00:01:19,"in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, archers competed on top of a rubbish heap."
00:01:19,00:01:24,"Lovely! Yeah! That's interesting! And was there a kind of fun whimsical, like did"
00:01:24,00:01:29,they have to aim at a particular kind of coke? Yeah they had them all lined up in
00:01:29,00:01:34,"a row, they were the targets, yeah. No, so this is not a typical rubbish heap, it's"
00:01:34,00:01:38,not kind of compost heap in the back garden sort of thing. This is a whole
00:01:38,00:01:44,"artificial island made out of rubbish. So off the coast of Tokyo, in Tokyo Bay,"
00:01:44,00:01:49,"there's an island called Yumenashima, which translates to Dream Island and it"
00:01:49,00:01:54,was created in the 1930s to begin with. So around Tokyo they were dredging up
00:01:54,00:01:59,a lot of the bay to provide channels for ships to come through and accidentally
00:01:59,00:02:05,formed a sandy island around the area. So Tokyo saw this and they're like great
00:02:05,00:02:10,"let's turn this into a new resort, but then there were typhoons and financial"
00:02:10,00:02:16,"problems, so they closed it down and in 1957 Tokyo couldn't really keep up with"
00:02:16,00:02:18,"the amount of waste that they were producing, they couldn't incinerate all"
00:02:18,00:02:23,"of it, so instead they decided to make an artificial island lasagne sort of"
00:02:23,00:02:27,"thing, so they would alternate layers of construction soil and food waste from"
00:02:27,00:02:36,households. And then nowadays it is a beautiful place to be. But it stinks of
00:02:36,00:02:42,"old rotting food. So not anymore, not anymore. So in the 1950s when they did"
00:02:42,00:02:48,"have this initial load of landfill kind of household waste that came along, they"
00:02:48,00:02:52,"didn't do a very good job of making sure it didn't smell horrendous, they were"
00:02:52,00:02:56,"like loads of flies, there were loads of gases that were setting off"
00:02:56,00:03:00,spontaneous fires in the area. It sounds like actually I would say a more fun
00:03:00,00:03:06,olympics thunderdome to have. Oh yeah. You're running 400 meters away from the
00:03:06,00:03:12,flies. Maybe the archery just started as target practice for all the flies. I
00:03:12,00:03:17,"didn't actually see an archer online, he's an American guy called Byron"
00:03:17,00:03:21,"Ferguson, who people call the world's greatest archer, this is his mates, but he"
00:03:21,00:03:24,"is good. And anyway, I watched a video where he shot an aspirin out of the air."
00:03:24,00:03:31,"Stop it. Yeah, pretty cool. Really? How many attempts did that take? Because you always see these videos online, don't you,"
00:03:31,00:03:35,of these people doing amazing tricks and you think that's taken you four weeks to
00:03:35,00:03:39,do that? How many aspirin were in the air? More than you're allowed to play at a chemist.
00:03:39,00:03:42,"He shot an aspirin out of the air. Yeah, it's pretty cool. But then he was the"
00:03:42,00:03:45,greatest archer in the world. Right. Supposedly the greatest archer in
00:03:45,00:03:50,"history was a guy called Howard Hill, this is an American guy. And I now"
00:03:50,00:03:54,"think he might not be the greatest archer in history because his main trick, you"
00:03:54,00:03:59,"know how William Tell shot an apple off someone's head? His son's head. Yeah, that"
00:03:59,00:04:04,"was the main part. It was the emotional jeopardy. Yeah, yeah. But this guy, he did"
00:04:04,00:04:07,"do that like to show off, but he would also sometimes shoot a prune off someone's"
00:04:07,00:04:11,"head. Wow, that's impressive. Now, it is, but if you put an aspirin on someone's"
00:04:11,00:04:16,"head, I think that might be even more impressive. That's really good. You know"
00:04:16,00:04:20,"that thing where the previous archer in the competition has got a bullseye, right?"
00:04:20,00:04:24,Yeah. How do you beat them? You have to split the arrow like Robin Hood. Exactly.
00:04:24,00:04:29,"Okay. In 2008, a 74 year old grandmother and archer whose name was Tilly Trotter."
00:04:29,00:04:34,Great name. Incredible name. She split an arrow that was already in the target with
00:04:34,00:04:38,"another arrow, despite the fact that she was blind. Wow. So you get a little bit"
00:04:38,00:04:43,"of assistance with the target, but not genuinely not much. So you... It's not"
00:04:43,00:04:47,"someone standing next to the target with a bell. No, it's not done by cues. I think"
00:04:47,00:04:51,"some of the people who did are partially sighted, but some of them are..."
00:04:51,00:04:54,"Some blind doctor is not very sighted at all, and she would kind of insist on not"
00:04:54,00:04:58,getting too much help from her husband. He wouldn't say left or right when she was
00:04:58,00:05:02,"aiming. That's amazing. It was very, very cool. I think if you and I went to archery,"
00:05:02,00:05:08,"Andy, and I hit a bullseye, and then you hit my arrow, split it in two, and also got"
00:05:08,00:05:12,"a bullseye, I would probably argue that that means I've got two bullseyes now,"
00:05:12,00:05:19,"and so I win the game. Well, that's why we never go down the butts. The butts."
00:05:19,00:05:23,"The butts, yeah, yeah. What do you mean, the butts? That's the archery butts. That's a..."
00:05:23,00:05:26,"Is that the top? That's the training ground for archery, isn't it? I didn't know that."
00:05:26,00:05:30,The butts full of the rubber sheep on the butts. I believe the butt is the name for
00:05:30,00:05:34,"the target, and it's what you're aiming towards, because in a fellow, he says,"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"""Here is my journey's end. Here is my butt."" Lovely. Nice. Lovely. And he's referring to"
00:05:39,00:05:42,"the journey of an arrow. I know these roads, aren't they? The places that are called"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"things like Butt Road, or... Oh, is that it? We come in a road... I can't remember where it is."
00:05:47,00:05:51,"Last to show, maybe it's called Butthole Lane, and... And it's where someone shot an arrow,"
00:05:51,00:05:58,"and it went so far into the butt that it made a hole. I don't know what the hole is,"
00:05:58,00:06:01,"but it definitely is. Like, this is the old archery ground, and people get confused"
00:06:01,00:06:06,and think it's Butthole Lane for another reason. We don't need to go into... Children.
00:06:06,00:06:10,"Children. The Robin Hood, actually, is called the Robin Hood, all one word,"
00:06:10,00:06:14,"that move where you slice an arrow up from behind, and it's not that hard."
00:06:14,00:06:21,"Okay. It's not that hard. I'll see you down at the butts later, who can tell you theory."
00:06:21,00:06:25,"Okay, probably we couldn't do it, but I've been spending some time on archery forums,"
00:06:25,00:06:29,and it's not unheard of. I think it seems a little bit like getting a hat trick or something.
00:06:29,00:06:35,"So, people will say, ""Oh, I just was down at the butts, and I did a Robin Hood. How amazing is"
00:06:35,00:06:40,"that?"" And people are responding, ""Oh, yeah, a Robin Hood. Yeah, nice shooting. That's pretty cool."""
00:06:40,00:06:44,"Oh, yeah. And one of these guys said, ""Actually, a Robin Hood's mostly a hassle,"
00:06:44,00:06:49,"because it just breaks your arrow, and you have to get a new one."" So, a lot of guys use either"
00:06:49,00:06:53,pin knocks or uni bushings instead of arrows. No. A uni bushing. A uni bushing at the butt.
00:06:53,00:06:57,"A uni bushing. Yeah, that's right. No, I didn't bother looking at all those things. I think we"
00:06:57,00:07:02,"can imagine. Actually, just on that, on breaking things, the official laws of archery, I was reading"
00:07:02,00:07:08,"them, and there's an etiquette section, and it says, ""A good archer does not leave litter."""
00:07:08,00:07:12,"It says, ""A good archer does not touch anyone else's equipment without permission,"
00:07:12,00:07:17,"and if they break another's arrow through their own carelessness, they must pay for it"
00:07:17,00:07:21,"in cash on the spot."" Really? That's in the official laws of archery."
00:07:21,00:07:28,"Do they accept contactless these days? Have you heard of Lottie Dodd? No, Lottie Dodd."
00:07:28,00:07:34,"She is actually quite brilliant. She was the youngest ever woman to win the Wimbledon Singles,"
00:07:34,00:07:38,"15 years old, which is incredible, and then she went on to win it another four times,"
00:07:38,00:07:42,"and then she was like, ""Okay, I'm done. I'm going to try another sport."" She went on to win the"
00:07:42,00:07:47,"British Ladies' Gold Championship in 1904, played twice for England's national field hockey team,"
00:07:47,00:07:54,"and then in the 1908 London Olympics, she commuted as an archer, won the silver medal alongside her"
00:07:54,00:07:58,"brother, who got the gold and the men's, and they became the first brother-sister duo to win"
00:07:58,00:08:02,"medals at the Olympics together. Really? Yeah, she's very cool. And then she went on,"
00:08:02,00:08:08,"she worked as a nurse for the Red Cross in World War I, and then passed away at 88 in Bournemouth,"
00:08:08,00:08:12,"listening to Wimbledon Commentaries on the radio. Did she? Very sweet, yeah."
00:08:12,00:08:16,"Just going, ""I could have done that one."" Have you heard of Target Panic?"
00:08:16,00:08:20,"It's the, is there anything called the Yips? Yeah, it's called Archery Yips."
00:08:20,00:08:25,"It's basically, like Dart Titus. All the spinnies in gymnastics, I think it's quite"
00:08:25,00:08:30,"a similar thing. Yeah, generally, spinnies. Simone Biles was like, in the past Olympics,"
00:08:30,00:08:35,"there was a whole thing about how she might have the spinnies, because she ended up having to not"
00:08:35,00:08:39,do a lot of the events that she was sent out for. And Dart Titus is where a darts player wants to
00:08:39,00:08:46,"throw the dart, but can't let it go. And they fly towards the dart. Holding onto the dart."
00:08:46,00:08:49,"But that is the thing. No, that's exactly it. So Archery, it's very, very similar. Basically,"
00:08:49,00:08:54,"you either loose the bow as soon as you see the target, you kind of premature fire arrow."
00:08:54,00:08:57,"Look, it's very common. It's a very common problem."
00:08:57,00:09:03,Or you freeze up and you can't release it at all. There's no way of saying this without
00:09:03,00:09:08,"making it sound penis-y, can we just... Yeah, and it's basically, like, it's a cast."
00:09:08,00:09:12,"And some people get it and they never shoot again. And it's really, and it's, you know,"
00:09:12,00:09:16,lots of artists get it from time to time and then get over it. And it might be just
00:09:16,00:09:20,"in the mind, but there is a theory. It's called vocal dystonia. It's a condition"
00:09:20,00:09:23,"where you have a, right, you have a particular movement. You're doing again and again and again,"
00:09:23,00:09:28,right? Like firing an arrow or firing a dart. And the neurons in your brain devoted to that
00:09:28,00:09:34,"get worn out from overuse. How weird is that? Like, there are sort of four cells that have"
00:09:34,00:09:39,been doing all the firing for you. I wonder how long it takes for the podcasting neurons to wear down.
00:09:44,00:09:47,"Do you guys know about the archer's paradox? Oh, I don't think so."
00:09:47,00:09:52,Is it the same as Zeno's paradox? Is the tortoise in the arrow?
00:09:52,00:09:58,Not to be confused with Zeno's archer's paradox. So Zeno's arrow paradox is that movement is
00:09:58,00:10:05,"impossible. Because he says at any one moment that an arrow is traveling, it's not moving because..."
00:10:05,00:10:11,"It's like if you say we're 10 meters away, then in half the time you'll be five meters away."
00:10:11,00:10:13,"No, that's a different one. Oh, is it? Yeah, I thought that was Zeno's paradox."
00:10:13,00:10:17,That's the tortoise in the arrow one. That is a Zeno's paradox. That's another Zeno's paradox.
00:10:17,00:10:23,He's got a few paradoxes. He didn't have much on. He's spent his time making up these pointless
00:10:23,00:10:28,"minds. How's it going, Zeno? Yeah, pretty good. We're kind of a really good new paradox."
00:10:28,00:10:33,"But actually, I feel really bad about it. I'll come down to the pub in a minute. Well,"
00:10:33,00:10:37,"I'd love to come to the pub, but movement is impossible. So you could just bring me a drink."
00:10:39,00:10:44,"Guys, what a shame. Zeno's not coming to the pub again. Oh yeah, shit. Well, nine minutes."
00:10:44,00:10:48,"Anyway, so he has the arrow paradox, which he uses an arrow to prove that motion is impossible."
00:10:48,00:10:52,But that's not what the archer's paradox is. The archer's paradox is this thing where...
00:10:52,00:10:57,"So imagine you're shooting a bird and arrow. If you point it at the target,"
00:10:57,00:11:03,then you let go of it. Can you describe how the arrow travels?
00:11:03,00:11:09,"It forwards quickly through the air. Like an arc, maybe? Like you have to aim slightly above."
00:11:09,00:11:17,"A word of this so badly, it's extraordinary that I write QI scripts. Basically, they wobble,"
00:11:17,00:11:21,"and they have to wobble, and there's nothing to stop them wobbling. And if you imagine that you've"
00:11:21,00:11:26,"got an arrow and it's against the wood of the bow, the curved wood, when you release it as it"
00:11:26,00:11:31,"rubs against the wood as it's going forward, that wood forces it a bit to the left if you're"
00:11:31,00:11:36,"shooting a right-handed bow and arrow, forces it a bit to the left. But then the arrow wobbles"
00:11:36,00:11:42,"back round to the right, so it snakes towards the target. And it's basically, it's explicable by"
00:11:42,00:11:47,"some physics. Oh, thank you, Professor Brian Cox."
00:11:47,00:11:54,"I'm just waiting for my science podcast to really take off. It's because arrows can bend,"
00:11:54,00:11:57,"so because they're not pointed straight, they'll bend around, so it bends around the bow."
00:11:57,00:12:01,"But whenever an arrow shoots towards the target, the only reason it can hit the target is because"
00:12:01,00:12:05,"it wobbles around and snakes like a snake. And if it didn't wobble around, it would just"
00:12:05,00:12:10,go off on a diagonal every single time. Okay. It's not as good as Zeno's. Me and Zeno's sitting
00:12:10,00:12:16,"around not being invited to the pub. I get it. The oldest arrows ever found, guess how old they are?"
00:12:16,00:12:23,"What, like 5,000 years? Yeah. Older. 50,000. That's a crazy increase, Hannah, but yeah,"
00:12:23,00:12:29,"it's about 65,000. Just stunning. They were found, they're often found in peat bogs. So the oldest"
00:12:29,00:12:34,"ones found in the UK are actually only 6,000 years old, give or take. It was a found in a peat"
00:12:34,00:12:45,"bog, I think it's Scotland called Rotten Bottom. Guys, do you know that the person who was ranked"
00:12:45,00:12:50,"ninth in the archery world cup in 2006, and actually went on to live in Japan and broke a"
00:12:50,00:12:54,bunch of Japanese archery records? I feel like I'm going to know this. I just have a hunch.
00:12:56,00:13:03,"Is Erika Eiffel? And who is Erika Eiffel? Descendant of the Gustav Eiffel? No, but"
00:13:03,00:13:09,related. She was in the news in 2007. She was sort of the first person who brought object
00:13:09,00:13:12,sexuality to the headlines of the strong word. She married the Eiffel Tower.
00:13:12,00:13:21,"Famous for marrying the Eiffel Tower, she had a career as a great archer before that."
00:13:21,00:13:25,"That's brilliant. It's incredible. Apparently, she lost all of her sponsors after admitting"
00:13:25,00:13:31,"to a relationship with her beau. Wait, I'm saying beau. How are you spelling beau?"
00:13:31,00:13:43,"Okay, it's time for our second fact of the show, and that's my fact. My fact this week is that the"
00:13:43,00:13:48,man who invented the electric blanket also invented a device to electrocute squirrels
00:13:48,00:13:54,"to keep them off his bird feeder. Oh, very nice. So, are we saying he's a good guy from history?"
00:13:54,00:13:59,"Yeah. Oh, you don't like squirrels, do you not? Not much. He didn't kill the squirrels. I think"
00:13:59,00:14:05,it was just a little shock to get them off. I think it was a one-volt shock. But if you can't
00:14:05,00:14:09,"tell the current, you don't know how harsh it's going to be on the body. I mean, you did use the"
00:14:09,00:14:14,word just because I couldn't feel James getting upset inside. You did use the word electrocute.
00:14:14,00:14:23,"Yep. You meant electrify. I meant zap. So, this is a guy called George Crowley or Crowley,"
00:14:23,00:14:28,"and he's the one who invented, before you all start writing in, the first modern electric blanket."
00:14:28,00:14:33,There have been a few before that. They've been used before for patients in sanatoriums and things
00:14:33,00:14:38,"like that, and they were small and very expensive and not very good. And George Crowley was alive"
00:14:38,00:14:43,and working at the time of the Second World War and had worked as an engineer on the idea of
00:14:43,00:14:47,"electrically heated flying suits for pilots. Ah, when you say flying suits."
00:14:48,00:14:52,"Suits that they would be flying in, rather than suits that make you fly."
00:14:52,00:14:56,"As in, sorry, you're like Iron Man. No, I think his work was secret, but not that secret."
00:14:56,00:15:04,"Sorry, yes. Rather than your kind of biggles style sheepskin leather jacket, he was working on"
00:15:04,00:15:09,"how pilots could stay warm, because lots of pilots were just open to the air, it turns out,"
00:15:09,00:15:14,"in early ball planes. It was so, so, so cold. So, they had to wrap up warm, and he worked on making"
00:15:14,00:15:19,electric suits for them. And I think that gave them an idea of how to make an electric blanket.
00:15:19,00:15:23,"Yeah, they were freezing in the war, weren't they? And you could, it was quite risky, because"
00:15:23,00:15:28,"your hands, I think, could get stuck to metal equipment, like frozen to metal equipment. I'll"
00:15:28,00:15:33,"add dumb and dumber. Very embarrassing and quite dangerous in the air. Apparently, pilots would"
00:15:33,00:15:37,"have to get dressed at the last minute, so as not to get their clothes wet with sweat, because you"
00:15:37,00:15:41,"had to put on very, very warm clothes if you're going up in a plane. But if you put them on too"
00:15:41,00:15:44,"soon, then you're going to sweat those, because you're boiling, and then as soon as you go up in"
00:15:44,00:15:47,"the plane, you'll sweat all freezes, and you've got a coat made of ice. Oh, gosh."
00:15:47,00:15:53,"Rough gigs. Wow, yeah. I looked into some of Crowley's other inventions. Oh, yeah. Right."
00:15:53,00:15:58,"So, he works for General Electric, so there are a lot of patterns that he kind of put out as part"
00:15:58,00:16:04,"of his job. There was a golf ball painter, so if your balls become a bit too dirty, stop it."
00:16:04,00:16:08,"You would tip them into a vending machine, and then it would blast like a little jet of air,"
00:16:08,00:16:12,"to hold it in the air, and then spray paint it. That's very clever. Just kind of like a hover"
00:16:12,00:16:16,"painting. Yeah, exactly. That's pretty cool. It's very cool. That seems unnecessary."
00:16:16,00:16:20,"Well, how else are you going to paint the last bit? Exactly. Yeah, because if you're holding it,"
00:16:20,00:16:24,you can hold the ball in the top and the bottom. How are you going to paint the bit on your fingers?
00:16:24,00:16:28,"That's the Achilles story. Instead of Achilles, it's a golf ball. Yeah. It's like the Zeno golf ball"
00:16:28,00:16:36,"paradox. Yeah. The golf ball isn't possible to paint. He also did a heater for shaving cream,"
00:16:36,00:16:41,"I guess, if your shaving cream is just a bit too cold, needs to heat up, and a ball bouncer,"
00:16:41,00:16:46,which would be to test and kind of standardize the effectiveness of a ball's bounce after being
00:16:46,00:16:49,kept in storage. But then he quickly abandoned the idea because he realized you could just do it
00:16:49,00:16:55,"as easily by hand. That was like to test tennis balls, right? To make sure that they all bounce"
00:16:55,00:16:59,"evenly. I think so, yes. That's pretty good. Because it sounds like you'd be a kid just being"
00:16:59,00:17:04,"like, ""Should we go out and bounce the ball?"" And we're like, ""No, my ball bouncer's doing it."""
00:17:04,00:17:10,"And the squirrel electrifier, Zappa, apparently according to his son-in-law David Scott, he"
00:17:10,00:17:15,abandoned it when he began to feel bad for the squirrels. There you go. So he had a conscience.
00:17:15,00:17:18,Yeah. Did he feel bad for the birds that were then starving to death?
00:17:18,00:17:25,"When he was a child, he invented a device that warned him when his parents were coming into"
00:17:25,00:17:31,his room. Brilliant. Useful in the teenage years. Yeah. Don't come in. I'm a lecture teacher.
00:17:31,00:17:42,"He was six years old when he invented that. Yeah. Very cool. And then at 12 years old,"
00:17:42,00:17:47,he set up a light sensor in the dining room door so that if his mum passed by with like an arm
00:17:47,00:17:52,"full of dirty dishes, it would open for her. He wired up the living room curtains so a light"
00:17:52,00:17:56,"switch so when you switch the light on at night, the curtains would close. He basically built like"
00:17:56,00:18:03,the first smart home. It was like Kevin from Home Lights. Yeah. I really thought you meant
00:18:03,00:18:09,Kevin from Kevin and Perry Go Large and only masturbating in your room. Another attempt
00:18:09,00:18:16,"to truly shake off the international listener. Yeah, I suppose so. And when he was in his prime"
00:18:16,00:18:22,"at work, he was brought in as a witness in quite a lot of court cases. What it would be is people"
00:18:22,00:18:28,would have a fire in their bedroom and they'd say that their electric blanket had set on fire
00:18:28,00:18:31,"and he would always come in and say, yeah, it's absolutely impossible that that's happened because"
00:18:31,00:18:38,"his improvement was the thermostat. Okay. When we say modern blankets, the ones before you couldn't"
00:18:38,00:18:42,"really set them, they just got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter, but his like had a limit."
00:18:42,00:18:48,It would always turn out that someone was smoking in bed. Because that always used to be the fear.
00:18:48,00:18:52,I had an electric blanket when I was a kid at some point. I was desperate for one. I went to
00:18:52,00:18:56,"stay at my grandma's house who had one and I was like, well, this is the tree. I wanted a Sony"
00:18:56,00:19:03,"PlayStation when I was a kid. To be fair, the reason I brought this fact to the attention of"
00:19:03,00:19:06,"the table in the first places I recently slept in bed for the first time, which had an electric"
00:19:06,00:19:12,"blanket, a game changer. I got mine for the first time this winter. Yeah. It's amazing. I don't know"
00:19:12,00:19:17,"how I've ever lived without it. Yeah. But I thought they were very much for your granny, basically."
00:19:17,00:19:23,"Well, they are. You're getting out of that age now. They're a new PlayStation."
00:19:23,00:19:27,But there was always the fear of dropping water on it and you'd somehow
00:19:27,00:19:32,"electrocute yourself. I think that is very unlikely, but I did when I was checking if that could"
00:19:32,00:19:37,"happen. I did come across a Sun article where the headline was, ""You've been using your electric"
00:19:37,00:19:50,"blanket all wrong."" It's always all wrong in those headlines, isn't it? It's never you've"
00:19:50,00:19:54,been slightly misusing it or you've been slightly tricking it. There might be something you've
00:19:54,00:19:57,"occasionally done. What are you meant to do? You're meant to turn off when you get into bed,"
00:19:57,00:20:00,"so you don't keep cooking yourself overnight. Yeah. You're meant to do that, everyone. Is that,"
00:20:00,00:20:02,don't fold it? Why would you fold it? It's just on your bed all the time.
00:20:03,00:20:07,"That is actually a good point, and that's what I think Crowley actually solved with the thermostats,"
00:20:07,00:20:13,"so the thermostats for turning things on and off, but also local hotspots, because if you fold it"
00:20:13,00:20:16,"or bunch it up, you'd get all these heating filaments getting closer and closer to each"
00:20:16,00:20:21,"other, so they wouldn't spread out the heat uniformly, and so you would get too hot in"
00:20:21,00:20:27,"certain places. Hot patches, I can microwave. Exactly. Sorry, this is question for Ethan,"
00:20:27,00:20:33,who's a physicist? If you had these electrical wires going around you and you folded it
00:20:33,00:20:39,"around yourself, would you become magnetic? Have you seen, you know, the X-mine, James? Oh yeah."
00:20:39,00:20:43,"Magneto, he originally had his powers after it, he gets tangled up in an electrical line."
00:20:43,00:20:49,"You never see what's under that cape of his, do you? No. So you're running a current through it."
00:20:49,00:20:53,"It's going to be a relatively low current, because it'll be high resistivity to give off more heat,"
00:20:53,00:20:58,"but also it's not straight wires going around in a coil. It's actually like lots of different ones,"
00:20:58,00:21:01,"so there'll be lots of interference, lots of different magnetic flux cancelling each other out,"
00:21:01,00:21:07,"so I don't think you'd be... Net. Magnetic. Sorry, James. Sorry. What's happened to all my spoons?"
00:21:07,00:21:12,Do you want to hear about an electric blanket owner who did use it? All wrong.
00:21:12,00:21:18,"Occasionally, I think that there are risky ones, like if they're very old, you should be"
00:21:18,00:21:22,"really careful around them and all that. Do be careful around them. But this happened in 2006,"
00:21:22,00:21:29,"which was a Burmese python called Houdini, living in California. Don't call your python Houdini,"
00:21:29,00:21:38,"honestly. Call it, like, happily caged. They're always called Houdini, aren't they? Every animal"
00:21:38,00:21:41,that escapes. That's because you've just stumbled upon the reason why. It's the problem that there's
00:21:41,00:21:48,"no one super, super famous for not having escaped. The man of the iron mask. Just call your python,"
00:21:48,00:21:55,yeah. The snake of Monte Cristo. Lots of... Anyway. You obviously didn't get very far into Monte
00:21:55,00:22:02,"Cristo, did you? It was so boring. It was just in prison for ages, so I gave up. Great. In 2006,"
00:22:02,00:22:09,"Houdini, in California, mistook a queen-size electric blanket for a rabbit. He was halfway through"
00:22:09,00:22:17,"eating. So his owner had given him a rabbit, right, to eat, and left it in his tank. But then Houdini,"
00:22:17,00:22:21,"for some reason, was able to access the electric blanket too, unplugged it from the wall, in many"
00:22:21,00:22:24,"ways, the most impressive bit of the whole procedure. And the rabbit was kind of tangled"
00:22:24,00:22:29,"up in the blanket, and I guess was white and fluffy. And Houdini then just ate the entire queen-size"
00:22:29,00:22:34,"electric blanket. It just sort of kept going. Like, he'd started... You know, when you start to eat a long,"
00:22:34,00:22:38,"like a bit of patroil or something, you think, ""Oh, I started to all finish."" Yeah. So they had to..."
00:22:38,00:22:44,So relatable. I'm not taking reasonable from Mr. Cat Evian over here.
00:22:44,00:22:54,"So why? And the good news is, there's a happy ending to the story. Oh. She can still use the"
00:22:54,00:22:59,electric blanket in this one. It was used as like a doorstopper.
00:22:59,00:23:03,"No, that's where we're able to get it out. That's good news. Jenny really,"
00:23:03,00:23:06,"the snake made a recovery. The first made an incision and very, very, very slowly removed"
00:23:06,00:23:10,"the entire electric blanket, which must have been a magic trick for the ages as well."
00:23:10,00:23:15,"And she must have gone back to her fellow snake saying, ""I had this unbelievably hot rabbit."""
00:23:15,00:23:22,"James, you mentioned getting too hot with electric blankets. Yeah. So I wouldn't have"
00:23:22,00:23:26,an electric blanket because I like to be cold in there. I actually agree. And I went off my
00:23:26,00:23:30,electric blanket very fast when I realized that. But you definitely wouldn't have liked this then.
00:23:30,00:23:36,So the precursor to Crowley's electric blanket was some less good electric costumes. And in World
00:23:36,00:23:42,"War I, the French and US military made electric suits, in fact, for pilots. But they weren't that"
00:23:42,00:23:45,"effective. They'd short out in the middle of a flight, so the pilot would be freezing cold."
00:23:45,00:23:51,Or sometimes the power came from a windmill that was attached to the outside of the plane.
00:23:51,00:23:54,"That's amazing. That was the Dutch Air Force, wasn't it?"
00:23:54,00:24:02,"Terrible news, all the tulips have gone from the wings where we were growing them."
00:24:02,00:24:09,"No, they just get quite hot because if you're playing one into a dive,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,probably not the main thing you're worried about if you're playing goes into a dive.
00:24:12,00:24:16,The windmill obviously starts going quite a lot faster and your suit gets incredibly hot.
00:24:16,00:24:21,"That's very funny that, again, well done Crowley for inventing that thermostat."
00:24:21,00:24:26,More dangerous for the little boy who's being used as a fuel cap. Give his finger in the hole.
00:24:26,00:24:33,"Anyway, don't stare at times. I've been working on something about the tail"
00:24:33,00:24:37,having holes in it already because it's made of edam. But it's not ready. It's not ready to be rolled out.
00:24:37,00:24:45,"Okay, it's time for fact number three, and that is Anna."
00:24:45,00:24:49,My fact this week is that there's a sea harbour in Uzbekistan
00:24:49,00:24:52,that's 150 kilometres from the sea.
00:24:52,00:24:57,How can it be Zeno's harbour?
00:24:57,00:25:06,"This is the town of Moinak in Uzbekistan, technically in the autonomous republic of"
00:25:06,00:25:11,Karakal-Pakstan. And it used to be on the sea. It used to be on the Aral Sea.
00:25:11,00:25:17,"And the Aral Sea was the world's fourth largest inland sea, so really sort of a lake."
00:25:17,00:25:23,"And it's now shriveled to about 10%, less than 10% of its size."
00:25:23,00:25:26,But there is this amazing place and you might have seen pictures of it.
00:25:26,00:25:30,Heard of people who've sort of done that disaster tourism thing of going to visit it.
00:25:30,00:25:34,Basically there's a harbour which still has a bunch of the old boats still in it.
00:25:34,00:25:39,I think it's got 12 or 13 boats that are all rusted and just lingering there.
00:25:39,00:25:43,But it's 150 kilometres to the sea at this point. So they're just marooned.
00:25:43,00:25:47,"And there's a lighthouse. That's a lighthouse, that's very spooky."
00:25:47,00:25:49,"Yeah, haunting place."
00:25:49,00:25:53,"There was when Geographical Magazine went to visit, apparently there's a local joke"
00:25:53,00:25:58,"that if every tourist, journalist and scientist who visits brought a bucket of water with them,"
00:25:58,00:26:00,the entire Aral Sea would be replenished by now.
00:26:00,00:26:05,"So the Aral Sea is a very, it's kind of interesting, it is an ecological disaster zone."
00:26:05,00:26:09,"So it's not very cheery to read about, but it is kind of fascinating."
00:26:09,00:26:12,"So I didn't really, you hear about the fourth largest lake in the world and you think,"
00:26:12,00:26:17,"well, probably quite big. It was half the size of England. It's so big."
00:26:17,00:26:21,"Or the size of Scotland, if you don't want to be so Anglo-centric."
00:26:21,00:26:27,"Or a third of the size of the United Kingdom, top to bottom. Brilliant."
00:26:27,00:26:30,"Oh, but nothing for the Welsh in here, I see."
00:26:30,00:26:34,"They always have the size of Wales, don't they?"
00:26:34,00:26:38,They've got the amounts of the Amazon being cut down and they should be happy with that.
00:26:38,00:26:40,"You never see the size of it. But anyway, imagine that."
00:26:40,00:26:45,It's so big. All water thriving with fish. And it was just kind of botched.
00:26:45,00:26:49,"And it was a very quick botch during the 20th century because it used to be,"
00:26:49,00:26:54,the water was always slightly drained off in a couple of rivers that fed it.
00:26:54,00:27:01,"And the water was traditionally controlled by the Mirabs, who were the water masters in the area."
00:27:01,00:27:04,"And they ensured that farms in the area got enough water to irrigate their crops,"
00:27:05,00:27:09,"but not too much, basically. But then during the Soviet times,"
00:27:09,00:27:12,"because both Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan were part of the Soviet Union,"
00:27:12,00:27:16,"and the RLC kind of straddled both, that was all centralized."
00:27:16,00:27:21,And also there was a mega drive to farm cotton in Uzbekistan.
00:27:21,00:27:23,"And cotton is a very, very thirsty crop."
00:27:23,00:27:29,And they diverted the rivers so much that this entire sea just started receding disasterously.
00:27:29,00:27:31,"And it was so fast, wasn't it?"
00:27:31,00:27:38,"So it was 1960, essentially, the Soviets launched their big sort of redirecting the main feeder rivers."
00:27:38,00:27:44,"And by 1970, then, in fact, I thought this was really interesting because it's a"
00:27:44,00:27:47,"measure of saltiness of water, which I didn't really realize existed."
00:27:47,00:27:50,"But by 1970, it was officially brackish."
00:27:50,00:27:53,"Oh, so my souls could live there."
00:27:53,00:27:55,"Exactly, mangroves can live there."
00:27:55,00:27:58,I don't think they had time to set up shop.
00:27:58,00:28:04,"So the freshwater fish started dying, but it was officially salt water by 1987,"
00:28:04,00:28:05,which is another level above.
00:28:05,00:28:09,"And it became officially, do you know what the last designation of saltiness is in 1996?"
00:28:09,00:28:11,Super saline.
00:28:11,00:28:11,"Oh, that's good."
00:28:11,00:28:13,That's a more common word.
00:28:13,00:28:15,"Oh, really?"
00:28:15,00:28:15,Salty.
00:28:15,00:28:16,"Yeah, briny."
00:28:16,00:28:17,"Oh, briny."
00:28:17,00:28:21,"Didn't realize, brackish salt water, briny."
00:28:21,00:28:23,So only nematodes and microbes can survive.
00:28:23,00:28:28,"But also awfully, it's split in two, the RLC, so the North Aral and the South Aral."
00:28:28,00:28:31,And the North Aral levels actually stabilized.
00:28:31,00:28:33,The water levels stabilized about 1988.
00:28:33,00:28:37,But by then it got quite salty and saltwater species has started to thrive in it.
00:28:37,00:28:42,"And then it started sort of getting a bit fresher again, replenishing a little bit."
00:28:42,00:28:44,So all the saltwater species died out.
00:28:44,00:28:44,"Oh, no."
00:28:44,00:28:51,"One of the problems that they had was basically Moscow kept saying to these stands,"
00:28:51,00:28:53,"""Okay, you've made this much cotton this year."
00:28:53,00:28:56,"Next year you need to make 5% more or 10% more."""
00:28:56,00:28:58,"And they went, ""All right, yeah, fine."""
00:28:58,00:28:59,And so then they would divert some river.
00:28:59,00:29:03,"And then they say, ""Okay, well, next year we need 10% more."""
00:29:03,00:29:04,And they keep doing that.
00:29:04,00:29:06,And they keep doing that and keep doing that.
00:29:06,00:29:11,"And in Russia it's known as the Uzbek skoyedila, which is like the Uzbek business."
00:29:11,00:29:14,"Because even once the RLC disappeared, they still kept saying,"
00:29:14,00:29:16,"""Well, we need another 5% next year."""
00:29:16,00:29:19,"And the people would be like, ""Yeah, fine, that'd be all right."""
00:29:19,00:29:23,"And they just kept saying that they were creating all this cotton, but they weren't making it."
00:29:23,00:29:24,And so they...
00:29:24,00:29:25,They sound like me.
00:29:25,00:29:27,They sound like me at work.
00:29:27,00:29:28,"""Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've got that covered."""
00:29:28,00:29:31,"Exactly, you can imagine."
00:29:31,00:29:37,"In 1983, they claimed that 981,000 tons of cotton were being harvested"
00:29:37,00:29:39,that were not being harvested.
00:29:39,00:29:43,"And then when Brezhnev died and Andropov came in,"
00:29:43,00:29:47,Andropov decided he wanted to do this sort of big anti-corruption drive.
00:29:47,00:29:49,And they picked on...
00:29:49,00:29:51,"Because there was corruption happening everywhere, obviously,"
00:29:51,00:29:53,but they picked on this in particular.
00:29:53,00:30:00,"And it was so huge that Sharif Rashidov, who had been in charge of Uzbekistan,"
00:30:00,00:30:04,"until then, he'd been buried in some huge place in the middle of Tashkent."
00:30:04,00:30:08,They exhumed his body and buried him in like a normal grave.
00:30:08,00:30:10,That's how much of a big deal it was.
00:30:10,00:30:14,What did punish him for the fact that he'd lied about using all this cotton?
00:30:14,00:30:15,Isn't that amazing?
00:30:15,00:30:21,"And then in 1991, when Uzbekistan became its own country and Islam Karimov came in,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,the first thing he did was just pardon everyone.
00:30:24,00:30:26,"So anyone who'd been in prison about any of this stuff,"
00:30:26,00:30:30,"he said, ""Oh, well, it was just Soviets being Soviets, so it's not your fault."""
00:30:30,00:30:30,Wow.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"That was, I mean, you know, a bit of reconciliation with the past."
00:30:34,00:30:35,Probably a good thing as you come in.
00:30:35,00:30:37,I know Islam Karimov was not a great president.
00:30:37,00:30:39,It depends who you are.
00:30:39,00:30:39,"Yeah, that's true."
00:30:39,00:30:43,"If you're one of the security apparatus, you're a great guy."
00:30:43,00:30:45,Yeah.
00:30:45,00:30:47,"So the Aral Sea, just quickly, one more thing on that."
00:30:47,00:30:48,This is a really cool thing about it.
00:30:48,00:30:51,"And it's a reason that you, James, might want to go there."
00:30:51,00:30:52,"Well, I do."
00:30:52,00:30:55,"Well, you could be, James, the first person on Earth"
00:30:55,00:30:59,to map the Aral Desert as it now is.
00:30:59,00:31:01,You're doing your impression of the watermen again.
00:31:01,00:31:02,"Yeah, I don't know what that's about."
00:31:02,00:31:05,"Yeah, yeah, it's just sort of like feel very connected to it."
00:31:05,00:31:10,"No, there is a theory that this is the last land surface on Earth that is not mapped."
00:31:10,00:31:13,"Satellites have taken pictures of it from a very long way away,"
00:31:13,00:31:17,but no one has done on-the-ground cartography because it's new land.
00:31:17,00:31:20,Would I have to train as a cartographer before I do this mapping?
00:31:20,00:31:21,I think so.
00:31:21,00:31:23,I just do it on a piece of paper.
00:31:23,00:31:25,"I mean, what kind of cartographer do you want to be?"
00:31:25,00:31:26,Do you want to be a 17th century one?
00:31:26,00:31:28,"What do you tell them and say, ""I'm naming that after my wife?"""
00:31:28,00:31:29,That after my wife.
00:31:29,00:31:32,"Well, you said I could do it."
00:31:32,00:31:32,You could do it.
00:31:32,00:31:35,"I mean, you could do a very, very amateurish cartography show."
00:31:35,00:31:41,"But I love that theory that this desert, the desert is so cool, like you, new land."
00:31:41,00:31:44,It's the Aralcom Salt Desert.
00:31:44,00:31:48,"It's known as today, and it's five million hectares, which is bigger than Denmark."
00:31:48,00:31:49,Wow.
00:31:49,00:31:51,"No idea how it is compared to Wales, I'm wondering."
00:31:51,00:31:54,"But yeah, that's mega."
00:31:54,00:31:55,"Yeah, wow."
00:31:55,00:31:58,OS Maps app wouldn't work there is what you're saying.
00:31:58,00:31:58,No.
00:31:58,00:32:03,And I don't think those Google cars have quite got to the salt flats.
00:32:03,00:32:07,Your Uber is 17 days away.
00:32:07,00:32:08,Oh my God.
00:32:08,00:32:09,"No, he's 18 days away."
00:32:09,00:32:15,"Just one more very quick thing about Minak, which is the town."
00:32:16,00:32:24,"When they, Aralsea first began to really deplete and the Soviet Union still existed around that"
00:32:24,00:32:30,"time, they weren't on the coast, but they had all these factories that were for canning fish."
00:32:30,00:32:35,And so what the Soviet Union did is that they would transport fish all the way from the Pacific
00:32:35,00:32:40,"to Minak so that the townspeople could still work in the factories canning fish,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,even though they were nowhere near the sea anymore.
00:32:42,00:32:42,Wow.
00:32:42,00:32:43,Isn't that amazing?
00:32:43,00:32:44,Oh my God.
00:32:44,00:32:45,That's very cool.
00:32:45,00:32:50,At some point they must have thought this is not a very sustainable line of work.
00:32:50,00:32:52,I'm sure they did think that.
00:32:52,00:32:53,"The Mirabs would have thought, sorry."
00:32:53,00:32:54,The Mirab.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Thank you.
00:32:55,00:32:57,Wow.
00:32:57,00:32:57,It's interesting.
00:32:57,00:33:02,"And the other thing about Aralsea is that there's an island there, which in Russia is"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"known as Vosrezhdenia, which means rebirth."
00:33:05,00:33:10,"And it's where it's mentioned in Call of Duty Black Ops, which I believe is a video game."
00:33:10,00:33:11,It is.
00:33:11,00:33:11,Certainly is your honor.
00:33:13,00:33:17,But it was also a place where they had a biological weapons research facility
00:33:17,00:33:22,and where a big cloud of smallpox was released in 1971.
00:33:22,00:33:22,Tremendous.
00:33:22,00:33:24,A happy place.
00:33:24,00:33:27,Did they dump the stuff in the water?
00:33:27,00:33:28,Did they dump?
00:33:28,00:33:29,They didn't dump it.
00:33:29,00:33:34,"It just kind of, there was an explosion, a load of smallpox when and then it's landed."
00:33:34,00:33:40,"So when I'm making my map and say there's Polina Hill and there's Polina Valley and stuff,"
00:33:40,00:33:43,I need to watch out for smallpox because it might still be there.
00:33:43,00:33:48,"And the big, big problem about that is now that it's not a lake anymore,"
00:33:48,00:33:52,"animals can just wander to this island, which they never would be able to do before."
00:33:52,00:33:57,"So it means that if there are any biological things on that island,"
00:33:57,00:34:00,we're going to get mutant animals who can take over the world.
00:34:00,00:34:01,We're going to get bears on wings.
00:34:01,00:34:02,Precisely what I'm saying.
00:34:02,00:34:02,Yes.
00:34:02,00:34:03,Yeah.
00:34:03,00:34:05,Or just sort of smallpox deer spreading it.
00:34:05,00:34:06,"All that, yeah."
00:34:07,00:34:13,"That's actually, I thought it was quite interesting reading about that chemical weapons testing"
00:34:13,00:34:19,"area because the area where it happens, in fact, the capital of Karakal-Pakstan,"
00:34:19,00:34:25,"which is the region this is in, is called Nukas, which feels like a very dangerous name to give"
00:34:25,00:34:30,"yourself middle of the Cold War when you've got some military stuff going on, doesn't it?"
00:34:30,00:34:30,"Oh, Nukas."
00:34:30,00:34:31,Yeah.
00:34:31,00:34:33,I thought you were saying it sounds a bit like Newcastle.
00:34:33,00:34:33,That's what I thought.
00:34:35,00:34:37,I never realized that Newcastle sounds like Nukasol.
00:34:37,00:34:45,"All the makums, all the people from Sunderland are going, yeah, well, we've had that in our head"
00:34:45,00:34:46,for a long time.
00:34:46,00:34:47,"Yeah, we wish."
00:34:47,00:34:52,"Just one more thing about the Aral Sea, which I thought was very interesting because I looked"
00:34:52,00:34:56,"in some newspaper archives, sort of what people had said about it before it got all depressing,"
00:34:56,00:35:01,"and whenever it's mentioned in the 18th and 19th centuries, in the early 20th century,"
00:35:01,00:35:04,it is mentioned as a sea which keeps on disappearing.
00:35:04,00:35:08,"So it was very shallow, and actually there are all these articles, like there's a travellers"
00:35:08,00:35:13,"report from 1910 that says it's so shallow that if a strong wind picks up, it blows the sea away,"
00:35:13,00:35:14,as far as the eye can see.
00:35:14,00:35:16,Annoying.
00:35:16,00:35:17,That's amazing.
00:35:17,00:35:20,What did the fish do?
00:35:20,00:35:22,I guess they got blown away.
00:35:22,00:35:27,"I'm sorry, kids, we've come to a beach where it was a bit windy and the sea's blown away."
00:35:27,00:35:29,What can you do?
00:35:29,00:35:30,That's amazing.
00:35:30,00:35:31,Come go home.
00:35:31,00:35:31,It's so funny.
00:35:31,00:35:35,"Yeah, and they kept saying there was an 1890 newspaper article about it saying"
00:35:35,00:35:39,it's undergoing a process of desiccation that makes it seem like it's going to disappear
00:35:39,00:35:40,all together.
00:35:40,00:35:41,How interesting.
00:35:41,00:35:44,"So maybe because it was very shallow, it was susceptible to that."
00:35:44,00:35:49,"It was clearly, and it had happened entirely, almost entirely, I think in the 14th century,"
00:35:49,00:35:53,"there are documents which show it basically fully dried up, and they're still finding,"
00:35:53,00:35:57,"as it dries up, it recedes and it reveals old sites of medieval settlements."
00:35:57,00:35:58,"Oh, that's really cool."
00:35:58,00:36:01,"Yeah, so maybe 600 years from now, it'll be back."
00:36:01,00:36:02,Fingers crossed.
00:36:02,00:36:03,"Maybe, yeah."
00:36:03,00:36:08,"Unless we think it was a Soviet or Russian problem, the Great Salt Lake in America has"
00:36:08,00:36:14,lost 73% of its water and is unable to sustain a lot of wildlife because local people are using
00:36:14,00:36:15,so much of the water around there.
00:36:15,00:36:19,"And the Colorado River, which used to reach the gulf, doesn't reach the gulf anymore."
00:36:19,00:36:22,It just dries off and it hasn't since 1988.
00:36:22,00:36:22,What?
00:36:22,00:36:23,Yeah.
00:36:23,00:36:25,A river just sort of ends?
00:36:25,00:36:25,"Yeah, it just dries."
00:36:25,00:36:29,"So it's like, it becomes a river, becomes a river, becomes a river."
00:36:29,00:36:35,"People in California, they're using the water so much that it just dries up."
00:36:35,00:36:35,That's awful.
00:36:35,00:36:37,It's a problem all around the world.
00:36:37,00:36:37,"Oh, yeah."
00:36:37,00:36:38,That's terrible.
00:36:38,00:36:43,So I was kind of looking at other landlocked countries that kind of had a very strong kind
00:36:43,00:36:47,"of association with the sea, despite obviously not being next to it."
00:36:47,00:36:54,"And I read into Bolivia, which is landlocked, and they're so obsessed with the sea."
00:36:54,00:36:59,"So it goes back to the War of the Pacific, which was in like 1879, 1884."
00:36:59,00:37:05,"Bolivia and Peru were up against Chile, and Chile ended up winning and annexed about 149 miles"
00:37:05,00:37:09,of the coastline and stopped Bolivia being able to access it.
00:37:09,00:37:11,That's a real dickhead bit to annex.
00:37:11,00:37:12,"I know, I know."
00:37:12,00:37:15,And Bolivia just haven't forgotten about it 140 years later.
00:37:15,00:37:20,"So they made a peace treaty in 1904, which granted Bolivia access to the Pacific Ocean."
00:37:21,00:37:24,"But it meant that they still had to go through lots of checks, and it was still, you know,"
00:37:24,00:37:25,subject to loads of fairs.
00:37:25,00:37:26,What are the checks doing there?
00:37:26,00:37:34,"They put an official plea with the Hague in 2013, but it was rejected that they didn't have to do"
00:37:34,00:37:34,anything.
00:37:34,00:37:38,But the kind of culture that sprung up around it is really funny.
00:37:38,00:37:43,"So on the 23rd of March, every year, Bolivia celebrates the national day of the sea."
00:37:43,00:37:47,And that date was chosen because it's the day that one of Bolivia's kind of iconic war heroes
00:37:47,00:37:52,"from the time, Eduardo Abaroa, was shot down by Chile."
00:37:52,00:37:55,"And his reported dying words were, ""Surrender!"
00:37:55,00:37:56,Your grandmother should surrender!
00:37:56,00:37:57,"You fuck!"""
00:37:57,00:38:01,"But yeah, they have a navy as well."
00:38:01,00:38:03,They've got 500 troops in their navy.
00:38:03,00:38:05,"They have, like, Titicaca, don't they?"
00:38:05,00:38:05,Exactly.
00:38:05,00:38:07,So is that where they do it?
00:38:07,00:38:07,They do it.
00:38:07,00:38:08,They do a lot of their training around there.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"They put, you know, patrol the area."
00:38:10,00:38:13,They also patrol the Amazonian rivers that they have in Bolivia.
00:38:13,00:38:14,"Oh, yeah."
00:38:14,00:38:15,"And yeah, helpful."
00:38:15,00:38:18,"Yeah, and the official motto is, ""The sea is ours by right."
00:38:18,00:38:20,"To take it back is our duty."""
00:38:20,00:38:21,Wow.
00:38:21,00:38:22,And would they--
00:38:22,00:38:23,"I mean, let it go?"
00:38:23,00:38:24,I know.
00:38:24,00:38:24,"No, no, no."
00:38:24,00:38:25,"Get it back, get it back."
00:38:25,00:38:26,"All right, Elsa."
00:38:26,00:38:28,Kling desperately on.
00:38:28,00:38:29,That's my version of the time.
00:38:29,00:38:31,I was reading-- what was I reading?
00:38:31,00:38:35,I was reading the article about the re-measuring the Amazon.
00:38:35,00:38:38,Because they once proved that the Amazons longer.
00:38:38,00:38:42,"And they're going to travel from the new source that they found, which is in Peru."
00:38:42,00:38:43,And they're going to travel down.
00:38:43,00:38:46,"Because you're saying about, like, the Navy are there."
00:38:46,00:38:49,Do you know what is the most dangerous animal that they might meet?
00:38:49,00:38:50,Is it mad?
00:38:50,00:38:52,It is.
00:38:52,00:38:52,How is it?
00:38:52,00:38:53,Mad.
00:38:53,00:38:56,"Is it, like, the remote communities?"
00:38:56,00:38:58,Or maybe the indigenous people that haven't been--
00:38:58,00:38:59,You know what?
00:38:59,00:39:00,"There's some of that, but actually, it's loggers."
00:39:00,00:39:01,"Loggers, yeah."
00:39:01,00:39:02,"Ah, OK."
00:39:02,00:39:02,Oh.
00:39:02,00:39:05,I was so primed to like the guys who were doing logging in the Amazon rainforest.
00:39:05,00:39:07,But now you've said that they're harmful.
00:39:07,00:39:09,I like them even less.
00:39:09,00:39:09,Yeah.
00:39:09,00:39:12,There was a bit of good news on land blockery.
00:39:13,00:39:15,So half a dozen landlocked countries in Africa
00:39:15,00:39:18,are going to get their own coastline before long.
00:39:18,00:39:18,"Oh, nice."
00:39:18,00:39:19,This is really interesting.
00:39:19,00:39:23,"So Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, the DRC, Malawi, and Zambia,"
00:39:23,00:39:25,"between five and 10 million years from now,"
00:39:25,00:39:31,"as the Somalian-Newbian tectonic plates move apart from the Arabian plate,"
00:39:31,00:39:33,cracks keep appearing.
00:39:33,00:39:37,"In Ethiopia in 2005, a big crack just appeared in the desert."
00:39:37,00:39:37,Terrifying.
00:39:37,00:39:40,So now I was reading an article about this on Quartz.
00:39:40,00:39:42,I just want to read you the last sentences.
00:39:42,00:39:46,"This also means, as well as getting seaside, great news."
00:39:46,00:39:48,"""These countries can finally be directly connected"
00:39:48,00:39:50,to subsea internet cables.
00:39:50,00:39:53,"If that technology will not have been bypassed by them,"
00:39:53,00:39:54,"assuming that millions of years down the line,"
00:39:54,00:39:57,"nation states will still exist in the form that they do now."""
00:39:57,00:40:01,So actually just on the internet in Uzbekistan.
00:40:01,00:40:08,So there's a lot of issues in Monday with corruption and cheating and exams.
00:40:08,00:40:10,"You've got about 400,000 students each year competing"
00:40:10,00:40:13,"for about 50,000 university places."
00:40:13,00:40:16,"And so they have loads of different kind of ways of cheating to try and,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,"you know, get them into uni."
00:40:18,00:40:21,So they bribe invigilators to turn blind eye to phone use
00:40:21,00:40:23,and people will use the parachute technique.
00:40:23,00:40:24,"Well, if they..."
00:40:24,00:40:24,Can I have a guess?
00:40:24,00:40:25,"Go on, go on, yeah."
00:40:25,00:40:27,"Parachutes are very tightly folded, aren't they?"
00:40:27,00:40:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:40:27,00:40:28,They're very tightly folded.
00:40:28,00:40:30,So have you folded up?
00:40:30,00:40:35,And you pull a card and a huge bit of cloth with all the answers comes up.
00:40:35,00:40:38,"Yeah, you've sort of written incredibly tiny writing"
00:40:38,00:40:39,on a very tightly folded bit of silk.
00:40:40,00:40:42,"I love that. It's not, I'm afraid."
00:40:42,00:40:44,It's basically they just chuck it out the window to somebody below
00:40:44,00:40:47,who then just corrects the answer.
00:40:47,00:40:52,The exam paper out the window to correct the answer and they just chuck it back up.
00:40:52,00:40:54,"No, sorry, what?"
00:40:54,00:40:54,Yeah.
00:40:54,00:40:55,How did they chuck it back up?
00:40:55,00:40:57,"So, hang on, you're doing your exam?"
00:40:57,00:40:58,Yeah.
00:40:58,00:41:02,"You have to find a way of going, ""Oh, no! Why is that in the window?"""
00:41:02,00:41:08,And then you also have to find a way of unfolding the paper aeroplane in a way that no one notices.
00:41:09,00:41:14,"Yeah, basically now the telecoms companies, the three major kind of network providers,"
00:41:14,00:41:19,all very conveniently have technical difficulties that they need to solve for like this five-hour
00:41:19,00:41:21,period where everybody's taking exams.
00:41:21,00:41:23,"But it's, yeah, it's just mad."
00:41:23,00:41:26,"Oh, another way that people would do, they would hide notes in, I quote,"
00:41:26,00:41:28,"""renaissance style hairstyles."""
00:41:28,00:41:31,So they're just kind of crib cheeks stuffed in there.
00:41:31,00:41:36,"If you have a big enough ruff, you can just write the answer and spin it round to whatever bit of the"
00:41:36,00:41:37,curriculum they ask about.
00:41:37,00:41:39,"There we go, very nice, very nice."
00:41:39,00:41:43,"James, did you ever see those landlocked, I'm asking James specifically,"
00:41:43,00:41:47,the landlocked population of sharks in Australia?
00:41:47,00:41:50,"Oh, no, I haven't seen, are they on a golf course?"
00:41:50,00:41:50,They're on a golf course.
00:41:50,00:41:51,"Yeah, I am aware of them."
00:41:51,00:41:52,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:52,00:41:54,And they washed in in the 90s.
00:41:54,00:41:54,That's right.
00:41:54,00:41:57,"And for years they were like the nessie of this golf course,"
00:41:57,00:41:59,because there wasn't a big lake on the golf course.
00:41:59,00:42:02,It's called the Carburett Golf Club in Queensland.
00:42:02,00:42:03,How did they wash in?
00:42:03,00:42:07,"Well, exactly, the area floods every now and again."
00:42:07,00:42:09,It's prone to flooding.
00:42:09,00:42:13,"So every several years they might have a really big flood, which sort of connects the sea to the..."
00:42:13,00:42:17,And bull sharks are very good at living in water of mixed salinity.
00:42:17,00:42:18,So they...
00:42:18,00:42:18,"Brackish, like you say."
00:42:18,00:42:20,Brackish.
00:42:20,00:42:20,Not rainy.
00:42:20,00:42:22,They're a home in the Brack.
00:42:22,00:42:26,"They have special, fun fact, rectal glands, which allow them to excrete salt."
00:42:26,00:42:29,So they can survive in saltier water or they can survive in less salty water.
00:42:29,00:42:32,Do they do it as like table salt or like mold and flakes?
00:42:32,00:42:33,So what are we talking about?
00:42:33,00:42:34,No.
00:42:34,00:42:36,"That's the third pot on the table, isn't it?"
00:42:36,00:42:37,"Shark, ain't a salt."
00:42:37,00:42:40,It'll catch on.
00:42:40,00:42:42,"Yeah, and so someone went there."
00:42:42,00:42:44,"A golfer named Scott Wagstaff said,"
00:42:44,00:42:47,"""I'm going to prove that this Aussie nessie is down here."""
00:42:47,00:42:49,He went down there with a camera and some meat.
00:42:49,00:42:52,"And he got them, he got them on film."
00:42:52,00:42:54,"And yeah, they haven't been seen since 2015."
00:42:54,00:42:56,And the area did flood again in 2013.
00:42:56,00:42:57,So it's possible they washed out.
00:42:57,00:42:58,That's interesting.
00:42:58,00:43:01,I once went to a restaurant where there was sharks.
00:43:01,00:43:03,"Well, it was..."
00:43:03,00:43:03,Where was it?
00:43:03,00:43:05,It was Dr. Evil's secret letter.
00:43:05,00:43:06,It was like that.
00:43:06,00:43:10,I think it was in Mauritius and you were beyond tables
00:43:10,00:43:13,and the tables were floating on the sea.
00:43:13,00:43:15,Sharks swimming around.
00:43:15,00:43:16,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:43:16,00:43:17,And then the...
00:43:17,00:43:18,"Did they have signs like,"
00:43:18,00:43:20,"""Do not feed the sharks under the table like a dog""?"
00:43:20,00:43:21,"Yeah, yeah, you weren't allowed to feed them."
00:43:21,00:43:24,But the waiters would come round.
00:43:24,00:43:29,They would bring some meat and they would throw little bits of meat into the water next to you.
00:43:29,00:43:31,"And then the sharks would come up and snap, snap, snap, snap."
00:43:31,00:43:32,But what?
00:43:32,00:43:33,And then you'd eat the rest of your meal.
00:43:33,00:43:36,That's an incredible restaurant to go to.
00:43:36,00:43:36,Isn't it?
00:43:36,00:43:41,"So if you were the waiter and someone really annoyed you,"
00:43:41,00:43:43,could you accidentally spill a tray of meat on them
00:43:43,00:43:45,so they'd be devoured by the sharks?
00:43:45,00:43:46,The shark would have to be able to jump out.
00:43:46,00:43:48,It would have to be like one of those make-o sharks
00:43:48,00:43:51,"that can jump out of the water, but I don't think they were those."
00:43:51,00:43:51,"So, but aren't you..."
00:43:51,00:43:53,"Sorry, you're sitting with your waists."
00:43:53,00:43:53,There's water.
00:43:53,00:43:55,"No, no, you're on an island."
00:43:55,00:43:56,You're on an island.
00:43:56,00:43:56,You're on an island.
00:43:56,00:43:57,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:43:57,00:43:59,"Right, what I got is that you're on an island."
00:43:59,00:44:00,You're floating.
00:44:00,00:44:02,You're on a floating island where the table is.
00:44:02,00:44:05,"The table must have a platform underneath it, right?"
00:44:05,00:44:06,Because you don't have the tables floating.
00:44:06,00:44:08,So you're not saying that you're way deeper water
00:44:08,00:44:09,"and there are sharks in here, right?"
00:44:09,00:44:09,Because that's what I am.
00:44:09,00:44:11,That's what I was guessing at the time.
00:44:11,00:44:14,"I mean, you wouldn't go twice, would you?"
00:44:14,00:44:17,You're very cold and you're very tense.
00:44:17,00:44:19,"Oh, and that huge tip."
00:44:19,00:44:20,Was the food good?
00:44:20,00:44:21,Yeah.
00:44:21,00:44:21,Yeah.
00:44:21,00:44:22,It was good.
00:44:22,00:44:23,Did it cost an arm and a leg?
00:44:23,00:44:34,"OK, it's time for our final fact of the show, and that is James."
00:44:34,00:44:38,"OK, my fact this week is that wombat burrows can be explored"
00:44:38,00:44:42,by a special robot called a wombot.
00:44:42,00:44:47,"Oh, it's so good."
00:44:47,00:44:50,So why are we exploring wombat burrows?
00:44:50,00:44:50,Yes.
00:44:50,00:44:51,I feel like it's none of our business.
00:44:51,00:44:54,"Well, you might want to learn stuff about wombats."
00:44:54,00:44:55,None of my business.
00:44:55,00:45:00,"With that, the spirit of the Enlightenment died for that."
00:45:00,00:45:04,"Does it look, is it a fake wombat?"
00:45:04,00:45:06,Would a wombat be able to know that it was a wombot?
00:45:06,00:45:09,"No, it doesn't look like a wombat."
00:45:09,00:45:09,OK.
00:45:09,00:45:13,It looks like a small black box with tank wheels.
00:45:13,00:45:13,OK.
00:45:13,00:45:15,Caterpillar tracks.
00:45:15,00:45:16,"Oh, nice."
00:45:16,00:45:16,OK.
00:45:16,00:45:21,"And this was something I read on the improbable website,"
00:45:21,00:45:23,run by our friends at the Ig Nobel Prizes.
00:45:23,00:45:29,And it was made by Scott Carver and Robert Ross.
00:45:29,00:45:33,And I think an honest student called Elizabeth Brown has worked.
00:45:33,00:45:34,"Yeah, that's right."
00:45:34,00:45:36,But this was at the University of Tasmania.
00:45:36,00:45:39,"And this is a really interesting thing, right?"
00:45:39,00:45:45,"So I've written to Dr. Carver, and he's given me lots of information."
00:45:45,00:45:47,And this is incredible.
00:45:47,00:45:51,"So wombat burrows are really difficult to get in,"
00:45:51,00:45:52,because they're quite small.
00:45:52,00:45:53,They're the size of a wombat.
00:45:53,00:45:55,Wombat's quite big.
00:45:55,00:45:56,I've seen a wombat in the zoo.
00:45:56,00:45:59,"They're big, but they're smaller than you, for instance."
00:45:59,00:46:00,"Yeah, OK."
00:46:00,00:46:02,It'd be tough for you to get in.
00:46:02,00:46:02,"Yeah, yeah."
00:46:02,00:46:07,"But it would be possible for, say, a 13 or 14-year-old boy to get in."
00:46:07,00:46:08,OK.
00:46:08,00:46:15,And until Scott Carver and Robert Ross and Elizabeth Brown
00:46:15,00:46:20,"and their friends made this machine, the only information we had"
00:46:20,00:46:24,"about wombat burrows was from a schoolboy called Peter Nicholson,"
00:46:24,00:46:31,"who in the 1960s, with a torch and a spade, went into wombat burrows"
00:46:31,00:46:34,and made observations of the wombats that he encountered.
00:46:34,00:46:35,It's so good.
00:46:35,00:46:36,It's so good.
00:46:36,00:46:40,"Literally, he wrote up his account in the school magazine."
00:46:40,00:46:44,"And until the last few years, this was the best information we had"
00:46:44,00:46:46,about wombat burrows.
00:46:46,00:46:47,I'm so jealous.
00:46:47,00:46:47,He's so cool.
00:46:47,00:46:49,That's a childhood fantasy.
00:46:49,00:46:53,You crawl into a badger set and you find them all drinking tea on the ground.
00:46:53,00:46:57,"So I read, there was a documentary by ABC,"
00:46:57,00:46:59,"so the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,"
00:46:59,00:47:02,and they kind of interviewed Peter Nicholson.
00:47:02,00:47:04,"So he was at Timotop boarding school in Victoria,"
00:47:04,00:47:07,and he and a friend stumbled upon the burrows.
00:47:07,00:47:09,"He was, I think, nine stone and six feet tall."
00:47:09,00:47:12,"So he was, you know, skinny enough that he could shuffle down."
00:47:12,00:47:15,"He was chased out by a female wombat at the time, a wild dog."
00:47:15,00:47:16,But chased out forwards or backwards.
00:47:16,00:47:20,"I think he probably ended up shuffling backwards and out, sort of, you know, feet first."
00:47:20,00:47:20,"Well, exactly."
00:47:20,00:47:23,"That's scary if you can't, if you have to."
00:47:23,00:47:27,"Also, and if they tilt down, you'll have to climb backwards and upwards."
00:47:27,00:47:30,"Oh, God, you've taken me right back to a very upsetting experience I had"
00:47:30,00:47:33,"in an underground car park in Slovenia, where I had to reverse out."
00:47:33,00:47:37,"Oh, my God, Andy, enough about your travel-adding, though."
00:47:37,00:47:39,It's Jesus Christ.
00:47:39,00:47:41,"Oh, you're ever talking about..."
00:47:41,00:47:43,"Oh, it was the first time I'd driven for years."
00:47:43,00:47:46,"And it was right down, like, very steep ramp down to the barrier,"
00:47:46,00:47:49,which was then closed for whatever reason.
00:47:49,00:47:53,And I had completely forgotten how to do a reverse hill start.
00:47:53,00:47:56,And that was the most stressful 20 minutes of that year.
00:47:56,00:47:57,It was horrible.
00:47:57,00:47:58,And there was sharks swimming under it.
00:47:58,00:48:04,"There was no agreed female wombat outside of the barrier, which would have made it worse."
00:48:04,00:48:07,"They weren't all, like, horrible wombats, though."
00:48:07,00:48:10,He did become friends with one wombat in particular.
00:48:10,00:48:13,"So when he would go down there, and he would go to genuinely,"
00:48:13,00:48:17,he would go down and he would just sit with the wombat for a while.
00:48:17,00:48:20,"Sometimes if the wombat would grunt, he'd grunt back just to try and,"
00:48:20,00:48:22,"you know, kind of replicate what he was doing."
00:48:22,00:48:26,"The wombat would come over and sniff him, or pour on him."
00:48:26,00:48:28,"Even followed him out on a cloudy day, because they're normally nocturnal,"
00:48:28,00:48:31,"so they would stay inside during the day, but he came out on one day."
00:48:31,00:48:35,"And they just sat together outside, him and this friendly wombat."
00:48:35,00:48:36,It's incredible.
00:48:36,00:48:37,That is a beautiful story.
00:48:37,00:48:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:48:37,00:48:40,It's a kids book and it makes you believe it.
00:48:40,00:48:42,"But anyway, now we can do it with robots."
00:48:42,00:48:45,"So kids, get out of the bar."
00:48:45,00:48:46,"And the wombat is fitted with lasers,"
00:48:46,00:48:50,and it can eliminate any wombat it comes across.
00:48:50,00:48:54,"Well, they have to, like, for instance, because of your problem, Andy,"
00:48:54,00:48:57,"they have to have, like, cameras on the front and the back,"
00:48:57,00:48:59,because so often you have to reverse and you can't turn around.
00:48:59,00:49:02,So that's one problem that they had.
00:49:02,00:49:06,They tied a rope to it just in case they got completely stuck
00:49:06,00:49:07,and they could just drag it out.
00:49:07,00:49:09,So that's kind of a lo-fi way of dealing with it.
00:49:09,00:49:12,"And they found something really important,"
00:49:12,00:49:15,which is wombats have been getting this parasite.
00:49:15,00:49:17,It's like a scabies kind of thing.
00:49:17,00:49:19,"And it's been very, very bad for the wombat."
00:49:19,00:49:22,"And they found, thanks to their wombat,"
00:49:22,00:49:27,"that mites can survive much longer inside the burrows,"
00:49:27,00:49:29,which people didn't realize before.
00:49:29,00:49:30,People thought the mites would just die.
00:49:30,00:49:33,"But now we know that if your wombat leaves a burrow,"
00:49:33,00:49:36,"and then another wombat goes in, which happens quite often,"
00:49:36,00:49:41,that's a way that this disease can spread from one wombat to another wombat.
00:49:41,00:49:41,That's interesting.
00:49:41,00:49:42,And that's something we didn't know before.
00:49:42,00:49:43,That's very cool.
00:49:43,00:49:44,"James, just quickly."
00:49:44,00:49:47,That vision of the wombat with a rope tied around it
00:49:47,00:49:51,"is kind of like an Australian version of the theseus and the minotaur myth, isn't it?"
00:49:51,00:49:53,That's exactly what I thought of weirdly when you said that.
00:49:53,00:49:55,One of my favorite facts about theseus and the minotaur.
00:49:55,00:49:59,"So a ball of string was called C-L-E-W, a clue."
00:49:59,00:50:03,"And essentially, that's where our modern word for ""clu"" comes from."
00:50:03,00:50:03,Really?
00:50:03,00:50:06,You're following a clue backwards out of a maze.
00:50:06,00:50:08,"So it's a ""lea"", essentially."
00:50:08,00:50:08,Yeah.
00:50:08,00:50:09,That's so good.
00:50:09,00:50:10,That is so cool.
00:50:10,00:50:11,"Yeah, it's really fun."
00:50:11,00:50:13,"But I also know something about wombats,"
00:50:13,00:50:18,"and that is that they are fluorescent under UV light, but so are scabies."
00:50:18,00:50:23,"However, the wombats glow blue, but scabies glow green."
00:50:23,00:50:26,"So if you were to shine a black light at a wombat,"
00:50:26,00:50:27,"you could tell if it's got scabies,"
00:50:27,00:50:30,if it's got little kind of green flecks coming through the glitter.
00:50:30,00:50:30,Question.
00:50:30,00:50:31,Yeah.
00:50:31,00:50:35,"If there is a bit of a scabies outbreak in the UK at the moment, apparently,"
00:50:35,00:50:40,"and if I went to a nightclub, as I haven't done for 10 years,"
00:50:40,00:50:42,"but if I was to go to a nightclub,"
00:50:42,00:50:46,would I be able to know that someone talking to me had scabies
00:50:46,00:50:48,because they would glow?
00:50:48,00:50:53,There would be like little green kind of areas where they are on the scene.
00:50:53,00:50:54,"If you get up close and take their clothes off,"
00:50:54,00:50:56,which often people do in nightclubs anyway.
00:50:56,00:50:57,"People are incredibly glad, yeah."
00:50:57,00:50:59,"Yeah, easy."
00:50:59,00:51:00,"Okay, that's public service."
00:51:00,00:51:02,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:51:02,00:51:05,"So yeah, so thank you to Dr. Carver"
00:51:05,00:51:07,for sending me all this information.
00:51:07,00:51:09,"If you want to learn more, then you can go to his Twitter,"
00:51:09,00:51:13,which is @scot_s_carver.
00:51:13,00:51:16,"And the last question I asked him was,"
00:51:16,00:51:18,"""Do you know that there's a US zoo"
00:51:18,00:51:21,"which claims to have had the world's oldest wombat?"""
00:51:21,00:51:22,And it was called Carver.
00:51:22,00:51:24,"Huh, lovely."
00:51:24,00:51:25,Isn't that amazing?
00:51:25,00:51:25,I thought--
00:51:25,00:51:26,Did you know that?
00:51:26,00:51:29,"I said, ""I just thought you'd be interested in that coincidence."""
00:51:29,00:51:30,"And he said, ""Cool fact."
00:51:30,00:51:35,"That wombat is a southern hairy-nosed wombat,"
00:51:35,00:51:37,"whereas our work has been bare-nosed wombat."""
00:51:37,00:51:42,"You must have felt so stupid when he's so young, yeah."
00:51:42,00:51:43,Oh my god.
00:51:43,00:51:45,"And apparently, to the best of his knowledge,"
00:51:45,00:51:47,"the oldest bare-nosed wombat is captivity,"
00:51:47,00:51:49,is in Japan and is called Wayne.
00:51:49,00:51:52,"So that put me in my place, yeah."
00:51:52,00:51:54,"Yeah, here's a riddle for you all."
00:51:54,00:51:59,"""What animal is the biggest user of a wombat burrow?"""
00:51:59,00:52:00,Wombat.
00:52:00,00:52:02,Yes!
00:52:02,00:52:05,Thank goodness someone's fallen into my cunningly laid trap.
00:52:05,00:52:06,Australian teenage boys.
00:52:06,00:52:07,That's it.
00:52:07,00:52:12,"Okay, so something else uses wombat burrows."
00:52:12,00:52:15,Is it going to be something of a similar size to a wombat?
00:52:15,00:52:17,"Sounds like it's going to be bigger, doesn't it?"
00:52:17,00:52:17,Is it?
00:52:17,00:52:18,"Oh, hold on."
00:52:18,00:52:22,"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not sure it's that heavy."
00:52:22,00:52:23,I've misunderstood the question.
00:52:23,00:52:28,"It was unfigurously worded, and I thought you meant biggest in size."
00:52:28,00:52:30,"You know, like maybe a wallaby sneaks in there."
00:52:30,00:52:31,She's got it.
00:52:31,00:52:33,"She's, I don't know how you've done it."
00:52:33,00:52:34,How the hell did she get that?
00:52:34,00:52:36,The most frequent user of wombat burrows is the flip-flip.
00:52:36,00:52:40,"To be fair, Ada, I did notice she'd throw a piece of paper out of the window just before."
00:52:40,00:52:45,The black-footed rock wallaby.
00:52:45,00:52:48,But wombats will tolerate other animals in their burrows
00:52:48,00:52:49,if there's something like a fire going on above ground.
00:52:49,00:52:51,There was a story that went kind of viral
00:52:51,00:52:53,that the wombats were rounding up other animals.
00:52:53,00:52:56,Rounding them up and then sort of assassinating them in the burrows.
00:52:56,00:52:58,"No, protecting them from the wildfires."
00:52:58,00:52:59,"Oh, right, sorry."
00:52:59,00:53:01,And they're amazing thermal buffers.
00:53:01,00:53:03,"You know, it can be incredibly hot above ground."
00:53:03,00:53:06,"Even if there's not a fire in it, it's just, obviously, it's very, very hot underground."
00:53:06,00:53:08,Level temperatures.
00:53:08,00:53:09,Good to know.
00:53:09,00:53:10,Look out for a wombat burrow.
00:53:10,00:53:12,Last resort.
00:53:13,00:53:15,Just on robots and mimic animals.
00:53:15,00:53:17,Biomimicry.
00:53:17,00:53:18,Biomimicry.
00:53:18,00:53:24,"Apparently, we are soon going to have zoos full of robots instead of animals."
00:53:24,00:53:27,This is the great suggestion.
00:53:27,00:53:32,And they've started making robots that look exactly like certain animals.
00:53:32,00:53:35,"So that when you go to a zoo, rather than keeping, I don't know,"
00:53:35,00:53:38,"a panda captive or a cheetah or something, you just look at a robot."
00:53:38,00:53:42,"And they've actually, they've got Del the Dolphin was one that I discovered."
00:53:43,00:53:44,Delboy.
00:53:44,00:53:46,"Also, but the Delphin."
00:53:46,00:53:52,"So Del the Dolphin is designed by one of the creative directors at Disney, in fact,"
00:53:52,00:53:56,"who is now working on this and the person who made Free Willy,"
00:53:56,00:53:57,which we talked about recently.
00:53:57,00:54:00,They're more cost effective because obviously you don't have to feed them.
00:54:00,00:54:01,"But then you can't really do feeding time,"
00:54:01,00:54:04,"which is part of the fun of the zoo, I suppose, I guess."
00:54:04,00:54:08,"Well, unless you're feeding them a robot fish, that's probably fine."
00:54:08,00:54:10,"Yeah, although then that stops being cost effective, I suppose,"
00:54:10,00:54:12,when you've got to generate a hundred robot fish every day.
00:54:12,00:54:16,"But yeah, apparently rather than having animals, we'll just have robots."
00:54:16,00:54:17,I think that sounds great.
00:54:17,00:54:17,Yeah.
00:54:17,00:54:22,There is a temple in India which has replaced its elephant with a robo elephant.
00:54:22,00:54:26,"And that's again, on grounds of animal stress levels,"
00:54:26,00:54:30,because lots of temples in India have live elephants.
00:54:30,00:54:36,So the Irringidapili Shri Krishna temple now has an 11 foot tall robo nearly.
00:54:36,00:54:36,"Gosh, good."
00:54:36,00:54:38,"I don't know what it, I don't know what it can do."
00:54:39,00:54:42,I don't know if it can amusingly hoover up a peanut.
00:54:42,00:54:45,This is the touch of Roomba to its trunk.
00:54:45,00:54:47,Yeah.
00:54:47,00:54:50,Here's one more thing.
00:54:50,00:54:53,"In America, they have a problem with poaching some places."
00:54:53,00:55:00,And one way that they deal with it is they put lures out to the poachers.
00:55:00,00:55:03,But you don't really want to lure with a real animal.
00:55:03,00:55:05,So they started doing it with robots.
00:55:05,00:55:08,"And the idea is you would get a robotic, say, bear."
00:55:09,00:55:12,And the poacher would shoot it.
00:55:12,00:55:15,"And then as soon as they did it, you could arrest them for shooting bears."
00:55:15,00:55:16,Brilliant.
00:55:16,00:55:19,"Even though they didn't technically shoot a real bear, the intention was there."
00:55:19,00:55:24,The problem is that poachers kind of get used to it.
00:55:24,00:55:27,And so you have to make them more and more and more realistic each time
00:55:27,00:55:29,so that they think it's real.
00:55:29,00:55:33,"And so the latest thing they've done, this guy in America called Volslagle,"
00:55:34,00:55:41,"who makes these props, has invented a deer which picks up its tail and poos out brown M&Ms."
00:55:41,00:55:48,"So the poachers sit there thinking, that animal hasn't poohed for a while."
00:55:48,00:55:50,I think it might be a robot.
00:55:50,00:55:53,"And then the M&Ms come out and they go, I got it."
00:55:53,00:55:54,And they shoot it.
00:55:54,00:55:59,"And apparently this guy in Volslagle, who made it, has three kids."
00:55:59,00:56:02,And they get to eat all of the other coloured M&Ms.
00:56:02,00:56:02,Brilliant.
00:56:02,00:56:03,And then he buys them.
00:56:03,00:56:04,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant."
00:56:04,00:56:05,So that's cool.
00:56:05,00:56:08,And that's why Van Halen wants it to have no brown M&Ms on the ride.
00:56:08,00:56:11,They knew they were needed for the robot.
00:56:11,00:56:18,"Okay, that's it."
00:56:18,00:56:18,That's all of our facts.
00:56:18,00:56:20,Thank you so much for listening.
