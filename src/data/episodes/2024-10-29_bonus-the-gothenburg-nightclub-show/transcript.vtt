00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 (upbeat music)

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880
 Hello, club fish members.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.400
 I hope you are all well, as indeed we are.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.080
 Although I must say we are a little bit tired

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.520
 because at the moment we are right in the middle of our tour.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.600
 We've done quite a lot of dates in the UK, in Ireland.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.480
 We've got some more UK dates coming up at time of recording

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.080
 and then we go off to Australia and New Zealand.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.280
 But in the middle of all that,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.320
 we found a little bit of time to go to Gothenburg.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.160
 And while we were there,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.880
 we were asked to do a nighttime late night gig.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.200
 Now, we didn't really know what to expect.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.840
 Anna actually didn't make it at all

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.600
 'cause she had to go back to the UK.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.840
 But me, Dan, and Andy went to this nightclub

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.000
 as it turned out.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.520
 And what we decided to do was to do a little quiz

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.000
 about things that we'd said

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 on No Such Things as a Fish in the first year.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.200
 So you can play along at home.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.560
 One thing to say is that it does sound

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.360
 like we're doing this in front of no one at all

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.820
 'cause there were no audience mics.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.680
 But I can assure you there were at least a couple

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.520
 of dozen of people watching this,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.680
 as well as the many more dozens of people

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520
 who were just enjoying their night in the nightclub,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 completely unaware that we were doing this show at all.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600
 Anyway, I really hope you enjoy it.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.720
 We'll be back in a couple of weeks

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.840
 with another bit of material,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.160
 maybe another episode of Drop As A Line.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 I hope we'll be recording one of those soon.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.720
 But in the meantime, all that's left to say

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.260
 is on with the bonus material.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.840
 (upbeat music)

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.420
 (upbeat music)

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.080
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.660
 (upbeat music)

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.240
 (upbeat music)

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 - Well, this is fucking weird.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.200
 We're very excited to be here.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.680
 I just had a curiosity.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.000
 So we're a UK podcast called No Such Things as a Fish.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 Has anyone in this vicinity heard it before?

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560
 Yes, some people have heard it.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 Who here in the vicinity has not heard it before?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.840
 - Oh wow, quite a few.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.680
 - 50/50.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.520
 - That's quite a few.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.920
 - That's interesting, okay.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.940
 - Okay, so we're from the UK

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.760
 and we basically make a podcast

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.040
 where we talk about the most interesting facts

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.000
 that we've found over the last seven days.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.420
 It's not like a cool fact that it's useful

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.200
 for finance and stuff like that.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.720
 It's stuff where it can be interesting

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.560
 and funny at the same time.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040
 James, you got one about a thing you came up with.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.360
 - Yeah, I certainly don't use this for financial advice.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.400
 - Right. - For sure, don't do that.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.200
 I like to kind of work out my own facts.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.680
 And one that I realized recently is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.240
 that they've recently found out

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440
 that there is microplastics in human semen.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440
 It's very, very small amounts, so don't worry.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.600
 But I worked out that if you wanted to make a Lego brick

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.840
 with that plastic,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.000
 you would have to ejaculate 100 billion times.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.020
 - Yeah, and how many in are you?

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.220
 (laughing)

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.220
 - Well, we all had to have a COVID hobby, didn't we?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.620
 - Yeah.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.940
 - We always have quite a nerdy crowd in our shows.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.700
 Is anyone here in academia does academic stuff?

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.380
 Is anyone from the University of Gothenburg?

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.900
 - One. - Okay.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.140
 - Yes, one. - Right.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.020
 We have a bone to pick with you.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.860
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 - Because this is the second time

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.460
 that we've been in Gothenburg.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.660
 - Yeah. - And the first time,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.860
 some people stole our blood.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.820
 - Oh, yeah.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.540
 We were here six years ago,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.620
 and we were part of an experiment at the university.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.540
 The university emailed us saying,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.260
 we'd like to do an experiment on you

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.340
 where we take your blood

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.020
 and we can tell you what you had for breakfast.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.020
 - I think as we already knew what we had for breakfast.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.780
 - Well, that's true, but they didn't.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.860
 (laughing)

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.820
 So we all went along to the university buildings.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.600
 There was a science lab they had there.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.440
 Took our blood.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.500
 We've never heard from them again.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.660
 We have no idea.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.020
 - Our blood samples are in your city, and...

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.860
 - There are people.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.980
 Maybe there are clones of us around Gothenburg right now.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.660
 - Wouldn't that be amazing if right now

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.340
 your kids were introduced onto stage?

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.700
 This is an intervention.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.540
 - What a reveal.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.060
 - That would be amazing.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.300
 - My theory is that we all have such unusual breakfasts

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.460
 that they couldn't work it out

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.260
 and they were too embarrassed to tell us.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.100
 - Yeah.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.860
 - None of these people had any pickled fish

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.980
 for their breakfast.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.180
 Sorry, sorry, it was a lazy duck.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.540
 (laughing)

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.220
 I actually, so I'm running on NoSleep for about 20,

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.460
 how long has it been now?

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.660
 Over 24 hours.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.500
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.820
 - I was at a party last night in London.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.780
 Has anyone ever done this?

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.860
 I decided at 2 a.m. when I was still partying,

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.420
 I was like, I'll just go to the airport now

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.660
 for my 9 a.m. flight, otherwise I might miss it.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.540
 And I couldn't fall asleep at the airport.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.340
 So I've had like 11 breakfasts today.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.020
 (laughing)

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.580
 If they took my sample right now,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.540
 they would be like, you should be dead.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.900
 - You're 98% breakfast.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.460
 - Yeah, exactly, yeah.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.300
 It's wild.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.940
 - Okay, so what are we gonna do today, Dan?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.060
 - Well, okay, so we are,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.140
 the reason we're over here is

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.700
 we're currently on a 10 year celebration tour.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.340
 We are 10 years into our podcast life.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.220
 It's been really amazing.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.860
 We're currently on tour in the UK.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.780
 - Said I've been missing for 10 years.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.620
 - You have? - Have you?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.460
 - Really?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.300
 You're a 10 year old?

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.140
 - You as well.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.980
 - That's off.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.820
 - Okay, cool.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.100
 - We have a massive archive of all the facts.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.420
 We thought we'd go into the archive

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.060
 and pick out some of our favorite facts to tell you.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.020
 - Maybe some from the first ever year of fish.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.860
 - That's nice.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.100
 - We've got every fact that we mentioned

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.300
 in the first year of fish, every headline.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.140
 - Amazing.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.260
 - And let's see if you remember any of them.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.580
 Okay, so.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.140
 - The two people who've been listening for 10 years,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.140
 you're in this game as well.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.980
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.820
 (laughing)

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.660
 - Well, the other one,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.780
 some of you might be able to guess some of them.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.420
 Like, here's an example of one that we said that year.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.980
 The Slovakian and Slovenian embassies in Washington

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.860
 meet once a month to exchange rungly-addressed mail.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.700
 - Yes.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.540
 - Oh, yeah.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.380
 - That's a great fact.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.220
 Do you remember that one?

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.060
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.420
 There's a similar fact, which is that

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.420
 the actors, Carrie Grant and Clark Gable

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.620
 used to meet up after Christmas

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.380
 and exchange gifts that had CG printed on it.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.500
 There's like, I hate this towel.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.580
 No, actually, I like that towel.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.820
 Cool, I'll get the belt buckle and they would do swaps.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.660
 - Exactly.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.620
 - It's with the tennis player, Andy Murray, don't you, Andy?

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.020
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.860
 Yeah.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.700
 (laughing)

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.540
 - Oh my God.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.380
 - Oh no.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.200
 (laughing)

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.740
 Andy is called Andrew Hunter Murray,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.940
 but we call him Andy Murray and--

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.060
 - As everyone else did until I was 17.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.900
 - Yeah, right.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:17.740
 - And then this tennis guy started out.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.220
 - And then the tennis player came along.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.380
 - Well, he's retired now, so maybe he could reclaim it.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.580
 - I would hope so.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.420
 - That's true.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.260
 - He's had a good term.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.080
 (laughing)

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.920
 And now it's time.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.900
 - So when we started our podcast,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.100
 it's really exciting when you start a podcast, by the way.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.680
 I don't know if there's any podcasters out here,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.780
 but you start seeing numbers come in

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.300
 and you start having people message you about it.

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.460
 And it was really exciting for us

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.980
 and we didn't know where it was going.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.180
 And we got offered a gig in Belgium

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.180
 and we'd never done an international gig before

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.140
 and it was incredibly exciting.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.020
 So we get there and there's all this media attention

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.180
 about our podcast.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.700
 And we're like, wow, we must have just a big fan base here

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.700
 and they wanted us on TV, they wanted us on radio.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.420
 And we quickly discovered when we got there,

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.060
 the headlines were Wimbledon Tennis Champion,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:03.860
 Andy Murray comes to do nerdy podcast in Belgium.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.700
 - Yeah.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.460
 (laughing)

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.300
 - Whoa, have we got another?

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.940
 - Okay, here's a question.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.220
 So this is to see what you remember.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.900
 We did a fact in the first year

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.060
 that according to the government of the Czech Republic,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.500
 there are three symbols of Easter in Czechia.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.740
 Can you guess what those three symbols of Easter

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.580
 - Yes.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.420
 - In Czechia are?

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.900
 - One of them is lambs.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.820
 - Easter lambs.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.660
 - Easter lambs.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.860
 - Which is kind of the same around the world, right?

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.700
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.540
 - Do you want to have a crack?

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.700
 - Can you think of rabbits?

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.620
 - No, think of something for Easter

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.740
 that you might give your kids, for instance.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:39.580
 - Chocolate.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.420
 - Yeah, Easter eggs.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.620
 - Easter eggs, sorry.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.940
 - But the third one is a little bit more unusual.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.180
 - I think I remember it.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.420
 - Yeah?

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.940
 - Is it whipping?

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.420
 Sorry, no, I'm not.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.700
 - You'd better hope this is right.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.860
 Otherwise that's the weirdest thing that anyone's ever guessed.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.180
 - Is it whipping?

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.020
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.180
 - The Easter whip.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.020
 - But what does it mean?

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.180
 Why would you whip someone?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.660
 Like, what was the deal there?

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.500
 Can you remember?

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.180
 - Oh, no.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.100
 I have no idea.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.940
 - Well, it was a tradition on Easter Monday

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.940
 that lads would whip young maids to be cheerful, it says here.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.100
 Don't know what that means.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100
 - Did it work?

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.220
 Were there controlled trials?

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.980
 - I think it's more like, you know,

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.900
 chasing each other around and stuff like that.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.740
 - Okay.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.580
 - Which is kind of cool.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:27.980
 In Lancashire, where I come from, which is in England,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.620
 we used to have a thing.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.060
 Now, this was a hundred years before I was born.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:32.900
 - Sure.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.780
 - There was a way that boys and girls would meet each other.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.500
 It was called promenading.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.420
 And what would happen is you would get on a street

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.500
 and all the girls would stand on one of the pavements

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.940
 and all the boys would stand on the other pavement

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.700
 and they would just stand there in silence

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.540
 for like 15 minutes.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.500
 And all you'd be looking for is someone to smile at you

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.500
 or you wouldn't say anything.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.340
 - To acknowledge you at all.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.180
 - Yeah, you're just looking for a little bit of eye contact

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.020
 or whatever.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.780
 And then everyone went home.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.340
 And then you just had to stay at home.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.860
 And then if you'd got like a Tinder match kind of thing,

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.940
 then they would leave you some flowers

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.700
 outside your front door and you would know that you got,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.980
 and then you would do the same to them.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.980
 And if it was a match, then you would go on a date.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.820
 - That's very nice.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.900
 - It's amazing that we had any children at all.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.660
 (laughing)

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.500
 - That's so cool.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.340
 - Okay, here's the thing.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.500
 Here's a question for you.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.060
 Again, one of our early facts.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.420
 One of the last things that NASA had to do

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:30.080
 before launching space shuttles was what?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.480
 - Make sure the astronauts know where their keys are.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.320
 - Oh yeah.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.240
 - Because you know, it's like when you get back

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.080
 from a holiday and you're like,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.920
 "Where are the keys?"

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.920
 You know, that.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.760
 - Oh, you weren't thinking keys for the spaceship.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.320
 - No, sorry, no, no, no, but you do need those too.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.280
 - Yeah, no, it's not that.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.880
 We've met some astronauts today, haven't we?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.720
 - We met some astronauts.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.560
 - There was Swedish astronauts.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.520
 - The book festival has the first two Swedish astronauts.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.600
 Very exciting.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.680
 They're upstairs now.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.760
 Well, there are two guys in spacesuits upstairs.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.080
 - I assume I don't think that's them.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:00.920
 - Is it not?

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.320
 - No, because they had a Star Trek thing on there.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.240
 - Yes, and I thought that was us.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.440
 The other guy had Battlestar Galactica on his arm.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.440
 I thought, "Come on."

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.920
 - It was all looking a bit dodgy.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.320
 Or is that your space program?

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.000
 (laughing)

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.240
 I don't want to be offensive, but it was a bit odd.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.400
 I mean, they look cool as far as they look really cool.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.480
 I really wanted to ask them.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.720
 There's a thing that apparently

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.200
 when astronauts come down to Earth,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.440
 they forget about gravity.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.360
 Like, gravity's like a forgotten concept to them.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.640
 So they'll be sort of like in the kitchen

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.600
 and they'll have like a drink.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:30.360
 They'll be like, "So anyway, I'm like,"

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.240
 and they think it's gonna hang there in the air.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.920
 And so apparently when astronauts come back,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.280
 put away your crockery

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.240
 'cause they just smash everything up.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.040
 - Apparently it's impossible to play guitar

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.000
 if you're in space to begin with.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.800
 You kind of have to teach yourself

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.880
 'cause you're holding it

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.600
 and you've got your fingers in the frets.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.960
 And because your hands don't really weigh anything,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.640
 you can't put them in the right position.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.480
 - Oh, wow.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.840
 - You just keep missing the frets all the time.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.400
 That's how Phil says that.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.360
 - Yeah, right.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.800
 So we covered ages ago that when you're in space,

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.960
 you are floating.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.000
 Obviously your limbs are floating,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.160
 your head is floating.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.480
 Also, your tongue is floating in your mouth.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.320
 - Oh, yeah.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.640
 - And your food in your stomach

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.760
 is floating inside you.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.600
 - Oh, my God.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.040
 - So it's a really strange feeling

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.600
 of not being able to, you know.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.440
 - Yeah.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.280
 - Yeah.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.800
 - I met, so James, you just mentioned Chris Hadfield.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.200
 Do you guys remember that he was the astronaut

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.920
 who played David Bowie in space?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.680
 - Good thing here as well.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.520
 Okay, yeah.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.960
 I met him once, and I had a bone to pick with him,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.880
 which is always exciting to have beef with an astronaut.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.800
 I was on a date once in London,

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.840
 and I was doing really well, I thought, on the date.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.320
 It was going really well.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.800
 And then the girl who was on the date, her phone pinged.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.160
 - Oh, he started the web page.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.560
 - Yeah, the web page happened.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.120
 Her phone pinged, and she went,

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.960
 "Oh, my God, the man I love just messaged me."

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.800
 - Oh.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.760
 - Which is a horrible thing to hear on a date.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.600
 - That's right.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.440
 - Like, that's no good.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.200
 And I was like, "Oh, that's great."

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.680
 And she showed me the email,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.400
 and it was from Chris Hadfield, the astronaut,

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.400
 who had emailed her from space.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.520
 He was in the International Space Station.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.360
 - Yeah.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.840
 - And there is nothing you can say.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.200
 Like, I had a few anecdotes.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.920
 I was gonna bust that later in the day,

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.160
 where I once shared a melted cheese sandwich

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.200
 with Paul McCartney.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.400
 Nothing, 'cause nothing I could say

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.120
 would top even Chris Hadfield being like,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.680
 "Hey, just had an apple in space."

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.520
 - No, yeah.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.360
 (laughing)

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.040
 Sorry, you shared a cheese sandwich with Paul McCartney.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.880
 - Thank you, Andy.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.720
 Yes.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.080
 - That is a good, is it a good story?

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.160
 - I was in his windmill with him, and--

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160
 - It's a good story.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.000
 (laughing)

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
 You were in his windmill?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.040
 - He has a windmill out on the countryside,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.120
 and we were, he was--

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:37.960
 - In Britain?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.680
 - In, sorry, in Britain, yeah, yeah.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.400
 And he was recording some bongos

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.840
 for a song that I was a part of.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.480
 It's really weird when you,

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.920
 Beatles, I have the best band in the world to me,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.360
 and I can understand why McCartney

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.760
 keeps putting out such shit music,

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.960
 because when you're in his presence,

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.160
 like when I heard the bongos being played by McCartney,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.880
 I was like, "This is the best fucking thing

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.120
 "since the Beatles that he's done.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.240
 "This is insane."

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.600
 Anyway, just by the way,

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.640
 the date ended with this, with my date,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.080
 with an ISS, an international space station,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.360
 app on her phone going,

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.800
 "It's going overhead right now.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.560
 "Let's go outside and wave."

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.040
 So I just had to stand there waving at Chris Hadfield.

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.240
 It was cloudy, we couldn't even fucking see it.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.080
 (laughing)

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:19.920
 And we're doing that.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.400
 So I met him years later on stage,

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.720
 and I went up to him and I said,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.520
 "Chris, you cock-blocked me from outer space, mate.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.120
 "That's what you did."

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.400
 And I was like, it was, it ruined the date.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.320
 And he said, "The coolest thing I've ever heard in my life."

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.000
 He went, "Oh man, I'm so sorry.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.960
 "I'm so sorry."

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.520
 - I'll snog you now, Dad, please.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.680
 (laughing)

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.280
 - No, he went, "I don't know what to say.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.800
 "I'm a fucking astronaut."

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.680
 And I was, "Ah, wow."

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.520
 - Stunning.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.360
 - Yeah.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.640
 - Okay. - So anyway, yeah.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.400
 So what do you think NASA had to do?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.360
 - Oh, sorry, yes, quiz question.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.000
 So what was the last thing NASA had to do?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.240
 - It's something about the launch, isn't it?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.680
 It's something they have to clear the area, or?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.760
 - They have to clear the area,

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.560
 but why do they have to clear the area?

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.200
 What is there in the area?

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.560
 - Pigs. - Pigs and alligators.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.920
 - There are pigs and alligators,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.680
 I'll admit, around Cape Canaveral,

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.280
 but really, if there's an alligator near your rocket,

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.120
 that's not gonna cause you too many problems.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120
 - Owls. - Oh, really?

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.360
 - They're bats.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.760
 - Where did you get owls from?

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.400
 - 'Cause I'm part of our show, and we've done this fact.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.640
 (laughing)

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.200
 - Because you're-- - Are there owls?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.000
 - No, no, there are not owls,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.600
 but there are birds there.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.440
 - Right.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.920
 - And the birds do get in the way,

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.720
 and so what the birds not like, owls, okay?

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.880
 So they put huge inflatable owls--

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.720
 - Really?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.080
 - Next to the space shuttle,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.760
 and then that scares away the birds,

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.600
 and the last thing they do before the shuttle goes up,

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.520
 is remove the inflatable owls.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.080
 - I mean, it's clever, but it's also stupid,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.920
 because if you had a bit of imagination,

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.280
 you would just paint the space shuttle

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.960
 to look like a massive owl.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.000
 - Yes. - Oh, yeah.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.520
 - Completely clear the area,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.800
 and also, when it goes, amazing.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.960
 - Yeah. - Like, amazing.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.480
 Put a whistle on the side, so it goes,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.720
 "Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo!"

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.440
 - Do you know if you call Cape Canaveral,

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.680
 so the dialing code, if you're calling Cape Canaveral

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.960
 where they launch the rockets.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.040
 In England, it's +44.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.400
 In Cape Canaveral, it's 3, 2, 1.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.640
 - Lovely. - Isn't that awesome?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.720
 - So good. - Yeah, that's a good one.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.800
 - Okay, here's another one.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.600
 I talked in about probably our 30th episode,

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.520
 about a computer game that had been invented,

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.400
 and there was something very unusual

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.280
 about playing this computer game.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.080
 Can you guess what it was?

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.680
 - You don't play it with your hands, you play it with--

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.920
 - With? - No, I don't like what it's saying.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.160
 - I found that.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.800
 - No, you don't play it with your penis, though.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.160
 - Thank you. Okay.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.080
 Okay. Is it something about the game itself?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.360
 - Yes, it is. - All right.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.880
 It's very big. It's very small.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.680
 - Oh, go for big. - It's very big.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.600
 - But then-- - It's a huge game.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.280
 - It's a huge game, but huge in what way?

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.680
 - Just there's loads of areas you can go.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.960
 Isn't it massive? You can run around for--

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.360
 Like, you know, the huge computer games.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.200
 You get this-- - Yeah, yeah.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.280
 No, I know what you mean. It's not like that.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.720
 - Okay. - It's huge in a different sense.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.760
 - Okay. - Think of all the different dimensions

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.400
 that it could be huge.

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.040
 - The fourth dimension, time?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.040
 - Time itself, Andrew. - Very nice.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.720
 - Time itself. - Right.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.880
 - They invented a computer game.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.240
 It was actually an art project, but it did exist.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.440
 A computer game was invented that takes more than a lifetime

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.120
 to complete. - Oh, is this the Terry Pratchett game?

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.080
 - No, that's a fake one. - Oh, right.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.880
 - Didn't he invent a game called Journey to Alpha Centauri?

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.680
 - Yeah, yeah. And you have to leave your computer

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.240
 on for four years, and at the end of it,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.240
 it just says, "Welcome to Alpha Centauri. Now go home."

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.720
 - I think that's the-- - Oh, yeah.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.920
 - Yeah, I think so. - But this is a real one.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.520
 - So this is a real one, and the idea was,

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.400
 they wanted to look at what happens

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.680
 with your digital footprint after you die.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.440
 And the idea was that you would play this computer game

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.400
 and you would get to level 273,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.280
 and then you would pass it down to your children

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.920
 who would then complete it. - Wow.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.920
 - Or even pass it on to their children who would complete it.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.160
 And it's like, if you own things, if you own digital stuff,

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.760
 is it the kind of thing you can pass down through generations?

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.240
 - Did they make it good to play?

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.400
 - No, it was really boring. - Okay.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.480
 - So I don't think anyone would ever want to play it.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.880
 It was more of a thought experiment.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.880
 - I see. Okay, that's very cool. - Yeah?

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.200
 - Oh, I love it. - Very cool, yeah.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.280
 - You want to fancy that one? - Yeah.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.160
 - Give us another one. - Okay.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.080
 Nobody knows why we blank.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.760
 - I think I know this one. - Go for it.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.240
 - Is it kiss? - It is kiss.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.160
 - Nobody knows why we kiss. - There's no accepted theory

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:46.640
 about why humans kiss each other that applies in all societies.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.200
 - Yeah, yeah. - As in it's all constructed, it's not...

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.040
 - And like, they kind of think that maybe not everyone did kiss,

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.520
 and then it kind of came over from India,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.400
 and because no one was writing about it and stuff like that.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.760
 But then other people think, well, maybe it happened even before we became humans,

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.640
 and it was actually mothers chewing up food and giving it to their children,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.280
 and that's how it came. - Right.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.120
 - Okay, well, let's not think about that too much.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:13.320
 What did we do before?

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.280
 Was it like, was it more like, you know, when Nala and Simba were making out

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.640
 and they just rubbed their heads against each other, like that kind of thing?

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.960
 - It was handshakes. It was exclusively handshakes. - Yeah.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.840
 - Until what century? About the 19th century. - And still that in the UK?

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.600
 - Oh, yeah, yeah. - We don't kiss in the UK.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.120
 - In South London? - Right.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.320
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we do. - In 2003, three people in Mexico died of...

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.360
 - I can only think of very lazy stereotypes. - Well, let's go for some lazy stereotypes.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.640
 - I don't know. - Three, but only three, so rare.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.040
 - Only three, so it's very rare.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.080
 - What could you do? - This was one of the things I do,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.320
 which is I like to go through massive long lists of data and just find funny...

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.080
 - Oh, yeah. Acne. - He's right.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.320
 - Is it? - It's acne. - Very nice.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.440
 - Three people died of acne. - Three people died of acne.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.960
 And we don't know why they died of acne.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:07.800
 It's just like literally a list of lots of different ways that people died.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.600
 And they must have... Maybe they take the wrong box.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.920
 - Oh, yeah. - You don't know.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.800
 I'll give you another one. I just got so many to get through.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.960
 - We've not got much time left, I don't think. - We've got like five minutes.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.960
 - Okay, let's see how many we can get. - Yeah.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.560
 According to Dr. Hans Ulrich, something never happened.

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.320
 - You know this, Dan, I reckon. - Is this... No, this is one of Dan's,

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.000
 but it might be... Is this the Middle Ages?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.120
 - Middle Ages never happened. - This is an amazing...

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.920
 - This is the Phantom Time Hypothesis. - Yeah.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.320
 It believes that like 600 years of our history just were made up.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.520
 And later historians are just having a joke.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.520
 Everyone agreed in about 500 AD.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.360
 Should we just say it's 1100 AD?

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.040
 And that's why we don't know anything that happened in that time.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.720
 - Yeah. - It's a good theory.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.880
 It's a great theory. I don't think it's real, but I think it's a great thing.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.520
 I think that was the first ever really dubious fact that you ever said on the show.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.520
 - Yeah. - And it's kind of set up your entire life since then.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.520
 Yeah, we invited a really amazing historian called Greg Jenner onto the show,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.520
 and that was the question I asked him.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.920
 And I don't think I'll ever forget the confuse there he gave it to me.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.120
 In 2013, six people in the US named their child.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.320
 I think... I know that... Isn't this... They call it mushroom?

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.720
 - Mushroom. - Mushroom, yes.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.120
 The first ever sandwich we know about contained bread, I'm going to say.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.720
 - Yeah. - Apart from bread.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.120
 God, we did a load on sandwiches.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.920
 I got married in the room where the sandwich was invented.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.720
 - Oh, yeah. - Oh, my God.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.520
 - Thank you very much. - Oh, yeah.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.720
 The guy officiating the wedding claimed, "I haven't checked it."

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.320
 It's one of those that we in the business call too good to check.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320
 - Yeah. - Just accepted and move on.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.720
 He also said, "So, are you actually going to order a sandwich?"

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.320
 "Can I... The deli's got a shot now, buddy."

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.720
 "I didn't get married in a subway."

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.120
 - Okay, sorry. What... First sandwich? - First sandwich.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.920
 We know about contained.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.720
 So, the one that you're talking about with the Earl of Sandwich.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.920
 - Yeah. - Supposedly named after the Earl of Sandwich.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.520
 I think that was a ham sandwich because he was...

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.520
 Oh, it was beef, actually. It was beef sandwich.

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.320
 - Yes. - Because he was playing poker.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.920
 And he wanted to eat something while he was playing poker.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.720
 But we found a much, much older one. In fact, Anna did.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.320
 - And... - It's wine, is it?

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.920
 - It contained wine, yes. - Very nice.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:24.920
 It was like a wrap and it had wine and it had raisins and stuff like that.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.920
 - That's delicious. - Okay, so...

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.520
 The first watt cost as much as a car.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.720
 - Oh. - And it's not cars.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.320
 The first car cost as much as a car, which is true.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.720
 - It's something more surprising. - Uh-huh.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.120
 Oh, I think this was one of yours, Andy.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.920
 - Go on. - Sorry, I'm getting major flashbacks to the facts we've done.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:44.520
 - Is it contact lenses? - Yes, it is.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.720
 And they were hard... Well, all contact lenses used to be hard.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.520
 And they were so... They were sort of £4,000.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.720
 I'm sorry, I don't know the exchange rate well enough.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.520
 - £70,000 crowns? Should we say that? - Wow.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.920
 - I don't know if that's the right rate. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.320
 - It would be more than that. Way more than that. Anyway. - Wow.

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.720
 My favourite car fact that I've ever read is that in 1895,

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.520
 the only two cars in Ohio crashed into each other.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.920
 How? How the fuck did that happen?

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.520
 I always imagine, what did they say when they got out of the car as well?

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.120
 "You came out of nowhere!" Like, what?

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.920
 What was the scenario? Why do we not know that?

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.920
 - I love that. Yeah, good. - And how's the time looking, Dan?

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.920
 We've got to wrap up. We've got one more minute, so give us one more...

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.120
 Okay, during his 27-year rule,

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.720
 Pope John Paul II took...

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.520
 - 100 ski vacations. - Correct.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:42.320
 - Actually, he took over 100 skiing and mountain climbing holidays. - That's very good.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.720
 - Half a point, okay. - Half right, half right.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.320
 He was obsessed with it, right?

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.520
 He used to... Kind of like how the Beatles used to have to, like,

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.320
 go out with fake mustaches and stuff.

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.320
 Pope John Paul II, yeah, used to, like, leave to go to the chalet

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:59.320
 with, like, a fake mustache and he had newspapers where you'd cut the holes in.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320
 - Stop it, Dan! - How many of us would recognise the Pope

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.320
 if he was completely dressed not as the Pope?

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.320
 - I think not one enough. - Most of it is the vestment.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.320
 That's why he got it wrong. He still dresses the Pope when he wore a mustache.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.920
 - I don't know what he was thinking. - Oh, I get this.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.120
 - It's a good fact to end on, I think. I think that's flawless. - Yeah, why don't we wrap up?

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.120
 Well, we're going to go party and get drunk in your beautiful, beautiful city.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.920
 Thank you so much for indulging us with that.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:30.520
 - Thank you guys. - And yeah, we'll hopefully see you again sometime.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.520
 Thanks so much, everyone. Bye!
