00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220
 Hey, everyone. Welcome to this week's episode of Fish. We hope you're well. We hope you're safe and we hope you're not going outside.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:16.360
 This week's episode is actually our first work from home episode. We're all in different locations and he actually is so far away that he actually didn't make it onto the show at all.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.960
 So Alex Bell is joining us for this one, but Andy will be back next week.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.600
 He will be back next week. He will. He can't wait.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.720
 All right, mate, not yet, but we, um, yeah, so this will be our first episode, but we thought in order to help distract you to stop your mind from going crazy.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:48.160
 We re-uploaded 52 episodes that were taken off a few years back. It's our second complete year of fish. And you can listen to them wherever you get your podcasts from. That's over 30 hours of old material that we brought back to the surface.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:57.200
 So we hope you enjoy those. We hope you are staying safe and will continue to do this. So here we go. Let's do our first work from home episode on with the show.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:41.880
 Hello and welcome to another episode of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you, not from the QI offices in Colvernt Garden, but from four self-isolated bits of the UK that we cannot disclose the locations of my name is Dan Schreiber and sitting not with Anna Chazinski or James Harkin or Alex Bell, but once again, we have gathered together over the internet to share our four favorite facts from the last seven days and in no particular order. Here we go.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.200
 Starting with you, Anna. My effect this week is that before we had the technology to take photos for mug shots, policemen had to visit prisons to memorize all the inmates appearances.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:08.840
 Well, in some prisons, I think. Is that like the knowledge for taxi drivers? It was exactly that, yes. And then a lot of it got automated and I put a lot of the old school taxi driver slash memorizers out of business.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.440
 Does that mean if you're like me and you can't recognize people's faces, you can't be a policeman?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:34.760
 You would not have fed well in that phase of the interview process, certainly. So I was reading the Pickwick papers at the moment and there's a scene where spoiler alert Mr. Pickwick goes to a debtor's prison and then there's suddenly the scene came up, which was Mr. Pickwick sits for his portrait and described him being sat down and a policeman saying, okay, it's time to sit for your portraits, sir.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:50.960
 And it said a long thin man planted himself opposite and took a good long view of him, a surly looking gentleman stationed himself close and rested his hands on his hips to inspect him narrowly and then two others came in and studied his features with the most intent and thoughtful faces.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.760
 And then they took this likeness and at length, it was completed and then they said, okay, you can go into the prison and it seemed to be just standard practice as you're going into jail.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:12.760
 So this feels like a date to me. Sounds like a date or very weird awkward dates you have. Do you just stare at the person at the table? Otherwise he'll never know on the second date who it is if he hasn't memorized what they look like.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.760
 Dickens must have known the Pickwick paper debtors jail really well because his dad was in there for a long time, wasn't he?

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:35.760
 Yes, well, he based another little door at his base sort of half in a debtor's prison and this was like his warm up. Yeah, he knew it very well. And it was fleet prison that this was set in and fleet prison was next to the river fleet, which is a now underground river that runs through London.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.760
 Wow. So that's amazing that you used to get your portrait done because that's a very lengthy process.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:51.760
 No, no, it wasn't taking his portrait. No one was drawing his portrait. It meant getting his portrait done as in people staring at him and memorising his face.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.760
 It was a metaphorical portrait. A metaphorical portrait.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:08.760
 And the first things that they did record when they started thinking actually we should probably just stop trying to work everything out by memory is they didn't they didn't they still didn't take pictures or portraits or photographs or anything or even due sketches they started taking measurements.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:21.760
 So Belgian prison warden called Stevens in 1860 is one of the first people who started measuring criminals like heads and their ears and their feet and like how tall they were like basically if you like measuring them up for a suit or something.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.760
 Which feels like incredibly like lengthy way to you then have to re-measure every single suspect that comes in and like you know for all of the measurements of everyone.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.760
 Yeah, also a lot of people have quite similar measurements, you know when you're roughly six foot with brown hair average weight exactly how to narrow it down.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.760
 It's not going to be like this person's ear is two and a half feet long and this person's you know slips of five inches in width.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:05:00.760
 So I should say that I did further research into this other than just assuming that a fictional book contained the truth. So just to be clear this was definitely the case and it was a thing that was done to identify criminals and it's mostly to spot reoffenders right.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.760
 So if someone comes into the prison it's so policeman can say oh yeah he's been in three times before.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:18.760
 It was really pioneered by this guy called Yuzhen Fulswavidok who was at the start of the 19th century criminal in fact a criminal turn policeman who pioneered this mass memorization program.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:26.760
 So he would train up all his agents to make regular trips to all the prisons around the country and memorize you know wander around the prison yards and memorize all their faces.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:33.760
 And it was thousands of faces they memorize I think something like 30,000 prisoners they had committed to memory so it did happen.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.760
 The extraordinary character of this guy wasn't a Yuzhen vidok so he was first put into jail when he was quite young by his own father.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:50.760
 He had robbed his dad's pawn shop and can I just say when you say pawn shop you mean people were giving goods to get money back for them.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.760
 I know pornography shop.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:06.760
 So specifically that one chess piece. A lot of people losing them so yeah did a good business out of that. Yeah no it was for pointing items into a shop so he stole from there his dad put him into prison.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:18.760
 He stayed there for about two weeks then when he came out he robbed the shop again took all the money and ran away and was going to go on a ship to America but then heard that there was a circus in town so tried to join that.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:28.760
 But quit because he was too afraid to bite the heads of chickens as was one of the acts they needed him to do also he started making out with the puppeteers wife while they were doing a show.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.760
 Yeah that was geeks wasn't it one wasn't geeks who were the people who bit the heads of chickens at circus is that right.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.760
 That's right yes that's why they called me a geek at school.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:55.760
 And so the duck had a really good memory didn't he he could memorize all these people absolutely perfectly but he said that he couldn't really require the same of his agents because he initially hired 28 detectives all of whom were also criminals to join his kind of police force.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:09.760
 And then he decided that he would set up index cards with all of these different aliases convictions what they would do how they would like to break into places and stuff like that and basically that was the start of intelligence.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.760
 Yeah so it was like flash cards but for criminals exactly.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.760
 We're like a massive game of guess who.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760
 Yes.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:24.760
 And James is looking so blank like he has no idea what that game is. I don't think James is so terrible I guess. Yeah it's just the same face on every corner.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.760
 He wasn't very popular he wasn't super popular because of his habit of just employing criminals.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:36.760
 So he wasn't very popular among criminals because he went to prison and then he used the fact that he was a criminal to report on all his other mates who were criminals and get them in trouble.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.760
 And then yeah he employed these people in the force who kept on just recommitting crimes.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.760
 And so I think the police weren't huge fans of him and in fact when he became the head of what was essentially the sort of undercover police force.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:58.760
 Then he was still a wanted criminal in another place and there was this constant back and forth between the police force that he was running saying no no we need him.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760
 And the prison saying well we want to put him in jail.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:18.760
 Fingerprinting another useful useful technology we use a lot and so this was proven to be superior to the old just like taking someone's measurements height and weight or memorizing their faces was proven to be vital with the case of Albert and Ebenezer Fox.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:26.760
 But I didn't know about these guys they were identical twins and this was the turn of the 20th century and they were both serial criminals they were poachers and thieves.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.760
 And because they were identical twins they just played this really fun game where whenever one of them got arrested they sort of say no that's my brother mate.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.760
 And what are you going to do to prove it wasn't all you can do is memorize my face.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:46.760
 And so there was this one policeman who said we've got to get a better system here and realize that their fingerprints were actually different to one another's even when everyone else is the same.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:58.760
 But what I like is that there's an estate in Wilma green which is a place in Hertfordshire it would be so great for someone listening who lives there and he didn't know this does an estate in Wilma green called twin foxes estate.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:09.760
 And these guys are pretty obscure now almost lost a history but the twin foxes estate has these two busts at the entrance to it of the identical twin fox brothers.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.760
 So it's an estate which is just in honor of these serial criminals.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:26.760
 That's incredible. Do you think if you were the sculptor of that would you do two different settings with a two different brothers or would you just think you know what he's he's skull to the individual fingerprints.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:39.760
 Just back very quickly to the doc so he was quite famous in his day wasn't he he was someone who was notorious for these stories of adventure and and espionage and so on.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:52.760
 So much so that he was actually he inspired characters and fiction so laym is it said that he is the inspiration for john vajan.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:10:04.760
 Yeah but not only that he is also the inspiration in the same book for the policeman character what's his name have you.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:29.760
 So when I read the first hundred pages over the car so about four years in the movie he's played by Russell Crowe so I think he's called have you and I might be pronouncing that wrong but it's the two different stages of his life he was so inspiring both in his notorious criminal activity and his police work he appears twice as inspiration.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.760
 I think that all Victor Hugo is an incredibly lazy author who just can be bothered to reach to two sources for inspiration.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:46.760
 Well I was wondering if it's just like one of those really hack horror movies where it turns out that it's two parts of the same person psyche that does the murder or whatever do you know.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 I mean yeah like he's a Zechelin hide.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:54.760
 Are you describing fight club as a really hack move? I haven't seen fight club already be dreaded.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.760
 Wow you just spoiled it for him Anna.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.760
 I have just done that.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.760
 Do you not know the first real fight club for fuck's sake?

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760
 Damn it.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.760
 Okay it's time for fact number two and that is James.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:21.760
 Okay my fact this week is that scientists working in the Arctic Ocean have caught Climidia and they can't explain how.

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:43.760
 Okay so when I say caught in this respect I mean like catching a fish or catching some species of organism and because they've gone down to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean and they've extracted some sediments from there and they've looked at what life forms are down there and they've found Climidia.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:55.760
 And it's strains of the Climidia family so it's not the Climidia that you get as humans but they're related organisms of the same family and they can't work out why they're there.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.760
 It doesn't make any sense. Climidia tends to or always as far as we know needs a host.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:08.760
 So you need to live inside the body of another animal but when they found these things there was no other animals there so they just can't work out why it's there and how it got there.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:16.760
 And has the Arctic denied all knowledge that said I'm you know me and the Pacific are just good friends. I don't know what you're suggesting.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.760
 I think I think protesting that it's not quite the Climidia you know doesn't really make it any better.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:37.760
 No I think well the thing is that the Arctic is being penetrated by the Atlantic at the moment because of the change in temperature on Earth and one salty water coming from the Atlantic is kind of coming into the Arctic at the moment and causing quite a few problems.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:42.760
 For the you know global climate so maybe it's something to do with that.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.760
 You think there'd be enough plastic in the oceans that they could penetrate each other safely but apparently not.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.760
 Indeed. Yeah the number of condoms we've given them over the years after.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:13:03.760
 And so there you go that's a thing that's happened and they found it out quite recently and it's been in a lot of the science see kind of publications and you scientist a few things like that and I just find it really interesting.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:09.760
 So are we going to give the ocean bed antibiotics or we're just going to let them suffer?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.760
 Yeah that's what we need to do poor more chemicals into the ocean.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:21.760
 I think it's not that they're suffering these are just organisms that live there they're just living their life they as far as I know they're not doing anyone any harm.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.760
 They just they're part of the of the biosphere really.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:34.760
 Okay so like I say we don't really know why they're there because they've tried to get the microbes and grow them in the lab but they've not been able to do it because the pressure underneath to see.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:38.760
 And basically the conditions down there are very different than what we can make in the lab.

00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:48.760
 So it's really really hard to study and it could be that they're using other microbes that are living in these sediments and they're using their bodies as it were to live.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:50.760
 But we really just don't know.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:14:06.760
 I was really about other symptoms of just for this podcast of normal chlamydia and did you know that if it goes untreated you can get a symptom called saxophone penis which is when the penis bends into the shape of a saxophone.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.760
 Okay hang on with a big open end bit you can't play it it doesn't turn into a saxophone.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:18.760
 You said the shape so does that mean it's kind of thin at the top and then bends around then it's got a big bell at the end.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:26.760
 It's basically a big bend where it shouldn't be and it looks like saxophone because it's more like a saxophone.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.760
 Wow.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.760
 That's yeah good luck getting that one because it's a pick up line.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.760
 Are you sure that that does look like extreme chlamydia to be.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.760
 I think of the Arctic conveniences. There is a thing called polar penis that you can get.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.760
 Wow.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:50.760
 This was an Antarctic adventure called Alex Brazier who reported this only last year I think it was.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:15:00.760
 So he was walking through the Antarctic and obviously his trousers were not thick enough and he said he suffered from an extremely cold painful and swollen member.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.760
 And the only way he knew how to treat it was to put a hat on it.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.760
 Right. Is that I can recover another way to treat him and ever.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:14.760
 In this case he had a woolly hat his penis was too cold and it was getting sore so he put a hat on it.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.760
 And it was fine and I like to think you know those innocent smoothie bottles that have the little woolly hats on.

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.760
 Yes.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.760
 I like to think it'd be like one of those little hats that you carry around with you or something.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.760
 Wow. You just made them a lot less cute for a lot of people.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:36.760
 I don't think that word a cold dick doesn't warrant a medical name.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:42.760
 I believe it was a lot more you know it wasn't just like it suddenly started to look like a piccolo.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.760
 It was like really kind of quite painful.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.760
 It's quite a lot of instruments we can get in his conditions.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.760
 I've got a trombona.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.760
 Oh god.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760
 Wow.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.760
 Do you know who has chlamydia?

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:00.760
 He's a you.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.760
 Of course it's koalas famously.

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.760
 Oh yeah koalas have chlamydia.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.760
 But it's actually not the same strain of chlamydia that infects humans.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:17.760
 But it's just seen that they get it through sex and it's probably around 100% of wild koalas who have this.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.760
 There's one or two populations that don't have it famously.

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:28.760
 I think there's one on kangaroo island that don't have it but pretty much all koalas in the wild have this disease.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.760
 And the problem with it, the main problem is of course antibiotics are quite good against chlamydia.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.760
 But if you're a koala you can't have antibiotics do you know why?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.760
 You can't open the bottle because it's like having pizza.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.760
 No. Are they just too embarrassed to get it checked up.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.760
 They just never get it diagnosed.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.760
 These are all great answers.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:52.760
 The answer is that they have a very very specific gut microbiome because they eat eucalyptus leaves only.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.760
 Don't they?

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.760
 And they have a very very specific bacteria that live in the stomachs that let them eat that and nothing else.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:04.760
 And if they take antibiotics then it can upset that and they can even die because they're not getting all the nutrients they need.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.760
 Someone needs to introduce the koala community to yakle surely.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.760
 Get some good bacteria in them.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.760
 I think they're talking about giving them fecal transplants aren't they?

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.760
 Which obviously you do for humans to regenerate their gut bacteria but so they could have that.

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.760
 Which seems sort of fitting because I think they get chlamydia from fecal matter.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.760
 So there are two ways you can get it. You can get it sexually as a koala.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:36.760
 Or you can get it from your mother's pap which is this disgusting substance that they consume between drinking their mother's milk and eating eucalyptus.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:42.760
 And it's thought that they eat their mother's pap which is essentially fecal matter that their mum feeds to them, their impu.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.760
 And then it's thought that that's what builds up their gut bacteria to help them digest eucalyptus.

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.760
 Can you imagine ever going to dinner party if you have that job when someone asks you and so what do you do?

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.760
 You know I give fecal transplants to koala bears.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.760
 I don't know about you, I believe you.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.760
 That is the kind of person I want to be sat next to at a dinner party.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.760
 I want to take the transplants on the left. I want saxophone pedus on the right.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.760
 I am dream dinner party.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.760
 Do you know who else has chlamydia?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:20.760
 Parrots. Parrots can get something called citacosis but with a silo p at the start and it's known as parrot fever.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.760
 Very good.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.760
 But yeah, this is an illness that they can get and it's caused by a chlamydia bacterium.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:37.760
 And it can sometimes go to humans and that is one theory and actually it's definitely where the popularisation of the phrase sick as a parrot comes from.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.760
 No way.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:47.760
 There are bits in, I think there might be in Shakespeare somewhere where someone says you're sick like a parrot.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:55.760
 But the specific sick as a parrot came from the 1970s and it was just at a time when there was a bit of a worry about parrot fever.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.760
 Which is a type of chlamydia you get from parrots.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.760
 Wait and when you say it can go to humans is that sexually transmitted?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.760
 It is not. It's because you are notically transmitted.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.760
 Okay fine, it's not because they can't sweet talk you parrots.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.760
 But with your own words, your own explanation.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.760
 That the sexiest words around those people.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.760
 You're looking nice today, you're looking nice today.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:31.760
 Is it more embarrassing to say to your spouse that the reason you've got chlamydia is that you've been having an affair or that it's from the pet parrot?

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.760
 They're both quite embarrassing. I've got chlamydia.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.760
 I've got chlamydia.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.760
 Imagine trying to hang up on a nice late night phone call with your parrot.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.760
 No you hang up first.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.760
 No you hang up first.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:56.760
 I found a story from 2004 from Sweden when the number of chlamydia cases were really spiking and the government had to do something about it.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:06.760
 So they started offering a service three days a week. I think it was something like Fridays and Saturdays and Sundays where you could ring a condom ambulance.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:12.760
 And it was called the Chousan Express because the Chousan is a well known make of condoms.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:22.760
 And for about four quids worth, they would deliver 10 condoms to any address within the city of Gothenburg or Stockholm or more.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:28.760
 Okay, it's pretty good value. Did they get the sort of ambulance level siren?

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.760
 It's the kind of urgency you want when you can't find a condom.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:38.760
 Yeah, especially the people who feel embarrassed buying condoms, you just get this picked siren.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.760
 I want the St John's Air ambulance outside my window, airlifting.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:51.760
 I always wanted a shop in Bolton and there was like a middle-aged man wanting to buy condoms and he was really embarrassed because it was a lady behind the counter.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.760
 And he just went, "Excuse me, love. You got any rubber gloves?"

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.760
 She went, "What?"

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.760
 He went, "You got any rubber gloves?"

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.760
 And she tuck into the other part of the star and gave him some actual rubber gloves.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.760
 And then he had to go, "No, I don't mean those."

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.760
 Oh, a guy. I felt so embarrassed for him.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.760
 I mean, it's just a story. If only you'd had five small penises, that would be nice.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.760
 We had a penis like a set of bagpipes.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:33.760
 Okay, it is time for fact number three and that is Alex.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.760
 My fact this week is that Jessica Alba has ridden the London Eye 31 times.

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.760
 She holds the record for the International Overseas Celebrity to have ridden in the most times.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.760
 It's such a good fact.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.760
 So do you know is it because she really loves the London Eye?

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.760
 I wish it was because that, because I love the idea of having a massive fan of it.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:59.760
 No, it's actually because she was doing press for the movie Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer,

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.760
 which came out a few years ago.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.760
 And she did the press interviews on the London Eye because part of it takes place in London.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.760
 Hang on, did she go off it and go back on it?

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.760
 No.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.760
 I don't think she went and queued every time and she had a new interview.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.760
 So she's done 31 rotations.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.760
 She's a one single rotation visit.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.760
 Yes, that's right.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.760
 What happened was it was like a press junket and it was Jessica Alba, Michael Chichlis and Chris Evans.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:33.760
 And they were all doing this thing and they went around 30 times and then she must have gone on one more time.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.760
 She just enjoyed it because of Punta, right?

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.760
 But what that says to me is that the other people don't really like it very much and they decided now we've done our 30 times.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.760
 Now we're not going to go back again.

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.760
 Yeah, I think that's fair.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:50.760
 Well, I think it's a bit weird that she went, can I have just one more just for me?

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.760
 Is that the longest press junket of all time?

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.760
 That is a 15-hour press junket.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760
 It's a long time, isn't it?

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760
 Is that right?

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.760
 It takes a half an hour to go around, yeah.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.760
 Holy moly.

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760
 Wow.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.760
 I wonder if she did it all in one day though or maybe they did it over two days?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760
 Well, never know.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.760
 If only she had some kind of media outlet.

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:13.760
 I messaged her Instagram feed to see if she'd tell me anything about it.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760
 She never replied.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:21.760
 In the article I read about this, it had a few other celebrities that have been on it quite a few times.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:27.760
 Matt Damon, I think I've tied with, I think we've been on about the same number of times.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.760
 How many?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.760
 Well, he's been at least five times and I've done at least six.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.760
 Really?

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:34.760
 Why have you been on it six times?

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.760
 I mean, 31 sounds ridiculous, but then I don't know, six is actually as outrageous as well for a normal person.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.760
 Well, I used to live outside the London, so if I came and visited family of friends in London,

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.760
 it was a touristy thing that they would take you to do.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.760
 And then I became that person who they would say, could we go and do it?

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.760
 So I've been on it quite a few times.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760
 Yeah, six.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.760
 But do you get on the same number as Charlie Chaplin?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760
 Have you?

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:57.760
 Yeah.

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.760
 Amazing fact.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:04.760
 And it's such a fan of it out to me, so happy that James shares that very, very ubiquitous thing.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:10.760
 No, that, my pause was, I was suddenly very annoyed that James knows something about Charlie Chaplin that I didn't,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.760
 so much so that I didn't notice the joke in my ears.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.760
 All I know is that he died before me.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760
 Yeah.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760
 London I was built.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760
 That's all I know.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 And I saw that entire thought process in Dan's face on my laptop, gradually happening.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.760
 So the London I really, it rejuvenated the Ferris wheel industry.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.760
 It really did.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.760
 Before it came along.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.760
 It came around again, the Ferris wheel industry after that, didn't it?

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.760
 Very good.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.760
 It did.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.760
 So it was a big deal around the turn of the 20th century.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:48.760
 And the tallest Ferris wheel in the world was the Grand Route de Paris, which was built in 1900 for the world's fair.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.760
 And demolished in 1920, but it was 100 metres high.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.760
 And that wasn't beaten for almost 90 years.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.760
 It's amazing, isn't it?

00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:00.760
 How the tallest wheel is not that much taller than the first Ferris wheel?

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.760
 You'd think that the first one would have been like, I know, four metres or something hilarious.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.760
 And it's actually pretty, it was a pretty good, like for a first attempt, I was pretty impressed.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760
 Decent.

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.760
 Also, do you know what one of the limiting factors, which is why they can't really go any taller?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:17.760
 This is according to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, who are one of the world's biggest manufacturers of giant Ferris wheels.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.760
 How many?

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760
 There are.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.760
 But take a guess.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.760
 A problem that I don't know how Jessica Albert dealt with, for instance.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.760
 Oh, okay.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.760
 Okay, is it because they can't go that fast.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760
 So if they're really, really big, it's going to take your ages to get all the way back around to the start again.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.760
 And people just get bored.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.760
 And is it going to be something to counterweighting?

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760
 It's close.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760
 No, James is a lot closer.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.760
 It's bored.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760
 And also, bearing in mind, maybe it's quite love.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.760
 All the people, or very small children, it's about a issue.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760
 No toilets.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.760
 No toilets.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760
 No toilets.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760
 Yeah.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:02.760
 And there's sort of like a maximum amount of time that you can have people trapped in a room without lose before their starts being sort of disastrous situations.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.760
 And more cleaners need to be brought on board, and it's just not worth it.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.760
 I do have a fact.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.760
 It's about Jessica Albert and Poe, actually, if you want to hear it.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760
 Yeah, please.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.760
 Why not?

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:24.760
 Because in the, she starred, in fact, in the 2011 movie, "Spikeids 4D," and the director, Robert Rodriguez, was inspired to write that movie after he watched Jessica Albert's baby do a poo.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 Interesting.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:25.760
 Sorry.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760
 What was the movie again?

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.760
 "Spikeids 4D."

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.760
 What's the relation?

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.760
 What's the relation?

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.760
 So he thought I'll just, he may be write a ship movie?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:33.760
 No, yeah.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.760
 Pretty much, yeah.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.760
 No, he, um, so he watched, he was working with her, and she was doing another press thing.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.760
 And she, her baby did a big poo in the nappy just as she was about to go on camera.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.760
 So she, what, he watched her change a nappy, like really quickly, while kind of, like, getting ready and doing all of her, like, makeup and stuff.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.760
 And he had, he was amazed at her watching her kind of be a mother, and also do this very professional job with, like, literally the same time.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:01.760
 And so he thought, wouldn't it be fun to have a spy who's also a mom, and then he wrote the movie with a spy who's a mom in it?

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.760
 Really? Is that what it's about?

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760
 Yeah.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.760
 Oh, we're doing the first three, also about that, so I don't know why he required new inspiration.

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.760
 But this is what it says in the, in the, yeah.

00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:13.760
 That's amazing.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.760
 You know, you were saying about how they can't get much bigger.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.760
 Have you seen the new biggest Ferris wheel, which is about to be opened this year?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760
 Is that the one in Dubai or something?

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.760
 Yeah, the one in Dubai is called AIN Dubai, AIN Dubai.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:35.760
 It's going to be 210 meters tall, and the current highest, which is in Las Vegas, is 167 meters tall.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.760
 So it's way, way, way, way bigger than that one.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.760
 London ice about 130, something like that.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:47.760
 And it means that each of the spokes of the wheel is about the same length as a football pitch.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.760
 Wow.

00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.760
 That's how big it is.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.760
 On the flip side, I tried to find the smallest Ferris wheel that we have.

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.760
 And there's a list on Wikipedia of Ferris wheels.

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.760
 And unfortunately, the smallest fair will didn't have a hyperlink to it.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.760
 But the second smallest did.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.760
 So I can tell you about the second smallest Ferris wheel.

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.760
 It's called the Uni Royal Giant Tire.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.760
 And it was built by the same team or company that built the Empire State Building.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760
 Right.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.760
 How cool is that?

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.760
 It is.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.760
 That's extraordinary.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.760
 Someone has deleted that information from my last day.

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.760
 Wow.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760
 That's amazing.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:35.760
 I mean, believeable that my son is in so much trouble right now.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.760
 Can you give us a rough size?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760
 Yes.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760
 Okay.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760
 Imagine the largest non-production tire.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760
 So it looks like it's the tire.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.760
 The largest non-production tire.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.760
 Let me just bring up a very clear image and scale in my mind because I'm so familiar with that.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.760
 Is it like a monster truck tire?

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.760
 Yeah, but like about ten times the size.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760
 Oh, okay.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760
 I mean, this is, guys, it's really big.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.760
 I've seen smaller Ferris wheels than that.

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.760
 You see like kids ones, don't you, in the background?

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.760
 What about Lego land?

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.760
 They have a tiny model one.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.760
 Or like those were connects ones you get in the windows of Harrods.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.760
 Probably someone's made one of them that I ever need a lot of chromium else.

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.760
 Yeah.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.760
 I suspect the Wikipedia decided not to list every single Ferris wheel in the world right down to the very smallest.

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.760
 Guys, I did say it was the second spot.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.760
 It's a good point.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:29.760
 Hey, Dan, do you remember in 2013, before we started this podcast, we did a whole lot of practices.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.760
 And one of the first ones we ever did was someone asked us a question, what is the name for a phobia of Ferris wheels?

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.760
 Yes.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:46.760
 I do, you know, weirdly, I got really emotional researching this fact because that was the conversation that we had that has led to this whole podcast.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.760
 That's singular one, yeah.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.760
 I went through and found out my old emails and went through all my old research for it, which is crazy.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.760
 It's actually quite common for people to have a phobia of Ferris wheels.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.760
 As I see, if I Google it or go on Twitter and type in phobia of Ferris wheels, it seems to be quite common.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.760
 And I went onto big roundwheel.com, which is like a Ferris wheel fun site.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.760
 And there's an FAQs there and they say, you know, what am I going to do if I'm scared of Ferris wheels?

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.760
 And they say, consider sitting on a park bench, which could probably support about £1,000.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.760
 While sitting on this bench, are you afraid the bench will suddenly break and you will fall?

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:29.760
 Most likely not, because the consequences are falling 18 inches and not very dangerous.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.760
 Now consider the Ferris wheel seat.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:38.760
 Yes, it's much higher, but it's also designed to carry about three times the weight of that park bench it is designed for.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.760
 So basically, if you are worried and it goes on and it goes on, but you are worried.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.760
 There's no, I didn't, you know, giving people like fear therapy.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.760
 You don't have to use that mocking tone, Jane.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.760
 You fucking idiot, Ferris wheel.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.760
 It didn't have the tone on the website because I was just reading it, but that's how I imagined they wrote it.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:06.760
 So when we had that initial fish chat before fish started, one of the topics we also spoke about was the person who created the Ferris wheel.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:13.760
 The first, the first one being George Washington, Gale Ferris, Jr, which is where Ferris gets its name from.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.760
 And I read about it's a inaugural run.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.760
 It's very first time it showed members of the public and press the first time it was spinning in all its glory.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.760
 And the first time it did that, it did it with no carriages hanging onto the end of the spokes.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.760
 So what did people just hang on with their hands?

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:37.760
 They had the people, the construction site workers climb to the end of the spokes and sit there on a nice angle as it was going.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.760
 Now that is a vat's of legit fear, I think.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:42.760
 Like if you're scared of Ferris wheel and they make you ride it like that.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.760
 Because have you imagined just sitting on like a lock, for instance?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.760
 You don't worry about falling off a lock, do you?

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.760
 So why should you worry about sure it's a lock?

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.760
 It's famously very easy to fall off a lock, James.

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.760
 But this was in 1893.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:01.760
 So this was first showed at the Chicago World Columbian Exposition.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.760
 And it was just a ridiculous thing to do.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760
 It was so ginormous.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.760
 It was bigger than the tallest buildings really at the time.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.760
 Or at least on par with them.

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.760
 A pretty extraordinary feat.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.760
 Well, the reason they did it is because they wanted something that was better than the Eiffel Tower.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.760
 Because the Eiffel Tower had been built in Paris, of course.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.760
 And everyone thought this was amazing.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.760
 But they had this new world fare.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:28.760
 And they thought, well, we can't be outdone by Paris.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.760
 We need something which is as good as that.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.760
 And so they had almost a competition to see what might come in the place of, you know,

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:37.760
 as their kind of version of the Eiffel Tower.

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:43.760
 One idea was they were going to have a 4,000 foot tower with a car that's seated 200 people

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.760
 that was on a bit of bungee rope.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.760
 And then people would push this car off the top of the tower.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.760
 And then all 200 people inside this pod would do like a joint bungee jump.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.760
 So a bungee jump at inside a bus?

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.760
 Exactly like that, you know?

00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760
 What a bloodbuff.

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:03.760
 That was, well, that can only be the reason they didn't do it.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.760
 Another idea was they would have a 5,000 foot tower made of logs.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.760
 And at the very top of this log tower, there would be a log cabin.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.760
 I don't know how you would get there.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.760
 There was another one which was a 9,000 foot tower.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.760
 And at the very top, they would have a toboggan slide.

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.760
 And you would kind of go on like a crest to run all the way down to the bottom.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.760
 Oh no, that sounds amazing.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.760
 With these increasingly desperate pictures from the same person,

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760
 they kept saying no.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.760
 And they were just like, he was like going down, down.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.760
 And they were like, what about a 20,000 foot tower?

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.760
 Monkey tennis?

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.760
 And then what half was they looked at all these things apart.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760
 This is ridiculous.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.760
 And they got a letter from Gustav Eiffel himself who said,

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.760
 you know what, I'll just make you another Eiffel Tower.

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.760
 I'll make it a little bit bigger than the other ones.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.760
 So it's better than the one in Paris.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.760
 And that's what they were going to go for.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.760
 But then it got into the newspapers and everyone was like,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.760
 no, you can't have a French person building something in America.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.760
 It needs to be in American.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.760
 And then that's when this guy, George Washington,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.760
 Gail Ferris, Jr. came along and said,

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.760
 I've got this idea for a big wheel.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.760
 Didn't a French person build the statue of Liberty?

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.760
 Sure.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:13.760
 Because they did it.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.760
 And it was built in the head there.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.760
 There's an amazing picture.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.760
 I nearly put it in the Ky titles, actually.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:25.760
 But it's just the head of the statue of Liberty sitting in a park in Paris

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.760
 where they sort of put it on display before they shipped it.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760
 Really cool.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.760
 Yeah, that is cool.

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.760
 Do you know why George Washington, Gail Ferris, Jr.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.760
 was called George Washington, Gail Ferris, Jr.

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760
 By the way.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.760
 Was it because his dad was called George Washington, Gail Ferris?

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.760
 No, it wasn't weirdly.

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.760
 Actually, that's quite weird, isn't it?

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:43.760
 But no, he wasn't.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.760
 It's just such a stupid name.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760
 I thought it'd look it up.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.760
 And the reason was that he was from a town called Gail's Burg,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.760
 that was named after a guy called George Washington, Gail.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.760
 And his parents were so proud of the town.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.760
 They decided to give him the entire name of the founder

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.760
 and then just put their family name Ferris at the end.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760
 No way.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.760
 So it's like me calling my children Andrew Hunter Murray Harkin.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.760
 Yeah.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.760
 It's like putting the entire name before your surname.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.760
 Although it does sound like the mum did have an affair

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.760
 with George Washington Gail and had to pull the wool

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.760
 over the eyes of the husband.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.760
 When Gail insisted he'd have his son named after him.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.760
 That is a convoluted situation you've set up there, Dan.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.760
 So the mum's had an affair with a guy who's insisted

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.760
 that even though she's married to someone else,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.760
 she named her son after him.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.760
 He's the founder of the city.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.760
 He's got Hugo running through his veins.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.760
 Fair point.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760
 And she's just got to cover that up.

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.760
 That is a difficult position you're putting that woman in.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.760
 I don't know why she shagged him in the first place.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.760
 He sounds like a dickhead.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.760
 Did you know that one of the two feet of the London Eye,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:52.760
 so the London Eye have to pay rent on one of the feet

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.760
 of the London Eye, or not the other one?

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.760
 Oh yeah.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760
 Why?

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.760
 Well, because the, let me see,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.760
 the foot that is closer to the South Bank Centre is owned by the South.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.760
 The land is owned by the South Bank Centre.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.760
 And when it was built as the Millennium Wheel,

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.760
 it was supposed to be a temporary structure.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.760
 And there was an agreement for five years.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.760
 And then when everybody wanted to keep it

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.760
 and make it a permanent installation,

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.760
 the South Bank Centre asked for,

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.760
 well, they pay half a million pounds a year as a lease.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.760
 It's a lot of money.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.760
 But did you read about the dispute?

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760
 It's crazy.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.760
 I know.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.760
 And because the South Bank Centre were basically able to hold onto ransom.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.760
 The South Bank Centre served the London Eye with an eviction notice.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760
 It's crazy.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760
 They wrote to them.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.760
 And at the time, the London Eye was paying rent of 65 grand for this one foot

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.760
 that was on their land.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760
 It was just on a bit of concrete.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.760
 It wasn't like it was in the middle of the South Bank Centre itself.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.760
 And the South Bank Centre said,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.760
 we're going to up that of 65 grand to 2.5 million pounds.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.760
 Oh.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:50.760
 And they said this in May, I think.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.760
 And they said, oh, you have to clear off our property by the first of July.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.760
 Wow, by July.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.760
 By July.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.760
 By July.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.760
 That's too big.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:05.760
 See, that's the benefit when you're a smaller ferris wheel that you can relocate to different places.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.760
 Much like the second smaller ferris wheel in the world, which did relocate.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.760
 Easy to do when you're only 86 feet tall.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:19.760
 OK, it's time for our final fact of the show.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
 And that is my fact.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:26.760
 My fact this week is that in 2003, the County of Ottawa, Michigan released a brochure

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:29.760
 for would-be residents to prepare them for living in the countryside.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.760
 It included a scratch and sniff that emitted the smell of manure.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.760
 So, yeah, you can see this brochure online.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.760
 It's really good.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:46.760
 And the whole premise behind it was that they kept having people move to these rural bits of Ottawa

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.760
 and complaining all the time about the realities of it.

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:55.760
 One of the main things being a lot of places you live in will be coated in the odor of manure.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.760
 So, at the scratch and sniff, they say, if you're not ready for this, maybe you're not ready to live here.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.760
 I think it would be more effective to just send them a small sample pack, like a welcome box of shit.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
 Yeah.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.760
 It's very confusing that there's a place in Michigan called Ottawa.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:10.760
 Yes.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.760
 When it's relatively quite close to Ottawa.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.760
 It's closer to Ottawa than I'm comfortable with it being without getting confused.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.760
 So, scratch and sniff is quite an interesting technology, actually.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760
 Yeah.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.760
 So, I didn't realize how long they can last scratch and sniff patches. They work in this really clever way,

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.760
 which is that you basically have the scent chemical.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.760
 So, whatever you scent, you're trying to broadcast, whether it's a smell of shit,

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.760
 that you want to send to an urban dweller, or whether it's a smell of perfume and a magazine,

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:45.760
 that you want a lady to buy, or a man, then it's tiny little scent molecules encased in tiny bits of plastic or gelatin.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.760
 And when you scratch it, you break a few of those bits of gelatin or plastic and it releases the smell.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.760
 So, it's kind of like there were hundreds and thousands of tiny little bottles.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.760
 And every time you scratch it, you smash some of those bottles and the scent goes up into your nose.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.760
 And what this means is that it does last for years.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:06.760
 So, it can last for more than a decade because the bottles that you haven't broken by scratching,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.760
 the scent's still in there waiting for you to experience it.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.760
 It's insane.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:17.760
 I just feel like there should be a smell archive and a smell library where we can preserve smells

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.760
 and put them in a pyramid, maybe, and then in thousands of years' time.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.760
 I feel like there must be one of those things.

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.760
 I definitely put it in a pyramid, though. I want it to be quite epic.

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.760
 The pyramid is the main thing, yeah.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.760
 Yeah, I want someone to uncover it, yeah.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.760
 I went to a smell museum once.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.760
 It was in Sunderland, I think, for some reason.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.760
 And you went there and they showed you lots of things from history,

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:44.760
 and you could go next to them and they would fire smells out and tell you what it was like.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:51.760
 So, they had, like, a Pharaoh's tomb because they were buried with lots of specific plants

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.760
 and perfumes and things like that, and you could smell that.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.760
 That was my idea.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.760
 Well, this happened a long time ago.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.760
 This is, like, ten years ago I went to this.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.760
 Still, I had the idea originally.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.760
 Did you say it? It's a proof of concept.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.760
 And they also had a smell of the sun.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.760
 So, you went in this room and they had a big picture of the sun.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.760
 And you can go over and they sent out the scent of the sun.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.760
 And it just smelled really metallic and it got you at the back of your throat.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760
 Yeah, yeah.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:25.760
 And then I bought the book that went with the exhibition and had that book in my house.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.760
 And I had to throw it away after less than a week because it just stunk out my entire house.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760
 Really?

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.760
 My whole house smelled like the sun.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760
 Wow.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.760
 Was it a scratch and sniff book or was it just smells?

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.760
 I think it was supposed to be scratch and sniff, but someone might have scratched it before I brought it home.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.760
 Because it just smelled really bad.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.760
 Yeah, not that reliable.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.760
 So, I found a story from 1987 where the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company sent out letters

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.760
 to educate the public on the smell of gas leaks and how to detect gas leaks.

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.760
 And they included a scratch and sniff sticker that you could scratch and get a sample of what the gas smells like.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:10.760
 And the result was that the gas was too strong and leaked out of the envelopes and the stickers

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:16.760
 before anyone had opened them and results in hundreds of people ringing up thinking that there had been a gas leak in their house.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760
 And it was a false alarm.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:18.760
 Wow.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.760
 Where was it that you bought that book, James?

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:21.760
 Did you say?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760
 It was in Sunderland, I think.

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760
 Sunderland.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:24.760
 Cool.

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.760
 Sunderland.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.760
 Why?

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.760
 Is that why the sun say?

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.760
 The Sunderland.

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.760
 Wow.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:37.760
 Well, I mean, it makes sense that it was smell metallic as well because as we established on this podcast a while ago, the sun is not in fact on fire.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.760
 It is, it is electromagnetic things.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760
 Oh, God.

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760
 Tell us more.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.760
 Tell us more.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:51.760
 So, the second smallest thing that I mean, if it was attached to a car, they could fit it.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.760
 It would be 200 feet high in that car.

00:41:54.760 --> 00:42:04.760
 Anyway, so back to Sunderland. The thing about Sunderland is they've got that book and I found another book which is actually a scratch and sniff book and it's in York.

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.760
 And it's the smells of the city of York, basically.

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760
 Okay.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.760
 It's just a beautiful collection.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.760
 So you get horse stables.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.760
 You get the York moors.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760
 You can smell the moors.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.760
 But I particularly want to get this book because one of the smells is the smell of a ghost.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.760
 Right.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760
 How cool is that?

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.760
 Okay. And what does that smell like, do you know?

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.760
 Apparently, it's not very good.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.760
 It's a bit musky according to people who've bought the book.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:37.760
 I, weirdly, the people who complain about the smell of the ghost say it doesn't smell like a ghost.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.760
 Which begs the question.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.760
 How do they know what one smells like?

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:42.760
 Wow.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:48.760
 What two combinations of madness do you have to have to have to have thought that you've seen lots of ghosts?

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.760
 And then to decide to create a smell that people can experience the ghost with.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.760
 There's a scratch and sniff movie that was released in the cinemas once.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:58.760
 Called Polyester.

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.760
 It was by this guy called John Waters.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:03.760
 He makes quite cult, cultish movies.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:08.760
 And this was a real gimmicky thing where he called it, you know, on the poster.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.760
 It said it was being released in Odervision.

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.760
 And it was a sent-sational movie.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.760
 That kind of terrible punning.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.760
 Oh, you'd love that.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.760
 The kind of thing that gets bombs on seats.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760
 Yeah.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.760
 And yeah, so the idea was that you got 10 scratch and sniff cards.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:26.760
 And you sat there.

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.760
 And as the movie was going on, it would come up with a number.

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.760
 And everyone in the audience would scratch it as they were going along smell what it was.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.760
 And he tried to toy with the audience.

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.760
 So you would think it was definitely going to be the object that was on the screen.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.760
 And as you were scratching it, they would suddenly chuck in some old shoes.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.760
 So it was suddenly the smell of a boot.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.760
 Did you know what there were 10 smells and do you know what some of them were?

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.760
 I have some of them.

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760
 Oh yeah, go for it.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.760
 So there was flatulence, obviously, because that's the first smell you're going to put into anything.

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.760
 Okay.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.760
 But then do you have to write your script to include these things?

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.760
 Because it sounds to me like you're saying what you have to have flatulence in,

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.760
 because that's an obvious thing.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.760
 But then if you have a really kind of tender love story.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.760
 You just have to have someone farting half the way through just so you get that smell.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.760
 Exactly.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:15.760
 I think they probably, I bet there was a bit of a kind of putting the cart before the horse sort of like

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.760
 we've got these smells available to us and you're going to have to include them if you want.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.760
 But there was flatulence, there was skunk, so really not a great experience.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.760
 Do you mean the drug?

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.760
 No, I think the animal.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.760
 Okay.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.760
 Natural gas, which again, like you know, is farting.

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760
 That's the same as farting.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760
 It's a bit, yeah, it's true.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:33.760
 But I don't know.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.760
 I feel like you're going to empty the cinema if they can all smell gas.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.760
 And air freshener, which I presume got rid of all the other smells.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760
 Oh, yeah.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:42.760
 That just sounds like a necessary one.

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760
 Yeah.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760
 The rest of it.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:50.760
 So, Dan, with this, what's the idea of having the smell not relate to the image?

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:55.760
 That's like showing a film and having it be a funny gimmick that the visuals you're saying don't match up with the sound.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760
 No, no, it just sounds quite annoying.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:57.760
 No, it always matched up.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.760
 What it would do is you thought you were going to scratch and it would be the smell of, say, roses.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:10.760
 Because there was a big vase full of roses on the screen and as you scratch, suddenly, in shot comes smelly shoes.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:12.760
 So it flips your, yeah.

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.760
 That's clever.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.760
 Do you know what other film employed the user's scratch and sniff technology?

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.760
 Spoke.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.760
 It's 4D.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760
 You're kidding.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.760
 No, true.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760
 That's what the 4D was.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.760
 It was just because the 4D dimension was smell.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.760
 Did they send in the smell of Jessica Alba's child's poo?

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:31.760
 That worked.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760
 Right at the beginning of the movie.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760
 You showed the inspiration, yeah.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:38.760
 At the same time, did you say it was a Roma Rama, Dan, or smell of vision?

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.760
 I think it's Oda Rama.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760
 Oda Rama, okay.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:46.760
 So there were a few of them around at the same time that were trying different methods to get smells in.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:53.760
 And the reason was TV had taken off and the cinemas were really worried that they'd go out of business because everyone was watching TV at home.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.760
 And another one that they had was smell of vision.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:06.760
 And the way that smell of vision worked is all the bits of the cinema had little kind of vents which would send out smells,

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.760
 rather than scratch and sniff.

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:15.760
 But unfortunately didn't really work that well because people who were in the balcony would get the smell a little bit too late.

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:22.760
 So you would be like, you were supposed to smell one thing and then the scenes moved on and then suddenly you get the smell.

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:25.760
 And then in other parts of the theatre, the elders were too faint.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.760
 And so you would just have lots of people going.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.760
 And then just sniffing the air.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.760
 And then everyone else just got really annoyed because they couldn't hear the movie because everyone was sniffing the air.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.760
 On the plus side, you could get away with farting whenever you like.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:45.760
 And you could be like, oh, I guess there's a farting scene coming up.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:51.760
 And if they heard, you can be like, wow, this surround sound is really getting amazing.

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.760
 The bass in our seats, did you feel like?

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.760
 The seats are moving at 4D.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:04.760
 Okay, that's it. That is all of our facts. Thank you so much for listening.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.760
