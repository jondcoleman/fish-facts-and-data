00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here just to let you know that our special guest on this week's fish is none other than

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Ann Miller. You will remember Ann because she's been on loads of times before, though she hasn't been on for a little while

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 We are so excited to see her again.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 Ann is a brilliant children's author. She's written Mickey and the Animal Spies, a series of children's books all about animals spying and codes.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
 They're fabulous. And as you're about to hear, she is obviously a magnificent researcher and elf.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 So we hope you enjoy this episode.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 That's right. We also just want to quickly say happy birthday publication to Andrew Hunter Murray because the sanctuary, yeah, has just been released in paperback.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 This is such a brilliant book. It's a book that is so brilliant that waterstones have actually decided to make it the thriller of the month.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 So you're going to see it everywhere in bookshops.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 And it's a book that's been called many things by many great people. It's been called imaginative and intriguing.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 The sanctuary sucks you in and doesn't let you leave until the very last page by Anthony Horowitz.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 It's a brilliantly clever thriller by a brilliantly clever author, says Richard Osman. They are all telling the truth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 Oh, Dan, thank you. Yeah, guys, it would mean the absolute world to me if you picked up a copy of the sanctuary in paperback.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 It's a gripping twisty thriller set on a mysterious island off the coast up north where one of the world's wealthiest, most enigmatic men is building an entirely new society.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 It's all about that and what the young hero from the city finds when he goes and sees this new world being built.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 It's about billionaires. It's about mysterious islands. It's about the near future.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 If you're looking for a gripping summer read on the beach, I think this could be the one for you.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 That's right. And it's also brilliant. So do make sure you go and get a copy from our own personal Sunday Times bestselling author here on the show, Andrew Hunter Murray.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 As I say, available in all good bookshops, both online and in the real world, do pick it up, help our buddy out to get back in that Sunday Times chart.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 All right, on with the show.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 On with the podcast.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 [Music]

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ann Miller.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 My fact is that Ann of Green Gables is from the same island as the world's largest potato sculpture.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Welcome back, Ann.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 Are you suggesting a link, a causal link between the two?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
 Between great literature and great snacks.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 Oh, that's a large potato, a great snack. I'm not coming around the house. Super Bowl Sunday.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 So I don't know really who Ann of Green Gables is.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 So I give you a pot as Ann of Green Gables one on one.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 So Ann of Green Gables is one of my favorite books of all time.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
 It is set on Prince Edward Island in Canada.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 I was given it when I was very young and the setting is just completely beautiful.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 So the thing about Ann is she is an orphan.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
 This brother and sister called Matthew Marilla live at a place called Green Gables.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 And they are convinced to adopt an orphan boy to help them on the farm.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 But when they go to collect the boy, it's Ann. She's a chatterbox. She's an imaginative.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
 She gets into endless scrapes, but they love her and she sort of builds this new life on Prince Edward Island.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
 And when I was a little bit older, my godmother sent me a postcard from Green Gables.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
 And it was as if someone had sent me a card from Narnia.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 I didn't understand how she'd been somewhere that was in a book.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 And I remember being so confused and like it was like, "Oh, nice time at Green Gables."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 And I was like, "How did you get there?"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 It's not a really big potato. Did she say that as well?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 She did not. She did not. I found out about that more recently.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
 But yeah, so the island, because Lizzie Moore Montgomery, who wrote the book, lived there.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 Ann is set there. There's lots of places in the book that are actually there.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 And it's a sweeping series. There are several books beyond Ann of Green Gables.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 And I was planning the trip of a lifetime to go and see Prince Edward Island for somewhere 2020.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 So I didn't make it there. But while I was reading about Prince Edward Island,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 I found out that they also are the home of the Canadian Potato Museum.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
 And outside is a 4.3 meter tall potato. We had a picture taken.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 And I just, I almost want to go there as much as I want to go to Green Gables.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 It's got exhibitions. It's got potatoes in tiny coffins to show the different diseases they can have.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
 It's got a potato themed gift shop. It's got a potato themed restaurant.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 So you can have baked potato with side of crisps. You can have with potato skins, potato soup.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 And what do you reckon you can have for pudding?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Oh, I know that they make potato fudge there. Yeah.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 Potato fudge. Potato fudge.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
 With mashed potato.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 I did have a quick look at TripAdvisor for the Potato Museum.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
 Pretty overwhelmingly good. I think it's also a tribute to Canadian positivity and politeness.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 Which one of you picked out there?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
 Oh, you know, obviously I was looking for the negative reviews.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 Actually, there are very few which is a tribute to the restaurant.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
 Well, there's one three star review which sniffs that the big potato could have been a little more realistic.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 The TripAdvisor review does suggest a duration one to two hours for your visit.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
 I think by the end of the second hour, you'll be running short of things to do.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
 You're right, they have absolutely loads of stuff.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 They say it's a living testament to the humble tuber and those who have tilled the soil in its evolution.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 Did they have any two or one star reviews?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
 They had so few actually that I think it would be unrepresentative of me to read any out.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 And I didn't write any down because they weren't very amusingly written.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
 But it's clearly a very popular place.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
 The museum was started by a guy called Dr Lloyd George Dewar, who was a politician.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
 And I tried to find anything interesting about him, which was really tough.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
 I even went into like these, what they call it, the websites that tell you about your family.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 Oh, like, yeah, yeah, ancestry.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
 Yeah, like an ancestry one.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
 And I found out that his great grandfather died at the age of 101 in the town of Dole in Persia.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
 The only interesting fact about that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
 So I could find, yeah, amazing.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 How heavy was the sculpture potato again, by the way?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000
 They didn't say the weight.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
 They don't list the weight.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000
 They don't list the weight.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
 Just the height.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
 I found the world's heaviest potato and was just curious.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
 How heavy is the difference?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
 Well, it's going to be a lot less heavy, I assume.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
 We're saying heaviest real potato.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
 Is it a real one?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
 Yeah, it's a real potato, which was just under five kilograms.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
 Nice.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 And that, well, that, no, that's, I know, well, this is the thing is potatoes aren't water bearing organisms like your squashes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
 That's why they take squashes kind of a ton and the biggest potato.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 But it's grown by friend of the podcast, Peter Glazebrook, who we've mentioned several times before,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
 because he's done things like the longest bean or the biggest maroon or whatever it is.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
 Yeah, he's got a load of those records.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
 He's a UK guy.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
 Which is great.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
 We should get him into the building sometime.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
 Unfortunately, he won't fit through the door.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
 He can carry his bean the other way, you know.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
 Oh, that's a good point.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
 But what about the nine foot apple?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
 I wanted to find a bigger potato to kind of spoil this fact.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
 Because that's my gel in this podcast.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
 So I looked at all the other potato museums around the world to see if they had one.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
 There are surprisingly quite a few.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
 There are quite a few.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
 But I found in the Idaho potato museum, they have the world's largest Pringle.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
 And we have perhaps a Pringles controversy with this.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
 Further, further.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
 Further, because I knew when Sarah Pasco was on, but she had five Pringles controversies.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
 Yes.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
 But this is the world's largest Pringle, but it's flat.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
 Oh, it's not the shape of a Pringle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
 So do you call that a Pringle?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
 Was it made by Pringles?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
 It was made by Pringles.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
 Yeah.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
 Is it made from the material of Pringle?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
 It's made from the hydrogenated potato starch.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
 Potato starch.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
 It's just not got the shape.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
 That's interesting.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
 What makes a Pringle?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 Is it the shape or is it the...

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
 Do you reckon it's a Pringle if it's not Pringle shaped?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
 I think if it's made by Pringles, it's a Pringle.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 Do you?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
 What about the box that's made by Pringles?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
 No.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
 The box is also a Pringle.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
 It's a cylindrical Pringle.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
 I'm going to double down on this.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
 Okay, fine.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Sadly, I do agree.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
 I think they have name rights.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
 So I can't call it a Pringles controversy.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
 Oh, well, I think we've certainly argued about it just now.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
 It's controversial that you're trying to introduce it as a controversy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
 Certainly.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
 Okay, great.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
 I'll email Sarah.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
 I did find out about the world's another non-largest potato in the world.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
 And this was, you may well have seen this in your research as well, which was nearly a

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 knockout blow to Peter Glazebrook's Five Kilo Potato.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
 Which is, I think, about an eight kilo potato.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
 Yeah, it was found by a pair of farmers in New Zealand who, the Guinness World Records

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
 people, wrote back to them when they wrote in saying, "We've got this."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
 They said, "In fact, it's a tuber of a kind of gourd.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
 A DNA testing actually revealed in true Jerry Springer style."

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
 Wow.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
 It wasn't a potato.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 It wasn't a potato at all.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
 It was called Doug.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
 Doug.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 After how they got it out of the grave.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
 Doug.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
 Samantha Baldwin, who's a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for Food and Plant Research,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
 presumably having a morning off or something.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
 So we tried running multiple tests on samples of Doug, but he just wasn't behaving like

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
 a potato should.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
 Because he wasn't a potato.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
 I like the idea of vegetable espionage, though, like posing as a potato for many, many years.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
 Yeah, I mean, it looks like a potato.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
 And the finders, they made a little trolley to drag it around on.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 It's quite sweet.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
 I have a couple more contenders for giant potatoes.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
 Oh, go on.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
 So I was a little bit concerned when I was double checking that there was a giant potato in

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
 Cyprus, which was two foot taller.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
 But sadly, or luckily for me, was chopped down by vandals.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
 That wasn't me who did it.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
 Was it just done this week?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
 Really?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
 Just after you said this fact?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
 That sounds suspicious.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 You are looking tanned.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
 Yeah, and you look so gleeful at the moment.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
 I mean, no jury would acquit you at the moment.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
 I can't look out if you're sad or, yeah, if you're hysterical.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
 I'm very sad.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 So the one inside for us was two foot taller, but it's been...

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 You're not doing a good impression of someone who hasn't chopped down a giant potato.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
 Put it that way.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
 Well, I definitely didn't chop down the one in Australia.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
 So they have the big things, I'm sure.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
 Yeah, of course, yeah.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
 And they have the big potato.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
 But theirs is lying down, so it's long.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
 Did someone knock it up?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
 But it did for a while have a face, which was so mildly terrifying.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
 And the face has been taken away.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
 I'm not sure if it was stolen.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Wow.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
 Any more for potatoes?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
 No.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
 How about Prince Edward Island?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
 Well, they do.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 They make about a million tons of potatoes each year.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
 They're big, big potatoes.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
 Yeah, a quarter of Canada's potatoes, despite it being a very small Canadian province.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
 Yeah, one of the smallest, I would say.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000
 A lot of the potatoes on Prince Edward Island are grown and processed by McCain,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
 who are the world's largest manufacturer of frozen potato products.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
 You will know them from their oven chips.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
 Yes, big fans.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
 They were founded by two brothers called Harrison and Wallace McCain.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 And like it seems, every single company that's founded by two brothers,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
 they got into a massive legal dispute and then one of the brothers had to leave

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
 and took over a thing called Maple Leaf Foods.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
 No, rivals.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
 I thought you were going to say there's a potato equator around the world.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
 Like the Eldie Brothers.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
 But no, isn't that surprising?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
 That is bizarre.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
 It does seem this thing, that brothers start companies and they fall out.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
 Was it Adidas?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
 Adidas.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
 Yeah, that's so weird.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
 Wow, and Oasis.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
 Oasis, yeah.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
 So it's a very big island as well.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
 It's 175 miles long.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
 Did I just say it was a small one?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
 It's a small province, but it's a big island.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
 You know what I mean?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
 Because Canada's massive.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
 I think everyone forgets how big Canada is.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
 Just shout out for Canada there.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
 But did you know we have a lot of listeners on Prince Edward Island?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
 Really?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 So I had a little look in the inbox, the fish inbox, podcast@qi.com.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
 We have had so many messages from people over the years saying,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
 "I'm on Prince Edward Island and I would like you to cover it."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
 And here are some facts.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
 So I've got a couple for you.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
 Ryan Barrett, who works for the PEI Potato Board.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
 Wow, you picked that up, friend.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
 Yeah, I mean, he wrote an email a couple of years ago.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
 This was when Anna was in charge of the inbox.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
 Ryan, I don't think you've got to reply.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
 So I'm going to write that wrong.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
 Anna really hates Prince Edward Island.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
 He doesn't say Prince Edward Island, does he?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
 Every week she goes on about how much she hates it.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
 You have to cut it out.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
 He just said some cool place names they've got.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
 They've got an Alaska, a Belfast, a New Zealand, a Toronto, a Norway,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
 a Crapo, which is French for toad, I didn't know,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
 and a Surice, which is French for mouse.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
 And he also has a fact about Anne of Green Gables, which is that,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
 because of Anne of Green Gables,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
 Prince Edward Island gets thousands and thousands of Japanese tourists every year.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
 And that's because the book was the first book

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
 taught in English in Japan after the Second World War.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
 It's massive there.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
 So big cultural influence.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
 Yeah, still to this day, it's ginormous.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
 And they have schools named after it there, the School of Green Gables.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
 They've got the University of Prince Edward Island School of Nursing.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
 And apparently adaptations are just always on TV.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
 Just non-stop on TV in Japan.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
 I've always heard that.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
 I never really understood why.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
 And I read a really cool article by Margaret Atwood to celebrate Anne's 100th birthday.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
 And she said she'd done an event in Japan, and she'd asked the audience,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
 and her translator had written down the responses.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
 And one of the big reasons is the author who translated it in Japan

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
 was already very beloved, so sort of had an audience there.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
 And there are many things about the book that just really resonated.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
 So Anne was an orphan, and there were sadly a lot of orphans in Japan after the war.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
 She's got a huge passion for Apple Blossom and Cherry Blossom,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
 which was very popular in Japan, and sort of her work ethic.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
 She's not scared of hard work, and she's very thoughtful,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
 but she's also quite forgetful, but it's because she's daydreaming.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
 She's not lazy. She tries to do her best, and she does wind up in scrapes, but it's never...

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
 She means well.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
 I did read one place that said that America kind of pushed Anne of Green Gables after the war,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
 because they thought it would help kind of as American liberal propaganda.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
 And they thought that this kind of book, which showed that women were more free-thinking,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
 might get them away from some of their old ideas.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
 So that was supposedly one of the reasons.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
 She sounds like a pretty cool character, the author Lucy Maud Montgomery.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
 When she was a kid, she had two imaginary friends, which is really cool.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
 So she was at her grandparents' house, and they had a bookcase,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
 and it had glass reflection doors on the bookcase,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
 and she could see herself in the reflection.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
 So the one on the left was a reflection of someone that she called Katie Maurice,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
 and the right was Lucy Gray, and it was both her, both her reflections,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
 but she created them as her imaginary friends.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
 Yeah, very cool idea.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
 And I love that her titles of her books all sound like she's still workshopping the author title.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
 This is Emily of New Moon, Pat of Silver Bush, Kill Many of the Orchard.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000
 One more to add to that.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
 So there's six in the Anne of series, and then there are two that focus on her children.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
 And the second one is Rilla of Ingleside, which is her youngest daughter.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
 So spoiler alert, she goes up to get married and has a bunch of children.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
 But what I didn't realize when I was younger is I followed the books through,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
 and I see her grow up, and I hadn't clocked that as she grew up,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
 the year would get so much closer to the war, so it becomes a book about the First World War.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
 So Rilla of Ingleside is about war coming to Canada, which I wasn't expecting.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
 And so two of her children end up fighting in the war,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
 her daughter Rilla ends up adopting a war baby and looking after him,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
 and it's just very odd to take a character who you know from a beloved children's book

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
 and put them in World War One.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
 I think this about, it's a slightly different example of it,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
 because there's an episode of Frasier where Martin Crane, Frasier's dad,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
 has just watched the Austin Powers film,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
 and it's very weird thinking of them in the same conceptual universe,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
 because there's a bit where Martin keeps on saying, "Shagadelic baby, yeah!"

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
 And it really takes you out of yourself.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
 It's quite amazing that she gave over the trademark basically to Anna Green-Gables

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
 to not only her daughters and the heirs, but to Prince Edward Island as well.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
 So they've got the trademark, which means that anyone who works on the island

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
 is allowed to make their own sort of products or merchandise and sell them.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
 Yeah, with no worry of the estate coming at them, because they are the estate.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
 Wow, can you do anything?

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
 It sounds like it. I mean, possibly you might have to pitch and say, you know...

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
 Yeah, you can have Anna Green-Gables, for instance.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
 Oh, yes.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
 The second World War book.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
 My fact this week is, in 1952, a cowboy successfully lassoed a plane

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
 as it flew past his house.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
 His house?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
 Yeah, so he was working at this house.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
 He was working with his boss.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
 I have a question, Dan.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
 Yeah.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000
 Successfully lassoed?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000
 Yeah.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
 Does that mean he got the lasso around the plane

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
 and then the plane flew off with his lasso attached?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000
 He tamed it.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
 He tamed it.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
 Yeah, yeah, he ended up riding the plane.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
 He broke it, you know, he made it submissive to him.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
 That's Andy's got it right.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
 And the plane lives happily in his garden to this day.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
 Yeah.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
 No, this is, the basic story is that he was at this house.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
 He was working as a cowboy, and this plane just kept flying really low over the house

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
 and kept going by, and had no idea what was going on.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
 It turns out what was going on was the pilot on the inside

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
 was trying to drop a love letter to a girl who lived inside the house,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
 and flying Kai, he was trying to get her to come out to see the love letter being dropped, right?

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
 But this cowboy gets pissed off.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
 So he gets out his lasso.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
 It's a three and a half meter long lasso.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
 And as the guy is swooping down, he's flying very low.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
 You know, he's got to drop the letter so it lands on a good spot.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
 Absolutely.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
 So he throws the lasso at the plane, it manages to collide with the propeller,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
 catches onto it and snaps off and gets tangled up in the propeller.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
 So the pilot has no choice but to turn around and quickly land the plane.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
 Obviously the cowboy was knocked onto his back.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
 It was not pleasant.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
 Obviously.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
 Did the guy in the plane survive?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
 Yeah, he did.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
 And actually years later, when he was 78 years old,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
 there was a photo of him with the propeller with the lasso rope still wrapped around it.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
 Wow.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
 Did he get the girl?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 I couldn't find that bit of the story.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
 Great question.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
 Yeah, great question.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
 Can I just say, everyone in the story is an idiot.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
 Not the girl?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
 Why isn't she coming out of her house?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
 How would she know to come out?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
 There's a plane flying apparently two meters above your house.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
 Show some curiosity.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
 Like she's idiot three on the list.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
 Idiot two, I think is probably the pilot who's doing this magic.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000
 Just send the card.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
 It doesn't matter.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
 Idiot one's the cowboy.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000
 Why?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
 Because he could have killed the pilot and himself.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
 But it's a good point though.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
 I felt sorry for the pilot because I thought he's trying to do something in secret.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
 Instead his plane's fallen out of the sky and made a big noise, presumably.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
 But the post is pretty secret.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
 Yeah, this is not secret.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
 This is less secret, I would say, than the post.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
 He's not trying to be secret.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
 This is romance.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
 This is, look, you can see me.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
 Hi, I've got a letter.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
 I want to show you my love.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
 Is it like the 80s thing of turning up outside the house with a boombox?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
 I was thinking.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
 Or the love actually thing of turning up with the cards.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
 It's exactly that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
 The propeller card.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
 I would be good in love actually in that scene if a lasso just came in for the second one.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
 Or if he's going round to loop the loop with a plane.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
 And every time he does the bottom of the loop, it's another card.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
 Oh yeah.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
 Oh.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
 Sorry, forgot to say.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
 Yeah, no.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000
 Yeah, fools.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000
 It's a great story.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
 It's a very random story.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
 It appeared in a Time Magazine article in a language that is just, it says like, then

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
 a few, few years ago, some smart fellows bought themselves a little airplane and opened a flying

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
 club just a hood and a holler from where the ranch cowboy.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
 This is Time Magazine.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
 This is how they're reporting the story.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
 So yeah.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000
 50s journalism.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
 Yeah, his name was Euclides Guterres is how I'm going to pronounce that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
 Who's that?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
 That's the cowboy.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
 That's the cowboy.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
 Yeah.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
 And again, so little detail about this story, but it's the South Brazilian cattle ranchers.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
 So I don't even think this is an American cowboy.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
 Oh, I see.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
 We're talking.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
 Oh, I thought we were in the USA.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
 That's what I, that's what I initially thought.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
 I thought we were in Brazil and ancient Greece from his name.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
 Um, just on Lassus and Lassouing things.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
 Um, I did find someone who Lassoued cats.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000
 Hell.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
 This was a cat Lassou artist from the second war.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
 She was called Miss Iris Davis.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000
 It's a really nice story actually.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
 So lots of buildings being bombed in the second war, lots of rubble, lots of, you know, ruins

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
 and things.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
 Also lots of cats, lots of people keeping cats.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
 And she was a volunteer worker for what something called the dumb friends league, which is friends

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
 of cats.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
 Yeah, exactly.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000
 Dumb as in, I think they don't speak rather than stupid cats.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
 But she went from, she went from bombed house to bombed house with a cat Lassou.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
 It was very long pole with the Lassou at the end, rescuing cats from the wreckage.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
 Can I ask Andy?

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
 You know, um, lots of planes flying very low there.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
 Yeah.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
 Do you think a curious person would get out of the house and look what's going on there?

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000
 Idiots.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000
 No, no, no, no.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
 Sorry.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
 She claimed in 1940, November 1940.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
 So I guess the Blitz had been going on for a while.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
 She claimed she had rescued 600 cats from bomber buildings, which is a lot.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
 No cats.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
 It was probably the same one.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
 Yeah, someone who's an unexpected cowboy, Osama bin Laden turns out he used to walk around

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
 with a Stetson on his favorite shows were bonanza and things like fury.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
 He had his own horse and he absolutely loved the world of cowboys.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
 Um, yeah, there was lots of stories because the biography came out where they said you

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
 would see Osama bin Laden walking around with his Stetson on acting all cowboy.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
 It's amazing.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
 It took that long to find and catch him, given that he was.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
 There can't be that many people in the Torah barricades with a massive Stetson.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
 Wow.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
 I didn't know what to make of that.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
 I know it's odd, isn't it?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
 But there's a lot of, um, so like Stalin, for example, if we're talking like bad people,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
 generally massive cowboy fan as well.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
 He used to love watching Westerns, love John Wayne movies, but also hated John Wayne because

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
 of his anti-communism stance.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
 And so actually plotted to have him murdered.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
 He ordered KGB assassins to go and try and kill John Wayne.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
 Um, and, and Chairman Mao did that as well.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
 Chairman Mao hated John Wayne.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
 The stories of assassination plot from, yeah, from Chairman Mao as well.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
 Oh, these all put out by John Wayne's PR language.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
 It feels like it, right?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000
 Communist dictators hate him.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
 Find this one weird trick.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
 There's a really good, there's a Hollywood writer called Michael Mundt.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
 I've read a couple of his books.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
 It's one that he did on John Wayne.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
 He found that the FBI had discovered that there were assassins that were sent to Hollywood.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
 To try and kill John Wayne.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
 Amazing.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
 Gosh.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
 Do you know how many people you can fit inside a lasso?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
 Oh, surely.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
 Do you have enough rope?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
 Well, the Guinness World Record for everyone who's done it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000
 So it has to be spinning.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
 Oh, yeah.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
 Was it thrown?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
 Yeah, yeah.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
 So it's like, it's spinning.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
 He's like, I would say actually it's smaller than you think.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
 I'm going to say 20 people gathered in a tight, as in that'll be very hard.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
 I think to let's do 20 people standing to get even standing together.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
 I'm going to say just going with my imagination here.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
 A million?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
 I'm going to say 200 and I'm going to say that the person was standing on top of a

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
 first floor building, like the top of a school, massive lasso and just managed to get the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
 throw.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
 A school, specifically a school.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
 There are no other buildings have more than one story as we know.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:56.000
 What I'm thinking maybe is maybe around 240 to 300 and they're all on the same plane and

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
 it gets lassoed.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
 Very nice.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.560
 - Yeah. - Very nice.

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.920
 - Well, you actually write the first time.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.400
 It's 13 or 14, including the guy handling it.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.240
 - Oh, he was so close. - So he counts.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.760
 - It sort of does he count.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.560
 The record is 13. - The guy throwing the rope.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.400
 He jumped in. - He jumped in.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.240
 - I think he's taking this.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.960
 - Oh, wait, if he's in the list of, yeah,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.080
 then that absolutely counts.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.240
 - He's in the center and he's a lassoing around

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.960
 and other people are gathering round him as he lassoes.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.800
 - Yeah, I love that.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.040
 - Does that count as lassoing?

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.760
 Because you don't usually stand, say, like,

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.760
 next to the wild horse and lasso yourself into it as well.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.880
 - They do tricks, don't they, lasso artists?

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.520
 And I think this is kind of part of that.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.480
 As in, they like a skipping rope,

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.880
 you're kind of lasso around and then you'll do jump in.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.760
 - You're gonna get lettuce from the cowboys

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.120
 and the skipping people.

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.880
 How dare you associate us with those hacks?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.120
 - I'll tell you what, if someone flies

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.420
 very close to the top of my house,

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.360
 then I'll look outside for the lettuce.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:50.320
 - Marlboro Man, one of the most famous cowboys

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.000
 for the internet. - Cigarette smoking Marlboro Man.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.480
 - Yeah, Bob Norris was the original Marlboro Man

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.560
 who never smoked cigarettes in his life.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.080
 He actively was anti it, but he was found

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.520
 because he was in a photo with John Wayne,

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.360
 who used to smoke seven packs a day.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.640
 And they saw him in that shot and went,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.680
 "Hey, that guy looks like he'd be good for our smoking."

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.360
 - Weirdly, he'd actually been hired by Stalin to kill Wayne.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.600
 (laughing)

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.960
 And then the film people got to him in time,

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.800
 the cigarette people.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.160
 - I was looking at other big animals that you can lasso.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.880
 So, do you know how many lessoes it takes

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.520
 to get a crocodile safely?

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.360
 - I would've said one.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.160
 I would've said one. - Just round the mouth.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.120
 - I'm gonna say three.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.640
 - Three, yeah, points to the driver.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.280
 So apparently, the way they do it

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.560
 is they lasso the top bit of the mouth,

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.080
 and they do it again with a second lasso.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.000
 I guess that's the most scary part.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.640
 And then they do one round the whole mouth,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.040
 and then they tape the mouth to be so, so, so sure.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.120
 And then the advice was, if it all goes pear-shaped, run.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.760
 - I was gonna say, that's a lot of detail

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.920
 to get right three times round.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.040
 We get the clippers sometimes to go to our gigs

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.640
 at Up The Creek, and whenever the boat comes in,

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.680
 they always have to lasso the boat.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.360
 And I always have a bet with whoever I'm standing with,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.520
 are they gonna get on the first go?

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.840
 Sometimes it's the third go,

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.880
 but the thing is the doc's not gonna eat you,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.200
 whereas a crocodile, yeah, that's a fine time.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.080
 - That's one of the first QI facts I ever learned,

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.320
 was that a crocodile can, what is it?

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.440
 It can bite you with the force of a truck

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.660
 falling off a cliff, but once his mouth is closed,

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.080
 it presents no threat at all,

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.320
 because you can hold its mouth shut with your hand.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.280
 - That's a rubber band, even just a rubber band.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.640
 - I think the scariest job is the person

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.440
 who takes the tape off at the end of the procedure.

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.160
 I think that's the real hero.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:26.320
 - But at that point it's quite annoyed, probably.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.400
 - Exactly, yeah.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.480
 - Have you ever held a crocodile?

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.560
 - No. - No.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:31.640
 - No, me either.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.080
 (laughing)

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.880
 - But my wife has, my wife has, so.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.720
 - I thought we were on the brink of an amazing Jane story.

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.960
 I've never, I've really had she.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.440
 - Yeah, yeah, we went to the Everglades,

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.360
 and there was a baby crocodile that you could hold,

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.040
 called Snappy. - Of course.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.600
 - And Polina held it, and I didn't have the guts to hold it.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.200
 - How big was Snappy?

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.040
 - How big were you talking?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.560
 - I would say about a foot and a half.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.400
 - Okay.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.360
 - Something like that.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.560
 - Wow, that's amazing.

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.800
 - I also did once, played mini golf in a place

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.360
 that had crocodiles sort of roaming around the world.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.520
 - Yes, yeah, there's that one golf course

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.520
 where the lake literally has giant snappy crocodiles,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.360
 which is amazing.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.960
 - You just have to stay away from them, basically.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.360
 - Yeah, okay, we're in London now.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.200
 - We are.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.160
 - Right? - Yeah, no crocodiles.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.560
 - No, no crocodiles, but some cowboys quite near here,

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.000
 there is a secret cowboy town in the middle of Kent.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.960
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.080
 It's called Laredo, it's founded in 1971,

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.160
 and they've got a blacksmith,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.080
 they've got an undertaker, a tobacconist.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.080
 - Like a working, these early models.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.920
 - It's life-size, and it's kind of functional.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.240
 So it was founded by a bloke called John Trudeau,

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.440
 who was a pig farmer, and he just loved the Wild West,

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.200
 and he just wanted to recreate the Wild West

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:44.360
 in his corner of Kent.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.240
 It's members only, and they go there at weekends,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.000
 and they recreate life in the Old West.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.840
 - Cool.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.760
 - Yeah, you can get a half an hour train

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.920
 from London and arrive in Laredo.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.200
 - And they won't let you in.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.560
 - They won't let you in, no, no.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:58.640
 - There's like a random Wild West in Morningside,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.480
 in Edinburgh.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.480
 Like it's just, you go like through an archway,

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.000
 and it's just a Wild West, like behind a bank of the flats.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.440
 Yeah, it's just there.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.920
 - I read about it, it was created by a furniture shop,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.760
 for some reason, it's called the Great American Indoors,

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.520
 the shop, and they made their own new Wild West.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.360
 - Yeah, it's not advertised.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.600
 Then we'll say, have you seen the Wild West?

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.280
 And you'll be like, no, we're in Scotland,

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.600
 and they'd say, oh, it's just over there,

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.440
 and you go and look.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.280
 - That's so weird.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.840
 - And that one you can just walk into.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.000
 - It's just like behind some flats, yeah.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:22.840
 - So weird.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.840
 - Does the piano player always stop whenever there's someone?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.000
 - No, but there's like always these planes

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.280
 coming down with ropes, so it's very strange.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.860
 (upbeat music)

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.000
 and that is James.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the best ways

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.920
 to trick puffins to a new nesting ground is with mirrors,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.320
 because they like to be in groups

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.680
 and can't tell the difference between a puffin

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.460
 and the reflection of a puffin.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.040
 - So they fail the mirror test.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.440
 They don't know that they are.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.000
 - Yeah, the mirror test is a thing with animals.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.680
 Some animals, if you show them a reflection of themselves

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:04.040
 and put a little mark on their head,

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.520
 they'll realize that it's them,

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.560
 and they'll try and wipe it off,

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.000
 whereas most animals won't do that.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.640
 They won't see, they'll see a mirror image of themselves

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.360
 and think it's another animal.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:17.880
 And in fact, humans, my daughter only did it a few weeks ago,

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.280
 and she's what, 14 months.

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.720
 So it's until that age is the first time you get to do that,

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.040
 so babies don't know it either.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.840
 But this is all about a guy called Stephen Kress,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.280
 and he was working about trying to get puffins

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.240
 into a new area.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.280
 In fact, they'd been in that area before,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.520
 but he wanted to get them back into that area

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.480
 on the East Coast of America.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.440
 And one of the ways that he did that

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.760
 was by making these decoys.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.680
 You can make actual decoys of little puffins,

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.160
 but one good way of doing it is mirrors,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.600
 'cause you can get multiple puffins.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.560
 - Oh yeah, hall of mirrors, like kaleidoscope stuff.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.400
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.280
 Unfortunately, they saw someone that were really tall,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.960
 someone that were really tall.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.880
 This mission he was on, 'cause Stephen Kress,

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720
 it sounds like a great guy.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.800
 He's been working on this for about 30 years, 40 years?

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.640
 - It's 1969.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.680
 - It's a long career in puffinology.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.160
 And he, so he and his colleagues,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.800
 they went to a breeding colony,

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.160
 which was healthy in Newfoundland, just Canada.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.880
 And they basically, they had to kidnap

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.360
 loads of baby puffins.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.480
 - Yeah, the start of the story is a bit dodgy, isn't it?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.280
 - It's a real villain-to-hero arc,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.920
 I think he and his colleagues went on,

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:23.680
 'cause they start off as puffin kidnappers, you know?

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.800
 - At the start, people are just like,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.600
 "What are you doing, stealing all those puffins?"

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.160
 - They shoved them in soup cans,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.600
 which I like, to transport them all the way

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.040
 to their new home.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.360
 But then, then, then, then there's the twist,

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.800
 the character twist, where he and his colleagues

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.680
 became puffin nannies, looking after them,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.800
 breeding them up on this new island in Maine.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.280
 And they put them in these fake burrows,

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.920
 which they had dug, and they fed them,

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.280
 they left fish in there,

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.040
 and he constructed all these decoy puffins.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.760
 And then, the thing is that the puffins go to sea,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.400
 eventually, when they become kind of teenagers,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.960
 they gain their independence, they go off,

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.720
 and then, he waited for years,

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.520
 hoping they would come back to the island.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.080
 - 'Cause the question is, would they go back to Newfoundland,

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.240
 where their kind of genes say that they should be living,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.720
 or will they remember where they lived as babies,

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.920
 and then come back to that place, and in the end?

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:10.000
 - In the end, they came back.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.800
 But I think, only in the third year,

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.360
 it was a few years before they did,

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:14.320
 and he was getting really worried,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.200
 and then, eventually, he built loads of decoys,

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.800
 and that kind of leered them back.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.200
 - Right, okay, that's very good.

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.800
 - I was reading about puffins' ministry of silly walks,

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.760
 so when they want to show that they're not any,

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.800
 'cause they live quite close together,

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.280
 they live in burrows, and so, if you want to cross across,

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.880
 you'll probably cross lots of other territories,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.680
 and if you don't want to start a fight,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.480
 they do this like, "Hey, don't mind me walk,"

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.480
 where they lower their head,

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.720
 and they sort of walk quite quickly,

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:37.120
 in trying not to get noticed.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.200
 But if they're on guard duty,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.680
 they'll stand outside their burrows nice and tall,

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.880
 and they'll sort of stamp their feet,

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.920
 like an exaggerated guard doing a march.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.440
 - Wow. - Okay, that's a real idea,

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.120
 of like, "I'm on patrol, and don't mind me, just over here."

00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.560
 - That's great. - And that's really funny.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.400
 - And they take over rabbit burrows as well.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.400
 I love that they don't even need

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.080
 to just dig their own burrows, they're just, yeah.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.200
 - They can make their own burrows if they want to.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.400
 And actually, sometimes rabbits take their burrows.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.720
 There's a whole little ecosystem going on there.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.040
 - That's pretty cool. - I went to the Isle of May

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:06.080
 a few years ago, which is off the east coast of Scotland,

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.120
 and you've got tons and tons of seabirds, loads of puffins,

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.160
 and there's certain bits where like,

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.640
 you cannot stray off the path,

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.080
 because the island is just covered in puffin burrows,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.160
 so you've got to walk on the bits that they know are safe,

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.080
 which is really cool.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.560
 - Back to Steven Kress very quickly.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.200
 He had a big problem with gulls.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.640
 Seagulls would attack the puffins,

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.920
 because seagulls had been living in this area

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.800
 long before the puffins came back.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.520
 So he tried a few different things.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.160
 He attracted turns, which are like bigger than puffins,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.600
 but smaller than gulls, and they'll kind of attack the gulls

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.440
 to stop them from coming in there.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:44.680
 And he also had a thing called a death sandwich,

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:50.200
 which is where his arc of being the evil puffin thief,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.240
 and then the nice puffin nurse, then at the end,

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.600
 he becomes the gull killer,

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.320
 because he puts these death sandwiches,

00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.800
 which is some bread with something called starlicide in,

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.640
 and starlicide is a chemical,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.280
 which is really toxic to starlings and seagulls,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.880
 but not toxic to any other animals.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.560
 He would put those out, which would kill the seagulls.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.000
 - Where's his arc sitting now?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.360
 - I think it's good.

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.320
 - If we were doing a fact about gulls, it's not good.

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320
 - Exactly, but we're not.

00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.000
 We're doing a fact about puffins.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.600
 - Sorry, my fact this week is that the evil gull killer,

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.000
 Steven Kress, and there are still,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.160
 I think there are still puffiniers,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.840
 as they call themselves, who have to go to the island

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.280
 to keep it healthy for the puffins,

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:33.240
 and prevent the gulls from taking root there.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.000
 And they have to smash up their nests,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.320
 and they also, I love this,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.600
 they have a robot mannequin,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.160
 which is dressed in a yellow coat

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.320
 and an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask, right?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.600
 And they inflate that.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.680
 I know, it sounds terrifying,

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.120
 and they inflate that to try and scare off the gulls.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.560
 It's a scarecrow, basically.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.760
 But the only problem is,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.160
 the gulls will eventually realize this is a motionless,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.120
 it's not an effective, scary thing,

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.640
 'cause it just sits there, it doesn't do anything.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.560
 So sometimes what the puffiniers will have to do is,

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.040
 they will have to dress up,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.600
 they have to put on the yellow coat and the mask,

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.880
 and then go around shooting gulls on the island

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.040
 to prove that it's a dangerous thing,

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.320
 so the gulls realize what they're doing.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.280
 - I just can't help thinking,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.640
 what if Arnold Schwarzenegger books

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.080
 a nice relaxing break, and the gulls don't know if it happens?

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.000
 - The island's off the coast of Maine, lovely.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:19.840
 - Jesus.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.680
 - I know.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.520
 - That's bad.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.000
 - But that's what it takes to, you know,

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.400
 get puffins up and running again, I'm all for it.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.480
 - I think there's a lot of gray areas,

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.320
 I'm looking after puffins,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.800
 'cause I was reading about there's some numbers

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.920
 that are declining very sadly,

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.640
 and there's some concerns that perhaps

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:34.480
 it's the food they're eating,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.320
 they're not getting the right fish,

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.480
 the fish are getting smaller,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.160
 and there's one study where to do this,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.360
 they would put up a massive net to catch a puffin,

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.520
 then take all its fish off them to examine the fish.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.120
 Doesn't say whether they gave the fish back.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.560
 - Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.640
 Their fishing is amazing,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:53.440
 because often they will have sort of depleted the area

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.720
 that's closest to an island,

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.760
 where they're fishing,

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.960
 and so they have to go on these huge journeys

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.000
 in order to get the fish,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.080
 to bring back for their starving kids

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.880
 who eat like four or five times a day.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.360
 And I watched this footage, it's amazing,

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.160
 it was a David Attenborough, Planet Earth,

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.440
 they fly 50 kilometers out to sea,

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.680
 50 kilometers, there's a whole group of them

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.160
 that just go in one go,

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.800
 they dive down into the ocean,

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.960
 and they have an amazing swimming ability,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.320
 they can swim for up to a minute holding their breath,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.720
 and they use their wings,

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.440
 like we would use our arms if we were doing front crawl,

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.480
 as they make their way,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.200
 they can go 40 meters deep,

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.840
 they come back up when they caught a fish,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.760
 it's just one fish in most cases in this footage,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.920
 they fly them back 50 kilometers again,

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.320
 and then when they get there,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.440
 very similar to the gulls.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.280
 - Oh, the kids don't want to eat it.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.860
 - No, they refuse to eat it.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.440
 - No, I'll have fish yesterday.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.080
 (laughing)

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.160
 - There are birds, which are called optic skewers,

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.680
 who are waiting for them as they come back,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.160
 knackered, and they swoop down,

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:50.440
 and they steal the fish off them.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.480
 It's an amazing shot in this Planet Earth documentary,

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.360
 because suddenly, one of them gets back,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.920
 because a guy wearing an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.480
 is suddenly shooting, say?

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.400
 No, that doesn't happen,

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.320
 but you're 100 kilometer round trip,

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.320
 and then the skewers come for one fish.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.840
 - Other skewers, they're sort of famously pirate birds,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.680
 aren't they?

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.520
 - Exactly.

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.360
 - Don't they, I think I might be making this up,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.640
 do they squeeze other birds to make them vomit up

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.200
 whatever they've just eaten,

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.040
 and then eat them?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.880
 - They're definitely villains.

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.240
 - So that might be skewers, yeah.

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.920
 - There is a bird that does that, yeah.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.640
 - The thing with skewers, well,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.440
 you pronounce them skewers, skewers, skewers, skewers.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:25.520
 The puffins can carry more than one fish,

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.840
 because they have skewers on their tongue, don't they?

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.000
 They have spiky bits on their tongue,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.760
 that they can attach one fish onto each spike,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.120
 and then go down for another one.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120
 - But if they get attacked,

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.640
 that's a skewer's crisis, you know?

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.480
 - Brilliant.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.320
 - Oh, lovely, thank you.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.160
 (laughing)

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.640
 - But part of the reason they're so good at swimming

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.280
 is their bones are dense, and other birds,

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:45.440
 they find it easy to swim,

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.200
 but they can find it harder to fly.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.600
 So did you read about these puffin patrols,

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.440
 they have in Iceland.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.280
 These are definitely good guys,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.520
 not a gray area for these ones.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.120
 So basically when the little pufflings, the baby ones,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.040
 they use the moon to navigate,

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:57.320
 but the streetlights come through them off,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.240
 so they sort of crash land in the town.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.520
 And so the whole town is basically united

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:02.640
 to like save these pufflings.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.560
 They go out on patrol, they try and find them,

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.800
 and if you find a puffling, like you have to look after it,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.920
 so they'll like take them to the cliff,

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.960
 and then they either will hot it down

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.840
 so it can like trot along and catch the breeze,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.480
 or you just lob it into the air and hope it takes flight.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.800
 - What? - And lob it into the air

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:16.640
 in the hope? - Yeah, to get,

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.360
 'cause they need to get the momentum to get up

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.560
 if it throws. - Oh, but you're catching it

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.400
 if it doesn't, right?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.240
 It's going off a cliff.

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.800
 - What if it sprained its wing?

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.840
 - Hopefully you checked that on the way in.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.360
 - I don't know, I don't think these guys sound

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.080
 like an uncomplicatedly benevolent thought.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.080
 Why don't they turn their streetlights off?

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.480
 That's what a real good guy would do.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:35.280
 - I feel like the terminal velocity of a puffin

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.600
 wouldn't be fast enough that they would die.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.440
 I think they might be all right,

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.960
 'cause they're quite small, aren't they?

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:42.800
 - They're really tiny.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.880
 - If it's the babies as well,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.080
 then they'll have a really low terminal velocity.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.240
 - Maybe. - You can survive.

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.840
 Like, didn't Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.840
 when he was looking for puffins?

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.440
 - The thing about Gordon Ramsay

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.800
 is his terminal velocity is famously low, isn't it?

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.040
 - 85 feet, I think it was, he fell off a cliff.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.720
 - I imagine when he falls,

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.880
 he's got like lots of flapping skin on his body

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.000
 and that kind of, yeah. - Oh, great.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.720
 He turns into one of those gliding parachuters.

00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.400
 - Flight fox. - Yeah.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.120
 - Sorry, why'd Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.360
 when he was looking for puffins?

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.200
 - Do you know what?

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.520
 This is a story just in the back of my head.

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.960
 I'm gonna connect it to puffins.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.360
 He was doing a documentary

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.560
 and he was looking at the various island.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.720
 He was on the side of a cliff

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.840
 and they were filming him and he just disappeared.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.880
 Yeah, and he fell down and he survived.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.200
 Yeah. - I don't believe that.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.240
 - It's true. - Is it?

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.080
 - Yeah.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.600
 - I think Gordon Ramsay is an honorable guy.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.280
 I don't see why he would lie.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.480
 - Presumably, it's on film.

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.720
 - I think they never released the film.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.160
 - Oh, they accidentally turned off the film

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.720
 before he fell 80 feet and survived.

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:40.040
 - 85, 85. - 85.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.960
 - What's that, 25 meters.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.680
 Survival, it must have been a big patch of Heather

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.760
 he landed on, or whatever it was.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.320
 - It's a big pile of other TV chefs

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.560
 previously fallen down there.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.800
 - Bounced off of Laurel Thompson, fortunately for him.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.520
 There's a thing which a lot of people say about puffins

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.040
 which is that they're monogamous.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.120
 You know, they have the same partner every year

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.760
 and that's very nice.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.280
 Well, it turns out, I think it is actually true

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.400
 'cause a load of birds, it's not true.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.240
 And they study EPCs, extra pair copulations.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.080
 That's the, do you remember?

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.240
 I think we've mentioned this once or twice before.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.800
 But they did a study of Atlantic puffins

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.280
 looking at extra pair heritage

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.400
 'cause now we've got DNA tests

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.400
 we can actually sample species.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.160
 And they are basically monogamous.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.480
 They are-- - Good for them.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.840
 - I know, so you know, no gray areas there.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.680
 It's a nice circle. - No Jerry Springer

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.000
 in the-- - No Jerry Springer.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.480
 Every DNA test comes back.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.400
 Yep, it's all fine, you are a father, great news.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.800
 - My current favorite puffin fact is that

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.760
 there is scientists creating sunglasses for puffins.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.680
 - Okay, why? - Because,

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.720
 I don't know how this happened, but they had a puffin

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.280
 and they realized that it's beak lit up under UV light.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.400
 - Okay. - Oh, you just got there.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.560
 - But the puffin was no longer alive.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.800
 So they're not completely sure

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:55.840
 if it's some sort of the way it decomposes

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:57.440
 or whether all puffins do this.

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:59.480
 So to test it, they need to get some alive puffins

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.840
 and try and UV on them.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.880
 But that could hurt their eyes.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.600
 They got to design little sunglasses to amuse themselves.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.800
 They've made them aviators.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.120
 - Okay, cool. - That's brilliant.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.240
 - What did they find? - I believe still pending.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.400
 - Still pending. - You'll find a puffin,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.080
 give it the sunglasses, shine the light,

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:13.920
 and then report back.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.320
 Because their beaks do change a lot, right?

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.600
 There's an outer beak that falls off,

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.360
 the color changes at different seasons.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.360
 - No, the beak falls off in winter.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.240
 - And it leaves them with what I found described

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.520
 in one article as a drab gray pecker.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.200
 (laughing)

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:27.480
 - My old tinder profile.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.320
 - That's amazing.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.440
 - I know, young puffins are just completely gray.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.120
 They sound so boring.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:33.960
 Just gray all the way through.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.560
 Gray beak, gray everything.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:37.400
 - I always thought that was your favorite fact of all time.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.040
 - It was one of my very, very first facts I ever felt

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.880
 for a QI. - Which one?

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.080
 - That a baby puffin is called a puffling.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.520
 But now, puffins, you notice they're on everything.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.680
 Puffins are everywhere now.

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.080
 So many kids' books about pufflings.

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.520
 And someone I know who works in publishing

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.800
 used to keep a list of which animals were on trend.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.680
 So you will have noticed it in me without realizing.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.880
 So for a while, it was sloths, they were on everything.

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.240
 It was flamingos for a while.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.560
 Llamas used to have a phase where they were on everything.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.400
 And I think puffins.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.520
 - Is it like children's books, do you mean?

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:09.360
 - Just like in paper chase or on clothing.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.200
 You could just notice it.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.400
 - Mirror cats were massive.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.480
 - Yeah, certain animals seem to like have their moment.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.640
 And I'm not quite sure why or how, but they do.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.560
 - But it's never the disgusting toad worm, is it?

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.400
 It's never like the--

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.080
 - He can be spring 2024, aren't they?

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.160
 - Never the penis worm, is it?

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.800
 - Yes. (laughs)

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.880
 - And do you feel slightly responsible for that?

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.080
 Because I think you're partly responsible

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.880
 for disseminating the adorable puffling fact.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.160
 - Because that fact has come out

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.640
 of various different QI iterations over the years.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640
 - I did put it in a lot of things.

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.320
 - Yeah, no, after all,

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.640
 there's tons of puffling stuff up there.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.160
 And they're super cute, so.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.760
 You used to get enormous flocks of puffins, didn't you?

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.800
 In the UK as well.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.240
 So the island of St. Kilda.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.400
 This was two people called Hertha and Don in 1897.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.880
 And they said that the puffins are in such numbers,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.400
 the clouds of birds sweep past us

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.000
 and make a sound like a whirlwind.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.040
 And another one said that it made a great cloud

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:05.600
 that perceptively interfered with the light of day.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.040
 And that parasites fell off the birds

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:11.920
 as they swarmed over us, much to our discomfort and annoyance.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.680
 So you can imagine there's like millions of these birds

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:17.160
 just blocking out the sun and flying over you

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.040
 and dropping the ticks on you and stuff.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.880
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.720
 - It's been incredible.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.600
 - Very cool.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.000
 In St. Kilda, there was one man who caught 620 puffins

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.400
 in a single day.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.560
 - Lesser of them?

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.400
 - Yeah, using a noose, no rod.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.480
 - No way.

00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:32.480
 Sorry to jump in on you there.

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.320
 - No, no.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:34.160
 - I didn't expect it was gonna be that.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.000
 Wow.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:35.840
 - Yeah, pretty much a Lesser.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:36.680
 That's what they used to use.

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:39.560
 Sort of like fishing rods, but with a better rope on the end.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.360
 - That's what this cat lady was using in the second one.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.200
 - Oh yeah.

00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:43.880
 Wow.

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.720
 - That's very cool.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.560
 - That's amazing.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.160
 - There are some places where the puffins are eaten,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.000
 aren't there?

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:48.840
 - Iceland.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.000
 - Yeah, Faroe Islands.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.320
 - Yeah.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.280
 Am I allowed to say I've eaten them in Iceland?

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.120
 - Have you?

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.960
 - Have you?

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.800
 - What did it taste like?

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.040
 - It was a long time ago.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.160
 - Oh, it was the 80s.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.200
 - Not that long ago.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.760
 - What did it taste like?

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:07.560
 - To me, I thought it just tasted like fishy, oily,

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.160
 not chicken, but like...

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.200
 - More like fish than like me.

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.960
 - Quail-y kind of stuff.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.080
 Like, game-y, fishy, chicken.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:16.720
 - It's a gray area.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.320
 (laughing)

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.680
 - Why is that gray area?

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.440
 - No, I guess everything we're saying about the puffins

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.520
 is sort of like, you know,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.760
 you've got to kill them to save them.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.600
 - How's that being,

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.360
 they're much more endangered than they used to be.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.200
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.040
 - So you have to...

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.880
 - Certainly back in the day

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.720
 when I was eating puffin that one time,

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.960
 they were all over them.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.400
 You couldn't move in recubes.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.600
 - You were on some kill though, weren't you?

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:35.840
 And the skies were thick with them.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.440
 You were actually doing them all the favor, yeah, yeah.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.360
 - I was so hoping that when you were grasping

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.200
 for what they tasted like,

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.920
 you're gonna be like, "No, a bit like panda."

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.240
 (laughing)

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.240
 - Like a cacopo taste to them.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:46.080
 - Yeah, but that's,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.120
 I mean, lots of places eat.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:48.960
 People eat meat,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.400
 and people eat the meats that are close to them.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.240
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.680
 - But if a particular meat is endangered,

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:53.520
 then you'd change.

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.560
 - Exactly, there was a whale on the menu,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.400
 which I didn't eat.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.240
 - Wow.

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.840
 - Does that help my archetyle?

00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.680
 - Exhilarated, yeah.

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.260
 (upbeat music)

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:08.280
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.160
 and that is Andy.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.560
 - My fact is that trash talk works better

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.800
 on dance players than shot putters.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.560
 - Ah, call that a fact.

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.400
 - There you go.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.240
 It begins.

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:20.080
 It begins.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.400
 I should have known when I picked this fact.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.240
 Idiot.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.840
 (laughing)

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.680
 - That's brilliant.

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.400
 - Yeah, it's just a study of trash talk basically.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400
 - Why would that be true?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.320
 - Well, this comes from a piece in The Economist,

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:34.640
 and it's all about sledging and,

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.600
 which is cricket-based trash talk.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.600
 And, you know, sporting insults, basically.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:40.360
 You dish out to people you're in a competition against.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.800
 And it found that there have been studies conducted

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.040
 which have found that trash talk is especially effective

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.920
 at distracting players if you're in a sport

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.080
 that needs fine motor skills or creativity,

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.600
 rather than brute-strength exhibitions.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.080
 So sports where you need to concentrate

00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.160
 are much more vulnerable,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.440
 which is why maybe cricket is vulnerable to lots of trash talk.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.440
 Chess, you don't see a lot of smack talk in chess.

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.280
 Yeah.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.080
 But you do, you get loads and, I mean, it's weird

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.680
 'cause lots of sports have different tolerances of it.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.400
 You know, so cricket has loads of it.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.920
 Boxing has loads of it, although-

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.760
 - Yeah, boxing is tough.

00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.720
 - It doesn't, you shouldn't need to do any trash talk

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.200
 'cause you're trying to hit someone hard anyway.

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.040
 - No, it's psychological.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.880
 The whole thing is a psychological warfare, right?

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.320
 - And it's very skillful sport boxing, I would say.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.160
 - Is it?

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.000
 - Yeah.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:26.840
 - I just thought you'd baster the other bloke, didn't you?

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:29.600
 - Well, that's one way of doing it.

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.120
 Whatever, if you're a really good boxer,

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:31.960
 it's all about movement.

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.800
 - Is this why my boxing career didn't...

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.040
 (laughing)

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:36.360
 Saw like a puppet.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.640
 (laughing)

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:38.960
 - I thought you'd like a giant potato.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:40.880
 Oh, no.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.480
 - Yeah, no, that's a really good point.

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.760
 In chess, I guess there is a lot of psychological stuff

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.440
 goes on, but it's not necessarily-

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.280
 - It's not normally-

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.120
 - Your shit.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:49.960
 - Your shit.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:50.800
 - Yeah, your shit.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:51.640
 (laughing)

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.880
 - In basketball, it's a big thing.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.960
 And I grew up watching basketball,

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.640
 so you would always see it happening.

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.000
 It's amazing when you see it happening,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.840
 trash talking between the sort of top players in the league.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.680
 So-

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.520
 - Are they better at it?

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.720
 - No, they're sort of, it's just interesting watching them,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.040
 'cause they're all on mic, right?

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.760
 Basically, no, no, you can hear it,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.360
 like you can hear it through the mics of the studio.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:10.680
 It comes through, you know.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.080
 - So they hear them saying like, oh.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.120
 - Yeah, exactly, you hear things.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.320
 So like, yeah, well, Shaquille O'Neal was up against,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.240
 so Shaquille O'Neal, one of the all-time greats

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.640
 of basketball against Kobe Bryant,

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.960
 who was also one of the other.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.320
 And he was overheard saying,

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.640
 "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes,"

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.680
 as he was about to dunk on him, right?

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.520
 Like, they say-

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:29.240
 - What does that mean, dunk on him?

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.680
 - Dunk on him, that's disgusting.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.880
 - Dunking is when you bring the ball into the ring

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.440
 and you hold the ring, kind of thing.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.840
 - Why is he tasting his ass when he does that?

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.200
 - Because he's going so high that the face of Kobe

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.320
 would be, yeah, and then there's this thing in basketball

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.440
 where then you make someone taste your ass after you've-

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.280
 - Got it, okay.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.120
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.880
 - Every day's a school day.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.360
 - In off the rim, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.920
 (all laughing)

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:56.160
 - And one thing they did with this research

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.640
 you're talking about is they sat people at computers

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.080
 and you had to move a slider to a particular spot

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:05.400
 and see how many you could do in two minutes.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.320
 And as you did it, a little message would come up

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.800
 on your screen, supposedly from one of the other people

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.200
 doing the experiment.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.960
 And it would either say, "I'm smarter and faster than you,"

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.240
 or, "Let's see what happens."

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:18.080
 - Hi, friend.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.080
 (all laughing)

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.240
 - And they found, actually, that people

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.160
 who got the negative messages performed better

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.600
 overall in that one.

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.560
 - I think this could spur you on.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.320
 You think I'm gonna lose, well, I'll just show you.

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.160
 - Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.920
 And that's what seemed to have happened in that one.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.840
 But then they tried it in a task

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:36.640
 which was slightly more skill-creative-based

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.720
 and they found that people did worse

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.040
 and they were more likely to cheat.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:41.880
 - Oh, yeah.

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:43.520
 - 'Cause you turns it dirty, so you're like, "Well."

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.080
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.160
 - I think one of them might have been the study

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.840
 by Karen McDermott, who was looking into this

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.400
 from the University of Connecticut.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.800
 And that involved people playing Mario Kart.

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.080
 And before the game, some of the people were insulted

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.680
 with various things like, "Grab a straw because you suck."

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.520
 - Brilliant.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.360
 - And so on.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.480
 Yeah, I think she had to pick quite carefully

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.320
 because a lot of insults might be the, you know,

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.480
 homophobic, or racist, or sexist, or whatever.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.960
 So she had to pick a carefully delineated selection

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.040
 of insults, which were cruel enough to sting,

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.140
 "Grab a straw because you suck," being one of them.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.240
 And the insulted players performed worse.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.840
 And they also rated themselves higher

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.960
 as having experienced anger and shame.

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.800
 - Oh, no.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.800
 - Yeah.

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.880
 - But were they playing Rainbow Road?

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.000
 - If you're playing Rainbow Road,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.200
 you always experience deep, deep shame

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.960
 and frustration and rage.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.120
 So, yeah, but does it make you play better or worse?

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.760
 There seem to be slightly conflicting studies

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.600
 on whether or not--

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.440
 - I read a lot of different ones.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.280
 - Yeah.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.120
 - And that's similar to what you were saying.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.440
 I also read, which just thought was a lovely point,

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.280
 that in a university study, you've got a university ethics code.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.700
 So what you can sledge someone with

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.220
 is kind of very different to what you can have

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.700
 like a whole stadium chanting at you

00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.540
 in a basketball game.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.360
 (laughing)

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.200
 - Yeah.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.140
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.380
 I also like the weird social side of trash talking

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.060
 as well within professional sports,

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.020
 which is let's say a younger player

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:04.540
 if trying to trash talk and create a relationship

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:06.980
 of conflict, which would then be on the cameras.

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.740
 And it's a way of social climbing.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:11.700
 So like, Michael Jordan, for example,

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.180
 would never trash talk whenever he was having it

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:16.420
 talk to him by like a rookie from a new team.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.560
 'Cause he thinks, I'll let my game do the talking

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:20.720
 and I don't want, I will make you famous

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.020
 by trash talking with you.

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.080
 So let's not get that.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:23.920
 - It's not worth it.

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:27.840
 - I think it's worth us saying, off menu as shit.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.000
 - Yeah, um, Chris and Rosie Ramsey.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.840
 - Oh, Wankers.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:31.660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:32.720
 - How the hell, fuck you.

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.560
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.920
 - There's no point saying, you know,

00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:37.320
 John's podcast about nothing.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.080
 - John's podcast about nothing is good, James.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.280
 I stand by, I've been listening.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.640
 I get all my facts from John's podcast about nothing.

00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.440
 (laughing)

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:46.740
 - Shout out to John.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:47.580
 - Hello, John.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.820
 (laughing)

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:55.060
 - One of my favorite sledges that I read

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.620
 was not so much a sledge, but as an AFL player

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:59.860
 called Stevie Baker and apparently during a game

00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:01.220
 he leaned over to someone and said,

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.680
 "Have you got a sausage dog?"

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.380
 (laughing)

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.660
 And they spent the next 20 minutes just being like,

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.140
 "What, what, what?"

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:08.980
 And they couldn't play.

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.140
 It was the worst insult they've heard.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.980
 - What is it?

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.820
 I'm sorry.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:12.640
 - It turned out that Baker has a sausage dog.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:13.480
 He was just like.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.300
 - I'm just making chat.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.360
 (laughing)

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.680
 This guy was like, he couldn't focus on the game.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.700
 He's like, "What's he saying?

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:20.540
 "Why does he..."

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.320
 - Yeah, I mean, I mean, well, it baffled me.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.820
 Like, I've heard the phrase sausage dog before.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.600
 I know what that is, but because it was at a sporting match

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.440
 I was thinking of a hot dog.

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:27.280
 - Yeah.

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.120
 - And we're like, "What's a sausage dog?

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:28.960
 "A hot dog is a sausage.

00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:29.800
 "What are you talking about?"

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.060
 - This is where I should swoop in and out fact you,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:31.900
 but I...

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.180
 (laughing)

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.720
 - It's all about distraction, isn't it, really?

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.040
 - I found this with you.

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.560
 - This reminds me, this isn't a fact,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.560
 but do you ever watch that episode of Cheers

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.440
 when there was like a basketball player

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.080
 and he couldn't miss and he was amazing

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.860
 and he was winning the whole season?

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.820
 And then he went to the bar and started talking about trivia

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:52.940
 with two of the barflies, Norm and whoever else it was.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.700
 And they asked him how many rivets there were

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.900
 in the basketball stadium.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.500
 And he just, all he could think about for the rest

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.260
 of his career was counting these rivets.

00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.020
 And all he would do was walk around counting

00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.060
 and he just couldn't play anymore

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:05.900
 'cause he was so discreet.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.500
 - That happened to me in an exam once.

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.340
 - What?

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.780
 - I was in an exam and people would always write on,

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.080
 and he's like, "Rickety old desk,

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.200
 "you only told them at exam time."

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.000
 And they would say like, "I heart so and so,"

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.460
 or that, "Maths is rubbish."

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.820
 (laughing)

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:18.660
 And I was saying it once.

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:20.680
 - You went to school in an episode of The Beano,

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.520
 didn't you?

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:22.360
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.400
 - I grew up in Dundee, yeah.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.240
 - Oh, yeah, so you did?

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.500
 (laughing)

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.400
 - So, but I was sitting in my seat in my exam

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:31.880
 and on my desk, someone had written,

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.960
 "There were 32 black lines on the ceiling."

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.760
 And so I look up and there are black lines

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.800
 really close together, never seen them before.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:40.720
 So of course I had to count them and I lost count.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.020
 - So I'd start again.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.380
 - Wow, do you think that might have been written

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:47.820
 by a crafty teacher trying to smoke out

00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.660
 easily distracted children?

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:50.780
 - I think it was one person in your class

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.340
 who wrote it on all the other desks apart from their own.

00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.700
 I mean, they would be top of the class.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:55.620
 - Yeah, it's good waiting.

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.820
 I'd forgotten that until now,

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.380
 but I can remember trying to count them.

00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.580
 - How did your exam, you'll have still passed, I guess.

00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.000
 - I play very badly, I don't remember.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.580
 - That's so funny.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.060
 I was looking 'cause you were talking about

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:10.420
 darts and shop putting, some trash talking in those spots.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.920
 And of course, we can't not talk about Gary Anderson

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.240
 and Wesley Harms.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:16.320
 - Of course we can't, thank God.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:21.320
 - The amazing match when Harms, who lost 10-2,

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.200
 did an interview and said there was a frequent smell

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.200
 that came from his opponent.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:27.960
 And he said, "It'll take me two nights

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.120
 to lose the smell from my nose."

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:30.960
 - Wow.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:31.800
 - And he claimed that Gary Anderson

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:35.360
 had been farting throughout the match to put him off.

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:38.400
 And then obviously they interview the loser first

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.640
 and then they interview the winner

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.020
 and they interviewed Gary Anderson

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.640
 and said, "Why were you farting the whole time?"

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.560
 And he said, "There was definitely a smell,

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.600
 but it was 1,010%, not me.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.460
 It was definitely the other guy."

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:53.560
 And Anderson said, "You can put your finger up my arse.

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.360
 There'll be no smell there."

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.200
 - What?

00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.040
 - What?

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.300
 - What is it with this sportsman?

00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.940
 - Yeah.

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.460
 - Okay, I mean, I believe the first guy,

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:03.240
 'cause that's a very high percentage, so.

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.860
 (all laughing)

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.100
 - Do we have trash talk at QI?

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:07.940
 - No.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:08.780
 - What do you mean?

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:11.420
 - I just, so there was a study of Fortune 500 companies

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.660
 and like, can you remember people being slagged off

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.220
 in that kind of gamesmanship way in the office?

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:18.580
 61% of employees found they could remember trash talk

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.840
 within the last few months.

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:20.680
 - Yeah.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.040
 - And I don't think we do sledging here, really.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.320
 - I've got nine years worth of--

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.920
 (all laughing)

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:27.020
 - And unfortunately for you guys, it's on record.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:28.860
 (all laughing)

00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:29.680
 - Cue the clip.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:30.520
 - Yeah.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.140
 - 'Cause this podcast, the whole HR exercise.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.940
 - One day you guys are gonna be called into an office, yeah.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.140
 One place where you get smacked talk famously is wrestling.

00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.360
 - Yeah.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.440
 - And I was reading the book,

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.000
 it's called Everything to Play For,

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.880
 the QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:48.720
 - Oh my goodness.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.940
 - Sounds a lot of sounds.

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.060
 - Well, I don't know, it doesn't come out until October,

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:53.960
 so I don't know if it's rubbish or not,

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.980
 but I suspect, the big names I suspect it'll be quite good.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.140
 - It's gonna be a fair hearing, eh?

00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.600
 - But they argue in that book

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.860
 (all laughing)

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.660
 that the earliest depictions of wrestling that we have,

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:05.520
 which are in the Egyptian tombs,

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.160
 they're quite similar to today's pro wrestling.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.960
 So there's an argument that it could be

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.840
 that all the games were fixed

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.600
 because they were often shown as being one person

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.240
 from Egypt, clearly,

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.860
 and one person from a place that isn't Egypt, clearly,

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:20.680
 and the Egyptian one always won.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:23.600
 And perhaps it was that they were fixed fights

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.280
 so that the pharaoh would know

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.680
 that his people were the greatest in the whole world.

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.840
 - Who's saying ancient Egyptian pro wrestling is fake?

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.000
 - That's what I'm saying.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.440
 Sorry, no, that's what James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.720
 are saying in that book,

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:39.320
 everything to play for the QI book of spot out in October.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.640
 But the other thing is that there's a really early one

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.000
 and there is some writing next to it.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.480
 And it's an Egyptian who defeated a Nubian opponent

00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.400
 and he says, "Woe to you, O Nubian enemy,

00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.840
 "I will make you take a hopeless fall

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.880
 "in the presence of the pharaoh."

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:59.880
 And so that's basically smack talk from 3,200 years ago.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.720
 - Tell me the flavor that you find in my ass.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.960
 (laughing)

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:13.640
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:14.960
