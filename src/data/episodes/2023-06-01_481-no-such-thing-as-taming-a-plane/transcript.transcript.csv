00:00:00,00:00:06,"Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here just to let you know that our special guest on this week's fish is none other than"
00:00:06,00:00:11,"Ann Miller. You will remember Ann because she's been on loads of times before, though she hasn't been on for a little while"
00:00:11,00:00:13,We are so excited to see her again.
00:00:13,00:00:20,"Ann is a brilliant children's author. She's written Mickey and the Animal Spies, a series of children's books all about animals spying and codes."
00:00:20,00:00:25,"They're fabulous. And as you're about to hear, she is obviously a magnificent researcher and elf."
00:00:25,00:00:27,So we hope you enjoy this episode.
00:00:27,00:00:38,"That's right. We also just want to quickly say happy birthday publication to Andrew Hunter Murray because the sanctuary, yeah, has just been released in paperback."
00:00:38,00:00:45,This is such a brilliant book. It's a book that is so brilliant that waterstones have actually decided to make it the thriller of the month.
00:00:45,00:00:47,So you're going to see it everywhere in bookshops.
00:00:47,00:00:53,And it's a book that's been called many things by many great people. It's been called imaginative and intriguing.
00:00:53,00:00:58,The sanctuary sucks you in and doesn't let you leave until the very last page by Anthony Horowitz.
00:00:58,00:01:05,"It's a brilliantly clever thriller by a brilliantly clever author, says Richard Osman. They are all telling the truth."
00:01:05,00:01:12,"Oh, Dan, thank you. Yeah, guys, it would mean the absolute world to me if you picked up a copy of the sanctuary in paperback."
00:01:12,00:01:22,"It's a gripping twisty thriller set on a mysterious island off the coast up north where one of the world's wealthiest, most enigmatic men is building an entirely new society."
00:01:22,00:01:28,It's all about that and what the young hero from the city finds when he goes and sees this new world being built.
00:01:28,00:01:32,It's about billionaires. It's about mysterious islands. It's about the near future.
00:01:32,00:01:36,"If you're looking for a gripping summer read on the beach, I think this could be the one for you."
00:01:36,00:01:46,"That's right. And it's also brilliant. So do make sure you go and get a copy from our own personal Sunday Times bestselling author here on the show, Andrew Hunter Murray."
00:01:46,00:01:54,"As I say, available in all good bookshops, both online and in the real world, do pick it up, help our buddy out to get back in that Sunday Times chart."
00:01:54,00:01:56,"All right, on with the show."
00:01:56,00:01:58,On with the podcast.
00:01:58,00:02:12,[Music]
00:02:12,00:02:20,"Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn."
00:02:20,00:02:25,"My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ann Miller."
00:02:25,00:02:30,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days."
00:02:30,00:02:37,"And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann."
00:02:37,00:02:45,My fact is that Ann of Green Gables is from the same island as the world's largest potato sculpture.
00:02:45,00:02:48,"Welcome back, Ann."
00:02:48,00:02:53,"Are you suggesting a link, a causal link between the two?"
00:02:53,00:02:55,Between great literature and great snacks.
00:02:55,00:03:01,"Oh, that's a large potato, a great snack. I'm not coming around the house. Super Bowl Sunday."
00:03:01,00:03:04,So I don't know really who Ann of Green Gables is.
00:03:04,00:03:06,So I give you a pot as Ann of Green Gables one on one.
00:03:06,00:03:09,So Ann of Green Gables is one of my favorite books of all time.
00:03:09,00:03:11,It is set on Prince Edward Island in Canada.
00:03:11,00:03:16,I was given it when I was very young and the setting is just completely beautiful.
00:03:16,00:03:18,So the thing about Ann is she is an orphan.
00:03:18,00:03:22,This brother and sister called Matthew Marilla live at a place called Green Gables.
00:03:22,00:03:26,And they are convinced to adopt an orphan boy to help them on the farm.
00:03:26,00:03:30,"But when they go to collect the boy, it's Ann. She's a chatterbox. She's an imaginative."
00:03:30,00:03:35,"She gets into endless scrapes, but they love her and she sort of builds this new life on Prince Edward Island."
00:03:35,00:03:40,"And when I was a little bit older, my godmother sent me a postcard from Green Gables."
00:03:40,00:03:42,And it was as if someone had sent me a card from Narnia.
00:03:42,00:03:45,I didn't understand how she'd been somewhere that was in a book.
00:03:45,00:03:50,"And I remember being so confused and like it was like, ""Oh, nice time at Green Gables."""
00:03:50,00:03:51,"And I was like, ""How did you get there?"""
00:03:51,00:03:53,It's not a really big potato. Did she say that as well?
00:03:53,00:03:57,She did not. She did not. I found out about that more recently.
00:03:57,00:04:01,"But yeah, so the island, because Lizzie Moore Montgomery, who wrote the book, lived there."
00:04:01,00:04:05,Ann is set there. There's lots of places in the book that are actually there.
00:04:05,00:04:09,And it's a sweeping series. There are several books beyond Ann of Green Gables.
00:04:09,00:04:16,And I was planning the trip of a lifetime to go and see Prince Edward Island for somewhere 2020.
00:04:16,00:04:19,"So I didn't make it there. But while I was reading about Prince Edward Island,"
00:04:19,00:04:23,I found out that they also are the home of the Canadian Potato Museum.
00:04:23,00:04:28,And outside is a 4.3 meter tall potato. We had a picture taken.
00:04:28,00:04:31,"And I just, I almost want to go there as much as I want to go to Green Gables."
00:04:31,00:04:36,It's got exhibitions. It's got potatoes in tiny coffins to show the different diseases they can have.
00:04:36,00:04:40,It's got a potato themed gift shop. It's got a potato themed restaurant.
00:04:40,00:04:45,"So you can have baked potato with side of crisps. You can have with potato skins, potato soup."
00:04:45,00:04:47,And what do you reckon you can have for pudding?
00:04:47,00:04:50,"Oh, I know that they make potato fudge there. Yeah."
00:04:50,00:04:52,Potato fudge. Potato fudge.
00:04:52,00:04:54,With mashed potato.
00:04:54,00:04:59,I did have a quick look at TripAdvisor for the Potato Museum.
00:04:59,00:05:05,Pretty overwhelmingly good. I think it's also a tribute to Canadian positivity and politeness.
00:05:05,00:05:08,Which one of you picked out there?
00:05:08,00:05:12,"Oh, you know, obviously I was looking for the negative reviews."
00:05:12,00:05:16,"Actually, there are very few which is a tribute to the restaurant."
00:05:16,00:05:23,"Well, there's one three star review which sniffs that the big potato could have been a little more realistic."
00:05:23,00:05:27,The TripAdvisor review does suggest a duration one to two hours for your visit.
00:05:27,00:05:34,"I think by the end of the second hour, you'll be running short of things to do."
00:05:34,00:05:38,"You're right, they have absolutely loads of stuff."
00:05:38,00:05:44,They say it's a living testament to the humble tuber and those who have tilled the soil in its evolution.
00:05:44,00:05:47,Did they have any two or one star reviews?
00:05:47,00:05:50,They had so few actually that I think it would be unrepresentative of me to read any out.
00:05:50,00:05:53,And I didn't write any down because they weren't very amusingly written.
00:05:53,00:05:56,But it's clearly a very popular place.
00:05:56,00:06:02,"The museum was started by a guy called Dr Lloyd George Dewar, who was a politician."
00:06:02,00:06:07,"And I tried to find anything interesting about him, which was really tough."
00:06:07,00:06:11,"I even went into like these, what they call it, the websites that tell you about your family."
00:06:11,00:06:13,"Oh, like, yeah, yeah, ancestry."
00:06:13,00:06:15,"Yeah, like an ancestry one."
00:06:15,00:06:23,And I found out that his great grandfather died at the age of 101 in the town of Dole in Persia.
00:06:23,00:06:25,The only interesting fact about that.
00:06:25,00:06:27,"So I could find, yeah, amazing."
00:06:27,00:06:30,"How heavy was the sculpture potato again, by the way?"
00:06:30,00:06:31,They didn't say the weight.
00:06:31,00:06:32,They don't list the weight.
00:06:32,00:06:33,They don't list the weight.
00:06:33,00:06:34,Just the height.
00:06:34,00:06:37,I found the world's heaviest potato and was just curious.
00:06:37,00:06:38,How heavy is the difference?
00:06:38,00:06:41,"Well, it's going to be a lot less heavy, I assume."
00:06:41,00:06:42,We're saying heaviest real potato.
00:06:42,00:06:43,Is it a real one?
00:06:43,00:06:45,"Yeah, it's a real potato, which was just under five kilograms."
00:06:45,00:06:46,Nice.
00:06:46,00:06:53,"And that, well, that, no, that's, I know, well, this is the thing is potatoes aren't water bearing organisms like your squashes."
00:06:53,00:06:56,That's why they take squashes kind of a ton and the biggest potato.
00:06:56,00:07:01,"But it's grown by friend of the podcast, Peter Glazebrook, who we've mentioned several times before,"
00:07:01,00:07:07,because he's done things like the longest bean or the biggest maroon or whatever it is.
00:07:07,00:07:09,"Yeah, he's got a load of those records."
00:07:09,00:07:10,He's a UK guy.
00:07:10,00:07:11,"Yeah, yeah."
00:07:11,00:07:12,Which is great.
00:07:12,00:07:14,We should get him into the building sometime.
00:07:14,00:07:17,"Unfortunately, he won't fit through the door."
00:07:17,00:07:20,"He can carry his bean the other way, you know."
00:07:20,00:07:21,"Oh, that's a good point."
00:07:21,00:07:23,But what about the nine foot apple?
00:07:23,00:07:27,I wanted to find a bigger potato to kind of spoil this fact.
00:07:27,00:07:29,Because that's my gel in this podcast.
00:07:29,00:07:33,So I looked at all the other potato museums around the world to see if they had one.
00:07:33,00:07:35,There are surprisingly quite a few.
00:07:35,00:07:36,There are quite a few.
00:07:36,00:07:41,"But I found in the Idaho potato museum, they have the world's largest Pringle."
00:07:41,00:07:46,And we have perhaps a Pringles controversy with this.
00:07:46,00:07:47,"Further, further."
00:07:47,00:07:53,"Further, because I knew when Sarah Pasco was on, but she had five Pringles controversies."
00:07:53,00:07:54,Yes.
00:07:54,00:07:59,"But this is the world's largest Pringle, but it's flat."
00:07:59,00:08:01,"Oh, it's not the shape of a Pringle."
00:08:01,00:08:03,So do you call that a Pringle?
00:08:03,00:08:04,Was it made by Pringles?
00:08:04,00:08:05,It was made by Pringles.
00:08:05,00:08:06,Yeah.
00:08:06,00:08:08,Is it made from the material of Pringle?
00:08:08,00:08:12,It's made from the hydrogenated potato starch.
00:08:12,00:08:13,Potato starch.
00:08:13,00:08:14,It's just not got the shape.
00:08:14,00:08:15,That's interesting.
00:08:15,00:08:16,What makes a Pringle?
00:08:16,00:08:17,Is it the shape or is it the...
00:08:17,00:08:19,Do you reckon it's a Pringle if it's not Pringle shaped?
00:08:19,00:08:21,"I think if it's made by Pringles, it's a Pringle."
00:08:21,00:08:22,Do you?
00:08:22,00:08:24,What about the box that's made by Pringles?
00:08:24,00:08:25,No.
00:08:25,00:08:27,The box is also a Pringle.
00:08:27,00:08:29,It's a cylindrical Pringle.
00:08:29,00:08:31,I'm going to double down on this.
00:08:31,00:08:32,"Okay, fine."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"Sadly, I do agree."
00:08:34,00:08:36,I think they have name rights.
00:08:36,00:08:39,So I can't call it a Pringles controversy.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"Oh, well, I think we've certainly argued about it just now."
00:08:42,00:08:45,It's controversial that you're trying to introduce it as a controversy.
00:08:45,00:08:46,Certainly.
00:08:46,00:08:47,"Okay, great."
00:08:47,00:08:49,I'll email Sarah.
00:08:49,00:08:53,I did find out about the world's another non-largest potato in the world.
00:08:53,00:08:57,"And this was, you may well have seen this in your research as well, which was nearly a"
00:08:57,00:09:00,knockout blow to Peter Glazebrook's Five Kilo Potato.
00:09:00,00:09:03,"Which is, I think, about an eight kilo potato."
00:09:03,00:09:08,"Yeah, it was found by a pair of farmers in New Zealand who, the Guinness World Records"
00:09:08,00:09:11,"people, wrote back to them when they wrote in saying, ""We've got this."""
00:09:11,00:09:14,"They said, ""In fact, it's a tuber of a kind of gourd."
00:09:14,00:09:18,"A DNA testing actually revealed in true Jerry Springer style."""
00:09:18,00:09:19,Wow.
00:09:19,00:09:20,It wasn't a potato.
00:09:20,00:09:21,It wasn't a potato at all.
00:09:21,00:09:22,It was called Doug.
00:09:22,00:09:23,Doug.
00:09:23,00:09:25,After how they got it out of the grave.
00:09:25,00:09:26,Doug.
00:09:26,00:09:29,"Samantha Baldwin, who's a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for Food and Plant Research,"
00:09:29,00:09:31,presumably having a morning off or something.
00:09:31,00:09:36,"So we tried running multiple tests on samples of Doug, but he just wasn't behaving like"
00:09:36,00:09:38,a potato should.
00:09:38,00:09:40,Because he wasn't a potato.
00:09:40,00:09:45,"I like the idea of vegetable espionage, though, like posing as a potato for many, many years."
00:09:45,00:09:46,"Yeah, I mean, it looks like a potato."
00:09:46,00:09:49,"And the finders, they made a little trolley to drag it around on."
00:09:49,00:09:50,It's quite sweet.
00:09:50,00:09:52,I have a couple more contenders for giant potatoes.
00:09:52,00:09:53,"Oh, go on."
00:09:53,00:09:57,So I was a little bit concerned when I was double checking that there was a giant potato in
00:09:57,00:09:59,"Cyprus, which was two foot taller."
00:09:59,00:10:03,"But sadly, or luckily for me, was chopped down by vandals."
00:10:03,00:10:07,That wasn't me who did it.
00:10:07,00:10:09,Was it just done this week?
00:10:09,00:10:10,Really?
00:10:10,00:10:11,Just after you said this fact?
00:10:11,00:10:12,That sounds suspicious.
00:10:12,00:10:13,You are looking tanned.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"Yeah, and you look so gleeful at the moment."
00:10:17,00:10:21,"I mean, no jury would acquit you at the moment."
00:10:21,00:10:24,"I can't look out if you're sad or, yeah, if you're hysterical."
00:10:24,00:10:25,I'm very sad.
00:10:25,00:10:28,"So the one inside for us was two foot taller, but it's been..."
00:10:28,00:10:31,You're not doing a good impression of someone who hasn't chopped down a giant potato.
00:10:31,00:10:32,Put it that way.
00:10:32,00:10:34,"Well, I definitely didn't chop down the one in Australia."
00:10:34,00:10:36,"So they have the big things, I'm sure."
00:10:36,00:10:37,"Yeah, of course, yeah."
00:10:37,00:10:39,And they have the big potato.
00:10:39,00:10:41,"But theirs is lying down, so it's long."
00:10:41,00:10:44,Did someone knock it up?
00:10:44,00:10:48,"But it did for a while have a face, which was so mildly terrifying."
00:10:48,00:10:50,And the face has been taken away.
00:10:50,00:10:52,I'm not sure if it was stolen.
00:10:52,00:10:53,Wow.
00:10:53,00:10:55,Any more for potatoes?
00:10:55,00:10:56,No.
00:10:56,00:10:58,How about Prince Edward Island?
00:10:58,00:10:59,"Well, they do."
00:10:59,00:11:02,They make about a million tons of potatoes each year.
00:11:02,00:11:04,"They're big, big potatoes."
00:11:04,00:11:08,"Yeah, a quarter of Canada's potatoes, despite it being a very small Canadian province."
00:11:08,00:11:10,"Yeah, one of the smallest, I would say."
00:11:10,00:11:16,"A lot of the potatoes on Prince Edward Island are grown and processed by McCain,"
00:11:16,00:11:19,who are the world's largest manufacturer of frozen potato products.
00:11:19,00:11:21,You will know them from their oven chips.
00:11:21,00:11:23,"Yes, big fans."
00:11:23,00:11:27,They were founded by two brothers called Harrison and Wallace McCain.
00:11:27,00:11:31,"And like it seems, every single company that's founded by two brothers,"
00:11:31,00:11:35,they got into a massive legal dispute and then one of the brothers had to leave
00:11:35,00:11:37,and took over a thing called Maple Leaf Foods.
00:11:37,00:11:39,"No, rivals."
00:11:39,00:11:43,I thought you were going to say there's a potato equator around the world.
00:11:43,00:11:45,Like the Eldie Brothers.
00:11:45,00:11:47,"But no, isn't that surprising?"
00:11:47,00:11:48,That is bizarre.
00:11:48,00:11:52,"It does seem this thing, that brothers start companies and they fall out."
00:11:52,00:11:54,Was it Adidas?
00:11:54,00:11:56,Adidas.
00:11:56,00:11:58,"Yeah, that's so weird."
00:11:58,00:12:00,"Wow, and Oasis."
00:12:00,00:12:02,"Oasis, yeah."
00:12:02,00:12:05,So it's a very big island as well.
00:12:05,00:12:07,It's 175 miles long.
00:12:07,00:12:09,Did I just say it was a small one?
00:12:09,00:12:11,"It's a small province, but it's a big island."
00:12:11,00:12:13,You know what I mean?
00:12:13,00:12:15,Because Canada's massive.
00:12:15,00:12:17,I think everyone forgets how big Canada is.
00:12:17,00:12:19,Just shout out for Canada there.
00:12:19,00:12:22,But did you know we have a lot of listeners on Prince Edward Island?
00:12:22,00:12:24,Really?
00:12:24,00:12:27,"So I had a little look in the inbox, the fish inbox, podcast@qi.com."
00:12:27,00:12:30,"We have had so many messages from people over the years saying,"
00:12:30,00:12:32,"""I'm on Prince Edward Island and I would like you to cover it."""
00:12:32,00:12:33,And here are some facts.
00:12:33,00:12:35,So I've got a couple for you.
00:12:35,00:12:39,"Ryan Barrett, who works for the PEI Potato Board."
00:12:39,00:12:42,"Wow, you picked that up, friend."
00:12:42,00:12:44,"Yeah, I mean, he wrote an email a couple of years ago."
00:12:44,00:12:46,This was when Anna was in charge of the inbox.
00:12:46,00:12:48,"Ryan, I don't think you've got to reply."
00:12:48,00:12:52,So I'm going to write that wrong.
00:12:52,00:12:54,Anna really hates Prince Edward Island.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"He doesn't say Prince Edward Island, does he?"
00:12:56,00:12:58,Every week she goes on about how much she hates it.
00:12:58,00:13:00,You have to cut it out.
00:13:00,00:13:02,He just said some cool place names they've got.
00:13:02,00:13:06,"They've got an Alaska, a Belfast, a New Zealand, a Toronto, a Norway,"
00:13:06,00:13:10,"a Crapo, which is French for toad, I didn't know,"
00:13:10,00:13:13,"and a Surice, which is French for mouse."
00:13:13,00:13:16,"And he also has a fact about Anne of Green Gables, which is that,"
00:13:16,00:13:18,"because of Anne of Green Gables,"
00:13:18,00:13:21,Prince Edward Island gets thousands and thousands of Japanese tourists every year.
00:13:21,00:13:23,And that's because the book was the first book
00:13:23,00:13:25,taught in English in Japan after the Second World War.
00:13:25,00:13:26,It's massive there.
00:13:26,00:13:27,So big cultural influence.
00:13:27,00:13:29,"Yeah, still to this day, it's ginormous."
00:13:29,00:13:32,"And they have schools named after it there, the School of Green Gables."
00:13:32,00:13:36,They've got the University of Prince Edward Island School of Nursing.
00:13:36,00:13:39,And apparently adaptations are just always on TV.
00:13:39,00:13:41,Just non-stop on TV in Japan.
00:13:41,00:13:42,I've always heard that.
00:13:42,00:13:44,I never really understood why.
00:13:44,00:13:49,And I read a really cool article by Margaret Atwood to celebrate Anne's 100th birthday.
00:13:49,00:13:52,"And she said she'd done an event in Japan, and she'd asked the audience,"
00:13:52,00:13:55,and her translator had written down the responses.
00:13:55,00:13:58,And one of the big reasons is the author who translated it in Japan
00:13:58,00:14:01,"was already very beloved, so sort of had an audience there."
00:14:01,00:14:03,And there are many things about the book that just really resonated.
00:14:03,00:14:07,"So Anne was an orphan, and there were sadly a lot of orphans in Japan after the war."
00:14:07,00:14:10,"She's got a huge passion for Apple Blossom and Cherry Blossom,"
00:14:10,00:14:13,"which was very popular in Japan, and sort of her work ethic."
00:14:13,00:14:15,"She's not scared of hard work, and she's very thoughtful,"
00:14:15,00:14:18,"but she's also quite forgetful, but it's because she's daydreaming."
00:14:18,00:14:22,"She's not lazy. She tries to do her best, and she does wind up in scrapes, but it's never..."
00:14:22,00:14:24,She means well.
00:14:24,00:14:30,"I did read one place that said that America kind of pushed Anne of Green Gables after the war,"
00:14:30,00:14:35,because they thought it would help kind of as American liberal propaganda.
00:14:35,00:14:41,"And they thought that this kind of book, which showed that women were more free-thinking,"
00:14:41,00:14:44,might get them away from some of their old ideas.
00:14:44,00:14:47,So that was supposedly one of the reasons.
00:14:47,00:14:52,"She sounds like a pretty cool character, the author Lucy Maud Montgomery."
00:14:52,00:14:55,"When she was a kid, she had two imaginary friends, which is really cool."
00:14:55,00:14:58,"So she was at her grandparents' house, and they had a bookcase,"
00:14:58,00:15:02,"and it had glass reflection doors on the bookcase,"
00:15:02,00:15:05,and she could see herself in the reflection.
00:15:05,00:15:08,"So the one on the left was a reflection of someone that she called Katie Maurice,"
00:15:08,00:15:11,"and the right was Lucy Gray, and it was both her, both her reflections,"
00:15:11,00:15:14,but she created them as her imaginary friends.
00:15:14,00:15:16,"Yeah, very cool idea."
00:15:16,00:15:21,And I love that her titles of her books all sound like she's still workshopping the author title.
00:15:21,00:15:26,"This is Emily of New Moon, Pat of Silver Bush, Kill Many of the Orchard."
00:15:26,00:15:27,One more to add to that.
00:15:27,00:15:31,"So there's six in the Anne of series, and then there are two that focus on her children."
00:15:31,00:15:35,"And the second one is Rilla of Ingleside, which is her youngest daughter."
00:15:35,00:15:39,"So spoiler alert, she goes up to get married and has a bunch of children."
00:15:39,00:15:42,"But what I didn't realize when I was younger is I followed the books through,"
00:15:42,00:15:45,"and I see her grow up, and I hadn't clocked that as she grew up,"
00:15:45,00:15:49,"the year would get so much closer to the war, so it becomes a book about the First World War."
00:15:49,00:15:54,"So Rilla of Ingleside is about war coming to Canada, which I wasn't expecting."
00:15:54,00:15:56,"And so two of her children end up fighting in the war,"
00:15:56,00:15:59,"her daughter Rilla ends up adopting a war baby and looking after him,"
00:15:59,00:16:03,and it's just very odd to take a character who you know from a beloved children's book
00:16:03,00:16:05,and put them in World War One.
00:16:05,00:16:09,"I think this about, it's a slightly different example of it,"
00:16:09,00:16:13,"because there's an episode of Frasier where Martin Crane, Frasier's dad,"
00:16:13,00:16:15,"has just watched the Austin Powers film,"
00:16:15,00:16:18,"and it's very weird thinking of them in the same conceptual universe,"
00:16:18,00:16:21,"because there's a bit where Martin keeps on saying, ""Shagadelic baby, yeah!"""
00:16:21,00:16:24,And it really takes you out of yourself.
00:16:24,00:16:29,It's quite amazing that she gave over the trademark basically to Anna Green-Gables
00:16:29,00:16:34,"to not only her daughters and the heirs, but to Prince Edward Island as well."
00:16:34,00:16:37,"So they've got the trademark, which means that anyone who works on the island"
00:16:37,00:16:41,is allowed to make their own sort of products or merchandise and sell them.
00:16:41,00:16:45,"Yeah, with no worry of the estate coming at them, because they are the estate."
00:16:45,00:16:47,"Wow, can you do anything?"
00:16:47,00:16:50,"It sounds like it. I mean, possibly you might have to pitch and say, you know..."
00:16:50,00:16:53,"Yeah, you can have Anna Green-Gables, for instance."
00:16:53,00:16:54,"Oh, yes."
00:16:54,00:16:56,The second World War book.
00:16:56,00:17:05,"Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact."
00:17:05,00:17:10,"My fact this week is, in 1952, a cowboy successfully lassoed a plane"
00:17:10,00:17:12,as it flew past his house.
00:17:12,00:17:13,His house?
00:17:13,00:17:15,"Yeah, so he was working at this house."
00:17:15,00:17:17,He was working with his boss.
00:17:17,00:17:18,"I have a question, Dan."
00:17:18,00:17:19,Yeah.
00:17:19,00:17:20,Successfully lassoed?
00:17:20,00:17:21,Yeah.
00:17:21,00:17:23,Does that mean he got the lasso around the plane
00:17:23,00:17:26,and then the plane flew off with his lasso attached?
00:17:26,00:17:27,He tamed it.
00:17:27,00:17:28,He tamed it.
00:17:28,00:17:30,"Yeah, yeah, he ended up riding the plane."
00:17:30,00:17:34,"He broke it, you know, he made it submissive to him."
00:17:34,00:17:36,That's Andy's got it right.
00:17:36,00:17:39,And the plane lives happily in his garden to this day.
00:17:39,00:17:40,Yeah.
00:17:40,00:17:44,"No, this is, the basic story is that he was at this house."
00:17:44,00:17:50,"He was working as a cowboy, and this plane just kept flying really low over the house"
00:17:50,00:17:53,"and kept going by, and had no idea what was going on."
00:17:53,00:17:56,It turns out what was going on was the pilot on the inside
00:17:56,00:18:00,"was trying to drop a love letter to a girl who lived inside the house,"
00:18:00,00:18:04,"and flying Kai, he was trying to get her to come out to see the love letter being dropped, right?"
00:18:04,00:18:06,But this cowboy gets pissed off.
00:18:06,00:18:08,So he gets out his lasso.
00:18:08,00:18:11,It's a three and a half meter long lasso.
00:18:11,00:18:14,"And as the guy is swooping down, he's flying very low."
00:18:14,00:18:16,"You know, he's got to drop the letter so it lands on a good spot."
00:18:16,00:18:17,Absolutely.
00:18:17,00:18:21,"So he throws the lasso at the plane, it manages to collide with the propeller,"
00:18:21,00:18:25,catches onto it and snaps off and gets tangled up in the propeller.
00:18:25,00:18:29,So the pilot has no choice but to turn around and quickly land the plane.
00:18:29,00:18:31,Obviously the cowboy was knocked onto his back.
00:18:31,00:18:32,It was not pleasant.
00:18:32,00:18:33,Obviously.
00:18:33,00:18:35,Did the guy in the plane survive?
00:18:35,00:18:36,"Yeah, he did."
00:18:36,00:18:38,"And actually years later, when he was 78 years old,"
00:18:38,00:18:42,there was a photo of him with the propeller with the lasso rope still wrapped around it.
00:18:42,00:18:43,Wow.
00:18:43,00:18:44,Did he get the girl?
00:18:44,00:18:46,I couldn't find that bit of the story.
00:18:46,00:18:47,Great question.
00:18:47,00:18:48,"Yeah, great question."
00:18:48,00:18:50,"Can I just say, everyone in the story is an idiot."
00:18:50,00:18:52,Not the girl?
00:18:52,00:18:54,Why isn't she coming out of her house?
00:18:54,00:18:56,How would she know to come out?
00:18:56,00:18:59,There's a plane flying apparently two meters above your house.
00:18:59,00:19:00,Show some curiosity.
00:19:00,00:19:02,Like she's idiot three on the list.
00:19:02,00:19:06,"Idiot two, I think is probably the pilot who's doing this magic."
00:19:06,00:19:07,Just send the card.
00:19:07,00:19:08,It doesn't matter.
00:19:08,00:19:09,Idiot one's the cowboy.
00:19:09,00:19:10,Why?
00:19:10,00:19:13,Because he could have killed the pilot and himself.
00:19:13,00:19:14,But it's a good point though.
00:19:14,00:19:17,I felt sorry for the pilot because I thought he's trying to do something in secret.
00:19:17,00:19:20,"Instead his plane's fallen out of the sky and made a big noise, presumably."
00:19:20,00:19:22,But the post is pretty secret.
00:19:22,00:19:23,"Yeah, this is not secret."
00:19:23,00:19:25,"This is less secret, I would say, than the post."
00:19:25,00:19:26,He's not trying to be secret.
00:19:26,00:19:27,This is romance.
00:19:27,00:19:28,"This is, look, you can see me."
00:19:28,00:19:29,"Hi, I've got a letter."
00:19:29,00:19:30,I want to show you my love.
00:19:30,00:19:33,Is it like the 80s thing of turning up outside the house with a boombox?
00:19:33,00:19:34,I was thinking.
00:19:34,00:19:36,Or the love actually thing of turning up with the cards.
00:19:36,00:19:37,It's exactly that.
00:19:37,00:19:38,The propeller card.
00:19:38,00:19:42,I would be good in love actually in that scene if a lasso just came in for the second one.
00:19:42,00:19:46,Or if he's going round to loop the loop with a plane.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"And every time he does the bottom of the loop, it's another card."
00:19:48,00:19:49,Oh yeah.
00:19:49,00:19:50,Oh.
00:19:50,00:19:52,"Sorry, forgot to say."
00:19:52,00:19:53,"Yeah, no."
00:19:53,00:19:54,"Yeah, fools."
00:19:54,00:19:55,It's a great story.
00:19:55,00:19:57,It's a very random story.
00:19:57,00:20:02,"It appeared in a Time Magazine article in a language that is just, it says like, then"
00:20:02,00:20:06,"a few, few years ago, some smart fellows bought themselves a little airplane and opened a flying"
00:20:06,00:20:09,club just a hood and a holler from where the ranch cowboy.
00:20:09,00:20:10,This is Time Magazine.
00:20:10,00:20:12,This is how they're reporting the story.
00:20:12,00:20:13,So yeah.
00:20:13,00:20:14,50s journalism.
00:20:14,00:20:17,"Yeah, his name was Euclides Guterres is how I'm going to pronounce that."
00:20:17,00:20:18,Who's that?
00:20:18,00:20:19,That's the cowboy.
00:20:19,00:20:20,That's the cowboy.
00:20:20,00:20:21,Yeah.
00:20:21,00:20:25,"And again, so little detail about this story, but it's the South Brazilian cattle ranchers."
00:20:25,00:20:27,So I don't even think this is an American cowboy.
00:20:27,00:20:28,"Oh, I see."
00:20:28,00:20:29,We're talking.
00:20:29,00:20:30,"Oh, I thought we were in the USA."
00:20:30,00:20:31,"That's what I, that's what I initially thought."
00:20:31,00:20:37,I thought we were in Brazil and ancient Greece from his name.
00:20:37,00:20:41,"Um, just on Lassus and Lassouing things."
00:20:41,00:20:44,"Um, I did find someone who Lassoued cats."
00:20:44,00:20:45,Hell.
00:20:45,00:20:47,This was a cat Lassou artist from the second war.
00:20:47,00:20:49,She was called Miss Iris Davis.
00:20:49,00:20:50,It's a really nice story actually.
00:20:50,00:20:55,"So lots of buildings being bombed in the second war, lots of rubble, lots of, you know, ruins"
00:20:55,00:20:56,and things.
00:20:56,00:20:58,"Also lots of cats, lots of people keeping cats."
00:20:58,00:21:03,"And she was a volunteer worker for what something called the dumb friends league, which is friends"
00:21:03,00:21:04,of cats.
00:21:04,00:21:05,"Yeah, exactly."
00:21:05,00:21:09,"Dumb as in, I think they don't speak rather than stupid cats."
00:21:09,00:21:12,"But she went from, she went from bombed house to bombed house with a cat Lassou."
00:21:12,00:21:16,"It was very long pole with the Lassou at the end, rescuing cats from the wreckage."
00:21:16,00:21:17,Can I ask Andy?
00:21:17,00:21:21,"You know, um, lots of planes flying very low there."
00:21:21,00:21:22,Yeah.
00:21:22,00:21:28,Do you think a curious person would get out of the house and look what's going on there?
00:21:28,00:21:29,Idiots.
00:21:29,00:21:30,"No, no, no, no."
00:21:30,00:21:31,Sorry.
00:21:31,00:21:33,"She claimed in 1940, November 1940."
00:21:33,00:21:35,So I guess the Blitz had been going on for a while.
00:21:35,00:21:39,"She claimed she had rescued 600 cats from bomber buildings, which is a lot."
00:21:39,00:21:40,No cats.
00:21:40,00:21:42,It was probably the same one.
00:21:42,00:21:48,"Yeah, someone who's an unexpected cowboy, Osama bin Laden turns out he used to walk around"
00:21:48,00:21:53,with a Stetson on his favorite shows were bonanza and things like fury.
00:21:53,00:21:58,He had his own horse and he absolutely loved the world of cowboys.
00:21:58,00:22:01,"Um, yeah, there was lots of stories because the biography came out where they said you"
00:22:01,00:22:05,would see Osama bin Laden walking around with his Stetson on acting all cowboy.
00:22:05,00:22:06,It's amazing.
00:22:06,00:22:10,"It took that long to find and catch him, given that he was."
00:22:10,00:22:15,There can't be that many people in the Torah barricades with a massive Stetson.
00:22:15,00:22:16,Wow.
00:22:16,00:22:18,I didn't know what to make of that.
00:22:18,00:22:19,"I know it's odd, isn't it?"
00:22:19,00:22:23,"But there's a lot of, um, so like Stalin, for example, if we're talking like bad people,"
00:22:23,00:22:25,generally massive cowboy fan as well.
00:22:25,00:22:30,"He used to love watching Westerns, love John Wayne movies, but also hated John Wayne because"
00:22:30,00:22:32,of his anti-communism stance.
00:22:32,00:22:34,And so actually plotted to have him murdered.
00:22:34,00:22:39,He ordered KGB assassins to go and try and kill John Wayne.
00:22:39,00:22:41,"Um, and, and Chairman Mao did that as well."
00:22:41,00:22:43,Chairman Mao hated John Wayne.
00:22:43,00:22:47,"The stories of assassination plot from, yeah, from Chairman Mao as well."
00:22:47,00:22:50,"Oh, these all put out by John Wayne's PR language."
00:22:50,00:22:52,"It feels like it, right?"
00:22:52,00:22:53,Communist dictators hate him.
00:22:53,00:22:55,Find this one weird trick.
00:22:55,00:22:57,"There's a really good, there's a Hollywood writer called Michael Mundt."
00:22:57,00:22:58,I've read a couple of his books.
00:22:58,00:23:00,It's one that he did on John Wayne.
00:23:00,00:23:03,He found that the FBI had discovered that there were assassins that were sent to Hollywood.
00:23:03,00:23:05,To try and kill John Wayne.
00:23:05,00:23:06,Amazing.
00:23:06,00:23:07,Gosh.
00:23:07,00:23:09,Do you know how many people you can fit inside a lasso?
00:23:09,00:23:11,"Oh, surely."
00:23:11,00:23:12,Do you have enough rope?
00:23:12,00:23:14,"Well, the Guinness World Record for everyone who's done it."
00:23:14,00:23:16,So it has to be spinning.
00:23:16,00:23:17,"Oh, yeah."
00:23:17,00:23:18,Was it thrown?
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Yeah, yeah."
00:23:19,00:23:20,"So it's like, it's spinning."
00:23:20,00:23:22,"He's like, I would say actually it's smaller than you think."
00:23:22,00:23:25,"I'm going to say 20 people gathered in a tight, as in that'll be very hard."
00:23:25,00:23:28,I think to let's do 20 people standing to get even standing together.
00:23:28,00:23:31,I'm going to say just going with my imagination here.
00:23:31,00:23:32,A million?
00:23:32,00:23:37,I'm going to say 200 and I'm going to say that the person was standing on top of a
00:23:37,00:23:42,"first floor building, like the top of a school, massive lasso and just managed to get the"
00:23:42,00:23:43,throw.
00:23:43,00:23:44,"A school, specifically a school."
00:23:44,00:23:47,There are no other buildings have more than one story as we know.
00:23:47,00:23:56,What I'm thinking maybe is maybe around 240 to 300 and they're all on the same plane and
00:23:56,00:23:57,it gets lassoed.
00:23:57,00:23:58,Very nice.
00:23:58,00:23:59,- Yeah. - Very nice.
00:23:59,00:24:00,"- Well, you actually write the first time."
00:24:00,00:24:03,"It's 13 or 14, including the guy handling it."
00:24:03,00:24:07,"- Oh, he was so close. - So he counts."
00:24:07,00:24:08,- It sort of does he count.
00:24:08,00:24:10,The record is 13. - The guy throwing the rope.
00:24:10,00:24:11,He jumped in. - He jumped in.
00:24:11,00:24:12,- I think he's taking this.
00:24:12,00:24:13,"- Oh, wait, if he's in the list of, yeah,"
00:24:13,00:24:15,then that absolutely counts.
00:24:15,00:24:17,- He's in the center and he's a lassoing around
00:24:17,00:24:19,and other people are gathering round him as he lassoes.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"- Yeah, I love that."
00:24:20,00:24:22,- Does that count as lassoing?
00:24:22,00:24:23,"Because you don't usually stand, say, like,"
00:24:23,00:24:27,next to the wild horse and lasso yourself into it as well.
00:24:27,00:24:29,"- They do tricks, don't they, lasso artists?"
00:24:29,00:24:31,And I think this is kind of part of that.
00:24:31,00:24:33,"As in, they like a skipping rope,"
00:24:33,00:24:35,you're kind of lasso around and then you'll do jump in.
00:24:35,00:24:37,- You're gonna get lettuce from the cowboys
00:24:37,00:24:39,and the skipping people.
00:24:39,00:24:40,How dare you associate us with those hacks?
00:24:40,00:24:42,"- I'll tell you what, if someone flies"
00:24:42,00:24:44,"very close to the top of my house,"
00:24:44,00:24:47,then I'll look outside for the lettuce.
00:24:47,00:24:50,"- Marlboro Man, one of the most famous cowboys"
00:24:50,00:24:53,for the internet. - Cigarette smoking Marlboro Man.
00:24:53,00:24:55,"- Yeah, Bob Norris was the original Marlboro Man"
00:24:55,00:24:57,who never smoked cigarettes in his life.
00:24:57,00:25:00,"He actively was anti it, but he was found"
00:25:00,00:25:02,"because he was in a photo with John Wayne,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,who used to smoke seven packs a day.
00:25:04,00:25:05,"And they saw him in that shot and went,"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"""Hey, that guy looks like he'd be good for our smoking."""
00:25:08,00:25:11,"- Weirdly, he'd actually been hired by Stalin to kill Wayne."
00:25:11,00:25:12,(laughing)
00:25:12,00:25:13,"And then the film people got to him in time,"
00:25:13,00:25:14,the cigarette people.
00:25:14,00:25:18,- I was looking at other big animals that you can lasso.
00:25:18,00:25:19,"So, do you know how many lessoes it takes"
00:25:19,00:25:21,to get a crocodile safely?
00:25:21,00:25:22,- I would've said one.
00:25:22,00:25:24,I would've said one. - Just round the mouth.
00:25:24,00:25:25,- I'm gonna say three.
00:25:25,00:25:27,"- Three, yeah, points to the driver."
00:25:27,00:25:29,"So apparently, the way they do it"
00:25:29,00:25:31,"is they lasso the top bit of the mouth,"
00:25:31,00:25:33,and they do it again with a second lasso.
00:25:33,00:25:35,I guess that's the most scary part.
00:25:35,00:25:36,"And then they do one round the whole mouth,"
00:25:36,00:25:39,"and then they tape the mouth to be so, so, so sure."
00:25:39,00:25:42,"And then the advice was, if it all goes pear-shaped, run."
00:25:42,00:25:44,"- I was gonna say, that's a lot of detail"
00:25:44,00:25:46,to get right three times round.
00:25:46,00:25:49,We get the clippers sometimes to go to our gigs
00:25:49,00:25:50,"at Up The Creek, and whenever the boat comes in,"
00:25:50,00:25:52,they always have to lasso the boat.
00:25:52,00:25:54,"And I always have a bet with whoever I'm standing with,"
00:25:54,00:25:55,are they gonna get on the first go?
00:25:55,00:25:56,"Sometimes it's the third go,"
00:25:56,00:25:58,"but the thing is the doc's not gonna eat you,"
00:25:58,00:26:03,"whereas a crocodile, yeah, that's a fine time."
00:26:03,00:26:05,"- That's one of the first QI facts I ever learned,"
00:26:05,00:26:07,"was that a crocodile can, what is it?"
00:26:07,00:26:09,It can bite you with the force of a truck
00:26:09,00:26:11,"falling off a cliff, but once his mouth is closed,"
00:26:11,00:26:13,"it presents no threat at all,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,because you can hold its mouth shut with your hand.
00:26:15,00:26:18,"- That's a rubber band, even just a rubber band."
00:26:18,00:26:19,- I think the scariest job is the person
00:26:19,00:26:22,who takes the tape off at the end of the procedure.
00:26:22,00:26:24,I think that's the real hero.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"- But at that point it's quite annoyed, probably."
00:26:26,00:26:27,"- Exactly, yeah."
00:26:27,00:26:29,- Have you ever held a crocodile?
00:26:29,00:26:30,- No. - No.
00:26:30,00:26:31,"- No, me either."
00:26:31,00:26:33,(laughing)
00:26:33,00:26:34,"- But my wife has, my wife has, so."
00:26:34,00:26:36,- I thought we were on the brink of an amazing Jane story.
00:26:36,00:26:37,"I've never, I've really had she."
00:26:37,00:26:40,"- Yeah, yeah, we went to the Everglades,"
00:26:40,00:26:43,"and there was a baby crocodile that you could hold,"
00:26:43,00:26:45,called Snappy. - Of course.
00:26:45,00:26:48,"- And Polina held it, and I didn't have the guts to hold it."
00:26:48,00:26:50,- How big was Snappy?
00:26:50,00:26:51,- How big were you talking?
00:26:51,00:26:53,- I would say about a foot and a half.
00:26:53,00:26:54,- Okay.
00:26:54,00:26:55,- Something like that.
00:26:55,00:26:56,"- Wow, that's amazing."
00:26:56,00:26:58,"- I also did once, played mini golf in a place"
00:26:58,00:27:02,that had crocodiles sort of roaming around the world.
00:27:02,00:27:04,"- Yes, yeah, there's that one golf course"
00:27:04,00:27:07,"where the lake literally has giant snappy crocodiles,"
00:27:07,00:27:08,which is amazing.
00:27:08,00:27:09,"- You just have to stay away from them, basically."
00:27:09,00:27:12,"- Yeah, okay, we're in London now."
00:27:12,00:27:13,- We are.
00:27:13,00:27:14,"- Right? - Yeah, no crocodiles."
00:27:14,00:27:18,"- No, no crocodiles, but some cowboys quite near here,"
00:27:18,00:27:22,there is a secret cowboy town in the middle of Kent.
00:27:22,00:27:23,- Really? - Yeah.
00:27:23,00:27:27,"It's called Laredo, it's founded in 1971,"
00:27:27,00:27:28,"and they've got a blacksmith,"
00:27:28,00:27:31,"they've got an undertaker, a tobacconist."
00:27:31,00:27:34,"- Like a working, these early models."
00:27:34,00:27:36,"- It's life-size, and it's kind of functional."
00:27:36,00:27:39,"So it was founded by a bloke called John Trudeau,"
00:27:39,00:27:41,"who was a pig farmer, and he just loved the Wild West,"
00:27:41,00:27:43,and he just wanted to recreate the Wild West
00:27:43,00:27:44,in his corner of Kent.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"It's members only, and they go there at weekends,"
00:27:47,00:27:50,and they recreate life in the Old West.
00:27:50,00:27:50,- Cool.
00:27:50,00:27:51,"- Yeah, you can get a half an hour train"
00:27:51,00:27:53,from London and arrive in Laredo.
00:27:53,00:27:55,- And they won't let you in.
00:27:55,00:27:56,"- They won't let you in, no, no."
00:27:56,00:27:58,"- There's like a random Wild West in Morningside,"
00:27:58,00:27:59,in Edinburgh.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"Like it's just, you go like through an archway,"
00:28:01,00:28:04,"and it's just a Wild West, like behind a bank of the flats."
00:28:04,00:28:05,"Yeah, it's just there."
00:28:05,00:28:07,"- I read about it, it was created by a furniture shop,"
00:28:07,00:28:10,"for some reason, it's called the Great American Indoors,"
00:28:10,00:28:12,"the shop, and they made their own new Wild West."
00:28:12,00:28:13,"- Yeah, it's not advertised."
00:28:13,00:28:14,"Then we'll say, have you seen the Wild West?"
00:28:14,00:28:16,"And you'll be like, no, we're in Scotland,"
00:28:16,00:28:17,"and they'd say, oh, it's just over there,"
00:28:17,00:28:18,and you go and look.
00:28:18,00:28:19,- That's so weird.
00:28:19,00:28:20,- And that one you can just walk into.
00:28:20,00:28:22,"- It's just like behind some flats, yeah."
00:28:22,00:28:22,- So weird.
00:28:22,00:28:24,- Does the piano player always stop whenever there's someone?
00:28:24,00:28:26,"- No, but there's like always these planes"
00:28:26,00:28:28,"coming down with ropes, so it's very strange."
00:28:28,00:28:30,(upbeat music)
00:28:30,00:28:36,"- Okay, it is time for fact number three,"
00:28:36,00:28:39,and that is James.
00:28:39,00:28:41,"- Okay, my fact this week is that one of the best ways"
00:28:41,00:28:45,"to trick puffins to a new nesting ground is with mirrors,"
00:28:45,00:28:47,because they like to be in groups
00:28:47,00:28:49,and can't tell the difference between a puffin
00:28:49,00:28:51,and the reflection of a puffin.
00:28:51,00:28:54,- So they fail the mirror test.
00:28:54,00:28:55,They don't know that they are.
00:28:55,00:28:59,"- Yeah, the mirror test is a thing with animals."
00:28:59,00:29:02,"Some animals, if you show them a reflection of themselves"
00:29:02,00:29:04,"and put a little mark on their head,"
00:29:04,00:29:05,"they'll realize that it's them,"
00:29:05,00:29:07,"and they'll try and wipe it off,"
00:29:07,00:29:09,whereas most animals won't do that.
00:29:09,00:29:11,"They won't see, they'll see a mirror image of themselves"
00:29:11,00:29:13,and think it's another animal.
00:29:13,00:29:17,"And in fact, humans, my daughter only did it a few weeks ago,"
00:29:17,00:29:19,"and she's what, 14 months."
00:29:19,00:29:21,"So it's until that age is the first time you get to do that,"
00:29:21,00:29:24,so babies don't know it either.
00:29:24,00:29:26,"But this is all about a guy called Stephen Kress,"
00:29:26,00:29:30,and he was working about trying to get puffins
00:29:30,00:29:31,into a new area.
00:29:31,00:29:33,"In fact, they'd been in that area before,"
00:29:33,00:29:35,but he wanted to get them back into that area
00:29:35,00:29:37,on the East Coast of America.
00:29:37,00:29:39,And one of the ways that he did that
00:29:39,00:29:41,was by making these decoys.
00:29:41,00:29:44,"You can make actual decoys of little puffins,"
00:29:44,00:29:46,"but one good way of doing it is mirrors,"
00:29:46,00:29:48,'cause you can get multiple puffins.
00:29:48,00:29:50,"- Oh yeah, hall of mirrors, like kaleidoscope stuff."
00:29:50,00:29:51,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:29:51,00:29:53,"Unfortunately, they saw someone that were really tall,"
00:29:53,00:29:54,someone that were really tall.
00:29:54,00:29:55,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:29:55,00:29:57,"This mission he was on, 'cause Stephen Kress,"
00:29:57,00:29:58,it sounds like a great guy.
00:29:58,00:30:00,"He's been working on this for about 30 years, 40 years?"
00:30:00,00:30:02,- It's 1969.
00:30:02,00:30:04,- It's a long career in puffinology.
00:30:04,00:30:06,"And he, so he and his colleagues,"
00:30:06,00:30:07,"they went to a breeding colony,"
00:30:07,00:30:12,"which was healthy in Newfoundland, just Canada."
00:30:12,00:30:13,"And they basically, they had to kidnap"
00:30:13,00:30:15,loads of baby puffins.
00:30:15,00:30:17,"- Yeah, the start of the story is a bit dodgy, isn't it?"
00:30:17,00:30:20,"- It's a real villain-to-hero arc,"
00:30:20,00:30:21,"I think he and his colleagues went on,"
00:30:21,00:30:23,"'cause they start off as puffin kidnappers, you know?"
00:30:23,00:30:24,"- At the start, people are just like,"
00:30:24,00:30:27,"""What are you doing, stealing all those puffins?"""
00:30:27,00:30:29,"- They shoved them in soup cans,"
00:30:29,00:30:31,"which I like, to transport them all the way"
00:30:31,00:30:33,to their new home.
00:30:33,00:30:35,"But then, then, then, then there's the twist,"
00:30:35,00:30:36,"the character twist, where he and his colleagues"
00:30:36,00:30:39,"became puffin nannies, looking after them,"
00:30:39,00:30:41,breeding them up on this new island in Maine.
00:30:41,00:30:43,"And they put them in these fake burrows,"
00:30:43,00:30:45,"which they had dug, and they fed them,"
00:30:45,00:30:47,"they left fish in there,"
00:30:47,00:30:49,and he constructed all these decoy puffins.
00:30:49,00:30:51,"And then, the thing is that the puffins go to sea,"
00:30:51,00:30:53,"eventually, when they become kind of teenagers,"
00:30:53,00:30:54,"they gain their independence, they go off,"
00:30:54,00:30:56,"and then, he waited for years,"
00:30:56,00:30:58,hoping they would come back to the island.
00:30:58,00:31:01,"- 'Cause the question is, would they go back to Newfoundland,"
00:31:01,00:31:04,"where their kind of genes say that they should be living,"
00:31:04,00:31:06,"or will they remember where they lived as babies,"
00:31:06,00:31:08,"and then come back to that place, and in the end?"
00:31:08,00:31:10,"- In the end, they came back."
00:31:10,00:31:11,"But I think, only in the third year,"
00:31:11,00:31:13,"it was a few years before they did,"
00:31:13,00:31:14,"and he was getting really worried,"
00:31:14,00:31:16,"and then, eventually, he built loads of decoys,"
00:31:16,00:31:17,and that kind of leered them back.
00:31:17,00:31:19,"- Right, okay, that's very good."
00:31:19,00:31:21,"- I was reading about puffins' ministry of silly walks,"
00:31:21,00:31:23,"so when they want to show that they're not any,"
00:31:23,00:31:24,"'cause they live quite close together,"
00:31:24,00:31:27,"they live in burrows, and so, if you want to cross across,"
00:31:27,00:31:28,"you'll probably cross lots of other territories,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,"and if you don't want to start a fight,"
00:31:30,00:31:32,"they do this like, ""Hey, don't mind me walk,"""
00:31:32,00:31:34,"where they lower their head,"
00:31:34,00:31:35,"and they sort of walk quite quickly,"
00:31:35,00:31:37,in trying not to get noticed.
00:31:37,00:31:38,"But if they're on guard duty,"
00:31:38,00:31:39,"they'll stand outside their burrows nice and tall,"
00:31:39,00:31:40,"and they'll sort of stamp their feet,"
00:31:40,00:31:42,like an exaggerated guard doing a march.
00:31:42,00:31:44,"- Wow. - Okay, that's a real idea,"
00:31:44,00:31:47,"of like, ""I'm on patrol, and don't mind me, just over here."""
00:31:47,00:31:48,- That's great. - And that's really funny.
00:31:48,00:31:50,- And they take over rabbit burrows as well.
00:31:50,00:31:51,I love that they don't even need
00:31:51,00:31:54,"to just dig their own burrows, they're just, yeah."
00:31:54,00:31:57,- They can make their own burrows if they want to.
00:31:57,00:32:00,"And actually, sometimes rabbits take their burrows."
00:32:00,00:32:02,There's a whole little ecosystem going on there.
00:32:02,00:32:04,- That's pretty cool. - I went to the Isle of May
00:32:04,00:32:06,"a few years ago, which is off the east coast of Scotland,"
00:32:06,00:32:09,"and you've got tons and tons of seabirds, loads of puffins,"
00:32:09,00:32:10,"and there's certain bits where like,"
00:32:10,00:32:11,"you cannot stray off the path,"
00:32:11,00:32:14,"because the island is just covered in puffin burrows,"
00:32:14,00:32:16,"so you've got to walk on the bits that they know are safe,"
00:32:16,00:32:17,which is really cool.
00:32:17,00:32:19,- Back to Steven Kress very quickly.
00:32:19,00:32:23,He had a big problem with gulls.
00:32:23,00:32:26,"Seagulls would attack the puffins,"
00:32:26,00:32:29,because seagulls had been living in this area
00:32:29,00:32:31,long before the puffins came back.
00:32:31,00:32:33,So he tried a few different things.
00:32:33,00:32:37,"He attracted turns, which are like bigger than puffins,"
00:32:37,00:32:39,"but smaller than gulls, and they'll kind of attack the gulls"
00:32:39,00:32:41,to stop them from coming in there.
00:32:41,00:32:44,"And he also had a thing called a death sandwich,"
00:32:44,00:32:50,"which is where his arc of being the evil puffin thief,"
00:32:50,00:32:53,"and then the nice puffin nurse, then at the end,"
00:32:53,00:32:55,"he becomes the gull killer,"
00:32:55,00:32:57,"because he puts these death sandwiches,"
00:32:57,00:33:00,"which is some bread with something called starlicide in,"
00:33:00,00:33:02,"and starlicide is a chemical,"
00:33:02,00:33:05,"which is really toxic to starlings and seagulls,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,but not toxic to any other animals.
00:33:07,00:33:10,"He would put those out, which would kill the seagulls."
00:33:10,00:33:12,- Where's his arc sitting now?
00:33:12,00:33:13,- I think it's good.
00:33:13,00:33:15,"- If we were doing a fact about gulls, it's not good."
00:33:15,00:33:16,"- Exactly, but we're not."
00:33:16,00:33:18,We're doing a fact about puffins.
00:33:18,00:33:21,"- Sorry, my fact this week is that the evil gull killer,"
00:33:21,00:33:24,"Steven Kress, and there are still,"
00:33:24,00:33:25,"I think there are still puffiniers,"
00:33:25,00:33:26,"as they call themselves, who have to go to the island"
00:33:26,00:33:29,"to keep it healthy for the puffins,"
00:33:29,00:33:33,and prevent the gulls from taking root there.
00:33:33,00:33:37,"And they have to smash up their nests,"
00:33:37,00:33:38,"and they also, I love this,"
00:33:38,00:33:39,"they have a robot mannequin,"
00:33:39,00:33:41,which is dressed in a yellow coat
00:33:41,00:33:43,"and an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask, right?"
00:33:43,00:33:44,And they inflate that.
00:33:44,00:33:45,"I know, it sounds terrifying,"
00:33:45,00:33:48,and they inflate that to try and scare off the gulls.
00:33:48,00:33:49,"It's a scarecrow, basically."
00:33:49,00:33:50,"But the only problem is,"
00:33:50,00:33:54,"the gulls will eventually realize this is a motionless,"
00:33:54,00:33:56,"it's not an effective, scary thing,"
00:33:56,00:33:57,"'cause it just sits there, it doesn't do anything."
00:33:57,00:33:59,"So sometimes what the puffiniers will have to do is,"
00:33:59,00:34:01,"they will have to dress up,"
00:34:01,00:34:03,"they have to put on the yellow coat and the mask,"
00:34:03,00:34:05,and then go around shooting gulls on the island
00:34:05,00:34:08,"to prove that it's a dangerous thing,"
00:34:08,00:34:10,so the gulls realize what they're doing.
00:34:10,00:34:11,"- I just can't help thinking,"
00:34:11,00:34:12,what if Arnold Schwarzenegger books
00:34:12,00:34:16,"a nice relaxing break, and the gulls don't know if it happens?"
00:34:16,00:34:19,"- The island's off the coast of Maine, lovely."
00:34:19,00:34:19,- Jesus.
00:34:19,00:34:20,- I know.
00:34:20,00:34:21,- That's bad.
00:34:21,00:34:23,"- But that's what it takes to, you know,"
00:34:23,00:34:25,"get puffins up and running again, I'm all for it."
00:34:25,00:34:27,"- I think there's a lot of gray areas,"
00:34:27,00:34:28,"I'm looking after puffins,"
00:34:28,00:34:30,'cause I was reading about there's some numbers
00:34:30,00:34:31,"that are declining very sadly,"
00:34:31,00:34:33,and there's some concerns that perhaps
00:34:33,00:34:34,"it's the food they're eating,"
00:34:34,00:34:35,"they're not getting the right fish,"
00:34:35,00:34:36,"the fish are getting smaller,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,"and there's one study where to do this,"
00:34:39,00:34:41,"they would put up a massive net to catch a puffin,"
00:34:41,00:34:44,then take all its fish off them to examine the fish.
00:34:44,00:34:47,Doesn't say whether they gave the fish back.
00:34:47,00:34:48,"- Oh, right, yeah, yeah."
00:34:48,00:34:49,"Their fishing is amazing,"
00:34:49,00:34:53,because often they will have sort of depleted the area
00:34:53,00:34:54,"that's closest to an island,"
00:34:54,00:34:55,"where they're fishing,"
00:34:55,00:34:57,and so they have to go on these huge journeys
00:34:57,00:34:59,"in order to get the fish,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,to bring back for their starving kids
00:35:01,00:35:02,who eat like four or five times a day.
00:35:02,00:35:04,"And I watched this footage, it's amazing,"
00:35:04,00:35:06,"it was a David Attenborough, Planet Earth,"
00:35:06,00:35:08,"they fly 50 kilometers out to sea,"
00:35:08,00:35:10,"50 kilometers, there's a whole group of them"
00:35:10,00:35:12,"that just go in one go,"
00:35:12,00:35:13,"they dive down into the ocean,"
00:35:13,00:35:15,"and they have an amazing swimming ability,"
00:35:15,00:35:18,"they can swim for up to a minute holding their breath,"
00:35:18,00:35:19,"and they use their wings,"
00:35:19,00:35:22,"like we would use our arms if we were doing front crawl,"
00:35:22,00:35:23,"as they make their way,"
00:35:23,00:35:25,"they can go 40 meters deep,"
00:35:25,00:35:26,"they come back up when they caught a fish,"
00:35:26,00:35:30,"it's just one fish in most cases in this footage,"
00:35:30,00:35:33,"they fly them back 50 kilometers again,"
00:35:33,00:35:35,"and then when they get there,"
00:35:35,00:35:36,very similar to the gulls.
00:35:36,00:35:37,"- Oh, the kids don't want to eat it."
00:35:37,00:35:38,"- No, they refuse to eat it."
00:35:38,00:35:40,"- No, I'll have fish yesterday."
00:35:40,00:35:42,(laughing)
00:35:42,00:35:44,"- There are birds, which are called optic skewers,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"who are waiting for them as they come back,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,"knackered, and they swoop down,"
00:35:49,00:35:50,and they steal the fish off them.
00:35:50,00:35:52,"It's an amazing shot in this Planet Earth documentary,"
00:35:52,00:35:54,"because suddenly, one of them gets back,"
00:35:54,00:35:56,because a guy wearing an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask
00:35:56,00:35:58,"is suddenly shooting, say?"
00:35:58,00:35:59,"No, that doesn't happen,"
00:35:59,00:36:01,"but you're 100 kilometer round trip,"
00:36:01,00:36:03,and then the skewers come for one fish.
00:36:03,00:36:05,"- Other skewers, they're sort of famously pirate birds,"
00:36:05,00:36:06,aren't they?
00:36:06,00:36:07,- Exactly.
00:36:07,00:36:08,"- Don't they, I think I might be making this up,"
00:36:08,00:36:10,do they squeeze other birds to make them vomit up
00:36:10,00:36:12,"whatever they've just eaten,"
00:36:12,00:36:13,and then eat them?
00:36:13,00:36:13,- They're definitely villains.
00:36:13,00:36:15,"- So that might be skewers, yeah."
00:36:15,00:36:16,"- There is a bird that does that, yeah."
00:36:16,00:36:18,"- The thing with skewers, well,"
00:36:18,00:36:22,"you pronounce them skewers, skewers, skewers, skewers."
00:36:22,00:36:25,"The puffins can carry more than one fish,"
00:36:25,00:36:28,"because they have skewers on their tongue, don't they?"
00:36:28,00:36:31,"They have spiky bits on their tongue,"
00:36:31,00:36:33,"that they can attach one fish onto each spike,"
00:36:33,00:36:35,and then go down for another one.
00:36:35,00:36:36,"- But if they get attacked,"
00:36:36,00:36:38,"that's a skewer's crisis, you know?"
00:36:38,00:36:39,- Brilliant.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"- Oh, lovely, thank you."
00:36:40,00:36:41,(laughing)
00:36:41,00:36:42,- But part of the reason they're so good at swimming
00:36:42,00:36:44,"is their bones are dense, and other birds,"
00:36:44,00:36:45,"they find it easy to swim,"
00:36:45,00:36:47,but they can find it harder to fly.
00:36:47,00:36:48,"So did you read about these puffin patrols,"
00:36:48,00:36:49,they have in Iceland.
00:36:49,00:36:50,"These are definitely good guys,"
00:36:50,00:36:51,not a gray area for these ones.
00:36:51,00:36:54,"So basically when the little pufflings, the baby ones,"
00:36:54,00:36:56,"they use the moon to navigate,"
00:36:56,00:36:57,"but the streetlights come through them off,"
00:36:57,00:36:59,so they sort of crash land in the town.
00:36:59,00:37:01,And so the whole town is basically united
00:37:01,00:37:02,to like save these pufflings.
00:37:02,00:37:04,"They go out on patrol, they try and find them,"
00:37:04,00:37:06,"and if you find a puffling, like you have to look after it,"
00:37:06,00:37:07,"so they'll like take them to the cliff,"
00:37:07,00:37:09,and then they either will hot it down
00:37:09,00:37:11,"so it can like trot along and catch the breeze,"
00:37:11,00:37:14,or you just lob it into the air and hope it takes flight.
00:37:14,00:37:15,- What? - And lob it into the air
00:37:15,00:37:16,"in the hope? - Yeah, to get,"
00:37:16,00:37:18,'cause they need to get the momentum to get up
00:37:18,00:37:19,"if it throws. - Oh, but you're catching it"
00:37:19,00:37:20,"if it doesn't, right?"
00:37:20,00:37:21,It's going off a cliff.
00:37:21,00:37:22,- What if it sprained its wing?
00:37:22,00:37:24,- Hopefully you checked that on the way in.
00:37:24,00:37:26,"- I don't know, I don't think these guys sound"
00:37:26,00:37:29,like an uncomplicatedly benevolent thought.
00:37:29,00:37:31,Why don't they turn their streetlights off?
00:37:31,00:37:32,That's what a real good guy would do.
00:37:32,00:37:35,- I feel like the terminal velocity of a puffin
00:37:35,00:37:38,wouldn't be fast enough that they would die.
00:37:38,00:37:40,"I think they might be all right,"
00:37:40,00:37:41,"'cause they're quite small, aren't they?"
00:37:41,00:37:42,- They're really tiny.
00:37:42,00:37:43,"- If it's the babies as well,"
00:37:43,00:37:46,then they'll have a really low terminal velocity.
00:37:46,00:37:47,- Maybe. - You can survive.
00:37:47,00:37:49,"Like, didn't Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff"
00:37:49,00:37:50,when he was looking for puffins?
00:37:50,00:37:52,- The thing about Gordon Ramsay
00:37:52,00:37:55,"is his terminal velocity is famously low, isn't it?"
00:37:55,00:37:56,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:37:56,00:37:58,"- 85 feet, I think it was, he fell off a cliff."
00:37:58,00:37:59,"- I imagine when he falls,"
00:37:59,00:38:02,he's got like lots of flapping skin on his body
00:38:02,00:38:04,"and that kind of, yeah. - Oh, great."
00:38:04,00:38:06,He turns into one of those gliding parachuters.
00:38:06,00:38:08,- Flight fox. - Yeah.
00:38:08,00:38:10,"- Sorry, why'd Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff"
00:38:10,00:38:11,when he was looking for puffins?
00:38:11,00:38:12,- Do you know what?
00:38:12,00:38:13,This is a story just in the back of my head.
00:38:13,00:38:14,I'm gonna connect it to puffins.
00:38:14,00:38:16,He was doing a documentary
00:38:16,00:38:18,and he was looking at the various island.
00:38:18,00:38:19,He was on the side of a cliff
00:38:19,00:38:21,and they were filming him and he just disappeared.
00:38:21,00:38:23,"Yeah, and he fell down and he survived."
00:38:23,00:38:25,Yeah. - I don't believe that.
00:38:25,00:38:26,- It's true. - Is it?
00:38:26,00:38:27,- Yeah.
00:38:27,00:38:29,- I think Gordon Ramsay is an honorable guy.
00:38:29,00:38:31,I don't see why he would lie.
00:38:31,00:38:32,"- Presumably, it's on film."
00:38:32,00:38:33,- I think they never released the film.
00:38:33,00:38:35,"- Oh, they accidentally turned off the film"
00:38:35,00:38:37,before he fell 80 feet and survived.
00:38:37,00:38:40,"- 85, 85. - 85."
00:38:40,00:38:42,"- What's that, 25 meters."
00:38:42,00:38:44,"Survival, it must have been a big patch of Heather"
00:38:44,00:38:46,"he landed on, or whatever it was."
00:38:46,00:38:50,- It's a big pile of other TV chefs
00:38:50,00:38:51,previously fallen down there.
00:38:51,00:38:54,"- Bounced off of Laurel Thompson, fortunately for him."
00:38:54,00:38:57,There's a thing which a lot of people say about puffins
00:38:57,00:38:59,which is that they're monogamous.
00:38:59,00:39:01,"You know, they have the same partner every year"
00:39:01,00:39:02,and that's very nice.
00:39:02,00:39:05,"Well, it turns out, I think it is actually true"
00:39:05,00:39:07,"'cause a load of birds, it's not true."
00:39:07,00:39:12,"And they study EPCs, extra pair copulations."
00:39:12,00:39:13,"That's the, do you remember?"
00:39:13,00:39:15,I think we've mentioned this once or twice before.
00:39:15,00:39:16,But they did a study of Atlantic puffins
00:39:16,00:39:18,looking at extra pair heritage
00:39:18,00:39:19,'cause now we've got DNA tests
00:39:19,00:39:22,we can actually sample species.
00:39:22,00:39:24,And they are basically monogamous.
00:39:24,00:39:25,They are-- - Good for them.
00:39:25,00:39:28,"- I know, so you know, no gray areas there."
00:39:28,00:39:30,It's a nice circle. - No Jerry Springer
00:39:30,00:39:32,in the-- - No Jerry Springer.
00:39:32,00:39:33,Every DNA test comes back.
00:39:33,00:39:36,"Yep, it's all fine, you are a father, great news."
00:39:36,00:39:39,- My current favorite puffin fact is that
00:39:39,00:39:42,there is scientists creating sunglasses for puffins.
00:39:42,00:39:44,"- Okay, why? - Because,"
00:39:44,00:39:46,"I don't know how this happened, but they had a puffin"
00:39:46,00:39:49,and they realized that it's beak lit up under UV light.
00:39:49,00:39:50,"- Okay. - Oh, you just got there."
00:39:50,00:39:52,- But the puffin was no longer alive.
00:39:52,00:39:53,So they're not completely sure
00:39:53,00:39:55,if it's some sort of the way it decomposes
00:39:55,00:39:57,or whether all puffins do this.
00:39:57,00:39:59,"So to test it, they need to get some alive puffins"
00:39:59,00:40:00,and try and UV on them.
00:40:00,00:40:01,But that could hurt their eyes.
00:40:01,00:40:04,They got to design little sunglasses to amuse themselves.
00:40:04,00:40:05,They've made them aviators.
00:40:05,00:40:07,"- Okay, cool. - That's brilliant."
00:40:07,00:40:09,- What did they find? - I believe still pending.
00:40:09,00:40:11,"- Still pending. - You'll find a puffin,"
00:40:11,00:40:13,"give it the sunglasses, shine the light,"
00:40:13,00:40:13,and then report back.
00:40:13,00:40:15,"Because their beaks do change a lot, right?"
00:40:15,00:40:16,"There's an outer beak that falls off,"
00:40:16,00:40:18,the color changes at different seasons.
00:40:18,00:40:20,"- No, the beak falls off in winter."
00:40:20,00:40:22,- And it leaves them with what I found described
00:40:22,00:40:24,in one article as a drab gray pecker.
00:40:24,00:40:26,(laughing)
00:40:26,00:40:27,- My old tinder profile.
00:40:27,00:40:29,- That's amazing.
00:40:29,00:40:31,"- I know, young puffins are just completely gray."
00:40:31,00:40:33,They sound so boring.
00:40:33,00:40:33,Just gray all the way through.
00:40:33,00:40:35,"Gray beak, gray everything."
00:40:35,00:40:37,- I always thought that was your favorite fact of all time.
00:40:37,00:40:39,"- It was one of my very, very first facts I ever felt"
00:40:39,00:40:39,for a QI. - Which one?
00:40:39,00:40:42,- That a baby puffin is called a puffling.
00:40:42,00:40:46,"But now, puffins, you notice they're on everything."
00:40:46,00:40:47,Puffins are everywhere now.
00:40:47,00:40:50,So many kids' books about pufflings.
00:40:50,00:40:51,And someone I know who works in publishing
00:40:51,00:40:54,used to keep a list of which animals were on trend.
00:40:54,00:40:56,So you will have noticed it in me without realizing.
00:40:56,00:40:59,"So for a while, it was sloths, they were on everything."
00:40:59,00:41:02,It was flamingos for a while.
00:41:02,00:41:04,Llamas used to have a phase where they were on everything.
00:41:04,00:41:05,And I think puffins.
00:41:05,00:41:06,"- Is it like children's books, do you mean?"
00:41:06,00:41:09,- Just like in paper chase or on clothing.
00:41:09,00:41:10,You could just notice it.
00:41:10,00:41:11,- Mirror cats were massive.
00:41:11,00:41:13,"- Yeah, certain animals seem to like have their moment."
00:41:13,00:41:16,"And I'm not quite sure why or how, but they do."
00:41:16,00:41:18,"- But it's never the disgusting toad worm, is it?"
00:41:18,00:41:19,It's never like the--
00:41:19,00:41:21,"- He can be spring 2024, aren't they?"
00:41:21,00:41:22,"- Never the penis worm, is it?"
00:41:22,00:41:23,- Yes. (laughs)
00:41:23,00:41:25,- And do you feel slightly responsible for that?
00:41:25,00:41:28,Because I think you're partly responsible
00:41:28,00:41:30,for disseminating the adorable puffling fact.
00:41:30,00:41:32,- Because that fact has come out
00:41:32,00:41:34,of various different QI iterations over the years.
00:41:34,00:41:35,- I did put it in a lot of things.
00:41:35,00:41:36,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:41:36,00:41:37,"- Yeah, no, after all,"
00:41:37,00:41:38,there's tons of puffling stuff up there.
00:41:38,00:41:40,"And they're super cute, so."
00:41:40,00:41:43,"You used to get enormous flocks of puffins, didn't you?"
00:41:43,00:41:44,In the UK as well.
00:41:44,00:41:47,So the island of St. Kilda.
00:41:47,00:41:51,This was two people called Hertha and Don in 1897.
00:41:51,00:41:53,"And they said that the puffins are in such numbers,"
00:41:53,00:41:56,the clouds of birds sweep past us
00:41:56,00:41:59,and make a sound like a whirlwind.
00:41:59,00:42:02,And another one said that it made a great cloud
00:42:02,00:42:05,that perceptively interfered with the light of day.
00:42:05,00:42:08,And that parasites fell off the birds
00:42:08,00:42:11,"as they swarmed over us, much to our discomfort and annoyance."
00:42:11,00:42:14,So you can imagine there's like millions of these birds
00:42:14,00:42:17,just blocking out the sun and flying over you
00:42:17,00:42:19,and dropping the ticks on you and stuff.
00:42:19,00:42:19,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:42:19,00:42:20,- It's been incredible.
00:42:20,00:42:21,- Very cool.
00:42:21,00:42:26,"In St. Kilda, there was one man who caught 620 puffins"
00:42:26,00:42:27,in a single day.
00:42:27,00:42:28,- Lesser of them?
00:42:28,00:42:30,"- Yeah, using a noose, no rod."
00:42:30,00:42:31,- No way.
00:42:31,00:42:32,Sorry to jump in on you there.
00:42:32,00:42:33,"- No, no."
00:42:33,00:42:34,- I didn't expect it was gonna be that.
00:42:34,00:42:35,Wow.
00:42:35,00:42:35,"- Yeah, pretty much a Lesser."
00:42:35,00:42:36,That's what they used to use.
00:42:36,00:42:39,"Sort of like fishing rods, but with a better rope on the end."
00:42:39,00:42:41,- That's what this cat lady was using in the second one.
00:42:41,00:42:42,- Oh yeah.
00:42:42,00:42:43,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:43,00:42:43,Wow.
00:42:43,00:42:44,- That's very cool.
00:42:44,00:42:45,- That's amazing.
00:42:45,00:42:47,"- There are some places where the puffins are eaten,"
00:42:47,00:42:48,aren't there?
00:42:48,00:42:48,- Iceland.
00:42:48,00:42:50,"- Yeah, Faroe Islands."
00:42:50,00:42:51,- Yeah.
00:42:51,00:42:53,Am I allowed to say I've eaten them in Iceland?
00:42:53,00:42:54,- Have you?
00:42:54,00:42:54,- Have you?
00:42:54,00:42:55,- What did it taste like?
00:42:55,00:42:57,- It was a long time ago.
00:42:57,00:42:58,"- Oh, it was the 80s."
00:42:58,00:42:59,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:42:59,00:43:01,- Not that long ago.
00:43:01,00:43:02,- What did it taste like?
00:43:02,00:43:07,"- To me, I thought it just tasted like fishy, oily,"
00:43:07,00:43:09,"not chicken, but like..."
00:43:09,00:43:10,- More like fish than like me.
00:43:10,00:43:11,- Quail-y kind of stuff.
00:43:11,00:43:15,"Like, game-y, fishy, chicken."
00:43:15,00:43:16,- It's a gray area.
00:43:16,00:43:18,(laughing)
00:43:18,00:43:19,- Why is that gray area?
00:43:19,00:43:21,"- No, I guess everything we're saying about the puffins"
00:43:21,00:43:22,"is sort of like, you know,"
00:43:22,00:43:23,you've got to kill them to save them.
00:43:23,00:43:24,"- How's that being,"
00:43:24,00:43:26,they're much more endangered than they used to be.
00:43:26,00:43:27,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:43:27,00:43:28,- So you have to...
00:43:28,00:43:28,- Certainly back in the day
00:43:28,00:43:30,"when I was eating puffin that one time,"
00:43:30,00:43:31,they were all over them.
00:43:31,00:43:33,You couldn't move in recubes.
00:43:33,00:43:34,"- You were on some kill though, weren't you?"
00:43:34,00:43:35,And the skies were thick with them.
00:43:35,00:43:37,"You were actually doing them all the favor, yeah, yeah."
00:43:37,00:43:39,- I was so hoping that when you were grasping
00:43:39,00:43:40,"for what they tasted like,"
00:43:40,00:43:41,"you're gonna be like, ""No, a bit like panda."""
00:43:41,00:43:43,(laughing)
00:43:43,00:43:45,- Like a cacopo taste to them.
00:43:45,00:43:46,"- Yeah, but that's,"
00:43:46,00:43:48,"I mean, lots of places eat."
00:43:48,00:43:48,"People eat meat,"
00:43:48,00:43:50,and people eat the meats that are close to them.
00:43:50,00:43:51,"- Exactly, yeah, yeah."
00:43:51,00:43:52,"- But if a particular meat is endangered,"
00:43:52,00:43:53,then you'd change.
00:43:53,00:43:55,"- Exactly, there was a whale on the menu,"
00:43:55,00:43:56,which I didn't eat.
00:43:56,00:43:57,- Wow.
00:43:57,00:43:58,- Does that help my archetyle?
00:43:58,00:43:59,"- Exhilarated, yeah."
00:43:59,00:44:02,(upbeat music)
00:44:02,00:44:08,"- Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,"
00:44:08,00:44:10,and that is Andy.
00:44:10,00:44:12,- My fact is that trash talk works better
00:44:12,00:44:15,on dance players than shot putters.
00:44:15,00:44:17,"- Ah, call that a fact."
00:44:17,00:44:18,- There you go.
00:44:18,00:44:19,It begins.
00:44:19,00:44:20,It begins.
00:44:20,00:44:21,I should have known when I picked this fact.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Idiot.
00:44:22,00:44:24,(laughing)
00:44:24,00:44:25,- That's brilliant.
00:44:25,00:44:28,"- Yeah, it's just a study of trash talk basically."
00:44:28,00:44:29,- Why would that be true?
00:44:29,00:44:31,"- Well, this comes from a piece in The Economist,"
00:44:31,00:44:34,"and it's all about sledging and,"
00:44:34,00:44:36,which is cricket-based trash talk.
00:44:36,00:44:38,"And, you know, sporting insults, basically."
00:44:38,00:44:40,You dish out to people you're in a competition against.
00:44:40,00:44:42,And it found that there have been studies conducted
00:44:42,00:44:46,which have found that trash talk is especially effective
00:44:46,00:44:48,at distracting players if you're in a sport
00:44:48,00:44:52,"that needs fine motor skills or creativity,"
00:44:52,00:44:55,rather than brute-strength exhibitions.
00:44:55,00:44:57,So sports where you need to concentrate
00:44:57,00:44:58,"are much more vulnerable,"
00:44:58,00:45:02,which is why maybe cricket is vulnerable to lots of trash talk.
00:45:02,00:45:04,"Chess, you don't see a lot of smack talk in chess."
00:45:04,00:45:05,Yeah.
00:45:05,00:45:08,"But you do, you get loads and, I mean, it's weird"
00:45:08,00:45:10,'cause lots of sports have different tolerances of it.
00:45:10,00:45:13,"You know, so cricket has loads of it."
00:45:13,00:45:14,"Boxing has loads of it, although-"
00:45:14,00:45:15,"- Yeah, boxing is tough."
00:45:15,00:45:17,"- It doesn't, you shouldn't need to do any trash talk"
00:45:17,00:45:19,'cause you're trying to hit someone hard anyway.
00:45:19,00:45:20,"- No, it's psychological."
00:45:20,00:45:21,"The whole thing is a psychological warfare, right?"
00:45:21,00:45:24,"- And it's very skillful sport boxing, I would say."
00:45:24,00:45:25,- Is it?
00:45:25,00:45:26,- Yeah.
00:45:26,00:45:26,"- I just thought you'd baster the other bloke, didn't you?"
00:45:26,00:45:29,"- Well, that's one way of doing it."
00:45:29,00:45:31,"Whatever, if you're a really good boxer,"
00:45:31,00:45:31,it's all about movement.
00:45:31,00:45:33,- Is this why my boxing career didn't...
00:45:33,00:45:35,(laughing)
00:45:35,00:45:36,Saw like a puppet.
00:45:36,00:45:37,(laughing)
00:45:37,00:45:38,- I thought you'd like a giant potato.
00:45:38,00:45:40,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:45:40,00:45:40,"Oh, no."
00:45:40,00:45:43,"- Yeah, no, that's a really good point."
00:45:43,00:45:45,"In chess, I guess there is a lot of psychological stuff"
00:45:45,00:45:47,"goes on, but it's not necessarily-"
00:45:47,00:45:48,- It's not normally-
00:45:48,00:45:49,- Your shit.
00:45:49,00:45:49,- Your shit.
00:45:49,00:45:50,"- Yeah, your shit."
00:45:50,00:45:51,(laughing)
00:45:51,00:45:52,"- In basketball, it's a big thing."
00:45:52,00:45:54,"And I grew up watching basketball,"
00:45:54,00:45:56,so you would always see it happening.
00:45:56,00:45:58,"It's amazing when you see it happening,"
00:45:58,00:46:00,trash talking between the sort of top players in the league.
00:46:00,00:46:01,So-
00:46:01,00:46:02,- Are they better at it?
00:46:02,00:46:04,"- No, they're sort of, it's just interesting watching them,"
00:46:04,00:46:06,"'cause they're all on mic, right?"
00:46:06,00:46:07,"Basically, no, no, you can hear it,"
00:46:07,00:46:09,like you can hear it through the mics of the studio.
00:46:09,00:46:10,"It comes through, you know."
00:46:10,00:46:12,"- So they hear them saying like, oh."
00:46:12,00:46:13,"- Yeah, exactly, you hear things."
00:46:13,00:46:16,"So like, yeah, well, Shaquille O'Neal was up against,"
00:46:16,00:46:18,"so Shaquille O'Neal, one of the all-time greats"
00:46:18,00:46:19,"of basketball against Kobe Bryant,"
00:46:19,00:46:20,who was also one of the other.
00:46:20,00:46:22,"And he was overheard saying,"
00:46:22,00:46:24,"""Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes,"""
00:46:24,00:46:26,"as he was about to dunk on him, right?"
00:46:26,00:46:27,"Like, they say-"
00:46:27,00:46:29,"- What does that mean, dunk on him?"
00:46:29,00:46:30,"- Dunk on him, that's disgusting."
00:46:30,00:46:33,- Dunking is when you bring the ball into the ring
00:46:33,00:46:35,"and you hold the ring, kind of thing."
00:46:35,00:46:36,- Why is he tasting his ass when he does that?
00:46:36,00:46:39,- Because he's going so high that the face of Kobe
00:46:39,00:46:42,"would be, yeah, and then there's this thing in basketball"
00:46:42,00:46:44,where then you make someone taste your ass after you've-
00:46:44,00:46:45,"- Got it, okay."
00:46:45,00:46:46,"- Yeah, that's a good point."
00:46:46,00:46:47,- Every day's a school day.
00:46:47,00:46:50,"- In off the rim, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
00:46:50,00:46:52,(all laughing)
00:46:52,00:46:56,- And one thing they did with this research
00:46:56,00:46:59,you're talking about is they sat people at computers
00:46:59,00:47:03,and you had to move a slider to a particular spot
00:47:03,00:47:05,and see how many you could do in two minutes.
00:47:05,00:47:08,"And as you did it, a little message would come up"
00:47:08,00:47:10,"on your screen, supposedly from one of the other people"
00:47:10,00:47:12,doing the experiment.
00:47:12,00:47:14,"And it would either say, ""I'm smarter and faster than you,"""
00:47:14,00:47:17,"or, ""Let's see what happens."""
00:47:17,00:47:18,"- Hi, friend."
00:47:18,00:47:19,(all laughing)
00:47:19,00:47:21,"- And they found, actually, that people"
00:47:21,00:47:23,who got the negative messages performed better
00:47:23,00:47:24,overall in that one.
00:47:24,00:47:26,- I think this could spur you on.
00:47:26,00:47:28,"You think I'm gonna lose, well, I'll just show you."
00:47:28,00:47:29,"- Yeah, absolutely."
00:47:29,00:47:30,And that's what seemed to have happened in that one.
00:47:30,00:47:32,But then they tried it in a task
00:47:32,00:47:36,which was slightly more skill-creative-based
00:47:36,00:47:38,and they found that people did worse
00:47:38,00:47:41,and they were more likely to cheat.
00:47:41,00:47:41,"- Oh, yeah."
00:47:41,00:47:43,"- 'Cause you turns it dirty, so you're like, ""Well."""
00:47:43,00:47:45,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:47:45,00:47:49,- I think one of them might have been the study
00:47:49,00:47:51,"by Karen McDermott, who was looking into this"
00:47:51,00:47:53,from the University of Connecticut.
00:47:53,00:47:55,And that involved people playing Mario Kart.
00:47:55,00:47:59,"And before the game, some of the people were insulted"
00:47:59,00:48:03,"with various things like, ""Grab a straw because you suck."""
00:48:03,00:48:04,- Brilliant.
00:48:04,00:48:05,- And so on.
00:48:05,00:48:06,"Yeah, I think she had to pick quite carefully"
00:48:06,00:48:09,"because a lot of insults might be the, you know,"
00:48:09,00:48:11,"homophobic, or racist, or sexist, or whatever."
00:48:11,00:48:13,So she had to pick a carefully delineated selection
00:48:13,00:48:17,"of insults, which were cruel enough to sting,"
00:48:17,00:48:19,"""Grab a straw because you suck,"" being one of them."
00:48:19,00:48:22,And the insulted players performed worse.
00:48:22,00:48:23,And they also rated themselves higher
00:48:23,00:48:25,as having experienced anger and shame.
00:48:25,00:48:26,"- Oh, no."
00:48:26,00:48:27,- Yeah.
00:48:27,00:48:29,- But were they playing Rainbow Road?
00:48:29,00:48:31,"- If you're playing Rainbow Road,"
00:48:31,00:48:33,"you always experience deep, deep shame"
00:48:33,00:48:34,and frustration and rage.
00:48:34,00:48:36,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:36,00:48:38,"So, yeah, but does it make you play better or worse?"
00:48:38,00:48:39,There seem to be slightly conflicting studies
00:48:39,00:48:40,on whether or not--
00:48:40,00:48:41,- I read a lot of different ones.
00:48:41,00:48:42,- Yeah.
00:48:42,00:48:43,- And that's similar to what you were saying.
00:48:43,00:48:44,"I also read, which just thought was a lovely point,"
00:48:44,00:48:47,"that in a university study, you've got a university ethics code."
00:48:47,00:48:48,So what you can sledge someone with
00:48:48,00:48:50,is kind of very different to what you can have
00:48:50,00:48:51,like a whole stadium chanting at you
00:48:51,00:48:52,in a basketball game.
00:48:52,00:48:53,(laughing)
00:48:53,00:48:54,- Yeah.
00:48:54,00:48:55,"- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:48:55,00:48:58,I also like the weird social side of trash talking
00:48:58,00:49:00,"as well within professional sports,"
00:49:00,00:49:02,which is let's say a younger player
00:49:02,00:49:04,if trying to trash talk and create a relationship
00:49:04,00:49:06,"of conflict, which would then be on the cameras."
00:49:06,00:49:08,And it's a way of social climbing.
00:49:08,00:49:11,"So like, Michael Jordan, for example,"
00:49:11,00:49:14,would never trash talk whenever he was having it
00:49:14,00:49:16,talk to him by like a rookie from a new team.
00:49:16,00:49:18,"'Cause he thinks, I'll let my game do the talking"
00:49:18,00:49:20,"and I don't want, I will make you famous"
00:49:20,00:49:22,by trash talking with you.
00:49:22,00:49:23,So let's not get that.
00:49:23,00:49:23,- It's not worth it.
00:49:23,00:49:27,"- I think it's worth us saying, off menu as shit."
00:49:27,00:49:30,"- Yeah, um, Chris and Rosie Ramsey."
00:49:30,00:49:30,"- Oh, Wankers."
00:49:30,00:49:31,"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
00:49:31,00:49:32,"- How the hell, fuck you."
00:49:32,00:49:33,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:49:33,00:49:34,"- There's no point saying, you know,"
00:49:34,00:49:37,John's podcast about nothing.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"- John's podcast about nothing is good, James."
00:49:39,00:49:41,"I stand by, I've been listening."
00:49:41,00:49:43,I get all my facts from John's podcast about nothing.
00:49:43,00:49:45,(laughing)
00:49:45,00:49:46,- Shout out to John.
00:49:46,00:49:47,"- Hello, John."
00:49:47,00:49:49,(laughing)
00:49:49,00:49:55,- One of my favorite sledges that I read
00:49:55,00:49:57,"was not so much a sledge, but as an AFL player"
00:49:57,00:49:59,called Stevie Baker and apparently during a game
00:49:59,00:50:01,"he leaned over to someone and said,"
00:50:01,00:50:02,"""Have you got a sausage dog?"""
00:50:02,00:50:04,(laughing)
00:50:04,00:50:06,"And they spent the next 20 minutes just being like,"
00:50:06,00:50:08,"""What, what, what?"""
00:50:08,00:50:08,And they couldn't play.
00:50:08,00:50:10,It was the worst insult they've heard.
00:50:10,00:50:10,- What is it?
00:50:10,00:50:11,I'm sorry.
00:50:11,00:50:12,- It turned out that Baker has a sausage dog.
00:50:12,00:50:13,He was just like.
00:50:13,00:50:14,- I'm just making chat.
00:50:14,00:50:16,(laughing)
00:50:16,00:50:18,"This guy was like, he couldn't focus on the game."
00:50:18,00:50:19,"He's like, ""What's he saying?"
00:50:19,00:50:20,"""Why does he..."""
00:50:20,00:50:22,"- Yeah, I mean, I mean, well, it baffled me."
00:50:22,00:50:23,"Like, I've heard the phrase sausage dog before."
00:50:23,00:50:25,"I know what that is, but because it was at a sporting match"
00:50:25,00:50:26,I was thinking of a hot dog.
00:50:26,00:50:27,- Yeah.
00:50:27,00:50:28,"- And we're like, ""What's a sausage dog?"
00:50:28,00:50:28,"""A hot dog is a sausage."
00:50:28,00:50:29,"""What are you talking about?"""
00:50:29,00:50:31,"- This is where I should swoop in and out fact you,"
00:50:31,00:50:31,but I...
00:50:31,00:50:33,(laughing)
00:50:33,00:50:34,"- It's all about distraction, isn't it, really?"
00:50:34,00:50:36,- I found this with you.
00:50:36,00:50:37,"- This reminds me, this isn't a fact,"
00:50:37,00:50:39,but do you ever watch that episode of Cheers
00:50:39,00:50:41,when there was like a basketball player
00:50:41,00:50:43,and he couldn't miss and he was amazing
00:50:43,00:50:44,and he was winning the whole season?
00:50:44,00:50:48,And then he went to the bar and started talking about trivia
00:50:48,00:50:52,"with two of the barflies, Norm and whoever else it was."
00:50:52,00:50:55,And they asked him how many rivets there were
00:50:55,00:50:57,in the basketball stadium.
00:50:57,00:51:00,"And he just, all he could think about for the rest"
00:51:00,00:51:02,of his career was counting these rivets.
00:51:02,00:51:04,And all he would do was walk around counting
00:51:04,00:51:05,and he just couldn't play anymore
00:51:05,00:51:05,'cause he was so discreet.
00:51:05,00:51:07,- That happened to me in an exam once.
00:51:07,00:51:08,- What?
00:51:08,00:51:10,"- I was in an exam and people would always write on,"
00:51:10,00:51:12,"and he's like, ""Rickety old desk,"
00:51:12,00:51:13,"""you only told them at exam time."""
00:51:13,00:51:15,"And they would say like, ""I heart so and so,"""
00:51:15,00:51:16,"or that, ""Maths is rubbish."""
00:51:16,00:51:17,(laughing)
00:51:17,00:51:18,And I was saying it once.
00:51:18,00:51:20,"- You went to school in an episode of The Beano,"
00:51:20,00:51:21,didn't you?
00:51:21,00:51:22,"- Yeah, yeah."
00:51:22,00:51:23,"- I grew up in Dundee, yeah."
00:51:23,00:51:24,"- Oh, yeah, so you did?"
00:51:24,00:51:26,(laughing)
00:51:26,00:51:30,"- So, but I was sitting in my seat in my exam"
00:51:30,00:51:31,"and on my desk, someone had written,"
00:51:31,00:51:34,"""There were 32 black lines on the ceiling."""
00:51:34,00:51:36,And so I look up and there are black lines
00:51:36,00:51:38,"really close together, never seen them before."
00:51:38,00:51:40,So of course I had to count them and I lost count.
00:51:40,00:51:42,- So I'd start again.
00:51:42,00:51:44,"- Wow, do you think that might have been written"
00:51:44,00:51:47,by a crafty teacher trying to smoke out
00:51:47,00:51:48,easily distracted children?
00:51:48,00:51:50,- I think it was one person in your class
00:51:50,00:51:53,who wrote it on all the other desks apart from their own.
00:51:53,00:51:54,"I mean, they would be top of the class."
00:51:54,00:51:55,"- Yeah, it's good waiting."
00:51:55,00:51:56,"I'd forgotten that until now,"
00:51:56,00:51:58,but I can remember trying to count them.
00:51:58,00:52:00,"- How did your exam, you'll have still passed, I guess."
00:52:00,00:52:03,"- I play very badly, I don't remember."
00:52:03,00:52:04,- That's so funny.
00:52:04,00:52:06,I was looking 'cause you were talking about
00:52:06,00:52:10,"darts and shop putting, some trash talking in those spots."
00:52:10,00:52:13,"And of course, we can't not talk about Gary Anderson"
00:52:13,00:52:15,and Wesley Harms.
00:52:15,00:52:16,"- Of course we can't, thank God."
00:52:16,00:52:21,"- The amazing match when Harms, who lost 10-2,"
00:52:21,00:52:24,did an interview and said there was a frequent smell
00:52:24,00:52:26,that came from his opponent.
00:52:26,00:52:27,"And he said, ""It'll take me two nights"
00:52:27,00:52:30,"to lose the smell from my nose."""
00:52:30,00:52:30,- Wow.
00:52:30,00:52:31,- And he claimed that Gary Anderson
00:52:31,00:52:35,had been farting throughout the match to put him off.
00:52:35,00:52:38,And then obviously they interview the loser first
00:52:38,00:52:39,and then they interview the winner
00:52:39,00:52:41,and they interviewed Gary Anderson
00:52:41,00:52:43,"and said, ""Why were you farting the whole time?"""
00:52:43,00:52:45,"And he said, ""There was definitely a smell,"
00:52:45,00:52:48,"but it was 1,010%, not me."
00:52:48,00:52:50,"It was definitely the other guy."""
00:52:50,00:52:53,"And Anderson said, ""You can put your finger up my arse."
00:52:53,00:52:55,"There'll be no smell there."""
00:52:55,00:52:56,- What?
00:52:56,00:52:57,- What?
00:52:57,00:52:58,- What is it with this sportsman?
00:52:58,00:52:59,- Yeah.
00:52:59,00:53:01,"- Okay, I mean, I believe the first guy,"
00:53:01,00:53:03,"'cause that's a very high percentage, so."
00:53:03,00:53:04,(all laughing)
00:53:04,00:53:07,- Do we have trash talk at QI?
00:53:07,00:53:07,- No.
00:53:07,00:53:08,- What do you mean?
00:53:08,00:53:11,"- I just, so there was a study of Fortune 500 companies"
00:53:11,00:53:13,"and like, can you remember people being slagged off"
00:53:13,00:53:16,in that kind of gamesmanship way in the office?
00:53:16,00:53:18,61% of employees found they could remember trash talk
00:53:18,00:53:19,within the last few months.
00:53:19,00:53:20,- Yeah.
00:53:20,00:53:22,"- And I don't think we do sledging here, really."
00:53:22,00:53:23,- I've got nine years worth of--
00:53:23,00:53:24,(all laughing)
00:53:24,00:53:27,"- And unfortunately for you guys, it's on record."
00:53:27,00:53:28,(all laughing)
00:53:28,00:53:29,- Cue the clip.
00:53:29,00:53:30,- Yeah.
00:53:30,00:53:33,"- 'Cause this podcast, the whole HR exercise."
00:53:33,00:53:35,"- One day you guys are gonna be called into an office, yeah."
00:53:38,00:53:41,One place where you get smacked talk famously is wrestling.
00:53:41,00:53:42,- Yeah.
00:53:42,00:53:43,"- And I was reading the book,"
00:53:43,00:53:45,"it's called Everything to Play For,"
00:53:45,00:53:47,the QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.
00:53:47,00:53:48,- Oh my goodness.
00:53:48,00:53:49,- Sounds a lot of sounds.
00:53:49,00:53:52,"- Well, I don't know, it doesn't come out until October,"
00:53:52,00:53:53,"so I don't know if it's rubbish or not,"
00:53:53,00:53:56,"but I suspect, the big names I suspect it'll be quite good."
00:53:56,00:53:58,"- It's gonna be a fair hearing, eh?"
00:53:58,00:53:59,- But they argue in that book
00:53:59,00:54:00,(all laughing)
00:54:00,00:54:03,"that the earliest depictions of wrestling that we have,"
00:54:03,00:54:05,"which are in the Egyptian tombs,"
00:54:05,00:54:08,they're quite similar to today's pro wrestling.
00:54:08,00:54:09,So there's an argument that it could be
00:54:09,00:54:11,that all the games were fixed
00:54:11,00:54:14,because they were often shown as being one person
00:54:14,00:54:16,"from Egypt, clearly,"
00:54:16,00:54:18,"and one person from a place that isn't Egypt, clearly,"
00:54:18,00:54:20,and the Egyptian one always won.
00:54:20,00:54:23,And perhaps it was that they were fixed fights
00:54:23,00:54:26,so that the pharaoh would know
00:54:26,00:54:28,that his people were the greatest in the whole world.
00:54:28,00:54:30,- Who's saying ancient Egyptian pro wrestling is fake?
00:54:30,00:54:32,- That's what I'm saying.
00:54:32,00:54:34,"Sorry, no, that's what James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski"
00:54:34,00:54:35,"are saying in that book,"
00:54:35,00:54:39,everything to play for the QI book of spot out in October.
00:54:39,00:54:41,But the other thing is that there's a really early one
00:54:41,00:54:44,and there is some writing next to it.
00:54:44,00:54:47,And it's an Egyptian who defeated a Nubian opponent
00:54:47,00:54:50,"and he says, ""Woe to you, O Nubian enemy,"
00:54:50,00:54:52,"""I will make you take a hopeless fall"
00:54:52,00:54:54,"""in the presence of the pharaoh."""
00:54:54,00:54:59,"And so that's basically smack talk from 3,200 years ago."
00:54:59,00:55:02,- Tell me the flavor that you find in my ass.
00:55:02,00:55:04,(laughing)
00:55:04,00:55:13,"- Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts."
