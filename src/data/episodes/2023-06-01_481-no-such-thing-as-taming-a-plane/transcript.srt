00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hi everybody, Dan and Andy here just to let you know that our special guest on this week's fish is none other than

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Ann Miller. You will remember Ann because she's been on loads of times before, though she hasn't been on for a little while

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 We are so excited to see her again.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Ann is a brilliant children's author. She's written Mickey and the Animal Spies, a series of children's books all about animals spying and codes.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 They're fabulous. And as you're about to hear, she is obviously a magnificent researcher and elf.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 So we hope you enjoy this episode.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 That's right. We also just want to quickly say happy birthday publication to Andrew Hunter Murray because the sanctuary, yeah, has just been released in paperback.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 This is such a brilliant book. It's a book that is so brilliant that waterstones have actually decided to make it the thriller of the month.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 So you're going to see it everywhere in bookshops.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And it's a book that's been called many things by many great people. It's been called imaginative and intriguing.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 The sanctuary sucks you in and doesn't let you leave until the very last page by Anthony Horowitz.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 It's a brilliantly clever thriller by a brilliantly clever author, says Richard Osman. They are all telling the truth.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Oh, Dan, thank you. Yeah, guys, it would mean the absolute world to me if you picked up a copy of the sanctuary in paperback.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 It's a gripping twisty thriller set on a mysterious island off the coast up north where one of the world's wealthiest, most enigmatic men is building an entirely new society.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 It's all about that and what the young hero from the city finds when he goes and sees this new world being built.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 It's about billionaires. It's about mysterious islands. It's about the near future.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 If you're looking for a gripping summer read on the beach, I think this could be the one for you.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 That's right. And it's also brilliant. So do make sure you go and get a copy from our own personal Sunday Times bestselling author here on the show, Andrew Hunter Murray.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 As I say, available in all good bookshops, both online and in the real world, do pick it up, help our buddy out to get back in that Sunday Times chart.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 All right, on with the show.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 On with the podcast.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 [Music]

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Hello and welcome to another episode of No Such Thing as a Fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Hoburn.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 My name is Dan Schreiber. I'm sitting here with James Harkin, Andrew Hunter Murray and Ann Miller.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 And in a particular order here we go. Starting with fact number one, and that is Ann.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 My fact is that Ann of Green Gables is from the same island as the world's largest potato sculpture.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Welcome back, Ann.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Are you suggesting a link, a causal link between the two?

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Between great literature and great snacks.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Oh, that's a large potato, a great snack. I'm not coming around the house. Super Bowl Sunday.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So I don't know really who Ann of Green Gables is.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 So I give you a pot as Ann of Green Gables one on one.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 So Ann of Green Gables is one of my favorite books of all time.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 It is set on Prince Edward Island in Canada.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I was given it when I was very young and the setting is just completely beautiful.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 So the thing about Ann is she is an orphan.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 This brother and sister called Matthew Marilla live at a place called Green Gables.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And they are convinced to adopt an orphan boy to help them on the farm.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 But when they go to collect the boy, it's Ann. She's a chatterbox. She's an imaginative.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 She gets into endless scrapes, but they love her and she sort of builds this new life on Prince Edward Island.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And when I was a little bit older, my godmother sent me a postcard from Green Gables.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And it was as if someone had sent me a card from Narnia.

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 I didn't understand how she'd been somewhere that was in a book.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And I remember being so confused and like it was like, "Oh, nice time at Green Gables."

46
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And I was like, "How did you get there?"

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 It's not a really big potato. Did she say that as well?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 She did not. She did not. I found out about that more recently.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 But yeah, so the island, because Lizzie Moore Montgomery, who wrote the book, lived there.

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Ann is set there. There's lots of places in the book that are actually there.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 And it's a sweeping series. There are several books beyond Ann of Green Gables.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And I was planning the trip of a lifetime to go and see Prince Edward Island for somewhere 2020.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 So I didn't make it there. But while I was reading about Prince Edward Island,

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 I found out that they also are the home of the Canadian Potato Museum.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And outside is a 4.3 meter tall potato. We had a picture taken.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 And I just, I almost want to go there as much as I want to go to Green Gables.

57
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 It's got exhibitions. It's got potatoes in tiny coffins to show the different diseases they can have.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 It's got a potato themed gift shop. It's got a potato themed restaurant.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 So you can have baked potato with side of crisps. You can have with potato skins, potato soup.

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 And what do you reckon you can have for pudding?

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Oh, I know that they make potato fudge there. Yeah.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Potato fudge. Potato fudge.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 With mashed potato.

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 I did have a quick look at TripAdvisor for the Potato Museum.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Pretty overwhelmingly good. I think it's also a tribute to Canadian positivity and politeness.

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Which one of you picked out there?

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Oh, you know, obviously I was looking for the negative reviews.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Actually, there are very few which is a tribute to the restaurant.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Well, there's one three star review which sniffs that the big potato could have been a little more realistic.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 The TripAdvisor review does suggest a duration one to two hours for your visit.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 I think by the end of the second hour, you'll be running short of things to do.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 You're right, they have absolutely loads of stuff.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 They say it's a living testament to the humble tuber and those who have tilled the soil in its evolution.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Did they have any two or one star reviews?

75
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 They had so few actually that I think it would be unrepresentative of me to read any out.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 And I didn't write any down because they weren't very amusingly written.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 But it's clearly a very popular place.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 The museum was started by a guy called Dr Lloyd George Dewar, who was a politician.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 And I tried to find anything interesting about him, which was really tough.

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 I even went into like these, what they call it, the websites that tell you about your family.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 Oh, like, yeah, yeah, ancestry.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Yeah, like an ancestry one.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 And I found out that his great grandfather died at the age of 101 in the town of Dole in Persia.

84
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 The only interesting fact about that.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 So I could find, yeah, amazing.

86
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 How heavy was the sculpture potato again, by the way?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 They didn't say the weight.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 They don't list the weight.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 They don't list the weight.

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 Just the height.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 I found the world's heaviest potato and was just curious.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 How heavy is the difference?

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 Well, it's going to be a lot less heavy, I assume.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 We're saying heaviest real potato.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Is it a real one?

96
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Yeah, it's a real potato, which was just under five kilograms.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Nice.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 And that, well, that, no, that's, I know, well, this is the thing is potatoes aren't water bearing organisms like your squashes.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 That's why they take squashes kind of a ton and the biggest potato.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But it's grown by friend of the podcast, Peter Glazebrook, who we've mentioned several times before,

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 because he's done things like the longest bean or the biggest maroon or whatever it is.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 Yeah, he's got a load of those records.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 He's a UK guy.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Yeah, yeah.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Which is great.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 We should get him into the building sometime.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Unfortunately, he won't fit through the door.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 He can carry his bean the other way, you know.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Oh, that's a good point.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 But what about the nine foot apple?

111
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 I wanted to find a bigger potato to kind of spoil this fact.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 Because that's my gel in this podcast.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 So I looked at all the other potato museums around the world to see if they had one.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 There are surprisingly quite a few.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 There are quite a few.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 But I found in the Idaho potato museum, they have the world's largest Pringle.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 And we have perhaps a Pringles controversy with this.

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Further, further.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Further, because I knew when Sarah Pasco was on, but she had five Pringles controversies.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Yes.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 But this is the world's largest Pringle, but it's flat.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 Oh, it's not the shape of a Pringle.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 So do you call that a Pringle?

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Was it made by Pringles?

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It was made by Pringles.

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Yeah.

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Is it made from the material of Pringle?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 It's made from the hydrogenated potato starch.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Potato starch.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 It's just not got the shape.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 That's interesting.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 What makes a Pringle?

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Is it the shape or is it the...

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Do you reckon it's a Pringle if it's not Pringle shaped?

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 I think if it's made by Pringles, it's a Pringle.

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Do you?

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 What about the box that's made by Pringles?

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 No.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 The box is also a Pringle.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 It's a cylindrical Pringle.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 I'm going to double down on this.

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Okay, fine.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 Sadly, I do agree.

144
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I think they have name rights.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 So I can't call it a Pringles controversy.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Oh, well, I think we've certainly argued about it just now.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 It's controversial that you're trying to introduce it as a controversy.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Certainly.

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 Okay, great.

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 I'll email Sarah.

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 I did find out about the world's another non-largest potato in the world.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 And this was, you may well have seen this in your research as well, which was nearly a

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 knockout blow to Peter Glazebrook's Five Kilo Potato.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Which is, I think, about an eight kilo potato.

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Yeah, it was found by a pair of farmers in New Zealand who, the Guinness World Records

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 people, wrote back to them when they wrote in saying, "We've got this."

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 They said, "In fact, it's a tuber of a kind of gourd.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 A DNA testing actually revealed in true Jerry Springer style."

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Wow.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It wasn't a potato.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It wasn't a potato at all.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 It was called Doug.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 Doug.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 After how they got it out of the grave.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Doug.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Samantha Baldwin, who's a researcher at the New Zealand Institute for Food and Plant Research,

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 presumably having a morning off or something.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 So we tried running multiple tests on samples of Doug, but he just wasn't behaving like

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 a potato should.

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Because he wasn't a potato.

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 I like the idea of vegetable espionage, though, like posing as a potato for many, many years.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Yeah, I mean, it looks like a potato.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And the finders, they made a little trolley to drag it around on.

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It's quite sweet.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 I have a couple more contenders for giant potatoes.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Oh, go on.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So I was a little bit concerned when I was double checking that there was a giant potato in

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 Cyprus, which was two foot taller.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 But sadly, or luckily for me, was chopped down by vandals.

180
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 That wasn't me who did it.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Was it just done this week?

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Really?

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 Just after you said this fact?

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 That sounds suspicious.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 You are looking tanned.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Yeah, and you look so gleeful at the moment.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 I mean, no jury would acquit you at the moment.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 I can't look out if you're sad or, yeah, if you're hysterical.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 I'm very sad.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 So the one inside for us was two foot taller, but it's been...

191
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 You're not doing a good impression of someone who hasn't chopped down a giant potato.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Put it that way.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Well, I definitely didn't chop down the one in Australia.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 So they have the big things, I'm sure.

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Yeah, of course, yeah.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And they have the big potato.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But theirs is lying down, so it's long.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 Did someone knock it up?

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 But it did for a while have a face, which was so mildly terrifying.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And the face has been taken away.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 I'm not sure if it was stolen.

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Wow.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Any more for potatoes?

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 No.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 How about Prince Edward Island?

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Well, they do.

207
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 They make about a million tons of potatoes each year.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 They're big, big potatoes.

209
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 Yeah, a quarter of Canada's potatoes, despite it being a very small Canadian province.

210
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Yeah, one of the smallest, I would say.

211
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 A lot of the potatoes on Prince Edward Island are grown and processed by McCain,

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 who are the world's largest manufacturer of frozen potato products.

213
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 You will know them from their oven chips.

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 Yes, big fans.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 They were founded by two brothers called Harrison and Wallace McCain.

216
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And like it seems, every single company that's founded by two brothers,

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 they got into a massive legal dispute and then one of the brothers had to leave

218
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 and took over a thing called Maple Leaf Foods.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 No, rivals.

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I thought you were going to say there's a potato equator around the world.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Like the Eldie Brothers.

222
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 But no, isn't that surprising?

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 That is bizarre.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 It does seem this thing, that brothers start companies and they fall out.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Was it Adidas?

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Adidas.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Yeah, that's so weird.

228
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 Wow, and Oasis.

229
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Oasis, yeah.

230
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So it's a very big island as well.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 It's 175 miles long.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Did I just say it was a small one?

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 It's a small province, but it's a big island.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 You know what I mean?

235
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Because Canada's massive.

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 I think everyone forgets how big Canada is.

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 Just shout out for Canada there.

238
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But did you know we have a lot of listeners on Prince Edward Island?

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Really?

240
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 So I had a little look in the inbox, the fish inbox, podcast@qi.com.

241
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 We have had so many messages from people over the years saying,

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 "I'm on Prince Edward Island and I would like you to cover it."

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 And here are some facts.

244
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 So I've got a couple for you.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 Ryan Barrett, who works for the PEI Potato Board.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Wow, you picked that up, friend.

247
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Yeah, I mean, he wrote an email a couple of years ago.

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 This was when Anna was in charge of the inbox.

249
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Ryan, I don't think you've got to reply.

250
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 So I'm going to write that wrong.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Anna really hates Prince Edward Island.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 He doesn't say Prince Edward Island, does he?

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Every week she goes on about how much she hates it.

254
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 You have to cut it out.

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 He just said some cool place names they've got.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 They've got an Alaska, a Belfast, a New Zealand, a Toronto, a Norway,

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 a Crapo, which is French for toad, I didn't know,

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 and a Surice, which is French for mouse.

259
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 And he also has a fact about Anne of Green Gables, which is that,

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 because of Anne of Green Gables,

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Prince Edward Island gets thousands and thousands of Japanese tourists every year.

262
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And that's because the book was the first book

263
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 taught in English in Japan after the Second World War.

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 It's massive there.

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So big cultural influence.

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 Yeah, still to this day, it's ginormous.

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 And they have schools named after it there, the School of Green Gables.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 They've got the University of Prince Edward Island School of Nursing.

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And apparently adaptations are just always on TV.

270
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Just non-stop on TV in Japan.

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 I've always heard that.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 I never really understood why.

273
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And I read a really cool article by Margaret Atwood to celebrate Anne's 100th birthday.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 And she said she'd done an event in Japan, and she'd asked the audience,

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 and her translator had written down the responses.

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And one of the big reasons is the author who translated it in Japan

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 was already very beloved, so sort of had an audience there.

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 And there are many things about the book that just really resonated.

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 So Anne was an orphan, and there were sadly a lot of orphans in Japan after the war.

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 She's got a huge passion for Apple Blossom and Cherry Blossom,

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 which was very popular in Japan, and sort of her work ethic.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 She's not scared of hard work, and she's very thoughtful,

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 but she's also quite forgetful, but it's because she's daydreaming.

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 She's not lazy. She tries to do her best, and she does wind up in scrapes, but it's never...

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 She means well.

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 I did read one place that said that America kind of pushed Anne of Green Gables after the war,

287
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 because they thought it would help kind of as American liberal propaganda.

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And they thought that this kind of book, which showed that women were more free-thinking,

289
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 might get them away from some of their old ideas.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So that was supposedly one of the reasons.

291
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 She sounds like a pretty cool character, the author Lucy Maud Montgomery.

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 When she was a kid, she had two imaginary friends, which is really cool.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 So she was at her grandparents' house, and they had a bookcase,

294
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 and it had glass reflection doors on the bookcase,

295
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 and she could see herself in the reflection.

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 So the one on the left was a reflection of someone that she called Katie Maurice,

297
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 and the right was Lucy Gray, and it was both her, both her reflections,

298
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 but she created them as her imaginary friends.

299
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 Yeah, very cool idea.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 And I love that her titles of her books all sound like she's still workshopping the author title.

301
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 This is Emily of New Moon, Pat of Silver Bush, Kill Many of the Orchard.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 One more to add to that.

303
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 So there's six in the Anne of series, and then there are two that focus on her children.

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And the second one is Rilla of Ingleside, which is her youngest daughter.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 So spoiler alert, she goes up to get married and has a bunch of children.

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 But what I didn't realize when I was younger is I followed the books through,

307
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 and I see her grow up, and I hadn't clocked that as she grew up,

308
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 the year would get so much closer to the war, so it becomes a book about the First World War.

309
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 So Rilla of Ingleside is about war coming to Canada, which I wasn't expecting.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 And so two of her children end up fighting in the war,

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 her daughter Rilla ends up adopting a war baby and looking after him,

312
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 and it's just very odd to take a character who you know from a beloved children's book

313
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 and put them in World War One.

314
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I think this about, it's a slightly different example of it,

315
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 because there's an episode of Frasier where Martin Crane, Frasier's dad,

316
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 has just watched the Austin Powers film,

317
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 and it's very weird thinking of them in the same conceptual universe,

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 because there's a bit where Martin keeps on saying, "Shagadelic baby, yeah!"

319
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 And it really takes you out of yourself.

320
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 It's quite amazing that she gave over the trademark basically to Anna Green-Gables

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 to not only her daughters and the heirs, but to Prince Edward Island as well.

322
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 So they've got the trademark, which means that anyone who works on the island

323
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 is allowed to make their own sort of products or merchandise and sell them.

324
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Yeah, with no worry of the estate coming at them, because they are the estate.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Wow, can you do anything?

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It sounds like it. I mean, possibly you might have to pitch and say, you know...

327
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Yeah, you can have Anna Green-Gables, for instance.

328
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Oh, yes.

329
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 The second World War book.

330
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Okay, it is time for fact number two, and that is my fact.

331
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 My fact this week is, in 1952, a cowboy successfully lassoed a plane

332
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 as it flew past his house.

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 His house?

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Yeah, so he was working at this house.

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 He was working with his boss.

336
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 I have a question, Dan.

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Yeah.

338
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Successfully lassoed?

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 Yeah.

340
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Does that mean he got the lasso around the plane

341
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 and then the plane flew off with his lasso attached?

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 He tamed it.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 He tamed it.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Yeah, yeah, he ended up riding the plane.

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 He broke it, you know, he made it submissive to him.

346
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 That's Andy's got it right.

347
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And the plane lives happily in his garden to this day.

348
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yeah.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 No, this is, the basic story is that he was at this house.

350
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 He was working as a cowboy, and this plane just kept flying really low over the house

351
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 and kept going by, and had no idea what was going on.

352
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 It turns out what was going on was the pilot on the inside

353
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 was trying to drop a love letter to a girl who lived inside the house,

354
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 and flying Kai, he was trying to get her to come out to see the love letter being dropped, right?

355
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 But this cowboy gets pissed off.

356
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 So he gets out his lasso.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 It's a three and a half meter long lasso.

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 And as the guy is swooping down, he's flying very low.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You know, he's got to drop the letter so it lands on a good spot.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Absolutely.

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 So he throws the lasso at the plane, it manages to collide with the propeller,

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 catches onto it and snaps off and gets tangled up in the propeller.

363
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 So the pilot has no choice but to turn around and quickly land the plane.

364
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Obviously the cowboy was knocked onto his back.

365
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It was not pleasant.

366
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Obviously.

367
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Did the guy in the plane survive?

368
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Yeah, he did.

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And actually years later, when he was 78 years old,

370
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 there was a photo of him with the propeller with the lasso rope still wrapped around it.

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Wow.

372
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Did he get the girl?

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 I couldn't find that bit of the story.

374
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Great question.

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 Yeah, great question.

376
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 Can I just say, everyone in the story is an idiot.

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Not the girl?

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Why isn't she coming out of her house?

379
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 How would she know to come out?

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 There's a plane flying apparently two meters above your house.

381
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 Show some curiosity.

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Like she's idiot three on the list.

383
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 Idiot two, I think is probably the pilot who's doing this magic.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Just send the card.

385
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Idiot one's the cowboy.

387
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Why?

388
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Because he could have killed the pilot and himself.

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 But it's a good point though.

390
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 I felt sorry for the pilot because I thought he's trying to do something in secret.

391
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Instead his plane's fallen out of the sky and made a big noise, presumably.

392
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 But the post is pretty secret.

393
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yeah, this is not secret.

394
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 This is less secret, I would say, than the post.

395
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He's not trying to be secret.

396
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 This is romance.

397
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 This is, look, you can see me.

398
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Hi, I've got a letter.

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 I want to show you my love.

400
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 Is it like the 80s thing of turning up outside the house with a boombox?

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 I was thinking.

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Or the love actually thing of turning up with the cards.

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It's exactly that.

404
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 The propeller card.

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I would be good in love actually in that scene if a lasso just came in for the second one.

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Or if he's going round to loop the loop with a plane.

407
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 And every time he does the bottom of the loop, it's another card.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Oh yeah.

409
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Oh.

410
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 Sorry, forgot to say.

411
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Yeah, no.

412
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 Yeah, fools.

413
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 It's a great story.

414
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 It's a very random story.

415
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 It appeared in a Time Magazine article in a language that is just, it says like, then

416
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 a few, few years ago, some smart fellows bought themselves a little airplane and opened a flying

417
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 club just a hood and a holler from where the ranch cowboy.

418
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 This is Time Magazine.

419
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 This is how they're reporting the story.

420
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 So yeah.

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 50s journalism.

422
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Yeah, his name was Euclides Guterres is how I'm going to pronounce that.

423
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 Who's that?

424
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 That's the cowboy.

425
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 That's the cowboy.

426
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Yeah.

427
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 And again, so little detail about this story, but it's the South Brazilian cattle ranchers.

428
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 So I don't even think this is an American cowboy.

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Oh, I see.

430
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 We're talking.

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 Oh, I thought we were in the USA.

432
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 That's what I, that's what I initially thought.

433
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 I thought we were in Brazil and ancient Greece from his name.

434
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Um, just on Lassus and Lassouing things.

435
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 Um, I did find someone who Lassoued cats.

436
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Hell.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 This was a cat Lassou artist from the second war.

438
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 She was called Miss Iris Davis.

439
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's a really nice story actually.

440
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 So lots of buildings being bombed in the second war, lots of rubble, lots of, you know, ruins

441
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 and things.

442
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Also lots of cats, lots of people keeping cats.

443
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 And she was a volunteer worker for what something called the dumb friends league, which is friends

444
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 of cats.

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Yeah, exactly.

446
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Dumb as in, I think they don't speak rather than stupid cats.

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 But she went from, she went from bombed house to bombed house with a cat Lassou.

448
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 It was very long pole with the Lassou at the end, rescuing cats from the wreckage.

449
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Can I ask Andy?

450
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 You know, um, lots of planes flying very low there.

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Yeah.

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Do you think a curious person would get out of the house and look what's going on there?

453
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Idiots.

454
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 No, no, no, no.

455
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 Sorry.

456
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 She claimed in 1940, November 1940.

457
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 So I guess the Blitz had been going on for a while.

458
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 She claimed she had rescued 600 cats from bomber buildings, which is a lot.

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 No cats.

460
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 It was probably the same one.

461
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Yeah, someone who's an unexpected cowboy, Osama bin Laden turns out he used to walk around

462
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 with a Stetson on his favorite shows were bonanza and things like fury.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 He had his own horse and he absolutely loved the world of cowboys.

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Um, yeah, there was lots of stories because the biography came out where they said you

465
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 would see Osama bin Laden walking around with his Stetson on acting all cowboy.

466
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It's amazing.

467
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 It took that long to find and catch him, given that he was.

468
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 There can't be that many people in the Torah barricades with a massive Stetson.

469
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Wow.

470
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I didn't know what to make of that.

471
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 I know it's odd, isn't it?

472
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 But there's a lot of, um, so like Stalin, for example, if we're talking like bad people,

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 generally massive cowboy fan as well.

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 He used to love watching Westerns, love John Wayne movies, but also hated John Wayne because

475
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 of his anti-communism stance.

476
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 And so actually plotted to have him murdered.

477
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 He ordered KGB assassins to go and try and kill John Wayne.

478
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 Um, and, and Chairman Mao did that as well.

479
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 Chairman Mao hated John Wayne.

480
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 The stories of assassination plot from, yeah, from Chairman Mao as well.

481
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Oh, these all put out by John Wayne's PR language.

482
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 It feels like it, right?

483
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Communist dictators hate him.

484
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Find this one weird trick.

485
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 There's a really good, there's a Hollywood writer called Michael Mundt.

486
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 I've read a couple of his books.

487
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 It's one that he did on John Wayne.

488
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 He found that the FBI had discovered that there were assassins that were sent to Hollywood.

489
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 To try and kill John Wayne.

490
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 Amazing.

491
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 Gosh.

492
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Do you know how many people you can fit inside a lasso?

493
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Oh, surely.

494
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 Do you have enough rope?

495
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Well, the Guinness World Record for everyone who's done it.

496
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So it has to be spinning.

497
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Oh, yeah.

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 Was it thrown?

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Yeah, yeah.

500
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 So it's like, it's spinning.

501
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 He's like, I would say actually it's smaller than you think.

502
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I'm going to say 20 people gathered in a tight, as in that'll be very hard.

503
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 I think to let's do 20 people standing to get even standing together.

504
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I'm going to say just going with my imagination here.

505
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 A million?

506
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 I'm going to say 200 and I'm going to say that the person was standing on top of a

507
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 first floor building, like the top of a school, massive lasso and just managed to get the

508
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 throw.

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 A school, specifically a school.

510
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 There are no other buildings have more than one story as we know.

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 What I'm thinking maybe is maybe around 240 to 300 and they're all on the same plane and

512
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 it gets lassoed.

513
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Very nice.

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,560
 - Yeah. - Very nice.

515
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,920
 - Well, you actually write the first time.

516
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,400
 It's 13 or 14, including the guy handling it.

517
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,240
 - Oh, he was so close. - So he counts.

518
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
 - It sort of does he count.

519
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,560
 The record is 13. - The guy throwing the rope.

520
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,400
 He jumped in. - He jumped in.

521
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
 - I think he's taking this.

522
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,960
 - Oh, wait, if he's in the list of, yeah,

523
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,080
 then that absolutely counts.

524
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,240
 - He's in the center and he's a lassoing around

525
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,960
 and other people are gathering round him as he lassoes.

526
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,800
 - Yeah, I love that.

527
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,040
 - Does that count as lassoing?

528
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,760
 Because you don't usually stand, say, like,

529
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,760
 next to the wild horse and lasso yourself into it as well.

530
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,880
 - They do tricks, don't they, lasso artists?

531
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
 And I think this is kind of part of that.

532
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,480
 As in, they like a skipping rope,

533
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
 you're kind of lasso around and then you'll do jump in.

534
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,760
 - You're gonna get lettuce from the cowboys

535
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,120
 and the skipping people.

536
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,880
 How dare you associate us with those hacks?

537
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,120
 - I'll tell you what, if someone flies

538
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,420
 very close to the top of my house,

539
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,360
 then I'll look outside for the lettuce.

540
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,320
 - Marlboro Man, one of the most famous cowboys

541
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,000
 for the internet. - Cigarette smoking Marlboro Man.

542
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,480
 - Yeah, Bob Norris was the original Marlboro Man

543
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,560
 who never smoked cigarettes in his life.

544
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,080
 He actively was anti it, but he was found

545
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,520
 because he was in a photo with John Wayne,

546
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,360
 who used to smoke seven packs a day.

547
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,640
 And they saw him in that shot and went,

548
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,680
 "Hey, that guy looks like he'd be good for our smoking."

549
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,360
 - Weirdly, he'd actually been hired by Stalin to kill Wayne.

550
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,600
 (laughing)

551
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,960
 And then the film people got to him in time,

552
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,800
 the cigarette people.

553
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,160
 - I was looking at other big animals that you can lasso.

554
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,880
 So, do you know how many lessoes it takes

555
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,520
 to get a crocodile safely?

556
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,360
 - I would've said one.

557
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,160
 I would've said one. - Just round the mouth.

558
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
 - I'm gonna say three.

559
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,640
 - Three, yeah, points to the driver.

560
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,280
 So apparently, the way they do it

561
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,560
 is they lasso the top bit of the mouth,

562
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,080
 and they do it again with a second lasso.

563
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,000
 I guess that's the most scary part.

564
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,640
 And then they do one round the whole mouth,

565
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,040
 and then they tape the mouth to be so, so, so sure.

566
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,120
 And then the advice was, if it all goes pear-shaped, run.

567
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,760
 - I was gonna say, that's a lot of detail

568
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,920
 to get right three times round.

569
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,040
 We get the clippers sometimes to go to our gigs

570
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,640
 at Up The Creek, and whenever the boat comes in,

571
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,680
 they always have to lasso the boat.

572
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,360
 And I always have a bet with whoever I'm standing with,

573
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,520
 are they gonna get on the first go?

574
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,840
 Sometimes it's the third go,

575
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,880
 but the thing is the doc's not gonna eat you,

576
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
 whereas a crocodile, yeah, that's a fine time.

577
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,080
 - That's one of the first QI facts I ever learned,

578
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,320
 was that a crocodile can, what is it?

579
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,440
 It can bite you with the force of a truck

580
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,660
 falling off a cliff, but once his mouth is closed,

581
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,080
 it presents no threat at all,

582
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,320
 because you can hold its mouth shut with your hand.

583
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,280
 - That's a rubber band, even just a rubber band.

584
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
 - I think the scariest job is the person

585
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,440
 who takes the tape off at the end of the procedure.

586
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,160
 I think that's the real hero.

587
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,320
 - But at that point it's quite annoyed, probably.

588
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,400
 - Exactly, yeah.

589
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,480
 - Have you ever held a crocodile?

590
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,560
 - No. - No.

591
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,640
 - No, me either.

592
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
 (laughing)

593
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,880
 - But my wife has, my wife has, so.

594
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,720
 - I thought we were on the brink of an amazing Jane story.

595
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,960
 I've never, I've really had she.

596
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,440
 - Yeah, yeah, we went to the Everglades,

597
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,360
 and there was a baby crocodile that you could hold,

598
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,040
 called Snappy. - Of course.

599
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,600
 - And Polina held it, and I didn't have the guts to hold it.

600
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,200
 - How big was Snappy?

601
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,040
 - How big were you talking?

602
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,560
 - I would say about a foot and a half.

603
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,400
 - Okay.

604
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,360
 - Something like that.

605
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,560
 - Wow, that's amazing.

606
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,800
 - I also did once, played mini golf in a place

607
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,360
 that had crocodiles sort of roaming around the world.

608
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,520
 - Yes, yeah, there's that one golf course

609
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 where the lake literally has giant snappy crocodiles,

610
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,360
 which is amazing.

611
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,960
 - You just have to stay away from them, basically.

612
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,360
 - Yeah, okay, we're in London now.

613
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,200
 - We are.

614
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,160
 - Right? - Yeah, no crocodiles.

615
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,560
 - No, no crocodiles, but some cowboys quite near here,

616
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,000
 there is a secret cowboy town in the middle of Kent.

617
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,960
 - Really? - Yeah.

618
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,080
 It's called Laredo, it's founded in 1971,

619
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,160
 and they've got a blacksmith,

620
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,080
 they've got an undertaker, a tobacconist.

621
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 - Like a working, these early models.

622
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,920
 - It's life-size, and it's kind of functional.

623
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,240
 So it was founded by a bloke called John Trudeau,

624
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,440
 who was a pig farmer, and he just loved the Wild West,

625
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,200
 and he just wanted to recreate the Wild West

626
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,360
 in his corner of Kent.

627
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,240
 It's members only, and they go there at weekends,

628
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,000
 and they recreate life in the Old West.

629
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,840
 - Cool.

630
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,760
 - Yeah, you can get a half an hour train

631
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,920
 from London and arrive in Laredo.

632
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,200
 - And they won't let you in.

633
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,560
 - They won't let you in, no, no.

634
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,640
 - There's like a random Wild West in Morningside,

635
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,480
 in Edinburgh.

636
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
 Like it's just, you go like through an archway,

637
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,000
 and it's just a Wild West, like behind a bank of the flats.

638
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,440
 Yeah, it's just there.

639
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,920
 - I read about it, it was created by a furniture shop,

640
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:10,760
 for some reason, it's called the Great American Indoors,

641
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,520
 the shop, and they made their own new Wild West.

642
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,360
 - Yeah, it's not advertised.

643
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,600
 Then we'll say, have you seen the Wild West?

644
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,280
 And you'll be like, no, we're in Scotland,

645
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,600
 and they'd say, oh, it's just over there,

646
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,440
 and you go and look.

647
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,280
 - That's so weird.

648
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,840
 - And that one you can just walk into.

649
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,000
 - It's just like behind some flats, yeah.

650
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,840
 - So weird.

651
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
 - Does the piano player always stop whenever there's someone?

652
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,000
 - No, but there's like always these planes

653
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,280
 coming down with ropes, so it's very strange.

654
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,860
 (upbeat music)

655
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,800
 - Okay, it is time for fact number three,

656
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
 and that is James.

657
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,760
 - Okay, my fact this week is that one of the best ways

658
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,920
 to trick puffins to a new nesting ground is with mirrors,

659
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,320
 because they like to be in groups

660
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,680
 and can't tell the difference between a puffin

661
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,460
 and the reflection of a puffin.

662
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,040
 - So they fail the mirror test.

663
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,440
 They don't know that they are.

664
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,000
 - Yeah, the mirror test is a thing with animals.

665
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,680
 Some animals, if you show them a reflection of themselves

666
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,040
 and put a little mark on their head,

667
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,520
 they'll realize that it's them,

668
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,560
 and they'll try and wipe it off,

669
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,000
 whereas most animals won't do that.

670
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,640
 They won't see, they'll see a mirror image of themselves

671
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,360
 and think it's another animal.

672
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,880
 And in fact, humans, my daughter only did it a few weeks ago,

673
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,280
 and she's what, 14 months.

674
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,720
 So it's until that age is the first time you get to do that,

675
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,040
 so babies don't know it either.

676
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,840
 But this is all about a guy called Stephen Kress,

677
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,280
 and he was working about trying to get puffins

678
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,240
 into a new area.

679
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,280
 In fact, they'd been in that area before,

680
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,520
 but he wanted to get them back into that area

681
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,480
 on the East Coast of America.

682
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,440
 And one of the ways that he did that

683
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,760
 was by making these decoys.

684
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,680
 You can make actual decoys of little puffins,

685
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,160
 but one good way of doing it is mirrors,

686
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,600
 'cause you can get multiple puffins.

687
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,560
 - Oh yeah, hall of mirrors, like kaleidoscope stuff.

688
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,400
 - Yeah, yeah.

689
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,280
 Unfortunately, they saw someone that were really tall,

690
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,960
 someone that were really tall.

691
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,880
 This mission he was on, 'cause Stephen Kress,

693
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,720
 it sounds like a great guy.

694
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,800
 He's been working on this for about 30 years, 40 years?

695
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,640
 - It's 1969.

696
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,680
 - It's a long career in puffinology.

697
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,160
 And he, so he and his colleagues,

698
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,800
 they went to a breeding colony,

699
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,160
 which was healthy in Newfoundland, just Canada.

700
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,880
 And they basically, they had to kidnap

701
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,360
 loads of baby puffins.

702
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,480
 - Yeah, the start of the story is a bit dodgy, isn't it?

703
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,280
 - It's a real villain-to-hero arc,

704
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,920
 I think he and his colleagues went on,

705
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,680
 'cause they start off as puffin kidnappers, you know?

706
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,800
 - At the start, people are just like,

707
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,600
 "What are you doing, stealing all those puffins?"

708
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,160
 - They shoved them in soup cans,

709
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,600
 which I like, to transport them all the way

710
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,040
 to their new home.

711
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,360
 But then, then, then, then there's the twist,

712
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,800
 the character twist, where he and his colleagues

713
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,680
 became puffin nannies, looking after them,

714
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,800
 breeding them up on this new island in Maine.

715
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,280
 And they put them in these fake burrows,

716
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,920
 which they had dug, and they fed them,

717
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,280
 they left fish in there,

718
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,040
 and he constructed all these decoy puffins.

719
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,760
 And then, the thing is that the puffins go to sea,

720
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,400
 eventually, when they become kind of teenagers,

721
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,960
 they gain their independence, they go off,

722
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,720
 and then, he waited for years,

723
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,520
 hoping they would come back to the island.

724
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,080
 - 'Cause the question is, would they go back to Newfoundland,

725
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,240
 where their kind of genes say that they should be living,

726
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,720
 or will they remember where they lived as babies,

727
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,920
 and then come back to that place, and in the end?

728
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,000
 - In the end, they came back.

729
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,800
 But I think, only in the third year,

730
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,360
 it was a few years before they did,

731
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,320
 and he was getting really worried,

732
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,200
 and then, eventually, he built loads of decoys,

733
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
 and that kind of leered them back.

734
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,200
 - Right, okay, that's very good.

735
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,800
 - I was reading about puffins' ministry of silly walks,

736
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,760
 so when they want to show that they're not any,

737
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,800
 'cause they live quite close together,

738
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,280
 they live in burrows, and so, if you want to cross across,

739
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,880
 you'll probably cross lots of other territories,

740
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,680
 and if you don't want to start a fight,

741
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,480
 they do this like, "Hey, don't mind me walk,"

742
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,480
 where they lower their head,

743
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,720
 and they sort of walk quite quickly,

744
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,120
 in trying not to get noticed.

745
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,200
 But if they're on guard duty,

746
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,680
 they'll stand outside their burrows nice and tall,

747
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,880
 and they'll sort of stamp their feet,

748
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,920
 like an exaggerated guard doing a march.

749
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,440
 - Wow. - Okay, that's a real idea,

750
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,120
 of like, "I'm on patrol, and don't mind me, just over here."

751
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,560
 - That's great. - And that's really funny.

752
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,400
 - And they take over rabbit burrows as well.

753
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,400
 I love that they don't even need

754
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,080
 to just dig their own burrows, they're just, yeah.

755
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,200
 - They can make their own burrows if they want to.

756
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,400
 And actually, sometimes rabbits take their burrows.

757
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,720
 There's a whole little ecosystem going on there.

758
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,040
 - That's pretty cool. - I went to the Isle of May

759
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,080
 a few years ago, which is off the east coast of Scotland,

760
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,120
 and you've got tons and tons of seabirds, loads of puffins,

761
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,160
 and there's certain bits where like,

762
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,640
 you cannot stray off the path,

763
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,080
 because the island is just covered in puffin burrows,

764
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,160
 so you've got to walk on the bits that they know are safe,

765
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,080
 which is really cool.

766
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,560
 - Back to Steven Kress very quickly.

767
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,200
 He had a big problem with gulls.

768
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,640
 Seagulls would attack the puffins,

769
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,920
 because seagulls had been living in this area

770
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,800
 long before the puffins came back.

771
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,520
 So he tried a few different things.

772
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,160
 He attracted turns, which are like bigger than puffins,

773
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,600
 but smaller than gulls, and they'll kind of attack the gulls

774
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
 to stop them from coming in there.

775
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,680
 And he also had a thing called a death sandwich,

776
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:50,200
 which is where his arc of being the evil puffin thief,

777
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,240
 and then the nice puffin nurse, then at the end,

778
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,600
 he becomes the gull killer,

779
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,320
 because he puts these death sandwiches,

780
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,800
 which is some bread with something called starlicide in,

781
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
 and starlicide is a chemical,

782
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,280
 which is really toxic to starlings and seagulls,

783
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,880
 but not toxic to any other animals.

784
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,560
 He would put those out, which would kill the seagulls.

785
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,000
 - Where's his arc sitting now?

786
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,360
 - I think it's good.

787
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,320
 - If we were doing a fact about gulls, it's not good.

788
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
 - Exactly, but we're not.

789
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,000
 We're doing a fact about puffins.

790
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,600
 - Sorry, my fact this week is that the evil gull killer,

791
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
 Steven Kress, and there are still,

792
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,160
 I think there are still puffiniers,

793
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,840
 as they call themselves, who have to go to the island

794
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,280
 to keep it healthy for the puffins,

795
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,240
 and prevent the gulls from taking root there.

796
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,000
 And they have to smash up their nests,

797
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,320
 and they also, I love this,

798
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,600
 they have a robot mannequin,

799
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,160
 which is dressed in a yellow coat

800
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,320
 and an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask, right?

801
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,600
 And they inflate that.

802
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,680
 I know, it sounds terrifying,

803
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,120
 and they inflate that to try and scare off the gulls.

804
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,560
 It's a scarecrow, basically.

805
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,760
 But the only problem is,

806
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,160
 the gulls will eventually realize this is a motionless,

807
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,120
 it's not an effective, scary thing,

808
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,640
 'cause it just sits there, it doesn't do anything.

809
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,560
 So sometimes what the puffiniers will have to do is,

810
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,040
 they will have to dress up,

811
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,600
 they have to put on the yellow coat and the mask,

812
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,880
 and then go around shooting gulls on the island

813
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,040
 to prove that it's a dangerous thing,

814
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,320
 so the gulls realize what they're doing.

815
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,280
 - I just can't help thinking,

816
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,640
 what if Arnold Schwarzenegger books

817
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,080
 a nice relaxing break, and the gulls don't know if it happens?

818
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,000
 - The island's off the coast of Maine, lovely.

819
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,840
 - Jesus.

820
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,680
 - I know.

821
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,520
 - That's bad.

822
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,000
 - But that's what it takes to, you know,

823
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,400
 get puffins up and running again, I'm all for it.

824
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,480
 - I think there's a lot of gray areas,

825
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,320
 I'm looking after puffins,

826
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
 'cause I was reading about there's some numbers

827
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,920
 that are declining very sadly,

828
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,640
 and there's some concerns that perhaps

829
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,480
 it's the food they're eating,

830
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,320
 they're not getting the right fish,

831
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,480
 the fish are getting smaller,

832
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,160
 and there's one study where to do this,

833
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,360
 they would put up a massive net to catch a puffin,

834
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,520
 then take all its fish off them to examine the fish.

835
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,120
 Doesn't say whether they gave the fish back.

836
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,560
 - Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

837
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,640
 Their fishing is amazing,

838
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:53,440
 because often they will have sort of depleted the area

839
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,720
 that's closest to an island,

840
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,760
 where they're fishing,

841
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,960
 and so they have to go on these huge journeys

842
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,000
 in order to get the fish,

843
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,080
 to bring back for their starving kids

844
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,880
 who eat like four or five times a day.

845
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,360
 And I watched this footage, it's amazing,

846
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,160
 it was a David Attenborough, Planet Earth,

847
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
 they fly 50 kilometers out to sea,

848
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,680
 50 kilometers, there's a whole group of them

849
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,160
 that just go in one go,

850
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,800
 they dive down into the ocean,

851
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,960
 and they have an amazing swimming ability,

852
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,320
 they can swim for up to a minute holding their breath,

853
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,720
 and they use their wings,

854
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,440
 like we would use our arms if we were doing front crawl,

855
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,480
 as they make their way,

856
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,200
 they can go 40 meters deep,

857
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,840
 they come back up when they caught a fish,

858
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,760
 it's just one fish in most cases in this footage,

859
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,920
 they fly them back 50 kilometers again,

860
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,320
 and then when they get there,

861
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,440
 very similar to the gulls.

862
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,280
 - Oh, the kids don't want to eat it.

863
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,860
 - No, they refuse to eat it.

864
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,440
 - No, I'll have fish yesterday.

865
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
 (laughing)

866
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,160
 - There are birds, which are called optic skewers,

867
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,680
 who are waiting for them as they come back,

868
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,160
 knackered, and they swoop down,

869
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,440
 and they steal the fish off them.

870
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,480
 It's an amazing shot in this Planet Earth documentary,

871
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,360
 because suddenly, one of them gets back,

872
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,920
 because a guy wearing an Arnold Schwarzenegger mask

873
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,480
 is suddenly shooting, say?

874
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,400
 No, that doesn't happen,

875
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,320
 but you're 100 kilometer round trip,

876
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
 and then the skewers come for one fish.

877
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,840
 - Other skewers, they're sort of famously pirate birds,

878
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,680
 aren't they?

879
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,520
 - Exactly.

880
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,360
 - Don't they, I think I might be making this up,

881
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,640
 do they squeeze other birds to make them vomit up

882
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,200
 whatever they've just eaten,

883
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,040
 and then eat them?

884
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:13,880
 - They're definitely villains.

885
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
 - So that might be skewers, yeah.

886
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,920
 - There is a bird that does that, yeah.

887
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,640
 - The thing with skewers, well,

888
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,440
 you pronounce them skewers, skewers, skewers, skewers.

889
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,520
 The puffins can carry more than one fish,

890
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,840
 because they have skewers on their tongue, don't they?

891
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,000
 They have spiky bits on their tongue,

892
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,760
 that they can attach one fish onto each spike,

893
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,120
 and then go down for another one.

894
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,120
 - But if they get attacked,

895
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,640
 that's a skewer's crisis, you know?

896
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,480
 - Brilliant.

897
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,320
 - Oh, lovely, thank you.

898
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,160
 (laughing)

899
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,640
 - But part of the reason they're so good at swimming

900
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,280
 is their bones are dense, and other birds,

901
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,440
 they find it easy to swim,

902
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,200
 but they can find it harder to fly.

903
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,600
 So did you read about these puffin patrols,

904
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,440
 they have in Iceland.

905
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,280
 These are definitely good guys,

906
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,520
 not a gray area for these ones.

907
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,120
 So basically when the little pufflings, the baby ones,

908
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,040
 they use the moon to navigate,

909
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,320
 but the streetlights come through them off,

910
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,240
 so they sort of crash land in the town.

911
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,520
 And so the whole town is basically united

912
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,640
 to like save these pufflings.

913
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,560
 They go out on patrol, they try and find them,

914
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,800
 and if you find a puffling, like you have to look after it,

915
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,920
 so they'll like take them to the cliff,

916
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,960
 and then they either will hot it down

917
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
 so it can like trot along and catch the breeze,

918
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,480
 or you just lob it into the air and hope it takes flight.

919
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,800
 - What? - And lob it into the air

920
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
 in the hope? - Yeah, to get,

921
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,360
 'cause they need to get the momentum to get up

922
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,560
 if it throws. - Oh, but you're catching it

923
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,400
 if it doesn't, right?

924
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,240
 It's going off a cliff.

925
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,800
 - What if it sprained its wing?

926
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,840
 - Hopefully you checked that on the way in.

927
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,360
 - I don't know, I don't think these guys sound

928
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:29,080
 like an uncomplicatedly benevolent thought.

929
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
 Why don't they turn their streetlights off?

930
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,480
 That's what a real good guy would do.

931
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,280
 - I feel like the terminal velocity of a puffin

932
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,600
 wouldn't be fast enough that they would die.

933
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,440
 I think they might be all right,

934
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,960
 'cause they're quite small, aren't they?

935
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,800
 - They're really tiny.

936
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,880
 - If it's the babies as well,

937
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,080
 then they'll have a really low terminal velocity.

938
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,240
 - Maybe. - You can survive.

939
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,840
 Like, didn't Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff

940
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
 when he was looking for puffins?

941
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,440
 - The thing about Gordon Ramsay

942
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,800
 is his terminal velocity is famously low, isn't it?

943
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,640
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,040
 - 85 feet, I think it was, he fell off a cliff.

945
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,720
 - I imagine when he falls,

946
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,880
 he's got like lots of flapping skin on his body

947
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,000
 and that kind of, yeah. - Oh, great.

948
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,720
 He turns into one of those gliding parachuters.

949
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,400
 - Flight fox. - Yeah.

950
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,120
 - Sorry, why'd Gordon Ramsay fall off a cliff

951
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,360
 when he was looking for puffins?

952
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,200
 - Do you know what?

953
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,520
 This is a story just in the back of my head.

954
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,960
 I'm gonna connect it to puffins.

955
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,360
 He was doing a documentary

956
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,560
 and he was looking at the various island.

957
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,720
 He was on the side of a cliff

958
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,840
 and they were filming him and he just disappeared.

959
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,880
 Yeah, and he fell down and he survived.

960
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,200
 Yeah. - I don't believe that.

961
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,240
 - It's true. - Is it?

962
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,080
 - Yeah.

963
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,600
 - I think Gordon Ramsay is an honorable guy.

964
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,280
 I don't see why he would lie.

965
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,480
 - Presumably, it's on film.

966
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,720
 - I think they never released the film.

967
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,160
 - Oh, they accidentally turned off the film

968
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,720
 before he fell 80 feet and survived.

969
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,040
 - 85, 85. - 85.

970
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,960
 - What's that, 25 meters.

971
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,680
 Survival, it must have been a big patch of Heather

972
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,760
 he landed on, or whatever it was.

973
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,320
 - It's a big pile of other TV chefs

974
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
 previously fallen down there.

975
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,800
 - Bounced off of Laurel Thompson, fortunately for him.

976
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,520
 There's a thing which a lot of people say about puffins

977
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,040
 which is that they're monogamous.

978
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,120
 You know, they have the same partner every year

979
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,760
 and that's very nice.

980
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,280
 Well, it turns out, I think it is actually true

981
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,400
 'cause a load of birds, it's not true.

982
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,240
 And they study EPCs, extra pair copulations.

983
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,080
 That's the, do you remember?

984
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,240
 I think we've mentioned this once or twice before.

985
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,800
 But they did a study of Atlantic puffins

986
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,280
 looking at extra pair heritage

987
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,400
 'cause now we've got DNA tests

988
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,400
 we can actually sample species.

989
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,160
 And they are basically monogamous.

990
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,480
 They are-- - Good for them.

991
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,840
 - I know, so you know, no gray areas there.

992
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,680
 It's a nice circle. - No Jerry Springer

993
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,000
 in the-- - No Jerry Springer.

994
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
 Every DNA test comes back.

995
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,400
 Yep, it's all fine, you are a father, great news.

996
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,800
 - My current favorite puffin fact is that

997
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,760
 there is scientists creating sunglasses for puffins.

998
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
 - Okay, why? - Because,

999
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,720
 I don't know how this happened, but they had a puffin

1000
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,280
 and they realized that it's beak lit up under UV light.

1001
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,400
 - Okay. - Oh, you just got there.

1002
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,560
 - But the puffin was no longer alive.

1003
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,800
 So they're not completely sure

1004
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,840
 if it's some sort of the way it decomposes

1005
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,440
 or whether all puffins do this.

1006
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,480
 So to test it, they need to get some alive puffins

1007
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,840
 and try and UV on them.

1008
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,880
 But that could hurt their eyes.

1009
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,600
 They got to design little sunglasses to amuse themselves.

1010
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,800
 They've made them aviators.

1011
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,120
 - Okay, cool. - That's brilliant.

1012
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,240
 - What did they find? - I believe still pending.

1013
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,400
 - Still pending. - You'll find a puffin,

1014
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,080
 give it the sunglasses, shine the light,

1015
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,920
 and then report back.

1016
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,320
 Because their beaks do change a lot, right?

1017
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,600
 There's an outer beak that falls off,

1018
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,360
 the color changes at different seasons.

1019
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,360
 - No, the beak falls off in winter.

1020
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,240
 - And it leaves them with what I found described

1021
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,520
 in one article as a drab gray pecker.

1022
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,200
 (laughing)

1023
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,480
 - My old tinder profile.

1024
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,320
 - That's amazing.

1025
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,440
 - I know, young puffins are just completely gray.

1026
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,120
 They sound so boring.

1027
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,960
 Just gray all the way through.

1028
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,560
 Gray beak, gray everything.

1029
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,400
 - I always thought that was your favorite fact of all time.

1030
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,040
 - It was one of my very, very first facts I ever felt

1031
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,880
 for a QI. - Which one?

1032
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,080
 - That a baby puffin is called a puffling.

1033
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,520
 But now, puffins, you notice they're on everything.

1034
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
 Puffins are everywhere now.

1035
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,080
 So many kids' books about pufflings.

1036
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,520
 And someone I know who works in publishing

1037
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
 used to keep a list of which animals were on trend.

1038
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,680
 So you will have noticed it in me without realizing.

1039
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,880
 So for a while, it was sloths, they were on everything.

1040
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,240
 It was flamingos for a while.

1041
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,560
 Llamas used to have a phase where they were on everything.

1042
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,400
 And I think puffins.

1043
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,520
 - Is it like children's books, do you mean?

1044
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,360
 - Just like in paper chase or on clothing.

1045
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,200
 You could just notice it.

1046
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
 - Mirror cats were massive.

1047
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,480
 - Yeah, certain animals seem to like have their moment.

1048
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,640
 And I'm not quite sure why or how, but they do.

1049
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,560
 - But it's never the disgusting toad worm, is it?

1050
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,400
 It's never like the--

1051
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,080
 - He can be spring 2024, aren't they?

1052
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,160
 - Never the penis worm, is it?

1053
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,800
 - Yes. (laughs)

1054
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,880
 - And do you feel slightly responsible for that?

1055
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,080
 Because I think you're partly responsible

1056
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,880
 for disseminating the adorable puffling fact.

1057
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
 - Because that fact has come out

1058
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,640
 of various different QI iterations over the years.

1059
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,640
 - I did put it in a lot of things.

1060
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,480
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,320
 - Yeah, no, after all,

1062
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,640
 there's tons of puffling stuff up there.

1063
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,160
 And they're super cute, so.

1064
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,760
 You used to get enormous flocks of puffins, didn't you?

1065
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,800
 In the UK as well.

1066
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,240
 So the island of St. Kilda.

1067
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:51,400
 This was two people called Hertha and Don in 1897.

1068
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,880
 And they said that the puffins are in such numbers,

1069
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,400
 the clouds of birds sweep past us

1070
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,000
 and make a sound like a whirlwind.

1071
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,040
 And another one said that it made a great cloud

1072
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,600
 that perceptively interfered with the light of day.

1073
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,040
 And that parasites fell off the birds

1074
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,920
 as they swarmed over us, much to our discomfort and annoyance.

1075
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,680
 So you can imagine there's like millions of these birds

1076
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,160
 just blocking out the sun and flying over you

1077
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,040
 and dropping the ticks on you and stuff.

1078
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,880
 - Yeah, yeah.

1079
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,720
 - It's been incredible.

1080
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,600
 - Very cool.

1081
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,000
 In St. Kilda, there was one man who caught 620 puffins

1082
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,400
 in a single day.

1083
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,560
 - Lesser of them?

1084
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,400
 - Yeah, using a noose, no rod.

1085
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,480
 - No way.

1086
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,480
 Sorry to jump in on you there.

1087
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,320
 - No, no.

1088
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,160
 - I didn't expect it was gonna be that.

1089
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,000
 Wow.

1090
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:35,840
 - Yeah, pretty much a Lesser.

1091
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,680
 That's what they used to use.

1092
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,560
 Sort of like fishing rods, but with a better rope on the end.

1093
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,360
 - That's what this cat lady was using in the second one.

1094
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,200
 - Oh yeah.

1095
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1096
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:43,880
 Wow.

1097
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,720
 - That's very cool.

1098
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,560
 - That's amazing.

1099
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,160
 - There are some places where the puffins are eaten,

1100
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,000
 aren't there?

1101
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,840
 - Iceland.

1102
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,000
 - Yeah, Faroe Islands.

1103
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,320
 - Yeah.

1104
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,280
 Am I allowed to say I've eaten them in Iceland?

1105
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,120
 - Have you?

1106
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:54,960
 - Have you?

1107
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,800
 - What did it taste like?

1108
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,040
 - It was a long time ago.

1109
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,160
 - Oh, it was the 80s.

1110
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1111
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,200
 - Not that long ago.

1112
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,760
 - What did it taste like?

1113
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,560
 - To me, I thought it just tasted like fishy, oily,

1114
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,160
 not chicken, but like...

1115
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,200
 - More like fish than like me.

1116
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,960
 - Quail-y kind of stuff.

1117
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,080
 Like, game-y, fishy, chicken.

1118
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,720
 - It's a gray area.

1119
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,320
 (laughing)

1120
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,680
 - Why is that gray area?

1121
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,440
 - No, I guess everything we're saying about the puffins

1122
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,520
 is sort of like, you know,

1123
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,760
 you've got to kill them to save them.

1124
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,600
 - How's that being,

1125
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,360
 they're much more endangered than they used to be.

1126
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,200
 - Yeah, yeah.

1127
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,040
 - So you have to...

1128
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,880
 - Certainly back in the day

1129
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,720
 when I was eating puffin that one time,

1130
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,960
 they were all over them.

1131
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,400
 You couldn't move in recubes.

1132
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,600
 - You were on some kill though, weren't you?

1133
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,840
 And the skies were thick with them.

1134
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,440
 You were actually doing them all the favor, yeah, yeah.

1135
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,360
 - I was so hoping that when you were grasping

1136
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,200
 for what they tasted like,

1137
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,920
 you're gonna be like, "No, a bit like panda."

1138
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,240
 (laughing)

1139
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,240
 - Like a cacopo taste to them.

1140
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,080
 - Yeah, but that's,

1141
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,120
 I mean, lots of places eat.

1142
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:48,960
 People eat meat,

1143
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
 and people eat the meats that are close to them.

1144
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,240
 - Exactly, yeah, yeah.

1145
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,680
 - But if a particular meat is endangered,

1146
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,520
 then you'd change.

1147
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,560
 - Exactly, there was a whale on the menu,

1148
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,400
 which I didn't eat.

1149
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,240
 - Wow.

1150
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,840
 - Does that help my archetyle?

1151
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,680
 - Exhilarated, yeah.

1152
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,260
 (upbeat music)

1153
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:08,280
 - Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show,

1154
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,160
 and that is Andy.

1155
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,560
 - My fact is that trash talk works better

1156
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,800
 on dance players than shot putters.

1157
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,560
 - Ah, call that a fact.

1158
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,400
 - There you go.

1159
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,240
 It begins.

1160
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,080
 It begins.

1161
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,400
 I should have known when I picked this fact.

1162
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,240
 Idiot.

1163
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,840
 (laughing)

1164
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,680
 - That's brilliant.

1165
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:28,400
 - Yeah, it's just a study of trash talk basically.

1166
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,400
 - Why would that be true?

1167
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,320
 - Well, this comes from a piece in The Economist,

1168
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,640
 and it's all about sledging and,

1169
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,600
 which is cricket-based trash talk.

1170
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
 And, you know, sporting insults, basically.

1171
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,360
 You dish out to people you're in a competition against.

1172
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,800
 And it found that there have been studies conducted

1173
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,040
 which have found that trash talk is especially effective

1174
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,920
 at distracting players if you're in a sport

1175
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,080
 that needs fine motor skills or creativity,

1176
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,600
 rather than brute-strength exhibitions.

1177
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,080
 So sports where you need to concentrate

1178
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,160
 are much more vulnerable,

1179
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,440
 which is why maybe cricket is vulnerable to lots of trash talk.

1180
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,440
 Chess, you don't see a lot of smack talk in chess.

1181
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,280
 Yeah.

1182
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,080
 But you do, you get loads and, I mean, it's weird

1183
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,680
 'cause lots of sports have different tolerances of it.

1184
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:13,400
 You know, so cricket has loads of it.

1185
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,920
 Boxing has loads of it, although-

1186
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,760
 - Yeah, boxing is tough.

1187
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,720
 - It doesn't, you shouldn't need to do any trash talk

1188
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,200
 'cause you're trying to hit someone hard anyway.

1189
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,040
 - No, it's psychological.

1190
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,880
 The whole thing is a psychological warfare, right?

1191
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,320
 - And it's very skillful sport boxing, I would say.

1192
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,160
 - Is it?

1193
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,000
 - Yeah.

1194
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,840
 - I just thought you'd baster the other bloke, didn't you?

1195
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,600
 - Well, that's one way of doing it.

1196
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,120
 Whatever, if you're a really good boxer,

1197
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:31,960
 it's all about movement.

1198
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,800
 - Is this why my boxing career didn't...

1199
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,040
 (laughing)

1200
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,360
 Saw like a puppet.

1201
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,640
 (laughing)

1202
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,960
 - I thought you'd like a giant potato.

1203
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,040
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1204
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,880
 Oh, no.

1205
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,480
 - Yeah, no, that's a really good point.

1206
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,760
 In chess, I guess there is a lot of psychological stuff

1207
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,440
 goes on, but it's not necessarily-

1208
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,280
 - It's not normally-

1209
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,120
 - Your shit.

1210
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,960
 - Your shit.

1211
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,800
 - Yeah, your shit.

1212
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,640
 (laughing)

1213
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,880
 - In basketball, it's a big thing.

1214
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,960
 And I grew up watching basketball,

1215
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,640
 so you would always see it happening.

1216
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,000
 It's amazing when you see it happening,

1217
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,840
 trash talking between the sort of top players in the league.

1218
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,680
 So-

1219
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:02,520
 - Are they better at it?

1220
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,720
 - No, they're sort of, it's just interesting watching them,

1221
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,040
 'cause they're all on mic, right?

1222
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,760
 Basically, no, no, you can hear it,

1223
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,360
 like you can hear it through the mics of the studio.

1224
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,680
 It comes through, you know.

1225
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,080
 - So they hear them saying like, oh.

1226
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,120
 - Yeah, exactly, you hear things.

1227
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,320
 So like, yeah, well, Shaquille O'Neal was up against,

1228
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,240
 so Shaquille O'Neal, one of the all-time greats

1229
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,640
 of basketball against Kobe Bryant,

1230
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,960
 who was also one of the other.

1231
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,320
 And he was overheard saying,

1232
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,640
 "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes,"

1233
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,680
 as he was about to dunk on him, right?

1234
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,520
 Like, they say-

1235
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,240
 - What does that mean, dunk on him?

1236
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,680
 - Dunk on him, that's disgusting.

1237
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,880
 - Dunking is when you bring the ball into the ring

1238
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,440
 and you hold the ring, kind of thing.

1239
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,840
 - Why is he tasting his ass when he does that?

1240
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,200
 - Because he's going so high that the face of Kobe

1241
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,320
 would be, yeah, and then there's this thing in basketball

1242
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,440
 where then you make someone taste your ass after you've-

1243
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,280
 - Got it, okay.

1244
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,120
 - Yeah, that's a good point.

1245
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,880
 - Every day's a school day.

1246
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,360
 - In off the rim, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1247
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,920
 (all laughing)

1248
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,160
 - And one thing they did with this research

1249
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,640
 you're talking about is they sat people at computers

1250
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,080
 and you had to move a slider to a particular spot

1251
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,400
 and see how many you could do in two minutes.

1252
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,320
 And as you did it, a little message would come up

1253
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,800
 on your screen, supposedly from one of the other people

1254
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,200
 doing the experiment.

1255
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,960
 And it would either say, "I'm smarter and faster than you,"

1256
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:17,240
 or, "Let's see what happens."

1257
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,080
 - Hi, friend.

1258
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
 (all laughing)

1259
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,240
 - And they found, actually, that people

1260
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,160
 who got the negative messages performed better

1261
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,600
 overall in that one.

1262
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,560
 - I think this could spur you on.

1263
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,320
 You think I'm gonna lose, well, I'll just show you.

1264
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,160
 - Yeah, absolutely.

1265
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,920
 And that's what seemed to have happened in that one.

1266
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,840
 But then they tried it in a task

1267
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,640
 which was slightly more skill-creative-based

1268
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,720
 and they found that people did worse

1269
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,040
 and they were more likely to cheat.

1270
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:41,880
 - Oh, yeah.

1271
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,520
 - 'Cause you turns it dirty, so you're like, "Well."

1272
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,080
 - Yeah, yeah.

1273
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,160
 - I think one of them might have been the study

1274
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,840
 by Karen McDermott, who was looking into this

1275
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,400
 from the University of Connecticut.

1276
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,800
 And that involved people playing Mario Kart.

1277
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,080
 And before the game, some of the people were insulted

1278
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,680
 with various things like, "Grab a straw because you suck."

1279
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,520
 - Brilliant.

1280
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,360
 - And so on.

1281
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,480
 Yeah, I think she had to pick quite carefully

1282
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,320
 because a lot of insults might be the, you know,

1283
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,480
 homophobic, or racist, or sexist, or whatever.

1284
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:13,960
 So she had to pick a carefully delineated selection

1285
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,040
 of insults, which were cruel enough to sting,

1286
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,140
 "Grab a straw because you suck," being one of them.

1287
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,240
 And the insulted players performed worse.

1288
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,840
 And they also rated themselves higher

1289
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,960
 as having experienced anger and shame.

1290
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:26,800
 - Oh, no.

1291
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,800
 - Yeah.

1292
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,880
 - But were they playing Rainbow Road?

1293
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,000
 - If you're playing Rainbow Road,

1294
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,200
 you always experience deep, deep shame

1295
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,960
 and frustration and rage.

1296
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,360
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,120
 So, yeah, but does it make you play better or worse?

1298
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,760
 There seem to be slightly conflicting studies

1299
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,600
 on whether or not--

1300
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,440
 - I read a lot of different ones.

1301
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,280
 - Yeah.

1302
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,120
 - And that's similar to what you were saying.

1303
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:44,440
 I also read, which just thought was a lovely point,

1304
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,280
 that in a university study, you've got a university ethics code.

1305
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,700
 So what you can sledge someone with

1306
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,220
 is kind of very different to what you can have

1307
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,700
 like a whole stadium chanting at you

1308
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:52,540
 in a basketball game.

1309
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,360
 (laughing)

1310
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,200
 - Yeah.

1311
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,140
 - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1312
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,380
 I also like the weird social side of trash talking

1313
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,060
 as well within professional sports,

1314
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,020
 which is let's say a younger player

1315
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,540
 if trying to trash talk and create a relationship

1316
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,980
 of conflict, which would then be on the cameras.

1317
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,740
 And it's a way of social climbing.

1318
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,700
 So like, Michael Jordan, for example,

1319
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,180
 would never trash talk whenever he was having it

1320
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:16,420
 talk to him by like a rookie from a new team.

1321
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,560
 'Cause he thinks, I'll let my game do the talking

1322
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,720
 and I don't want, I will make you famous

1323
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,020
 by trash talking with you.

1324
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:23,080
 So let's not get that.

1325
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,920
 - It's not worth it.

1326
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:27,840
 - I think it's worth us saying, off menu as shit.

1327
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,000
 - Yeah, um, Chris and Rosie Ramsey.

1328
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,840
 - Oh, Wankers.

1329
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,660
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1330
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,720
 - How the hell, fuck you.

1331
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,560
 - Yeah, yeah.

1332
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,920
 - There's no point saying, you know,

1333
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,320
 John's podcast about nothing.

1334
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,080
 - John's podcast about nothing is good, James.

1335
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,280
 I stand by, I've been listening.

1336
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,640
 I get all my facts from John's podcast about nothing.

1337
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,440
 (laughing)

1338
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,740
 - Shout out to John.

1339
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:47,580
 - Hello, John.

1340
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,820
 (laughing)

1341
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:55,060
 - One of my favorite sledges that I read

1342
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,620
 was not so much a sledge, but as an AFL player

1343
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,860
 called Stevie Baker and apparently during a game

1344
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,220
 he leaned over to someone and said,

1345
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,680
 "Have you got a sausage dog?"

1346
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,380
 (laughing)

1347
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,660
 And they spent the next 20 minutes just being like,

1348
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,140
 "What, what, what?"

1349
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:08,980
 And they couldn't play.

1350
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,140
 It was the worst insult they've heard.

1351
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,980
 - What is it?

1352
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:11,820
 I'm sorry.

1353
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,640
 - It turned out that Baker has a sausage dog.

1354
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,480
 He was just like.

1355
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,300
 - I'm just making chat.

1356
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,360
 (laughing)

1357
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,680
 This guy was like, he couldn't focus on the game.

1358
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,700
 He's like, "What's he saying?

1359
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,540
 "Why does he..."

1360
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,320
 - Yeah, I mean, I mean, well, it baffled me.

1361
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,820
 Like, I've heard the phrase sausage dog before.

1362
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,600
 I know what that is, but because it was at a sporting match

1363
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,440
 I was thinking of a hot dog.

1364
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,280
 - Yeah.

1365
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,120
 - And we're like, "What's a sausage dog?

1366
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:28,960
 "A hot dog is a sausage.

1367
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,800
 "What are you talking about?"

1368
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,060
 - This is where I should swoop in and out fact you,

1369
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:31,900
 but I...

1370
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,180
 (laughing)

1371
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,720
 - It's all about distraction, isn't it, really?

1372
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,040
 - I found this with you.

1373
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,560
 - This reminds me, this isn't a fact,

1374
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:39,560
 but do you ever watch that episode of Cheers

1375
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,440
 when there was like a basketball player

1376
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
 and he couldn't miss and he was amazing

1377
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,860
 and he was winning the whole season?

1378
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,820
 And then he went to the bar and started talking about trivia

1379
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,940
 with two of the barflies, Norm and whoever else it was.

1380
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,700
 And they asked him how many rivets there were

1381
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:57,900
 in the basketball stadium.

1382
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,500
 And he just, all he could think about for the rest

1383
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,260
 of his career was counting these rivets.

1384
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,020
 And all he would do was walk around counting

1385
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,060
 and he just couldn't play anymore

1386
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:05,900
 'cause he was so discreet.

1387
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,500
 - That happened to me in an exam once.

1388
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,340
 - What?

1389
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,780
 - I was in an exam and people would always write on,

1390
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,080
 and he's like, "Rickety old desk,

1391
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,200
 "you only told them at exam time."

1392
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,000
 And they would say like, "I heart so and so,"

1393
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,460
 or that, "Maths is rubbish."

1394
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:17,820
 (laughing)

1395
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:18,660
 And I was saying it once.

1396
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,680
 - You went to school in an episode of The Beano,

1397
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,520
 didn't you?

1398
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:22,360
 - Yeah, yeah.

1399
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,400
 - I grew up in Dundee, yeah.

1400
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,240
 - Oh, yeah, so you did?

1401
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,500
 (laughing)

1402
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,400
 - So, but I was sitting in my seat in my exam

1403
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,880
 and on my desk, someone had written,

1404
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,960
 "There were 32 black lines on the ceiling."

1405
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,760
 And so I look up and there are black lines

1406
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,800
 really close together, never seen them before.

1407
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,720
 So of course I had to count them and I lost count.

1408
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,020
 - So I'd start again.

1409
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,380
 - Wow, do you think that might have been written

1410
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,820
 by a crafty teacher trying to smoke out

1411
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,660
 easily distracted children?

1412
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,780
 - I think it was one person in your class

1413
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,340
 who wrote it on all the other desks apart from their own.

1414
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,700
 I mean, they would be top of the class.

1415
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:55,620
 - Yeah, it's good waiting.

1416
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,820
 I'd forgotten that until now,

1417
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,380
 but I can remember trying to count them.

1418
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,580
 - How did your exam, you'll have still passed, I guess.

1419
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,000
 - I play very badly, I don't remember.

1420
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,580
 - That's so funny.

1421
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,060
 I was looking 'cause you were talking about

1422
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,420
 darts and shop putting, some trash talking in those spots.

1423
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,920
 And of course, we can't not talk about Gary Anderson

1424
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,240
 and Wesley Harms.

1425
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,320
 - Of course we can't, thank God.

1426
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:21,320
 - The amazing match when Harms, who lost 10-2,

1427
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,200
 did an interview and said there was a frequent smell

1428
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,200
 that came from his opponent.

1429
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,960
 And he said, "It'll take me two nights

1430
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,120
 to lose the smell from my nose."

1431
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:30,960
 - Wow.

1432
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,800
 - And he claimed that Gary Anderson

1433
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,360
 had been farting throughout the match to put him off.

1434
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,400
 And then obviously they interview the loser first

1435
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,640
 and then they interview the winner

1436
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,020
 and they interviewed Gary Anderson

1437
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,640
 and said, "Why were you farting the whole time?"

1438
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,560
 And he said, "There was definitely a smell,

1439
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,600
 but it was 1,010%, not me.

1440
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,460
 It was definitely the other guy."

1441
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,560
 And Anderson said, "You can put your finger up my arse.

1442
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,360
 There'll be no smell there."

1443
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,200
 - What?

1444
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,040
 - What?

1445
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,300
 - What is it with this sportsman?

1446
00:52:58,300 --> 00:52:59,940
 - Yeah.

1447
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,460
 - Okay, I mean, I believe the first guy,

1448
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:03,240
 'cause that's a very high percentage, so.

1449
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,860
 (all laughing)

1450
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,100
 - Do we have trash talk at QI?

1451
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,940
 - No.

1452
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,780
 - What do you mean?

1453
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,420
 - I just, so there was a study of Fortune 500 companies

1454
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,660
 and like, can you remember people being slagged off

1455
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:16,220
 in that kind of gamesmanship way in the office?

1456
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,580
 61% of employees found they could remember trash talk

1457
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,840
 within the last few months.

1458
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,680
 - Yeah.

1459
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,040
 - And I don't think we do sledging here, really.

1460
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,320
 - I've got nine years worth of--

1461
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,920
 (all laughing)

1462
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,020
 - And unfortunately for you guys, it's on record.

1463
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,860
 (all laughing)

1464
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,680
 - Cue the clip.

1465
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,520
 - Yeah.

1466
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,140
 - 'Cause this podcast, the whole HR exercise.

1467
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,940
 - One day you guys are gonna be called into an office, yeah.

1468
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,140
 One place where you get smacked talk famously is wrestling.

1469
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,360
 - Yeah.

1470
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,440
 - And I was reading the book,

1471
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,000
 it's called Everything to Play For,

1472
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,880
 the QI Book of Sport by James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski.

1473
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,720
 - Oh my goodness.

1474
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,940
 - Sounds a lot of sounds.

1475
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,060
 - Well, I don't know, it doesn't come out until October,

1476
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,960
 so I don't know if it's rubbish or not,

1477
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,980
 but I suspect, the big names I suspect it'll be quite good.

1478
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:58,140
 - It's gonna be a fair hearing, eh?

1479
00:53:58,140 --> 00:53:59,600
 - But they argue in that book

1480
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,860
 (all laughing)

1481
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,660
 that the earliest depictions of wrestling that we have,

1482
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,520
 which are in the Egyptian tombs,

1483
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,160
 they're quite similar to today's pro wrestling.

1484
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,960
 So there's an argument that it could be

1485
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,840
 that all the games were fixed

1486
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,600
 because they were often shown as being one person

1487
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,240
 from Egypt, clearly,

1488
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,860
 and one person from a place that isn't Egypt, clearly,

1489
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,680
 and the Egyptian one always won.

1490
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,600
 And perhaps it was that they were fixed fights

1491
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,280
 so that the pharaoh would know

1492
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,680
 that his people were the greatest in the whole world.

1493
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,840
 - Who's saying ancient Egyptian pro wrestling is fake?

1494
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,000
 - That's what I'm saying.

1495
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,440
 Sorry, no, that's what James Harkin and Anna Tyshinski

1496
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,720
 are saying in that book,

1497
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:39,320
 everything to play for the QI book of spot out in October.

1498
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,640
 But the other thing is that there's a really early one

1499
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,000
 and there is some writing next to it.

1500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,480
 And it's an Egyptian who defeated a Nubian opponent

1501
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:50,400
 and he says, "Woe to you, O Nubian enemy,

1502
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,840
 "I will make you take a hopeless fall

1503
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,880
 "in the presence of the pharaoh."

1504
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,880
 And so that's basically smack talk from 3,200 years ago.

1505
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:02,720
 - Tell me the flavor that you find in my ass.

1506
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,960
 (laughing)

1507
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:13,640
 - Okay, that's it, that is all of our facts.

1508
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,960
