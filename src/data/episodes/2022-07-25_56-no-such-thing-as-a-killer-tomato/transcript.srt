00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,540
 Do you know what it would look like?

 [Music]

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,720
 Hello, and welcome to another episode.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,460
 A no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covert Garden.

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,760
 My name is Dan Schreiber.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,100
 I'm sitting here with Anna Chizinski, James Harkin, and Andy Murray.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,740
 But once again, we have gathered around the microphone with our four favorite facts from the last seven days.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,900
 And in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,580
 Starting with you, Chizinski.

12
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,220
 Yeah, my fact is that for 200 years, after tomatoes made it to England,

13
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,220
 they were grown almost entirely for ornamental reasons.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,580
 Because they didn't want to eat them.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,000
 They were just waiting for them to be ripe.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,700
 [Laughter]

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,380
 It's still red. Wait for it to be green.

18
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,100
 [Laughter]

19
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,860
 I think the first tomatoes that were brought over were yellow.

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,020
 And that's why they're called Pomodore in Italian, I think.

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,300
 It's like yellow apples or something.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,020
 Anyway, yeah, people thought they were poisonous.

23
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,420
 And this was for, well, there are a number of explanations for why people thought that.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,060
 I think the most likely one is that they were botanically identified as belonging to the night-shade family.

25
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,500
 And people knew that other members of the night-shade family, deadly night-shade, were poisonous.

26
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,780
 So they were botanically advanced enough to work out what family tomatoes belonged to.

27
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,980
 But not botanically advanced enough to say these things are obviously harmless so you can eat them.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,260
 So there's another theory that they were actually poisoning people, isn't there?

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,580
 And the idea behind that is that they had puter plates which contains lead.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,540
 And the tomatoes have acid in them.

31
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,660
 And the acid would release the lead out of the puter plates and would give people lead poisoning.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,620
 So that was one theory.

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,580
 Yes. Although I think puter plates may need belonged to wealthy people.

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,300
 But yeah, I reckon if they thought they were part of the night-shade family,

35
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,500
 there may be a few rich people got ill from that, that would have meant.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,340
 Can I say my favourite theory?

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,260
 Go on.

38
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,260
 [Laughter]

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,100
 No, no, this was a big one during the day.

40
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,980
 They thought someone noticed, I believe it was Ralph Walder Emerson, in fact, noticed that there was a worm that was going into his tomato.

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,220
 And he thought that it was the worm that was poisonous, that it was poisoning the actual tomato.

42
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,820
 And so there was a green tomato worm, wasn't it?

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,060
 Yes, exactly.

44
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,900
 And it's just great because a bit of hysteria was created out of people thinking that it was this thing.

45
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,460
 There's someone who described it as poisonous as a rattlesnake.

46
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,540
 They were saying, you know, stay away from this thing.

47
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,300
 And there's a wonderful quote.

48
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,660
 Dr. Fuller said that there is a new enemy to human existence.

49
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
 [Laughter]

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:31,380
 And then he said that if you were bitten, that you would die, and then someone else pointed out that wouldn't hurt a flea.

51
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,500
 So it wasn't actually as dangerous.

52
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,900
 But for a while they thought it was this worm, which is pretty cool.

53
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,740
 Yeah, I think tomatoes were just starting to get over their bad reputation, and suddenly these worms were opt-up.

54
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,540
 And there was such hysteria, there's this story that's told that's so brilliant.

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,020
 And there's no first hand record of it, but it was reported in newspapers in the 19th century.

56
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,500
 And it's that it was in Salem.

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,660
 It was at the Old County Courthouse in Salem.

58
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,580
 It was 1820, and this guy called Colonel Johnson had decided it was getting ridiculous that everyone thought tomatoes were poisonous.

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,860
 And he was going to prove to people that they weren't.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,620
 And so he stood on the steps of Salem Courthouse, and he ate this whole bowl of tomatoes in front of this huge crowd.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:17,060
 And the witness reports, apparently, according to newspapers, the reporter later said that women were screaming and fainting as they watched him do what they thought was suicide in public.

62
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,980
 Do you know what the Latin name for tomatoes is?

63
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,580
 It's lycopersicon, which means wolf peach.

64
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,420
 How cool is that?

65
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,660
 Why, do we know why?

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,820
 No, well, I don't.

67
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,660
 Maybe it's because when they go moldy, they get a grave fur.

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,940
 Yes, and they also start hunting in packs.

69
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,540
 And a few of them can bring down a fully grown moose.

70
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,700
 It's actually no wonder people were so afraid of them for so long.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,700
 Well, there was the attack of the killer tomatoes movie, wasn't there?

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,060
 Was that factual documentary, yes?

73
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,500
 The return of the killer tomatoes was George Clooney's first movie, or first movie.

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,580
 He'd been in a few things before, but that was his first main break.

75
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,940
 Wow, well done, George.

76
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,860
 And the first attack of the killer tomatoes, there was a helicopter crash, which is in there at the start, and it was a real crash.

77
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,620
 And it was a rented helicopter, and it went down.

78
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,380
 Fortunately, no one was killed, but the crash cost them $60,000,

79
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,100
 which used up more of the budget than all of the aspects of the film combined.

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,980
 Wow, at least they got the footage.

81
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,820
 Did you guys know that George Clooney, 10 years, exactly 10 years before he started being the star of ER,

82
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,700
 was the star of a hospital drama called ER, with dots after the ER.

83
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,460
 Really, yeah.

84
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,180
 Watch, yeah.

85
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,740
 Just kind of feel like there was some kind of admin mixup, doesn't it?

86
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,580
 It really does.

87
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,900
 They've just got the cast list and got the wrong cast list, the old one, it's like ER.

88
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,820
 Yeah, yeah, if someone Robert De Niro was meant to get the part in the ER.

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,140
 I have a new story, which I also wanted to share with you.

90
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,740
 This is from 2013, from the BBC.

91
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,300
 A man caught with a prostitute in his car, told police she was there to show him where to buy tomatoes.

92
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,700
 Is that you for business?

93
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,620
 This is in the West Midlands, and...

94
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,940
 I could have told him where to get tomatoes in the West Midlands.

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,420
 Where?

96
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,540
 There's a nice big Morrison's in Wolverhampton.

97
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,140
 Yeah, well, he could have saved 20 quid and a Â£400 fine from Walsall magistrate's court.

98
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,860
 Walsall, yeah, I don't know that as well.

99
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,140
 Police reaction was amazing.

100
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,940
 PC, one of the police from Walsall police, said, "I've heard some excuses before,

101
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,740
 but in the 10 years I've been a police officer, I've never heard a curve call a covering up his crimes

102
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,660
 by claiming to be buying tomatoes.

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,300
 Our officers in the court saw through his lies."

104
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,780
 [laughter]

105
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,340
 Well done, Scooby, that's another crime soul.

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,540
 I've, over the last two years, developed a new taste for tomato juice on planes.

107
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,900
 It is supposed to taste better.

108
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,780
 Yeah, then, like, other things that you would try on the airplanes would taste worse,

109
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,540
 but actually tomato juice, like Bloody Marys and stuff, are supposed to be still okay.

110
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,540
 Yeah, why is that?

111
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,740
 Well, your taste buds obviously go down.

112
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,220
 So, tomato juice, because of the thickness, kind of, and for other reasons,

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,220
 I'm sure, retains the full taste.

114
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,740
 Okay.

115
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,140
 But, they did a massive test of it in a simulation where they had passengers come on

116
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,380
 to a simulated flight to see if they...

117
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,740
 That wouldn't work, really, because surely it's the altitude that makes a difference.

118
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
 Yes, exactly.

119
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,860
 So, actually, the whole study brought no conclusion results.

120
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,860
 [laughter]

121
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,900
 But the reasonings, they asked all the passengers, "Why did you go for it?"

122
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:26,740
 And one of the main results, which is exactly what I did, is that you see the person ahead of

123
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,380
 you, or two people ahead of you going, "Tomato juice," and you go, "Oh, I might have a tomato juice."

124
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,140
 And that was genuinely one of the main results that they got from the thing.

125
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:38,340
 So, they think that it just happens that the people in the front row tend to order tomato juice.

126
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,140
 Someone orders it, and it spills down.

127
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,340
 But surely we have to work out why that first person always order tomato juice.

128
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,740
 Because they were at the back of a previous flight where someone offered them tomato juice.

129
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
 So, one person once happened to order tomato juice, and since then it's been a constant dominant attack.

130
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,140
 Well, sometimes the trolley comes from behind you on a plane.

131
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,140
 Oh, you're talking about an economy, right?

132
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,140
 I didn't know they had trolleys back then.

133
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,940
 [laughter]

134
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,540
 Another theory about the tomato juice thing is that I can't believe this,

135
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,540
 but is that the noise of the plane affects how you perceive flavor.

136
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
 [laughter]

137
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
 Wow.

138
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,540
 But you've genuinely experienced the tomato juice thing.

139
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
 On planes, it's my main topic of conversation.

140
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,540
 If there's someone I don't know next to me, I'm like, "God."

141
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,540
 Yeah, so I'm with the tomato juice already.

142
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,540
 And they're going, "Excuse me, are there any spare seats?"

143
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
 [laughter]

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
 "I don't mind going back to economy."

145
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
 Tomatoes.

146
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
 Are they a fruit or a vegetable?

147
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
 They are a fruit.

148
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
 They are, so botanically they are a fruit.

149
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,540
 But legally, they are a vegetable.

150
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,540
 And that was a precedent set in 1887,

151
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,540
 because some guy called John Nix was trying to import a bunch of tomatoes.

152
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
 And he was saying, "These are botanically a fruit,

153
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,540
 and so I shouldn't have to pay the vegetable tariff on them,

154
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,540
 because they wasn't the same tariff for fruits."

155
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
 And the court decided that they wanted him to pay that tariff,

156
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
 so they declared that tomatoes are a vegetable and he had to pay up.

157
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
 And that's it.

158
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
 The judge said, in the common language of the people,

159
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,540
 whether sellers or consumers of provisions,

160
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,540
 all these are vegetable, which are grown in kitchen gardens,

161
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,540
 and which, whether eaten cold or raw are,

162
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,540
 like potatoes, carrots, past nips, turnips,

163
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,540
 beets, cauliflower, cabbage celery and lettuce,

164
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:15,540
 usually served in, with or after the soup, fish, or meats,

165
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,540
 which constitute the principal part of the repaste,

166
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,540
 and not like fruits generally as a dessert.

167
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,540
 And I must have it.

168
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,540
 I didn't realise how long that was going to be.

169
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,540
 I can't help thinking that guy got turned down,

170
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,540
 and his job was a chef, and went on.

171
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,540
 So other things that were not used for eating originally,

172
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,540
 the Romans didn't really eat butter.

173
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
 They did have it, but they didn't really eat it.

174
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
 What did they do with it?

175
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
 They would rub it on themselves,

176
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,540
 if they had a burn, for instance.

177
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,540
 They would use it for medical reasons.

178
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,540
 The Germans had it, and they did kind of eat it more,

179
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
 but they didn't eat it all the time.

180
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,540
 They used it for her dressing.

181
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,540
 And Herodotus says that the Thracians ate it,

182
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,540
 but the Greeks thought that they were weird for eating it.

183
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
 So back in the old days, how did they have the butter?

184
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,540
 Did it happen with the first Roman who got a burn on his lips?

185
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
 Put it on there.

186
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,540
 Well, this is delicious.

187
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
 When a second.

188
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,540
 Oh, when they burned no toast, presumably.

189
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
 Okay, time for fact number two.

190
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,540
 And that's my fact.

191
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,540
 My fact this week is that NASA is planning on giving the moon a moon,

192
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,540
 which is very excited.

193
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,540
 Explain yourself.

194
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,540
 So basically, NASA is going to...

195
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,540
 It's quite an ambitious idea, and in theory...

196
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
 No kidding.

197
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,540
 But they are going for it, so it's not...

198
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
 You know, it is NASA.

199
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,540
 It's not like some college kids.

200
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
 They've got it planned for us.

201
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
 Is it going to be a smaller moon than the current size moon?

202
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,540
 Yes.

203
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,540
 Yeah, yeah.

204
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,540
 So the idea is that in 2020, they're going to launch a probe

205
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
 that's going to go to a passing asteroid.

206
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,540
 They're going to land on the asteroid and less sue around it

207
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,540
 or using a kind of napsat bag of a sort of gigantic scale.

208
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,540
 Take a boulder off it, then head back to our moon,

209
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,540
 and then leave that boulder at a point where it can orbit the moon,

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,540
 and then they can mine the asteroid for everything.

211
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,540
 Learn more about what asteroids are made up of and so on.

212
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,540
 It's hugely ambitious, but it's in the slot.

213
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,540
 So I don't think moons can really have moons.

214
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
 Well, our moon can't really.

215
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
 It could have one for a shot amount of time,

216
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,540
 but eventually the orbit would decay.

217
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,540
 And that's because the movement of the Earth and the movement of the Sun

218
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
 would kind of give tidal forces that would kind of decay the orbit.

219
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
 How long do you think they could have it for?

220
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,540
 I think they could have it for a fair amount of time.

221
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
 Good few years, but it wouldn't last forever.

222
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,540
 That's quite cool, though.

223
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,540
 We're going to live in a period where the moon has an orbiting moon.

224
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,540
 But it is weird, like if you look at NASA's schedule for, you know,

225
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
 it's upcoming seasons.

226
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,540
 It does have a few planned projects that you just go,

227
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,540
 have I read in April Fool's page?

228
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,540
 And I check the date this time, and I haven't.

229
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,540
 Because they're doing the planning of going to Venus

230
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,540
 with these balloons that are going to sit and kind of create a little balloon city

231
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,540
 that they can do observations from.

232
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
 It's really weird.

233
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,540
 They're working on a city made out of huge balloons in the clouds of Venus,

234
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
 which will allow astronauts to explore the planet

235
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,540
 without venturing onto the hostile surface.

236
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,540
 That's from a science website.

237
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
 It's amazing.

238
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
 Yeah.

239
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
 I read another one from 2020.

240
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
 This is a mission called the Asteroid Impact Mission.

241
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 And they're going to send a probe up to an asteroid called Didymus.

242
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,540
 And the asteroid Didymus has a moon called Didymune.

243
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,540
 Just like those names.

244
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,540
 The naming conventions are great.

245
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,540
 And they officially encourage you not to name them after your pets.

246
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,540
 But I don't know how strictly the rules are enforced, basically.

247
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
 Oh, you talk about asteroids?

248
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
 Yes.

249
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,540
 Asteroids have actually lots of planetary bodies.

250
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,540
 But they instituted the rule relatively recently.

251
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
 But the first one that came to their attention was they didn't like.

252
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,540
 There's a guy who named an asteroid Spock.

253
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,540
 He named it Mr. Spock.

254
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
 But it wasn't after Mr. Spock.

255
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,540
 It was after his cat, who was called Mr. Spock.

256
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,540
 But you mean the cat was called Mr. Spock after Mr. Spock?

257
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,540
 Yes, but the asteroid was technically being named after a cat.

258
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,540
 That's so good.

259
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,540
 And in the 19th century people would name them after their mistresses and racy things like that.

260
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,540
 And they said, yeah, we don't want that either.

261
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,540
 Well, my mistress was called Mr. Spock.

262
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,540
 That's why I called her anyway.

263
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,540
 Just like with the idea of names being odd.

264
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
 Check out the name for this Venus one.

265
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,540
 It's called the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept.

266
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
 And it's not a very good name.

267
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
 But it actually breaks down into havoc.

268
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,540
 Is that what you want to be naming a serious NASA mission?

269
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
 Exactly.

270
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,540
 Is that a balloon one?

271
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
 Yeah, yeah.

272
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,540
 This is a proposal stage at the moment.

273
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,540
 But it is being proposed by NASA to NASA.

274
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,540
 Well, surely NASA is going to accept it.

275
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,540
 Guys, I think this is a brilliant idea.

276
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,540
 Well, thank you, NASA.

277
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,540
 No problem, NASA.

278
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
 Just the idea of naming something havoc though.

279
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,540
 Yes, we're doing Central High Altitude Operational System, the Project Chaos.

280
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:12,540
 Yeah, or mayhem, well, certain death.

281
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,540
 I found something really nice about just being asteroids

282
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
 and things orbiting each other.

283
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
 Yeah.

284
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
 So you all know that Pluto was downgraded

285
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,540
 from being a planet in 2006 to being a dwarf planet.

286
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
 A dwarf planet.

287
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
 The decision could have gone another way

288
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,540
 because the international astronomical union met up.

289
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,540
 And according to a draft definition of planets,

290
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,540
 its moon, a caron, or a caron, could have been upgraded to being a planet.

291
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
 So then you would try...

292
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,540
 Sharon is just a pretentious, Sharon, isn't it?

293
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,540
 That's be honest.

294
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
 Sorry, it's moon, Sharon.

295
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
 It's moon, Sharon.

296
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,540
 Sharon is someone's named after their mistress, haven't they?

297
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,540
 Yes.

298
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,540
 And Pluto presumably after their pet.

299
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,540
 That must have been a good day's work.

300
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
 And the guys will never work it out.

301
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,540
 But yeah, there would have been a binary pair of planets

302
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
 because they orbit a central gravity,

303
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
 which is outside both of them.

304
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
 It's a point of space between the two of them.

305
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,540
 So they're both constantly orbiting that point.

306
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,540
 There's a great moon that I saw called Mimaz.

307
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:14,540
 And it looks exactly like the Death Star from Star Wars.

308
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,540
 It looks exactly like it.

309
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
 It's so cool.

310
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
 Or it looks like a 3D squeezable boob.

311
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
 That's the other thing it looks like.

312
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,540
 I'm sorry, aren't boobs just 3D squeezable boobs?

313
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,540
 Yeah, no, no.

314
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,540
 Normally you have to specify if a boob is 2D or not squeezable.

315
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,540
 NASA is looking, so it's looking to employ people, I suppose.

316
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,540
 It's looking for people who are willing to stay in bed for 70 days.

317
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,540
 And it'll pay them $18,000.

318
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,540
 But yeah, this is to see what effects long periods of having to stay still.

319
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,540
 Like you often would have to in a spaceship or something has on the body

320
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,540
 and has on a loss of muscle and bone and cardiovascular function.

321
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
 Like hypersleep.

322
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
 It's like hypersleep except you'd be awake and bored.

323
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,540
 But earning good money.

324
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,540
 Well, that's, it's a new thing called terranauts where you can,

325
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,540
 you can have a whole career at NASA as an Earth astronaut, a terranaut.

326
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,540
 So you just hang here and you do all the things that they're prepping astronauts

327
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,540
 to do, including laying in bed.

328
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,540
 I can just see the husband and a party going, "I'm an astronaut."

329
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,540
 And the wife and eggs are going, "You're an Earth astronaut."

330
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
 Terranaut.

331
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
 I looked up a list of things that are on the moon.

332
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
 Yeah, okay.

333
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
 That we have left there.

334
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,540
 Okay, because lots of things have crashed into their over the years.

335
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,540
 It's a huge amount.

336
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
 It's about the weight of a blue whale.

337
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,540
 So golf balls is famously up there?

338
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,540
 Golf balls.

339
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
 There's also a javelin, is there?

340
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
 Yeah.

341
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,540
 When Alan Shepard met his golf shot, his colleague through a,

342
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,540
 it was an improvised javelin.

343
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,540
 It was apparently a star from a solar wind experiment.

344
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,540
 But he threw it as a javelin.

345
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,540
 And I have a theory that it might be the longest javelin throw ever.

346
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,540
 It was made on the moon.

347
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
 When they're a father, it go.

348
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,540
 Well, there isn't data.

349
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,540
 Well, the world's hard of javelins probably just over a hundred meters,

350
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,540
 probably about a hundred and six meters or something like that.

351
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,540
 Yeah.

352
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,540
 But you do need data, Andy.

353
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
 I don't, like, with world records the way it works.

354
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,540
 You have to provide an actual number from what I was saying.

355
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
 I reckon.

356
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
 It's just my pet theory.

357
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,540
 I can't prove it.

358
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
 But I do believe it.

359
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,540
 Also on the moon.

360
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
 There are, they call them defecation collection devices.

361
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
 And there are five of those.

362
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
 And there are five of those.

363
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 That is a javelin.

364
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
 That was a toilet attendant, isn't it?

365
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
 This is a toilet.

366
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
 A puzzle dream on the way back.

367
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
 He's like, "Oh, God, has anyone got too quit?

368
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
 I could leave this to him."

369
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
 That's the terrible thing.

370
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
 They live on tips.

371
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,540
 And there's very little to come by on the moon.

372
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,540
 And there are ten urine bags, which are divided into urine collection assembly small,

373
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,540
 and urine collection assembly large.

374
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,540
 And there are also six bags, which are just called emesis, which actually means vomit.

375
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
 Yeah.

376
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
 But they were too polite to say vomit bags.

377
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
 Wow.

378
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
 Yeah.

379
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,540
 I've read the other day that Buzz Aldrin actually brought a book to the moon.

380
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
 He's got a book.

381
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
 He's got boy.

382
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
 Exactly.

383
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,540
 Well, he's going to be sat on the toilet.

384
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,540
 He's going to be sat on the toilet.

385
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,540
 Yeah, he brought a book to the moon.

386
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
 What was the book?

387
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,540
 There's a biography of a pioneer of rockets.

388
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,540
 So someone who was building rockets.

389
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
 And I can't remember his name, but yeah.

390
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,540
 Speaking of emesis in space, they've been...

391
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,540
 NASA has been developing ways of getting alcohol into space.

392
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540
 Or tentatively.

393
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,540
 Smuggling it up.

394
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
 At the moment, you're not allowed.

395
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
 Yeah, well, at the moment, you're not allowed alcohol in space.

396
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
 The Russians take it up, didn't they?

397
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
 Yes.

398
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
 Do they?

399
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,540
 Secretly, they were bringing up vodka.

400
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,540
 The weird thing is, they only actually took vodka up because it went so well with the tomato

401
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,540
 juice, which just takes so much better in space.

402
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
 It was a John Gladn.

403
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
 I'm not seeing tomato juice.

404
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,540
 Everyone's copied him ever since.

405
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
 Yes, we're going on.

406
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:42,540
 Yeah, so they've developed like a powdered cherry, NASA tried out.

407
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,540
 And they decided to test this out by recreating a zero-gravity test.

408
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,540
 And putting people in the test flight.

409
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,540
 And as soon as the astronauts who in this test flight smell the cherry, they all vomited.

410
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,540
 So they haven't perfected it yet.

411
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,540
 I actually think that the Australians have developed a beer to take to space.

412
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,540
 And so far as I know, it's the only contribution of space that the Aussies have made.

413
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,540
 The Italians are taking a espresso machine up, aren't they?

414
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
 Yeah.

415
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,540
 And the South Koreans came up with a space kimchi.

416
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
 Oh, yeah.

417
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,540
 So like a lot of different countries do their specialism, and I guess Australia's this beer.

418
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,540
 Yeah, America has SpaceX. Australia has 4x.

419
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,540
 Could I just stop you there for a second?

420
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,540

 Back to the podcast.

426
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,540
 Okay, time for fact number three.

427
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
 Andrew Hunter Murray.

428
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,540
 My fact is that the man who played Sherlock Holmes spent the first world war dressed as a tree.

429
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
 Which man?

430
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,540
 What?

431
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,540
 Benedict Cumberbatch.

432
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,540
 No, Benedict Cumberbatch was not as far as I know intimately involved in the first world war.

433
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,540
 You're saying he's a coward?

434
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
 Yes.

435
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
 Sure I have, Dodger.

436
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,540
 And I can say that all I like, because I know that he won't fight me over it.

437
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,540
 This was Basil Rathbone, who was one of the first people to become extremely famous playing Sherlock Holmes.

438
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
 He played him in a lot of films.

439
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:31,540
 Yeah, he's one of those guys who I know about, and I remember his face, but until his name is set out loud,

440
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,540
 if you just said name the Sherlock Holmes guy, I wouldn't be able to name him.

441
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,540
 But he did like 16 movies, 200 radio plays.

442
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,540
 Yeah, and he was also in the first world war.

443
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,540
 And he was playing a tree.

444
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,540
 He was fought on the western front, and his brother was killed in 1918.

445
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:57,540
 And he did these incredibly dangerous patrols where during daylight he and other men would basically camouflage themselves as trees

446
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,540
 and walk very, very slowly or crawl towards the German trenches.

447
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,540
 If you're crawling, are you going as a tree that's fallen down, I guess?

448
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,540
 Yeah, so yeah.

449
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:12,540
 There's such an interesting concept, the idea of the tree being a spying mechanism for war.

450
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,540
 Because this did happen, the Germans built a 25-foot tall tree out of metal.

451
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,540
 They cut down a real tree, put up a fake tree, put a man in it, and later on the British overtook the same area.

452
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,540
 And they didn't notice for seven months that the tree was not real.

453
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,540
 Well, what do they, unless you went up inside it?

454
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,540
 I mean, they were designed, they were photographed and sketched by botanical experts, weren't they?

455
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,540
 So that then they'd go and photograph the correct tree, and then they'd bring the sketches and photographs back to base.

456
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,540
 And they'd be designed to look exactly like the tree that they'd replaced.

457
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,540
 In the autumn, did you have to kind of drop your fake leaves?

458
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
 Do you think?

459
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
 Yeah.

460
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
 You would have to, wouldn't you?

461
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,540
 You would have to.

462
00:20:50,540 --> 00:21:00,540
 You'd have to have someone climb up and paint them painstakingly brown for a period of weeks, and then remove them one by one to seem natural.

463
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,540
 But these are two different types of tree disguise we're talking about, right?

464
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
 Yes.

465
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,540
 So these trees were talking about were more common, I think, which were trees that you'd put snipers or like observational posts up inside,

466
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,540
 whereas Basil Rappen, I think, was a moving tree.

467
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
 Dressed as a tree, yeah.

468
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,540
 So really, what's he, he was just like, he was a tiny tree.

469
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:21,540
 Like, there's a Charlie, famous Charlie Chaplin movie where he's dressed as a tree, and he hits soldiers as they come by.

470
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,540
 Um, he was, I think he was Charlie Chaplin's mentor.

471
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
 So maybe that's where Charlie Chaplin got the idea.

472
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,540
 Oh, really?

473
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
 So you're saying Charlie Chaplin dressed as a tree in one of his films?

474
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
 Yeah, he did. It's a very famous one.

475
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
 Wow.

476
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
 He was very laconic about it.

477
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,540
 He just said, we brought back an awful lot of information and a few prisoners too.

478
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
 That was it. He did a few of these patrols.

479
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
 He didn't spend the whole war dressed as a tree.

480
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
 I imagine being captured by a tree.

481
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
 Yeah.

482
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:48,540
 So he, as I think Dan said, he sort of volunteered to do this because his brother had died.

483
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,540
 And I think it seems like maybe he lost respect for his own life.

484
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
 It was devastated his brother's death.

485
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,540
 But he had, or thought we had a premonition of his brother's death because he wrote in his journal,

486
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
 one night that he'd woken up at one o'clock in the morning.

487
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
 It was June the 4th, 1918.

488
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,540
 And suddenly he woke up in bed and thought of his brother and started crying.

489
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
 And he didn't know why.

490
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,540
 And then he later found out that exactly at that time was when his brother had been killed.

491
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
 Why me?

492
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
 He wrote a fantastic letter to his family.

493
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,540
 If I read it, I'll read a little bit of it to you.

494
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,540
 It's, dear all, bees letter arrived this morning along with some other things.

495
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,540
 And a parcel from Aunt Elfrida, which looked very promising but proved to contain nothing but wooden underwear

496
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,540
 of such gigantic proportions I am at a loss for words.

497
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,540
 We have managed to fit three men inside a single pair.

498
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
 I wonder if this is the intention.

499
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
 You must inquire and discover if Auntie made them herself.

500
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
 I think they will make excellent tents.

501
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,540
 Do not tell her that.

502
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:51,540
 Just a bit of nicer, so these huge giant tree structures, they actually had almost, I guess, like foxholes that you would enter them through.

503
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,540
 You'd go underneath them.

504
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
 Yeah, and go into them.

505
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
 They were really tall.

506
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
 They were very, very tall trees.

507
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:05,540
 I really like just on a bit of nominative determinism that one of the guys who sketched one of the trees that's held in the Imperial War Museum, his name was Leon Underwood.

508
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,540
 Underwood.

509
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
 It's fantastic.

510
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,540
 And Basil Rathbone's second wife was called Branch.

511
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
 That was her surname.

512
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
 Really?

513
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,540
 So you get fake trees around these days, which are mobile phone masks, don't you?

514
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
 Really?

515
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:27,540
 So probably in the 90s or something, they built a load of mobile phone masks around the UK.

516
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,540
 And to make them look better, they decided to disguise them as trees.

517
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,540
 But what they had to do at the same time was build other trees around them, so it made it look more like a little car.

518
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:44,540
 Now the problem is, what they didn't realize is that the mobile masks that looked like trees, of course, didn't grow.

519
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
 But the trees did grow.

520
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:51,540
 And so now you have loads and loads of masks with just trees all around them and you can't get a signal out of them.

521
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:59,540
 And apparently there's about 10,000 masks in the UK around with trees completely around them that you can hardly get any signals.

522
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:05,540
 In 2007, a man tried to rob a bank in New Hampshire dressed as a tree.

523
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,540
 They article about this said that it was despite the lack of other trees with which to blend in.

524
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
 He was in a bank.

525
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
 He was in a branch.

526
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,540
 Oh, nice.

527
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,540
 And it was on Elm Street as well, the branch of the bank.

528
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,540
 Perfect.

529
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,540
 The police later found someone who recognised him from CCTV.

530
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:31,540
 Do you think that there might be CCTV footage of, say, half an hour before the actual robbery of him in a fancy dress shop going, "Do you have any balaclava?"

531
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,540
 I'm like, "I'm sorry we're all out, mate."

532
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
 We do have a tree costume.

533
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,540
 Oh, damn it. All right.

534
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,540
 Yeah, if you're going to rob a bank, dress up as something that you'd find in a bank, like a person.

535
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,540
 It seems like the smartest thing.

536
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:49,540
 Or a biro on the little stand, because then you can get really close to the counter without anyone noticing.

537
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
 But then you'll change to the counter forever.

538
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,540
 Forever, that's true, yeah.

539
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
 Don't go too method on it.

540
00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:00,540
 So, Rathbone, he was the archetypal Sherlock Holmes.

541
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
 Yes.

542
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,540
 And he was also often a villain in other movies that he did.

543
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
 And he apparently is a really, really great swordsman.

544
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,540
 He might be the best ever swordsman that Hollywood ever brought out.

545
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,540
 Right.

546
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,540
 But he would always lose because he was always the villain.

547
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
 Yeah.

548
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,540
 And there was only one time he won a duel on screen in his whole career.

549
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,540
 And it was when he played Tibolt in Romeo and Juliet.

550
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,540
 And he got an Oscar nomination for it.

551
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
 Oh, really?

552
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,540
 Was that just kind of a sort of pity thing?

553
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,540
 Because he'd had to lose so many jewels.

554
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
 Yeah, maybe.

555
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,540
 The first Sherlock Holmes film was in 1900.

556
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,540
 And it was called Sherlock Holmes Baffled.

557
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:39,540
 Basically, this guy who supposedly Sherlock Holmes walks into his drawing room to find that he's been burgled.

558
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,540
 And then he sees the villain.

559
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,540
 And he's about to shoot him.

560
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,540
 And then the villain just disappears.

561
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,540
 And it was like just a way of showing trick photography at the time.

562
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,540
 In the Wikipedia thing of what happens in the movie, it says at the very end.

563
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,540
 At this point, the movie ends abruptly with Holmes looking Baffled.

564
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,540
 Do you think it was only at that point at the audience when, oh, the title.

565
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
 That makes sense.

566
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,540
 Okay.

567
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,540
 Good reveal.

568
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
 Yeah.

569
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,540
 Just one more thing that we used for camouflage in the First World War.

570
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
 Yeah.

571
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,540
 The French used a horse carcass disguise.

572
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
 Okay.

573
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,540
 So there was a real horse, which was dead on the battlefield.

574
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:20,540
 And he replaced it with, I think a papier-machÃ© one, but possibly something a bit more robust than that.

575
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,540
 But they made a fake horse carcass, left it on the battlefield.

576
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,540
 And a man crawled inside under cover of darkness and was able to observe any German troop movements.

577
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,540
 And he had a telephone wire in there so he could report back.

578
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,540
 They also used a camel dung as camouflage.

579
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,540
 This was Jasper Masculine, who was a magician.

580
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,540
 And according to his memoirs, which were not 100% sure we believe, but according to his memoirs,

581
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:46,540
 he had to mask a load of tanks, which had been painted green, because they were going to be used in Europe.

582
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,540
 But actually, they were being used in Egypt, so they needed to be sand coloured.

583
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,540
 And in order to make them sand coloured, they painted them in putrid Worcester sauce, flour and camel dung.

584
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
 Wow.

585
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,540
 Wait, his name was Masculine.

586
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
 Yeah.

587
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
 And he had to mask a line of tanks.

588
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
 Wow.

589
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
 No one has to have determinism.

590
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
 It gets everywhere.

591
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
 It gets everywhere.

592
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:12,540
 We also used paper mache heads, didn't we, during trench warfare, so they'd make a whole bunch of paper mache heads.

593
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:16,540
 This sounds like possibly the most fun part of what wasn't a very fun thing to do, which was fight in the trenches.

594
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,540
 And then you just like stick the paper mache heads up above the parapet, and hope that they all got shot.

595
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,540
 And then...

596
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
 You would see where the snipers were firing from.

597
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
 Is that the idea?

598
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,540
 Or where their guns were?

599
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
 Yeah, or you'd just, it would just be like misdirection.

600
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,540
 It would just be like, they'll think now that they've defeated us, because they've just shot all our heads off.

601
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:39,540
 I was reading during World War II as part of ways of disguising one of the big problems, obviously German U-boats.

602
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
 They didn't know when they were going to come up.

603
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:48,540
 And if a U-boats saw a battleship, they'd be inclined not to come up, because they know the battleship had the capability to just mow them down.

604
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
 Yeah.

605
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:56,540
 So what they used to do was they used to disguise their battleships as cruises, as public member of cruises.

606
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:05,540
 And they would all dress up all the soldiers, the sailors would dress up as just people who were just on a holiday, and guys would dress as girls, and they'd be hugging on the...

607
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,540
 So the U-boat would see them, come up, come towards them, and suddenly all the guns would come out, and then they would take down the U-boat.

608
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,540
 So once they had seen a U-boat, as in, they were trying to lure it a bit closer, they had a whole rigmarole of what to do.

609
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,540
 So they would start running around the deck, like panicked civilians, basically.

610
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:29,540
 And some of them would fall over, and some of them would jump into a lifeboat, and then leave someone behind by mistake, and he would be screaming at the Reds and come back, come back.

611
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:37,540
 All the sailors who wanted to be an amdram, but didn't have the chance, because they were at sea, would have applied for this particular mission.

612
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,540
 What's my motivation for this sinking, I just wanted nothing.

613
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,540
 It apparently worked. Apparently 14 U-boats were sunk, as a result of this, it was amazing.

614
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:57,540
 Do you know that some U-boats came fitted with planes? So there were genuinely U-boats, which had little aircraft hangers on top of them, which could be sealed, obviously.

615
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,540
 But when they surfaced, they would open the hanger and send up a little plane.

616
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
 Like thunderbirds.

617
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,540
 Yeah, and it would observe the sea all around, because obviously it's really good for observation.

618
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,540
 And then it would land, ideally, near the submarine, because they'd have to sort of tug it back in and then put it in the hanger.

619
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:19,540
 So it lands on skis or something. Yeah, exactly. It can land on water. How cool is that? That's very cool.

620
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,540
 Yeah, I love those things.

621
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,540
 I got one last thing before we move on, Bazzle Rathbone, didn't actually like playing Sherlock Holmes.

622
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:31,540
 It became the bane of his life, because everyone just, it was total typecasting, everyone wanted him to be Sherlock Holmes.

623
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
 A bit like Conan Doyle, how he wanted to.

624
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,540
 Exactly, exactly like Conan Doyle. And he even talked about it, saying Conan Doyle killed him off, but I can't, you know.

625
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,540
 At the end of his career, though, he said to his wife, why don't you write a Sherlock Holmes play, and she did.

626
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,540
 And it closed after three nights.

627
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,540
 Apparently it wasn't that good.

628
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:54,540
 But if you look at his IMDB, among his last movies ever made, are two that I really like, called Hillbilly's in a haunted house.

629
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,540
 And the ghost in the invisible bikini.

630
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
 Wow.

631
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,540
 Yeah.

632
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:10,540
 Okay, time for our final fact of the show, and that is James Harkin.

633
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,540
 My fact this week is that Abraham Lincoln used his stealth pipe hat to keep important documents hidden.

634
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,540
 Was this before you mentioned the briefcase?

635
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,540
 I imagine it was, you know, no, when was the briefcase invented?

636
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,540
 I don't know, but why was he using his hat that feels like they would fall out? Do you know how it worked?

637
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:31,540
 Yeah, I think those, it was in the lining, I think he had a little pocket in there that he'd be able to keep things in.

638
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
 So these were his top hats?

639
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,540
 Yeah, the top hat thing that he's really famous for wearing.

640
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,540
 Yeah.

641
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,540
 It seemed like he used the top hat as a bit of a gimmick because he was six foot far anyway.

642
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,540
 And this top hat would give him an extra like seven, eight inches.

643
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,540
 So he would be by far and away the tallest person in any room.

644
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
 Yeah.

645
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:53,540
 And also it was always slightly shabby, which apparently was supposed to like suit his frontier image.

646
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,540
 And there was a story that he was shot by someone and it hit his hat.

647
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,540
 And it knocked his hat off what he survived and everyone thought, oh well, the hat saved his life.

648
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:09,540
 But actually what it meant was that he was always much easier to spot because he had a big hat.

649
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,540
 And it was easier for people to see him if they wanted to shoot him, they'll just aim for the hat.

650
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,540
 Yeah, and he, because this was the year before he was actually assassinated, he was riding on his horse.

651
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,540
 His hat just gets knocked off.

652
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,540
 The horse goes insane, rides off one of his people, go back to find the hat.

653
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:31,540
 And they find this big, you know, gun hole through it and he didn't believe that it was someone trying to kill him.

654
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,540
 He just thought it was a mistake.

655
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
 Yeah, he thought it was a mistake.

656
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,540
 He thought someone had let off a gun in a distance shooting, attempting to shoot some wild animals.

657
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
 A wild hat.

658
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
 A wild hat.

659
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,540
 Yeah.

660
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:53,540
 The day that he was assassinated, he there was found on his desk the documents which proposed to put the secret service into being.

661
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,540
 Which proposed to make the secret service be a thing.

662
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:01,540
 And the secret service, obviously now the purpose of the secret service is to protect the president and to try and save his life and something from being assassinated.

663
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
 He started it or he started the secret service.

664
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,540
 Yeah, actually weirdly at the time the secret service was to solve a fraud and money laundering.

665
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
 Oh, so it wasn't.

666
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
 It wasn't taken into consideration.

667
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,540
 You could imagine the day after they go, "Okay, bad first day."

668
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:24,540
 The man who shot Lincoln was John Wilkes Booth but the man who shot him was a guy called Boston Corbett.

669
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,540
 Have you heard of him?

670
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,540
 Yeah.

671
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,540
 He was the most strange and interesting person.

672
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,540
 He was a hatter and he was genuinely a mad hatter.

673
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,540
 Did he, was the reason that he shot him because he had shot at the wearer of one of his precious hats?

674
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:43,540
 It feels like it's some kind of hat related vengeance.

675
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,540
 It does, doesn't it? I don't think it was.

676
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,540
 He had previously castrated himself with a pair of scissors.

677
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
 Oh, well they summarize scissors.

678
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,540
 I hope so for his sake.

679
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,540
 But yeah, and he then went for a walk before going to hospital to think about what he'd just done.

680
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,540
 So just let's go to the assassination scene for a second.

681
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
 John Wilkes Booth, you're mentioning.

682
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:12,540
 So an interesting connection is that Tony Blair's wife, Cherie Blair was originally Cherie Booth.

683
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
 Yeah.

684
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,540
 She is directly related to John Wilkes Booth.

685
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
 Really?

686
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,540
 Yeah, she's a fourth removed cousin I believe.

687
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
 And so she has a connection there.

688
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,540
 More interestingly, I think, for the purpose of this podcast.

689
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,540
 On the night that Abraham Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth, another person was injured in the commotion that followed.

690
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:38,540
 And it was a guy called Major Henry Rathbone, who is related directly to Basil Rathbone.

691
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:43,540
 And he later died of the wounds that he suffered from that night from a stabbing wound.

692
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,540
 And that was Basil Rathbone's distant relative.

693
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
 Oh, wow.

694
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,540
 Yeah.

695
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,540
 The other thing is, you know, the assassination of JFK, the grassy null.

696
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,540
 Yeah.

697
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,540
 That was Basil Rathbone dressed as a grassy null.

698
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:03,540
 And on the night he was assassinated, Lincoln had been drinking tomato juice.

699
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:08,540
 Because he was very high up in the theatre and at that altitude, tomato juice tastes better.

700
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,540
 Well, he was six foot far, so he probably did taste better.

701
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,540
 There were some hats in the Georgian period, I think.

702
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:18,540
 This is according to Lucy Warsley, who's just written a book about that period.

703
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,540
 That would never intend to be worn on the head.

704
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,540
 I think that kind of disqualifies it to be in a hat.

705
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,540
 They were referred to as hats.

706
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,540
 They were by those bicorn hats, which are like they've got a lot too long, pointy sides.

707
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
 They're hats at sailors wear.

708
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,540
 They were made to be held under the arm of the occasions.

709
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,540
 They were impossible to wear off the head.

710
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,540
 There were other types of bicorn hat that were designed to be collapsible in the 19th century,

711
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,540
 which I quite like.

712
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,540
 And there was one hat designed, which is called the opera hat, which was collapsible,

713
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,540
 so that when you went to the opera, you wouldn't be obscuring people's vision.

714
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,540
 So that was when they were big top hats, and they were spring loaded,

715
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
 so that you could just collapse them, and then you'd sit on them.

716
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,540
 You'd sit on this flat-collapsed hat on your opera chair.

717
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
 Spring loaded.

718
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
 Spring.

719
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
 They're very dangerous.

720
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,540
 Yeah.

721
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,540
 What if the spring went off while you were sitting on it?

722
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
 Everyone's bouncing around.

723
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
 You're jacking a book.

724
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
 My date's just been lobbed over the balcony.

725
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:17,540
 President Mabuto of Zaire banned all leopard print hats from his country, except for his own.

726
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
 So it wasn't animal rights grounds?

727
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
 No, he was the only one allowed to wear it.

728
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,540
 And he also made a law saying that television in Zaire could not mention anybody but him by name.

729
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,540
 What?

730
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,540
 That must have made a lot of dramas very difficult.

731
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
 Or the weakest link.

732
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,540
 So, who do you think is the weakest link?

733
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,540
 I think it was that guy.

734
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,540
 Which guy?

735
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
 That guy.

736
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,540
 Oh, a university challenge.

737
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:50,540
 Second along on the top deck.

738
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,540
 That is unbelievable.

739
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
 How long was that?

740
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
 When did he die?

741
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
 He must have died about 10 years ago.

742
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
 How would he be introduced to people?

743
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,540
 Mabuto, this is a guy.

744
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,540
 He's only on TV.

745
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,540
 I'm only on TV.

746
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,540
 The law in the whole country.

747
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,540
 We'd better call our next child Mabuto.

748
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,540
 Why should we call this asteroid?

749
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,540
 They would after my mistress Mabuto.

750
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,540
 Just other famous hats.

751
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
 I really like John Wayne's hat.

752
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,540
 Oh, yeah.

753
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,540
 He had a Stetson.

754
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,540
 War it all the time.

755
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:31,540
 Everyone thought it was to cultivate this constant image of a wild western kind of cowboy.

756
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,540
 Loved his hat so much, not wanting to take it off.

757
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,540
 That he actually had his car, which was a Pontiac station wagon.

758
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,540
 He had the roof raised so that he could fit his Stetson in when he was sitting.

759
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
 They still have that car.

760
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
 I saw an image of it.

761
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
 It was really cool.

762
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,540
 I went to the hat museum in stockpot.

763
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:51,540
 They reckoned that one of the reasons that hats went out of fashion is because of the motor car.

764
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,540
 Because you couldn't wear it inside the car.

765
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,540
 The roof was too low.

766
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,540
 But when they went out of fashion, no one could really believe it.

767
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,540
 Newspaper reports of 1948.

768
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:09,540
 I bemoaned the fact that there was a new fashion of headedness and the hats industry did some research.

769
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:14,540
 And they found that 84% of women preferred men in hats.

770
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,540
 So they couldn't believe that people had stopped wearing them because they were so attractive.

771
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
 I think they still...

772
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,540
 I'd like to see a pool of women now what they think of membrane hats.

773
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,540
 I reckoned on most women would say they'd prefer men wearing hats.

774
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,540
 We kind of fetishized that Mr. Darcy top hat looked, didn't we?

775
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,540
 Not like a backwards cap.

776
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,540
 Context of being in 1814 or whatever it was.

777
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,540
 Do you think if someone actually walked into the bar wearing a Mr. Darcy hat, you think?

778
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
 I do think.

779
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
 I'm not so into this as I thought.

780
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,540
 It's very hard to wear any hat other than a beanie hat or a baseball cap.

781
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
 Non-ironically without...

782
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,540
 Seeming like you're trying to dress up like you're in the 40s.

783
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
 I'm not sure you could get away with a baseball cap.

784
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
 No, you're absolutely right.

785
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
 You're absolutely right.

786
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:58,540
 Babe Ruth always kept a cabbage leaf in his hat underneath his cap to keep him cool.

787
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:03,540
 There was a South Korean baseballer called Park Myeong Kwon,

788
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,540
 who also kept frozen cabbage leaves under his cap to keep him cold.

789
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
 But he wasn't really supposed to.

790
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,540
 There wasn't really a rule, but it was kind of seen as not very good because it was...

791
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,540
 Performance enhancing cabbage.

792
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,540
 Exactly that.

793
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,540
 After leaves fell out twice live on television, they came up with a new rule,

794
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:29,540
 and now players may only wear cabbage leaves by presenting a doctor's note in advance.

795
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
 Which doctor are you going to...

796
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,540
 Which serious doctor is going to sign something to that effect?

797
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,540
 Only doctors who are in the pocket of big cabbage will do that.

798
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,540
 Okay, that's it.

799
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,540
 That's all of our facts.

800
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
