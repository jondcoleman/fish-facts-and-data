00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 (blues music)

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:16.220
 Hello and welcome back to another episode

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.860
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.460
 coming to you from the Kiwi offices in Covent Garden.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.700
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.460
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Tijinsky,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.420
 Alex Bell and special guest Ed Brooke Hitching.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.260
 and in no particular order, here we go.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.220
 Starting with you, Ed.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.700
 - In 1875, the British Navy erased 123 islands

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.560
 from their charts because they didn't exist.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.660
 - The British Navy didn't exist or the islands?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.340
 - Yeah, you were gonna do that.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.580
 No, it's, Phantom Islands were a huge problem

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.620
 when we were sorting out our charts.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.700
 They were just, the maps were just cluttered with these things

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.100
 and mainly caused by human error,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.420
 especially in a time before we could measure longitude,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.180
 you would estimate your position with dead reckoning.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.260
 And because of that, you had huge amounts

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.980
 of wildly inaccurate coordinates

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.620
 that would be fed back to cartographers,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.020
 painted on maps and presented as facts.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.820
 - So to be fair to them, they were often real islands.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.540
 They just weren't anywhere near the places

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.340
 where they were told that they were.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.460
 - To what extent is an island in a different place

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.460
 before it becomes a different island?

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.500
 - I'll give them a hundred miles leeway

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 in any direction.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 - Yeah, it's unbelievable.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.140
 They're doing a job half right as well.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.300
 You're giving them too much.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.540
 - You've gotta be loose with these poor charts.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.940
 They didn't have longitude.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.780
 - Okay.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.180
 - Were there sort of mirages and things

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.060
 that meant people think they'd seen an island

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 and they hadn't?

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.300
 - Yeah, there's a whole load of crazy natural phenomena

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.580
 presumably still out there waiting for you to think

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.620
 that you are seeing land when you're not.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.940
 I mean, we're talking icebergs,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.500
 but sometimes covered in dirt that can disguise them

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.060
 as an island, surrounded by sea gals.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.900
 - Did somebody do that?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.060
 Did somebody go to an iceberg?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 - It's put like a palm tree on it.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.180
 - The biggest prank of all time.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.020
 - America.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.500
 - The whole thing just made up just all the back of the iceberg.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.460
 - But there's also things like low-hanging clouds,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.020
 which doesn't sound like you would mistake the solid land,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.500
 but it's like this island, the fluffiest island

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.860
 and the whole South Pacific.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:18.860
 - Is it still happening?

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:19.860
 Do we ever get?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.700
 - Yes.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.540
 - There's one in 2012.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.540
 I was covered.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540
 Sandy Island got undiscovered.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.540
 Yeah, it was in New Caledonia, just in Calsy.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.340
 - Yeah, the North East Coast of Australia.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.100
 - It was undiscovered then.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.420
 - So everyone thought it was there

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.620
 and then eventually someone went there

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.620
 and there was nothing there.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.460
 - Wow.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.660
 - It had been on maps for a hundred years

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 and it was discovered to be fake seven years

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.380
 after you launched Google Maps.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.220
 - Yeah.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.660
 - So you could, to a time, find it on Google Maps

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.860
 and you still can, but there's a little annotation saying,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.700
 it's not...

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.700
 - It does not exist.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.700
 - It sees refreshable browser.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.300
 - How embarrassing, if you lived there,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 and you found out it wasn't real.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.220
 - I feel like such an idiot.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.740
 - Do you think some people do still try to build houses, though?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.020
 You know, like if you go on a walk

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.060
 and you are insisting that you're following a footpath

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.420
 that you've obviously lost it,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.820
 but you just keep hacking through the undergrowth.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.140
 Doing there are people who are putting brick upon brick

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.980
 on a cloud.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.020
 - On a cloud, yeah, yeah.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.740
 - There was a radio DJ in the '60s

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.660
 who claimed to have broadcast a radio show

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.580
 from a reef called the Maria Teresa Reef

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.940
 that no one has ever been able to find.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.220
 And he swore to his friends that he was there

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.740
 and the water was lapping up to his knees

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.500
 and his deck chair was floating away.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.300
 - Maybe he just had a sound effect CD

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 and he was like, "Oh, the water's really close."

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.220
 - He was in his mum's basement.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 - Yeah, exactly.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.020
 - So three years ago, Pakistan got a new island,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.700
 completely new island.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.260
 They had an earthquake in the country

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.700
 'cause they're quite a couple of tectonic plates

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.740
 right up against each other there,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.020
 hence the Himalayas.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.540
 Anyway, after this earthquake,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 it disturbed a pocket of pressurized gas.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.100
 And as a result, this entire section of the seabed

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.460
 rose up to the surface and bobbed around for a bit

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.940
 and until the gas underneath it was going to sort of collapse

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.740
 or get pressurized and then it sank again.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.060
 But it was so unattractive as an island,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.260
 it was just mud and silt and it was covered in dead fish

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.860
 which did not realize what was happening to it.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.780
 It's not the side of mystical land appearing

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.940
 out of the sea that we all dream of.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.100
 - It was much of a stir.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.940
 - No wonder it sank.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.540
 It was so horrible to me.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.060
 - I think if I were a fish,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.780
 I would manage to swim into the water.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.100
 I mean, how quickly did this island pop up out of it?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.820
 - What if you're a flatfish?

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.740
 And you're meant to be on this surface,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.740
 you might not notice as it was rising.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.740
 - Yeah, I see.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.820
 - It's like getting scurriedy close.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.580
 It's kind of like the fish's version of a tsunami.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.420
 - Yes.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.260
 - Do you know that there's no map containing the phrase

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.380
 "Hibby Dragons"?

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.340
 But there aren't two globes, ancient globes

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.020
 which do have the phrase "Hibby Dragons"

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.100
 or they have the Latin 'cause they were classy back then

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.620
 which is Hick Sun to Draconis

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.340
 and one of them is from 1510

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.500
 and it's one of the first ever European globes

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.020
 and one of them's from 1504

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.620
 and it's from ostrich eggs.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.740
 That's what they made it out of.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.220
 Take two ostrich eggs, cut them in half,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.260
 glue them together, draw on globes.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.100
 - Oh wow, yeah.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.100
 - Do we think one day the sea will recede

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.980
 to reveal that there are in fact dragons there?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.140
 - Wouldn't that be nice?

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.980
 - Wouldn't it be?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.020
 - Well, you're getting island floating up

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.180
 with the dragon's flopping around like fish.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.180
 (laughing)

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 - Well, a lot of these monsters,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.580
 they sort of they're painted on for stylistic flourishes

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.500
 and sometimes it's just not a lot of information.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.780
 You've got to fill the blanks.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.620
 (laughing)

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.300
 It's called horror vacuity.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.740
 You know, these cartographers,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.540
 they cannot ignore blank spaces.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.300
 They have to fill it in with something.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.340
 But there's one particular monster

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.940
 you sometimes see drawn on maps

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.260
 of South America in the Patagonian region

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.500
 and it's a giant, a giant couple

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.220
 and it usually says a Regium Gigantan region of the giants.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.500
 The weird thing is that wasn't just a stylistic flourish.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 It got to the point in 18th century London

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.820
 where they really believed there was a race of eight-foot giants

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.980
 that stalked the landscape in Patagonia

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.180
 and to the extent that I think Dr. Matthew Macy,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.740
 Secretary of the British Royal Society,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.900
 sent a letter to the French Academy of Sciences

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.980
 saying the existence of giants here is confirmed.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.300
 - What?

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.340
 - And when they printed their journal,

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.500
 it came with a frontispiece illustration of one of the sailors

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.460
 and British sailors at that time were about five at five.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.340
 One of the sailors giving them a biscuit.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.020
 - It's just going to piece off.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.300
 - So it was a massive bestseller.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.140
 People wanted to see it.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.980
 - Oh, wow.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.140
 - Maybe they only viewed them from a distance

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.980
 and it was just that that area had slightly smaller trees.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.340
 - Well, the thing is, they reckon that it was a native tribe

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.460
 that no longer exists of maybe six-foot tall men

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.220
 that still to a very short Englishman

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.500
 were laterifying.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.220
 - I'm distanced in an element of exaggeration going on there,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.420
 when a six-foot tall man morphs into a hereby giants type.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.180
 They had six-foot tall people.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.420
 And wasn't Washington older Lincoln six-foot?

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.660
 - Abraham Lincoln was six-foot-four.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:45.940
 - I think that's with the hat, though.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.180
 - I think it was even bigger with the hat.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.100
 With the hat, he was about seven feet tall.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.940
 - Wow.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:51.780
 - Yeah.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.140
 - They have a fully functional audio animatronic robot

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.420
 of him in Disneyland.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.620
 - Is it fully functional?

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.620
 - Yeah, fully functional.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.140
 - Does it emancipate slaves?

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.020
 - No, it just stands up, makes a speech.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:03.260
 It's supposed to be exactly like him.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.100
 - They're all the presidents.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.380
 They're a whole hall for every single president of the United States

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.820
 and they all get up and talk and make speeches.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.220
 - You watch Vida in YouTube, it's pretty weird and cool.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.060
 - And it's very passionate.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.900
 - Where is this?

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:13.740
 - Disneyland.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.900
 - I'm sorry, when you said it,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.940
 I just had a vision of all of them in a hall

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.580
 talking at the same time on their own.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.860
 And it's just the most frightening, weird, unsettling.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.780
 - They tag each other in, like restless.

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.660
 - On Fictitious Islands, so you were saying

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.140
 that there were various reasons that they got it wrong

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.700
 and they put islands in the wrong places.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.420
 But they did also make them up, didn't they?

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.660
 They, like you say, they wanted stuff to happen.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.140
 They didn't like empty space.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.980
 And so I was reading about Benjamin Morel,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980
 who I assume you're a maps fan.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.220
 - Benjamin Morel, I just find historical liars fascinating.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.460
 - So what Benjamin Morel did is he made up

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.460
 a whole bunch of places in Ireland.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.020
 So he made up this island called New South Greenland,

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.460
 near Antarctica, which didn't exist.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.500
 And we thought it existed for a hundred years

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.860
 until I think a Shackleton expedition undiscovered it

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.420
 in between 1940 and 1917.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.060
 They went there and said, oh, that's not here.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.140
 But why did this guy do that?

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.620
 - Well, this is, I mean, voyages at that time

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.420
 and probably still are a business operation.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.980
 You need to raise funds and sponsorship to do it.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.460
 And people are more likely to give you money

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.860
 if it's exciting, if you're often an adventure.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:24.460
 All he wanted to do was go and travel.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.100
 He just wanted to live at sea.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.620
 And so when he came back and he had a particularly

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.220
 an eventful trip, he had to sex it up somehow.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.020
 So he invented as buyers island,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.180
 there's Morels Land, was one of his, he claimed.

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.580
 - Oh, that's where the wheels started coming off

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.420
 the way he was asked.

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.500
 And what was the name of that that the locals had for it?

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.140
 Oh, Morels Land.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.980
 - And so, yeah, that's how he secured funding.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.260
 And so he was known as the biggest lion Pacific

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.020
 because of this tendency to just invent geography.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.860
 - So we should say the reason that Ed knows

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.260
 so much about this is that you have written a book

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.380
 on this very subject, haven't you Ed?

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.060
 - Yeah, it's called the Phantom Atlas.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.340
 And it comes out in November 3rd.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.980
 And it's basically an Atlas of the world

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.460
 as we believed it to be, rather than how it actually existed.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.180
 - There you go, Phantom Atlas, go and buy it.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.980
 Not on the second of November, but on the third.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.740
 'Cause on the second, it won't exist.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.180
 - Yes, you'll be a bit disappointed.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.020
 - Yeah.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.540
 There are, isn't there an island somewhere called

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.660
 Disappointment Island?

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.500
 - Maybe it was one that Morel bigged up

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.380
 and then his son went and visited this paradise.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.780
 - I made it ice cream and it's easy to me to say.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.660
 - Turn out it's covered in dead fish.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.540
 - Disappointment islands.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.700
 One of the first Westerners to land there

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.140
 was John Byron, who was grandfather of Lord Byron.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.980
 - I really though as well.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.580
 - The man who discovered the Patagonian Giants.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.740
 - Really? - Yeah.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.580
 - Was John Byron.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.100
 - Yeah, he was Captain of the Dolphin.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.540
 - Wow. - Oh, cool.

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.980
 - And they called him Falweather Jack

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.500
 'cause he had this amazing knack

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.780
 of sailing always into enormous storms.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.500
 - I think we've met before. - Yes, we've told you.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.220
 - So the islands had already been called

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.260
 the Unfortunate Islands 'cause they didn't have

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.180
 a decent water supply on them.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.980
 And that was by Magellan.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.060
 - But they were called Disappointment Island

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:10.900
 for a different reason.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:12.100
 It wasn't 'cause there wasn't any water.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.940
 It was because John Byron found that the people

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.540
 who lived there were of a hostile disposition

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.380
 and they didn't like him.

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.220
 - That's a dick move.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:20.060
 They had to rename someone.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.580
 That's like, "You now live on bastard lanes."

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.140
 - I would aggressive, isn't it?

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.300
 - No, we were just a disappointment.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:29.020
 - Yeah, he didn't call them fierce or frightening,

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.700
 which I think they would have been more flattered by

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.540
 to call someone Disappointment.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.700
 - You've been a real disappointment.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.740
 Yeah, we were really expecting good things

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.180
 from these islands and...

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.900
 - I bet he was really nice to their face as well.

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.220
 - It was really nice.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.060
 - Lovely time, guys.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.140
 - Thank you for the Candy Floss Brilliant Islands.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.260
 We'll definitely call it that when we get back.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.840
 (upbeat music)

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.940
 Okay, time now for fact number two,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.500
 which is my fact this week is that the White House

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.420
 only got the ability to print on double-sided paper

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.340
 this year.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.300
 - And was that the staff weren't trained well enough

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.300
 to understand?

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.260
 - It's a very hard little clickbox to find.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.100
 - It's really easy.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940
 - It's very hard.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.780
 - They've had the ability.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.620
 They just...

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.060
 - No, this is the amazing thing

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.460
 is that they have not had the ability.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.300
 It's incredible.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.860
 The White House has just had a huge technological overhaul,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.780
 which has meant that they can now print double-sided.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.620
 They can do color printing.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.300
 They don't all have to use blackberry phones.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.540
 It's incredibly difficult to upgrade any technology

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:30.060
 in the White House, but partly because of security

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.580
 and partly because it's very complicated,

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.060
 but also there are four different offices

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.300
 which look after White House tech.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.780
 So it's a complete nightmare.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.580
 It's the National Security Council,

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.020
 Executive Office of the President,

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.100
 the Secret Services and the White House Communications Agency.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.020
 And between them, nothing has been achieved for the last

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.860
 - Even to eat all of that expertise.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.500
 They still can't get the opportunity to work.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.580
 No one's got any hope.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:53.420
 - No.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.500
 - And they even, one thing they did,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.260
 they had to remove lots of spare wiring

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.740
 that was just left in the walls of the building

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.140
 from previous systems that were no longer in use.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.100
 They removed 13,000 pounds of wiring.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.460
 So the White House has just lost 13,000 pounds in weight.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.660
 - So when they renovated the situation room in 2067,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:15.540
 up until that point, they were using cathode ray tube TV screens

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.300
 and fax machines and photos from the 80s.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.140
 Like, you're absolutely right.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.580
 It was a completely diet situation.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.260
 And apparently it was a really disruptive overhaul.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.020
 They found bits of a windows

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.820
 and the remains of a sunken courtyard

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.420
 that had been left over by previous presidents.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:29.460
 They didn't know it was there.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.220
 - So I think Roosevelt built in the White House,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.820
 warm swimming pool and he used it

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.580
 for therapeutic swimming for his polio.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.820
 So this was in the 1930s.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.740
 There was a big opening in 1933.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:42.100
 That was inside the White House.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.980
 Various other presidents used it

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.500
 and then Nixon, fun lover that he was,

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.220
 decided to cover it up and build the press.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.580
 - Classic Nixon.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.220
 (laughing)

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.740
 - But he also installed the bowling alley there.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.420
 So you know, he's nice and all.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.580
 - That's true, yeah, yeah.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.500
 - So Nixon covered it up and typically

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.740
 and he turned it into a press briefing room.

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.180
 But we only realized quite recently

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.500
 when they were excavating the White House

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500
 or doing some building work.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.420
 So the swimming pool is actually completely intact

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:09.260
 underneath it.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:10.380
 So underneath this floor,

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.900
 underneath where the main White House press secretary stands

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.580
 is the deep end of the swimming pool

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.860
 and then goes up to the shallow end underneath there.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.500
 - That's a fun metaphor for any of the secretary.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.460
 We're putting you in the deep end.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.380
 Presumably it's been drained.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.820
 - I think it has been drained, yes.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.420
 - Although Hillary Clinton expressed a while ago,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:28.100
 I think when Bill was president,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.500
 she expressed a desire to have that swimming pool back.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.380
 So you never know if she wins.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.220
 She might...

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.900
 - Stop all press briefings.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.620
 - Stop the press briefings, get the pool back.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.100
 That's gonna be a campaign slogan.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.980
 - It's only we can have both

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.260
 and you have inflatable floating chairs

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:42.660
 for the press people.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.100
 - That is a good idea.

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.340
 - And then to do length off and down there.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:46.660
 - And then the press secretary

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.180
 can have a flamingo or something

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.660
 an inflatable flamingo to be on

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.780
 to show that position.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.620
 (laughing)

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.700
 - You know, the secret service had to hide

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.660
 the front doorbell on the north side

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.260
 of the White House from Calvin Coolidge,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.700
 the president, because he would prank them.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:02.980
 And every time someone rang the doorbell

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.700
 that wasn't expected, obviously the secret service

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.540
 had to rush it.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.380
 We're talking 1929.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.660
 And he just loved doing it and then hiding in a bush

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.940
 and watching them arrive and be completely confused.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.780
 (laughing)

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.300
 So when they finally figured out what he was doing,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.140
 and this is from an article in Time.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.940
 I'm not pulling this completely out.

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.780
 - Wow.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.580
 - They hid the doorbell from him,

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.780
 so he couldn't do it again.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.820
 After that, he was leaving bags of flaming dog shit

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.660
 on the doorbells.

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:25.500
 (laughing)

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.660
 - Of his own house.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.780
 - My partner still has a blackberry, doesn't he?

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.100
 - But he really wants an iPhone.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.940
 - Does he?

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.940
 - Yeah, he was saying, "Oh, it's a great phone,

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.940
 "but it doesn't take pictures.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.220
 "You can't text, the phone doesn't work.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.060
 "You can't pay music on it."

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.460
 And he's really jealous of his wife and kids

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:37.300
 because they've got cool phones

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.300
 and they can snap chat and stuff.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.140
 And he was complaining.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.500
 - That refers to sounds like a terrible phone

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.220
 if it can't text, take pictures or doing else.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.420
 - That's actually the reason that he's not

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.980
 completely tearing up the Constitution

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.220
 and standing for a third term.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.100
 - He would, but he wants that iPhone.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.500
 - When you're the president,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.860
 you still can't get the model of phone that you want.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.820
 - Well, it's because it needs to be heavily modified,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:58.060
 doesn't it, by the secret service?

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.260
 We'll have a phone, the president uses it.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.540
 I think this is why.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.580
 And so an iPhone is a little bit more difficult

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.740
 for them to hack into, I think.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.020
 Or they've got to say much trouble

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.700
 by the time they've modified his bloody blackberry

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.020
 that when he comes back next year

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.780
 and says I want an upgrade, they say, "Sorry mate."

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.900
 - It's just the secret service.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.980
 They're always modifying things.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.980
 So we've talked before about the presidential cars

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.060
 and how they're modified.

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.700
 And I just get the idea of a blackberry,

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.380
 which has got three inches of armour plating on the outside.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.620
 And there are seven decoys.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.420
 So whenever he goes, "Which one is my phone?"

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.420
 - So another thing about early days of tech

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.580
 in the White House, the first ever telephone

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.900
 in the White House could only be used to call the treasury.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.620
 And if you wanted to ring the White House,

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.300
 the treasury just had to pick up the phone and dial one.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.500
 - That's so cool.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.660
 - The phone number was one.

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.340
 - So printing.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.860
 - Yes, printing.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.900
 Let's talk about that.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.740
 Did you know, you know heart, the Harold Angels thing?

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.580
 - Yeah.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.420
 - The song.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.260
 - The song.

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.380
 Do you know what relation that has to printing?

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.380
 - No.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.860
 - That Mendelssohn wrote that tune

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.740
 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the printing press.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.740
 - Wow.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:00.780
 - Yeah, isn't that weird?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:03.700
 It was for some celebrations in honour of Gutenberg.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.540
 And yeah.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.740
 - I didn't get that from the lyrics.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:06.820
 I've said, I always thought it was...

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.820
 - Should have been called the Harold Angels print.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.140
 In glory to the newborn Canon H.B. laser jet.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.380
 (all laughing)

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:15.380
 That is very cool.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.980
 - Yeah, so just to clarify,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.780
 aside from these guys silly jokes,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.540
 the lyrics were not the same at the time.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.980
 They were in fact lyrics suitable

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.660
 to the celebration of Gutenberg.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:25.660
 - Well, really so.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:26.500
 - Yes.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.900
 - It's just the music that we're talking about.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.580
 - It was, yeah, so he wrote the tune

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.420
 and then someone else wrote the lyrics about,

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:33.460
 it was called the Gutenberg Cantata.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.300
 - Wow.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.180
 - And then later on it was repurposed.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.660
 - Well, do you guys know the expression to a T

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.820
 when you're talking about knowing something very precisely

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.900
 that you play the bank robbery into a T?

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.660
 - Do you know what the T stands for?

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.500
 - No.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.060
 - Tittle.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.580
 And Tittle is the official name for the dot

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:52.740
 in a lowercase i that printers it.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.580
 - Ah, really?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.340
 - That is J.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.780
 So the original phrase was to a Tittle.

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:58.340
 - So what's a jot thing?

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.140
 'Cause I know the phrase jot and Tittle.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.900
 - Yeah, that's from the Bible.

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:02.720
 - What?

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.300
 - Yeah, to care not a jot or a Tittle.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.220
 - Well, they people, they sound like characters on the Bible.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:08.500
 - Oh, no, they won't be.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.340
 (all laughing)

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.700
 - What kind of weird children's Bible are you reading?

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.220
 - Jobs and Tittle. - Jobs and Tittle.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220
 - And all these weird things.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.340
 - They could, actually they could catch on as fancy names.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:21.140
 Tittle, Tittle come and do your piano practice.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.620
 Jot, it's definitely Jot is a boy's name

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.620
 and Tittle is a girl's name, I think.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.500
 - Well, she's gonna have a rough time at school.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.900
 - Did you know that on printing, publishing,

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.380
 the illustrator of the first ever nursery rhyme book

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.540
 was sued for selling porn?

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.220
 This was a guy called George Bickham, Jr.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.180
 It was in the 1740s.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.100
 And the nursery rhyme book was three inches by 1.75 inches,

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.340
 which is so sweet.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.660
 (all laughing)

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.820
 I know, isn't that cool because it was a book for children,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.980
 so it was child size.

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.140
 But then he went on to sell loads of porn,

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.780
 which makes me really wonder what was for me illustrations.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.260
 - He put some saucy images in the first children's book.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.660
 - Well, maybe he did, but I don't think he did.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.660
 (all laughing)

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.500
 - Have you heard of the smallest ever inkjet printed picture

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.940
 this was done not so long ago?

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.460
 It's 0.08 millimeters by one millimeter

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.620
 and it's a picture of a few different tropical clownfish.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:13.500
 It's the same as Nemo, basically.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.780
 And it's unbelievable.

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.540
 It's done with a thing called quantum dots.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.660
 The really weird thing is, the dots look

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.220
 like a different color according to what size they are.

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.220
 So obviously they're all absolutely tiny,

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:27.900
 but the very, very smallest ones look blue.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.820
 There's slightly larger ones look green

00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.500
 and then the bigger ones look red.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.660
 So you can print different colors using the same ink.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:36.500
 - What?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.180
 - It's just using this, I think it's something to do with the light,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.620
 but I'm not completely sure.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.300
 - It's obviously, it's obviously something to do with light.

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:44.700
 - That's on the press police.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.700
 (all laughing)

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.180
 - It's on the press police for dummies.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.020
 (upbeat music)

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.180
 - Time for fact number three now and that is Alex.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.900
 - My fact this week is that World War Two

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.180
 Morse code operators could recognize each other's accents

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.020
 over the line.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:04.020
 - They were speaking in Morse code at the time, presumably.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.100
 - Yes, yeah, so it's not even just World War Two operators.

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:07.940
 There's all operators.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.020
 If you do Morse code a lot, if you're one of those kind of people,

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.180
 it's known as your fist.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.500
 If you have a good fist or you have a poor fist,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.340
 that means you've got a very kind of sloppy,

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.180
 bad way of typing in Morse code.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.620
 - It means a completely different thing actually

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.180
 where I was brought up, but yeah.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.260
 (all laughing)

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.140
 - And I grew up in a boxing community.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.300
 - All right, just to make that ultra clear,

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:28.820
 go ahead and jump in, yeah.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.100
 (all laughing)

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.220
 - Bit like, I guess it's like an antiation,

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.980
 but for Morse code, if you have a good fist,

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.980
 you Morse code very, exactly like I'm not doing now.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.540
 You code very, very good.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.380
 (all laughing)

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.060
 - Particularly, it's the way that I can never remember.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.900
 - Just to be clear, is it the speed

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.460
 with which people are typing the letters or is it?

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.340
 - If you read it, it's everything.

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.100
 It's the rhythm, which you type.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.220
 It's also, you would Morse differently depending

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.060
 on the type of instrument you're using.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.420
 So there are different mechanisms in different things.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.980
 So you would get different rhythms

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:04.140
 or different intonations of your Dawson dashes.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.220
 - Could British Morse code people

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.220
 recognize individual German?

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.220
 - Yeah.

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:10.940
 - But it's not like, hello there.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.780
 (all laughing)

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.460
 - It's a regional accent, yeah.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.260
 - No, it sounds like it's exactly the equivalent of that.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.500
 - Yeah, I know that there was,

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.220
 the people in Bletchley monitoring spy codes

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.780
 and speaking a lot with the same people

00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:23.300
 from a long way, they never met,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.500
 were able to recognize each other just from the Morse.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.420
 - I remember one story, a lady talking,

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.820
 who worked at Bletchley, talking about it,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.500
 and she felt that she knew the person

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.180
 who she was listening into so intimately

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.020
 that she referred to her as, I think, Maria.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.220
 She gave her a name, and wow.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:37.820
 - Even though you only hear,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.980
 dot, dot, dash, dot, dash, dot, dot, wow.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.100
 - Classic Maria.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.860
 (all laughing)

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.340
 - There's this story about Thomas Edison.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.260
 It's one of those probably apocryphal.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.260
 After he went deaf, that he and his wife

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.380
 would communicate through Morse code.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.660
 And so when they went to the theater,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.620
 she would have his hand on his knee

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.900
 and would tap out the lines as he was performed,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.780
 which, that would be pretty rapid

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.140
 and quite irritating, yapping.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.340
 Especially for whoever's in the row in front of them.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.340
 - Yeah.

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.900
 - Well, we sure she wasn't a Scotsie trying to say,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.020
 "Excuse me, do I need the toilet?"

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.180
 Can you get up and let me know?

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.180
 (all laughing)

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.700
 - So on communicating in secret using Morse code,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:15.980
 here is a cool thing.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.060
 During the Second World War,

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:19.260
 there was a British prisoner of war

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.940
 who was imprisoned in Germany.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.540
 He was called Major Alexis Castelli,

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.820
 and he was a sower.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.940
 So he would sove to pass the time,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.580
 very intricate, beautiful patterns,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.100
 and there are bits of cross stitch.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.020
 And there's one he did that's really nice.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.380
 It says, you know, this piece of work

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.340
 was made by Major here at this castle on these dates.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.060
 But around the edges, there are two borders,

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.580
 and they are little patterns of dots and dashes.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.740
 And one of them says, "God save the king in Morse code."

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.660
 And the other one says, "Excuse my French, fuck Hitler."

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.700
 (all laughing)

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.740
 And it's amazing, and it was so nice and pretty

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.540
 that he was allowed to hang it on the wall

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.380
 at the prison camps.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.900
 He was in, and none of the German guards

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.420
 ever spotted or deciphered that this was Morse code.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:06.340
 - So risky, 'cause so many of them

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.580
 must have known Morse code.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.420
 It was wartime.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.700
 I thought everyone had to memorize it.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.700
 - Unbelievable.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.780
 - In 2010, members of the Colombian army

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:16.380
 were being held hostage by the guerrilla army

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.900
 in Gambia, the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.540
 And so the Colombian army wanted to get a message to them,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.100
 and they decided the best way to do it

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.100
 would be to commission a pop song,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.500
 which had Morse code hidden inside it,

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:29.620
 and then find a way of getting it on air,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.300
 broadcast on radio, so that they could get a message

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.460
 to their country.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.260
 So at the various points in the chorus,

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.420
 they sing the words, "Listen to this message brother."

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.060
 And then after that, the beat is built around a Morse code message

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.860
 that says, "Nine people rescued your necks, don't lose hope."

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.020
 And they got through it, isn't it?

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.860
 - Wow.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.620
 - And then there's an interview with a guy who said,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.820
 "Yeah, I recognise you pretty much immediately,

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820
 'cause I was expecting Morse code,

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.220
 and it was pretty blatant when I heard a,

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.700
 "Listen to this message."

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.540
 Yeah, it's amazing.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.740
 - And I knew your accent, obviously,

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:56.860
 'cause of that extra long gap,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.300
 if you leave it between the ear and the L.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.620
 - It'd better be a good song as well.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.300
 Otherwise, you just turn the radio off.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.140
 - Yeah, that was the problem.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.140
 They had to make it good,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.180
 'cause they had to justify forcing radios,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.380
 like, as in they had to try and get it on radio stations,

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.100
 so that it could be broadcast as a song on the radio.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.220
 So it couldn't be awful, otherwise,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.060
 people would get suspicious.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.660
 - Yeah, and you'd have to be like, you know,

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.740
 Ken hates jazz.

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:15.740
 We can't do that.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.540
 He will switch over immediately.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.900
 Actually, not that useful a message,

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.780
 to be honest, if I were sitting there in prison

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.340
 and I just finally decoded,

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:25.820
 "Oh, how the, what's the key to how I get out?"

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.060
 - We're on our way.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.820
 - I think I just hope you're well.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:30.700
 - At the moment, we're having a great time

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.620
 recording a pop song, but we'll be there soon, yeah.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.980
 - There's Morse code on Mars.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.820
 Anyone?

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.660
 - Yep.

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.820
 The Curiosity Rover leaves tire tracks

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.780
 and it has Morse code in those tire tracks.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.420
 This is JPL, but there's actually a practical use for it.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.820
 You're able to look at a picture

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.100
 and they know how big the tire tracks are

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.220
 because they design the wheels.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.060
 So then they can be like,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.620
 "Oh, okay, that's that much distance."

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.740
 - So very efficient, dead reckoning.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.700
 - Yes, that's exactly what it is, yeah.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:58.140
 - We should say what JPL stands for

00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.620
 is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.220
 which is NASA's the guys who built the rover, right?

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.060
 - Yes.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:04.540
 - That's very cool.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.380
 Do you know what 21 means in Morse code?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:08.220
 - No.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.220
 - So you used to have all the letters, obviously,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.100
 but it's so, it's such a pain to type out every letter,

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:12.940
 as Alex says.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.740
 So there are about 99 short codes,

00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:16.540
 which we're using the numbers from 1 to 99.

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.100
 21 is stop for meal.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:20.940
 So that's why you're not getting a reply.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.980
 88 is love and kisses.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.340
 I really like 28, which is, "Do you get my writing?"

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:28.820
 (laughing)

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:30.140
 - Really insecure hips to do it.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.140
 - What are the themes that are emerging

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.260
 in the last message I really want you to draw them out?

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.500
 - In, I've just remembered this,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.220
 which is so related to the original fact,

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:38.660
 but now we've slightly off topic,

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.580
 but there were people in World War II

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.700
 who claimed they could recognize a German accent

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.140
 in a pigeon.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:45.740
 And these were experts,

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.260
 'cause there were a lot of pigeon spies

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.300
 that people thought were coming over here.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.460
 - Coming over here, taking our information,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.020
 going back to Germany.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.860
 - Exactly.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.220
 And so experts claimed that they could recognize

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.260
 a German speaking Italian pigeon.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.620
 - This sounds to me like someone who knows his pigeons,

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:04.060
 and he can tell by looking at them,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.940
 but he comes up with a really clever way

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:07.260
 of sounding like he's the expert.

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.900
 Like, just say cool again.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.100
 (laughing)

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.900
 He just knows he's got brand dots, that's German,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.460
 but I'm not sure what's happening.

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.700
 - Is it the ones which the German spies have a tube

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.820
 on their leg, which has a message in it in German?

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:19.980
 - They've got a little monochole.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.460
 (laughing)

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.700
 A way that Moore's code has been used recently

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.140
 is in a chess tournament last year,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.220
 and it was used by an Italian chess player to cheat,

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.100
 but it was quite impressive, so it was one of the biggest,

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.180
 I think it was the biggest chess tournament in Italy,

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:39.180
 and this guy was ranked number 51,366 in the world,

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.220
 and he got to the penultimate round,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.460
 so apparently the tournament organizers were,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:45.940
 but it's suspicious up to that point anyway.

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.620
 And he kept on, he had his hand constantly under his armpit

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.180
 while he was playing,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.260
 and he was blinking in a most unusual manner apparently.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.380
 (laughing)

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.220
 - So he kept asking for the same song to be played

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.580
 over and over again.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.900
 - So eventually people was a bit dodgy,

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:04.140
 so they asked him to take off his shirt,

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.380
 and understandably actually, he said he wouldn't.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.700
 And so then they put him for a metal detector,

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:11.180
 and they found that there was a video camera

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:13.500
 and a little pendant that he was wearing around his neck,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.380
 and then there was a box under his armpit

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.980
 with a mass of wires going around his body,

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.300
 and that was transmitting signals to him

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.860
 from a computer or a friend who was telling him

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.020
 - The friend who was only number 49,000 in the world.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.180
 (laughing)

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.580
 - It's being cheating, there's a,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.020
 there's a spoke-or-vincan sport,

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.340
 a sort of competitive bird tweeting,

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.620
 where you have your bird in a box,

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.820
 and they measure how many Cisco eats it produces.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.300
 - What's a modern amount of time?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.460
 - A Cisco eat is just the name of the note of a chip,

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:43.660
 and if it goes a Cisco what, then it's a dud.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.900
 But they found, I think fairly recently there was a,

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.900
 it's a competition.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.740
 - So you have a bird,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:48.980
 and you have to make your bird produce more.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.740
 - You have a bird in a box,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.820
 you don't do anything to make it,

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.420
 you've just trained this bird to chirp.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.260
 - Okay.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:54.580
 - There's a huge amount of cheating

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:56.660
 in the Vincan sport, Finch singing.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.740
 - Or Cheeping.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:04.100
 - To the point where one year they opened up a box,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.460
 'cause they noticed that his bird

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.620
 cheaped the exact same number each time,

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:09.260
 and they found a CD play.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.060
 (laughing)

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.660
 - It hadn't struck the tournament organizers

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.620
 to have sort of transparent boxes.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.100
 - That suspicion was a rouse when he asked

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.020
 if he could plug in his Finch.

00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:19.980
 (laughing)

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.860
 - Does anyone have anything else before we move on?

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.180
 - Can we end this section with a stop?

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.100
 - Since it's that one's code.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.820
 - Yeah, you know we can, Alex, just stop.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.420
 (upbeat music)

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.740
 - Okay, time for our final fact this week,

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.140
 which is Anna.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.780
 - My fact this week is that Brava Snails

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.060
 have thicker shells.

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.380
 - This is so good, I love this one.

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.100
 - I like the snails, you have thicker.

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.340
 - It's like a fridge magnet, saying.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.140
 - Yeah, it is, it's work up ages, what does it mean?

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.460
 What are you trying to tell me?

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:51.460
 - If something you tell your children

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.460
 is not being bullied in the playground, I think.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.900
 - I can see, you're trying to work out.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.820
 - I'm just figuring out the wording,

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.500
 so snails with thicker shells are Brava.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.380
 - What a great question, we don't know.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.900
 So it could be either way around.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.220
 This is a study last year that was published

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.540
 in Biology Letters, which is the Royal Society

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.860
 Science Journal, published last year,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.980
 and it found that risk taking fresh water snails

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.420
 turned to have thicker, stronger, rounder shells.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.140
 But we don't actually know, so we can only hypothesize

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.700
 as to whether they've developed stronger shells

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.780
 because they're naturally very risk-taking,

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.580
 and so they need to mitigate that risk of predation

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.940
 by having a stronger shell,

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.220
 or whether they had a stronger shell,

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.900
 and so they went out and took more risks.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.300
 - I have never noticed a snail taking risks,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.700
 or being conspicuously brave, at burning buildings,

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.340
 it's never a snail coming out

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.060
 with the orphans over his shoulder.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.820
 - How do you define bravery in a snail?

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:45.820
 Like, what kinds of things?

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:48.260
 - Yeah, climbing up, saving children.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.180
 Yeah, so bolder snails are defined as snails

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.260
 who, when you scared them, and they retract

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.580
 to their neck back into their shell,

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.060
 they then start their neck back out again

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.340
 within 10 seconds, and the cowardly snails

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.700
 with those who exceeded the 10 second limit

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.660
 for sticking their neck back out again.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.180
 And also, I think the bolder snails

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.020
 had a wider aperture, so they had a bigger front door,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.020
 essentially.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.020
 (laughing)

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.460
 - That's really disgusting.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:12.060
 (laughing)

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.900
 - That's snail, snails are amazing.

00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:15.140
 We've never really talked about snails before.

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.580
 - That's unbelievable.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.860
 - That's who the snails go on.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.380
 - So, generally, in snails,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.060
 you can get a left hand of snails and right hand of snails,

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.660
 in the sense that some snails have a left spiraling shell

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.980
 and some snails have a right spiraling shell.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:28.420
 The first interesting thing is that,

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.340
 in most places around the world,

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.620
 the ratio of left spiraled to right spiraled snails

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.540
 is roughly the same as ratio of left hand

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:36.540
 of people to right hand people.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:38.740
 The reason that there aren't very many

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.220
 left hand of snails in most parts of the world

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.220
 is because it's very difficult for a left spiraled

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:44.940
 and right to spiral to snails to have sex.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.900
 In Japan, there's a snail called the Satsuma snail.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.380
 And there are a lot more left spiraling snails

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.300
 than right spiraling sounds there,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.900
 because they have a predator,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.500
 which is a snake that likes to eat them.

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.900
 And it has real difficulty latching on and biting down

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.460
 on snails with left spiraled shells.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.300
 - Wow.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.140
 - So they flourish.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.220
 - That is such a good example of natural selection.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.060
 - Yeah.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.300
 - Do you hear the story of in New Zealand,

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.140
 they have a giant snails that can grow the size of Hamburg,

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.700
 is it called the Puele Fanta?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.540
 - Oh.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.940
 - The Puele Fanta.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.260
 And in 2011, their habitat was on a particular,

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.460
 I think, plateau that was due to be mined.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.980
 And so the government in a mass operation moved these,

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.180
 I think something like 6,000 of these giant snails

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.700
 into these high-tech cool rooms, temperature controlled.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.060
 You know what's coming next.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.220
 - Oh no, they died.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.740
 - There was a glitch and the temperature plummeted to zero,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:37.540
 but no one noticed for ages because they

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:40.220
 didn't constantly check on the snails.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.500
 And half of the snails that hadn't been re-homed.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.260
 So I think something like 800 of 1,600 of these

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.100
 very rare snails die.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.940
 They're all killed.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.860
 - Oh, that ate them.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:51.100
 - Oh, fuck up.

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.340
 - Wow.

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.700
 - Have you heard of the giant African land snail?

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.540
 - No.

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:56.740
 - This is an amazing snail.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:57.740
 It's massive.

00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:00.500
 And they're really popular for eating.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.980
 And people keep on smuggling them around the world.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.140
 It's about 15 centimeters long, normally.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:06.980
 It's just pretty long, but it gets really big.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.340
 In 2005, there was a passenger coming through Heathrow

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.900
 who said she had something small to declare.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.540
 And she walked through the red line.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.940
 They looked in her luggage.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:20.940
 She had 104 kilos, 16 stone of snails in her luggage.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.460
 - 16 stone.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.340
 - Yeah, alive and with eggs all over the place.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.700
 Well, they're really popular to be eating.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.460
 One farmer in Austria sells snail caviar and snail livers.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.460
 And snail livers are also in spiral shapes.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.620
 - Are they amazing?

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.460
 - Amazing.

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.460
 Cool.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.940
 You know, speaking of smuggling snails, you know Patricia Heismith,

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.300
 the novelist who wrote Tanda Mr. Ripley of those books.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.380
 She wrote strangers on a train

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.980
 which was adapted into the Hitchcock film.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.180
 She hated people and loved snails at a snail obsession.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:54.660
 So she used to smuggle snails with her

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.100
 and she kept about 300 snails as pets.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:58.100
 Took them with her wherever she went.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:31:59.380
 When she went to a dinner party,

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.940
 she'd always have them in her handbag

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:02.420
 and then she'd get bored.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.340
 Many, many, a good proportion.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.060
 And then she'd whip them out and put them on the table

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.980
 and then she'd find the snails, right?

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:09.300
 - The snails, yes.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.460
 - No wonder people didn't like it.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.460
 I know why she didn't like people.

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460
 - She hated people.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.820
 She sometimes apparently traveled around

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:15.700
 with a snail under each breast.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.340
 (laughing)

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.540
 - Why would you invite that person to a dinner party?

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:23.300
 - There was a guy, I like this guy so much.

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.180
 He was a charity director called Lloyd Scott.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.420
 And in 2011, he dressed up as a snail

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.380
 to do the London marathon.

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.500
 It took him 26 days.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.780
 He raised 20,000 pounds doing so.

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:34.620
 One article wrote,

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.180
 "He has crawled for 26 days across broken glass,

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.220
 "nails, dog feces, enduring cramps, vomiting,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.180
 "and at least one trip to A&E."

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.300
 He has said he was reluctant to repeat the experience.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.220
 Right, so he gets to the end of the course.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.220
 Took him 26 days.

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.460
 - I know, and someone stepped on him and squashed him.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.220
 (laughing)

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.300
 - He was in a nine foot long snail costume

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.460
 dressed as Brian from the magic roundabout.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.500
 He was then sacked by the charity he worked for

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.020
 because he hadn't raised enough money doing it.

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.900
 - It's because he did cost more money to do it.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.100
 - Yeah, he'd incurred a loss, basically,

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.700
 and not raised enough money, and that's a result.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.460
 Imagine just crawling slowly towards the P-45

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.260
 at the other end of the way, it's so unkind.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:15.020
 Why wouldn't they sack him during it?

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.620
 Why would they wait until you've done the whole thing?

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:19.380
 - They do sound as sadistic people.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:21.420
 You're right, it's true.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.020
 - Just cheering him on all the way to the end.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.500
 - Snails, anuses, are...

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:27.500
 (laughing)

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.620
 - Got to talk about snails, anuses, for our snails.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.020
 Snails anuses are just above their heads.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.340
 - But they're not there for the whole lot?

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.540
 - No, so they start out at the back of them,

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.340
 and then they undergo the coiling process

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.580
 like the rest of the body.

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.020
 So I think the snail must be thrilled as it begins

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.540
 an embryo that it is bummers all the way at the back of it,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.620
 doesn't have anything to do with it,

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.740
 and it gradually grows up and around

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.180
 until it's perched right above its eye.

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:49.660
 - But it's a really weird thing that only happens

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.780
 to specific type of invertebrates,

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.420
 and it's basically a whole body just turns around.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.180
 - I'm unbelievably glad that only happens

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.580
 to a certain type of invertebrates.

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.500
 - Yeah, the ramifications of the cosmetic industry here

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.380
 would be huge into having bum replacements,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.980
 so that you looked young and beautiful again,

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:04.500
 'cause your bum was way your bummers.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.940
 Instead of on the back of your neck.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.780
 - That's a good point.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.300
 - Although you save an underpants, you just use a hat, right?

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.700
 - Right, point, yeah, pants and hats dub up as one.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.660
 - That's a small advantage to many disadvantaged people.

00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.660
 - As true, as you get older,

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.580
 you really want your ass to be as far away from you as possible.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.180
 - I was on pet snails.co.uk.

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.020
 - I'm really confused with pet snails.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.260
 (laughing)

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.380
 - But they have a list of problems

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.020
 that your snail can have,

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.060
 and the list of problems in killudes,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.460
 excessive mucous, swollen tentacles,

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.020
 and sudden multiple death.

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:42.820
 There's a page for what happens if I stepped on a snail.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:43.660
 What do I do?

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:44.860
 How can I resuscitate it?

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.700
 - What do you do?

00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.540
 - Well, the author then said,

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.700
 "If you found a snail that looks really mangled,

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:51.020
 or the internal organs sticking out of gaping cracks

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.340
 in the shell, et cetera, please call 111,

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.780
 but it's 999, it's over-stressed."

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.220
 - I euthanase them by stamping on them.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:00.060
 It sounds horrible,

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.140
 but it's far better than taking hours to dry out

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.780
 and die from desiccation.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:04.900
 - All right, good advice.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.740
 - Probably worth clarifying,

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.700
 'cause I always thought this is true,

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.740
 and it's not true that snails are built into their shells.

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:12.140
 They just live in their shells like a herb crab.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.220
 You don't turn into a slug if you take out a slug.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.260
 - How many snails did you remove?

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.420
 - I've gone anywhere near them.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.940
 (laughing)

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:21.540
 - Have you heard of semi slugs?

00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.420
 Does a slightly flaccid slug?

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.820
 (laughing)

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.980
 - I suppose that's what the permanently erect slugs

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.260
 you normally get.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.420
 - Oh, they're always like that.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.580
 Oh, me, I'm just saying.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.500
 (laughing)

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:36.420
 - You and Patricia Heismet, aren't they?

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:40.020
 - Semi slugs, they're slugs,

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.380
 which have got a shell on their back,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.660
 but it's not quite big enough for them

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.380
 to fit the whole body into,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.420
 but it's not quite completely vestigial yet,

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:49.100
 so they can kind of cram a bit of themselves into it.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.100
 (laughing)

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.900
 - I'm definitely still a size eight.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.980
 (laughing)

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:53.980
 I don't know, Boris, yeah.

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:56.060
 House is looking pretty small these days.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.660
 (upbeat music)

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.340
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.260
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.220
 If you have enjoyed this podcast,

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.700
 and you'd like to follow us on Twitter, you can do so.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.380
 I'm on @AndrewHunterM, Alex.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.940
 - @AlexBell_Ed.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.180
 - Ed @FoxTosser.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.020
 - Yeah.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.020
 - Which is a reference to Ed's previous book,

00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.900
 which is very good, either by that or the Phantom Atlas.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.180
 And Anna.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.380
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.780
 - There's also a group Twitter account,

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:29.980
 which is @QIPodcast,

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.980
 and if you want to listen to all our previous episodes

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:33.300
 of no such thing as a fish,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.740
 you can go to our website,

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.100
 which is qi.com/podcast.

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.180
 Also, the first 52 episodes of fish

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.700
 are now available to buy on iTunes,

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.980
 and they are not available on the website,

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.700
 so if you want to listen to them,

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.580
 you've got to shell out, like a snail.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.740
 - Okay.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:54.020
 - See what you did, man.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.980
 - We'll be back again next week with another podcast.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.420
 Thank you so much for listening, and goodbye.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.000
 (upbeat music)

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.580
 (upbeat music)

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:06.160
 (upbeat music)

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.740
 (upbeat music)
