00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
 (blues music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,220
 Hello and welcome back to another episode

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,860
 of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,460
 coming to you from the Kiwi offices in Covent Garden.

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,700
 My name is Andrew Hunter Murray

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,460
 and I'm sitting here with Anna Tijinsky,

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,420
 Alex Bell and special guest Ed Brooke Hitching.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,300
 Once again, we have gathered around the microphones

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,500
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,260
 and in no particular order, here we go.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,220
 Starting with you, Ed.

12
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,700
 - In 1875, the British Navy erased 123 islands

13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,560
 from their charts because they didn't exist.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,660
 - The British Navy didn't exist or the islands?

15
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,340
 - Yeah, you were gonna do that.

16
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,580
 No, it's, Phantom Islands were a huge problem

17
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,620
 when we were sorting out our charts.

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,700
 They were just, the maps were just cluttered with these things

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,100
 and mainly caused by human error,

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,420
 especially in a time before we could measure longitude,

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,180
 you would estimate your position with dead reckoning.

22
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,260
 And because of that, you had huge amounts

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,980
 of wildly inaccurate coordinates

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,620
 that would be fed back to cartographers,

25
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,020
 painted on maps and presented as facts.

26
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,820
 - So to be fair to them, they were often real islands.

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,540
 They just weren't anywhere near the places

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,340
 where they were told that they were.

29
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,460
 - To what extent is an island in a different place

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,460
 before it becomes a different island?

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,500
 - I'll give them a hundred miles leeway

32
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
 in any direction.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,340
 - Yeah, it's unbelievable.

34
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,140
 They're doing a job half right as well.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,300
 You're giving them too much.

36
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,540
 - You've gotta be loose with these poor charts.

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,940
 They didn't have longitude.

38
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,780
 - Okay.

39
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,180
 - Were there sort of mirages and things

40
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,060
 that meant people think they'd seen an island

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,980
 and they hadn't?

42
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,300
 - Yeah, there's a whole load of crazy natural phenomena

43
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,580
 presumably still out there waiting for you to think

44
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,620
 that you are seeing land when you're not.

45
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,940
 I mean, we're talking icebergs,

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,500
 but sometimes covered in dirt that can disguise them

47
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,060
 as an island, surrounded by sea gals.

48
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,900
 - Did somebody do that?

49
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,060
 Did somebody go to an iceberg?

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,060
 - It's put like a palm tree on it.

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,180
 - The biggest prank of all time.

52
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,020
 - America.

53
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,500
 - The whole thing just made up just all the back of the iceberg.

54
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,460
 - But there's also things like low-hanging clouds,

55
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,020
 which doesn't sound like you would mistake the solid land,

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,500
 but it's like this island, the fluffiest island

57
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,860
 and the whole South Pacific.

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,860
 - Is it still happening?

59
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
 Do we ever get?

60
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,700
 - Yes.

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,540
 - There's one in 2012.

62
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
 I was covered.

63
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
 Sandy Island got undiscovered.

64
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,540
 Yeah, it was in New Caledonia, just in Calsy.

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,340
 - Yeah, the North East Coast of Australia.

66
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,100
 - It was undiscovered then.

67
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,420
 - So everyone thought it was there

68
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,620
 and then eventually someone went there

69
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
 and there was nothing there.

70
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,460
 - Wow.

71
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,660
 - It had been on maps for a hundred years

72
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,660
 and it was discovered to be fake seven years

73
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,380
 after you launched Google Maps.

74
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,220
 - Yeah.

75
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,660
 - So you could, to a time, find it on Google Maps

76
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,860
 and you still can, but there's a little annotation saying,

77
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,700
 it's not...

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,700
 - It does not exist.

79
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
 - It sees refreshable browser.

80
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,300
 - How embarrassing, if you lived there,

81
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,780
 and you found out it wasn't real.

82
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,220
 - I feel like such an idiot.

83
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,740
 - Do you think some people do still try to build houses, though?

84
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,020
 You know, like if you go on a walk

85
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,060
 and you are insisting that you're following a footpath

86
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,420
 that you've obviously lost it,

87
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,820
 but you just keep hacking through the undergrowth.

88
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,140
 Doing there are people who are putting brick upon brick

89
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,980
 on a cloud.

90
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,020
 - On a cloud, yeah, yeah.

91
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,740
 - There was a radio DJ in the '60s

92
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,660
 who claimed to have broadcast a radio show

93
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,580
 from a reef called the Maria Teresa Reef

94
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,940
 that no one has ever been able to find.

95
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,220
 And he swore to his friends that he was there

96
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,740
 and the water was lapping up to his knees

97
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,500
 and his deck chair was floating away.

98
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
 - Maybe he just had a sound effect CD

99
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,100
 and he was like, "Oh, the water's really close."

100
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,220
 - He was in his mum's basement.

101
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,340
 - Yeah, exactly.

102
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,020
 - So three years ago, Pakistan got a new island,

103
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,700
 completely new island.

104
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,260
 They had an earthquake in the country

105
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,700
 'cause they're quite a couple of tectonic plates

106
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,740
 right up against each other there,

107
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,020
 hence the Himalayas.

108
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,540
 Anyway, after this earthquake,

109
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,260
 it disturbed a pocket of pressurized gas.

110
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,100
 And as a result, this entire section of the seabed

111
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,460
 rose up to the surface and bobbed around for a bit

112
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,940
 and until the gas underneath it was going to sort of collapse

113
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,740
 or get pressurized and then it sank again.

114
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,060
 But it was so unattractive as an island,

115
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,260
 it was just mud and silt and it was covered in dead fish

116
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,860
 which did not realize what was happening to it.

117
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,780
 It's not the side of mystical land appearing

118
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,940
 out of the sea that we all dream of.

119
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,100
 - It was much of a stir.

120
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,940
 - No wonder it sank.

121
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,540
 It was so horrible to me.

122
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,060
 - I think if I were a fish,

123
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,780
 I would manage to swim into the water.

124
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,100
 I mean, how quickly did this island pop up out of it?

125
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,820
 - What if you're a flatfish?

126
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,740
 And you're meant to be on this surface,

127
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,740
 you might not notice as it was rising.

128
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
 - Yeah, I see.

129
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,820
 - It's like getting scurriedy close.

130
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,580
 It's kind of like the fish's version of a tsunami.

131
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,420
 - Yes.

132
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,260
 - Do you know that there's no map containing the phrase

133
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,380
 "Hibby Dragons"?

134
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,340
 But there aren't two globes, ancient globes

135
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,020
 which do have the phrase "Hibby Dragons"

136
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,100
 or they have the Latin 'cause they were classy back then

137
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,620
 which is Hick Sun to Draconis

138
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,340
 and one of them is from 1510

139
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,500
 and it's one of the first ever European globes

140
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,020
 and one of them's from 1504

141
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,620
 and it's from ostrich eggs.

142
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,740
 That's what they made it out of.

143
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,220
 Take two ostrich eggs, cut them in half,

144
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,260
 glue them together, draw on globes.

145
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,100
 - Oh wow, yeah.

146
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
 - Do we think one day the sea will recede

147
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,980
 to reveal that there are in fact dragons there?

148
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,140
 - Wouldn't that be nice?

149
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,980
 - Wouldn't it be?

150
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,020
 - Well, you're getting island floating up

151
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,180
 with the dragon's flopping around like fish.

152
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
 (laughing)

153
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,180
 - Well, a lot of these monsters,

154
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,580
 they sort of they're painted on for stylistic flourishes

155
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,500
 and sometimes it's just not a lot of information.

156
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,780
 You've got to fill the blanks.

157
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,620
 (laughing)

158
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,300
 It's called horror vacuity.

159
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,740
 You know, these cartographers,

160
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,540
 they cannot ignore blank spaces.

161
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,300
 They have to fill it in with something.

162
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,340
 But there's one particular monster

163
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,940
 you sometimes see drawn on maps

164
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,260
 of South America in the Patagonian region

165
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,500
 and it's a giant, a giant couple

166
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,220
 and it usually says a Regium Gigantan region of the giants.

167
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,500
 The weird thing is that wasn't just a stylistic flourish.

168
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 It got to the point in 18th century London

169
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,820
 where they really believed there was a race of eight-foot giants

170
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,980
 that stalked the landscape in Patagonia

171
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,180
 and to the extent that I think Dr. Matthew Macy,

172
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,740
 Secretary of the British Royal Society,

173
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,900
 sent a letter to the French Academy of Sciences

174
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,980
 saying the existence of giants here is confirmed.

175
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,300
 - What?

176
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,340
 - And when they printed their journal,

177
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,500
 it came with a frontispiece illustration of one of the sailors

178
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,460
 and British sailors at that time were about five at five.

179
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,340
 One of the sailors giving them a biscuit.

180
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,020
 - It's just going to piece off.

181
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,300
 - So it was a massive bestseller.

182
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,140
 People wanted to see it.

183
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,980
 - Oh, wow.

184
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,140
 - Maybe they only viewed them from a distance

185
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,980
 and it was just that that area had slightly smaller trees.

186
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,340
 - Well, the thing is, they reckon that it was a native tribe

187
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,460
 that no longer exists of maybe six-foot tall men

188
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,220
 that still to a very short Englishman

189
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,500
 were laterifying.

190
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,220
 - I'm distanced in an element of exaggeration going on there,

191
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,420
 when a six-foot tall man morphs into a hereby giants type.

192
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,180
 They had six-foot tall people.

193
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,420
 And wasn't Washington older Lincoln six-foot?

194
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,660
 - Abraham Lincoln was six-foot-four.

195
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,940
 - I think that's with the hat, though.

196
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,180
 - I think it was even bigger with the hat.

197
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,100
 With the hat, he was about seven feet tall.

198
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,940
 - Wow.

199
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,780
 - Yeah.

200
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,140
 - They have a fully functional audio animatronic robot

201
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,420
 of him in Disneyland.

202
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,620
 - Is it fully functional?

203
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,620
 - Yeah, fully functional.

204
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,140
 - Does it emancipate slaves?

205
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,020
 - No, it just stands up, makes a speech.

206
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,260
 It's supposed to be exactly like him.

207
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
 - They're all the presidents.

208
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,380
 They're a whole hall for every single president of the United States

209
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,820
 and they all get up and talk and make speeches.

210
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,220
 - You watch Vida in YouTube, it's pretty weird and cool.

211
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,060
 - And it's very passionate.

212
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,900
 - Where is this?

213
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,740
 - Disneyland.

214
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,900
 - I'm sorry, when you said it,

215
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,940
 I just had a vision of all of them in a hall

216
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,580
 talking at the same time on their own.

217
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,860
 And it's just the most frightening, weird, unsettling.

218
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,780
 - They tag each other in, like restless.

219
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,660
 - On Fictitious Islands, so you were saying

220
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,140
 that there were various reasons that they got it wrong

221
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,700
 and they put islands in the wrong places.

222
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,420
 But they did also make them up, didn't they?

223
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,660
 They, like you say, they wanted stuff to happen.

224
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,140
 They didn't like empty space.

225
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,980
 And so I was reading about Benjamin Morel,

226
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
 who I assume you're a maps fan.

227
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,220
 - Benjamin Morel, I just find historical liars fascinating.

228
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,460
 - So what Benjamin Morel did is he made up

229
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,460
 a whole bunch of places in Ireland.

230
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,020
 So he made up this island called New South Greenland,

231
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,460
 near Antarctica, which didn't exist.

232
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,500
 And we thought it existed for a hundred years

233
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,860
 until I think a Shackleton expedition undiscovered it

234
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,420
 in between 1940 and 1917.

235
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,060
 They went there and said, oh, that's not here.

236
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,140
 But why did this guy do that?

237
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,620
 - Well, this is, I mean, voyages at that time

238
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,420
 and probably still are a business operation.

239
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,980
 You need to raise funds and sponsorship to do it.

240
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,460
 And people are more likely to give you money

241
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
 if it's exciting, if you're often an adventure.

242
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,460
 All he wanted to do was go and travel.

243
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,100
 He just wanted to live at sea.

244
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,620
 And so when he came back and he had a particularly

245
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,220
 an eventful trip, he had to sex it up somehow.

246
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,020
 So he invented as buyers island,

247
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,180
 there's Morels Land, was one of his, he claimed.

248
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,580
 - Oh, that's where the wheels started coming off

249
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,420
 the way he was asked.

250
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,500
 And what was the name of that that the locals had for it?

251
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,140
 Oh, Morels Land.

252
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,980
 - And so, yeah, that's how he secured funding.

253
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,260
 And so he was known as the biggest lion Pacific

254
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,020
 because of this tendency to just invent geography.

255
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,860
 - So we should say the reason that Ed knows

256
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,260
 so much about this is that you have written a book

257
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,380
 on this very subject, haven't you Ed?

258
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,060
 - Yeah, it's called the Phantom Atlas.

259
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,340
 And it comes out in November 3rd.

260
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,980
 And it's basically an Atlas of the world

261
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,460
 as we believed it to be, rather than how it actually existed.

262
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,180
 - There you go, Phantom Atlas, go and buy it.

263
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,980
 Not on the second of November, but on the third.

264
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,740
 'Cause on the second, it won't exist.

265
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,180
 - Yes, you'll be a bit disappointed.

266
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,020
 - Yeah.

267
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,540
 There are, isn't there an island somewhere called

268
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,660
 Disappointment Island?

269
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,500
 - Maybe it was one that Morel bigged up

270
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,380
 and then his son went and visited this paradise.

271
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,780
 - I made it ice cream and it's easy to me to say.

272
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,660
 - Turn out it's covered in dead fish.

273
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,540
 - Disappointment islands.

274
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,700
 One of the first Westerners to land there

275
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,140
 was John Byron, who was grandfather of Lord Byron.

276
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,980
 - I really though as well.

277
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,580
 - The man who discovered the Patagonian Giants.

278
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,740
 - Really? - Yeah.

279
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,580
 - Was John Byron.

280
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,100
 - Yeah, he was Captain of the Dolphin.

281
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,540
 - Wow. - Oh, cool.

282
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,980
 - And they called him Falweather Jack

283
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,500
 'cause he had this amazing knack

284
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,780
 of sailing always into enormous storms.

285
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,500
 - I think we've met before. - Yes, we've told you.

286
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,220
 - So the islands had already been called

287
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,260
 the Unfortunate Islands 'cause they didn't have

288
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,180
 a decent water supply on them.

289
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,980
 And that was by Magellan.

290
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,060
 - But they were called Disappointment Island

291
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,900
 for a different reason.

292
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,100
 It wasn't 'cause there wasn't any water.

293
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,940
 It was because John Byron found that the people

294
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,540
 who lived there were of a hostile disposition

295
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,380
 and they didn't like him.

296
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,220
 - That's a dick move.

297
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,060
 They had to rename someone.

298
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,580
 That's like, "You now live on bastard lanes."

299
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,140
 - I would aggressive, isn't it?

300
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,300
 - No, we were just a disappointment.

301
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,020
 - Yeah, he didn't call them fierce or frightening,

302
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,700
 which I think they would have been more flattered by

303
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,540
 to call someone Disappointment.

304
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,700
 - You've been a real disappointment.

305
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,740
 Yeah, we were really expecting good things

306
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,180
 from these islands and...

307
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,900
 - I bet he was really nice to their face as well.

308
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,220
 - It was really nice.

309
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,060
 - Lovely time, guys.

310
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,140
 - Thank you for the Candy Floss Brilliant Islands.

311
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,260
 We'll definitely call it that when we get back.

312
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,840
 (upbeat music)

313
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,940
 Okay, time now for fact number two,

314
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,500
 which is my fact this week is that the White House

315
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,420
 only got the ability to print on double-sided paper

316
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,340
 this year.

317
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,300
 - And was that the staff weren't trained well enough

318
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,300
 to understand?

319
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,260
 - It's a very hard little clickbox to find.

320
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,100
 - It's really easy.

321
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
 - It's very hard.

322
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,780
 - They've had the ability.

323
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
 They just...

324
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,060
 - No, this is the amazing thing

325
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,460
 is that they have not had the ability.

326
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,300
 It's incredible.

327
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,860
 The White House has just had a huge technological overhaul,

328
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,780
 which has meant that they can now print double-sided.

329
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,620
 They can do color printing.

330
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,300
 They don't all have to use blackberry phones.

331
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,540
 It's incredibly difficult to upgrade any technology

332
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,060
 in the White House, but partly because of security

333
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,580
 and partly because it's very complicated,

334
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,060
 but also there are four different offices

335
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,300
 which look after White House tech.

336
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,780
 So it's a complete nightmare.

337
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,580
 It's the National Security Council,

338
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,020
 Executive Office of the President,

339
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,100
 the Secret Services and the White House Communications Agency.

340
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,020
 And between them, nothing has been achieved for the last

341
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,860
 - Even to eat all of that expertise.

342
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,500
 They still can't get the opportunity to work.

343
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,580
 No one's got any hope.

344
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,420
 - No.

345
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,500
 - And they even, one thing they did,

346
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,260
 they had to remove lots of spare wiring

347
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,740
 that was just left in the walls of the building

348
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,140
 from previous systems that were no longer in use.

349
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,100
 They removed 13,000 pounds of wiring.

350
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,460
 So the White House has just lost 13,000 pounds in weight.

351
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,660
 - So when they renovated the situation room in 2067,

352
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,540
 up until that point, they were using cathode ray tube TV screens

353
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,300
 and fax machines and photos from the 80s.

354
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,140
 Like, you're absolutely right.

355
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,580
 It was a completely diet situation.

356
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,260
 And apparently it was a really disruptive overhaul.

357
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,020
 They found bits of a windows

358
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,820
 and the remains of a sunken courtyard

359
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
 that had been left over by previous presidents.

360
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,460
 They didn't know it was there.

361
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,220
 - So I think Roosevelt built in the White House,

362
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,820
 warm swimming pool and he used it

363
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,580
 for therapeutic swimming for his polio.

364
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,820
 So this was in the 1930s.

365
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,740
 There was a big opening in 1933.

366
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,100
 That was inside the White House.

367
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,980
 Various other presidents used it

368
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,500
 and then Nixon, fun lover that he was,

369
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,220
 decided to cover it up and build the press.

370
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,580
 - Classic Nixon.

371
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,220
 (laughing)

372
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,740
 - But he also installed the bowling alley there.

373
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,420
 So you know, he's nice and all.

374
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,580
 - That's true, yeah, yeah.

375
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,500
 - So Nixon covered it up and typically

376
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,740
 and he turned it into a press briefing room.

377
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,180
 But we only realized quite recently

378
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,500
 when they were excavating the White House

379
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
 or doing some building work.

380
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,420
 So the swimming pool is actually completely intact

381
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,260
 underneath it.

382
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,380
 So underneath this floor,

383
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,900
 underneath where the main White House press secretary stands

384
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,580
 is the deep end of the swimming pool

385
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,860
 and then goes up to the shallow end underneath there.

386
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,500
 - That's a fun metaphor for any of the secretary.

387
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,460
 We're putting you in the deep end.

388
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,380
 Presumably it's been drained.

389
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,820
 - I think it has been drained, yes.

390
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,420
 - Although Hillary Clinton expressed a while ago,

391
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,100
 I think when Bill was president,

392
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,500
 she expressed a desire to have that swimming pool back.

393
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,380
 So you never know if she wins.

394
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
 She might...

395
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,900
 - Stop all press briefings.

396
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,620
 - Stop the press briefings, get the pool back.

397
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,100
 That's gonna be a campaign slogan.

398
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,980
 - It's only we can have both

399
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,260
 and you have inflatable floating chairs

400
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,660
 for the press people.

401
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,100
 - That is a good idea.

402
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,340
 - And then to do length off and down there.

403
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,660
 - And then the press secretary

404
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,180
 can have a flamingo or something

405
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,660
 an inflatable flamingo to be on

406
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,780
 to show that position.

407
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,620
 (laughing)

408
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,700
 - You know, the secret service had to hide

409
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,660
 the front doorbell on the north side

410
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,260
 of the White House from Calvin Coolidge,

411
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,700
 the president, because he would prank them.

412
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,980
 And every time someone rang the doorbell

413
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,700
 that wasn't expected, obviously the secret service

414
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,540
 had to rush it.

415
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,380
 We're talking 1929.

416
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,660
 And he just loved doing it and then hiding in a bush

417
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,940
 and watching them arrive and be completely confused.

418
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,780
 (laughing)

419
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,300
 So when they finally figured out what he was doing,

420
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,140
 and this is from an article in Time.

421
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,940
 I'm not pulling this completely out.

422
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,780
 - Wow.

423
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,580
 - They hid the doorbell from him,

424
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,780
 so he couldn't do it again.

425
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,820
 After that, he was leaving bags of flaming dog shit

426
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,660
 on the doorbells.

427
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,500
 (laughing)

428
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,660
 - Of his own house.

429
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,780
 - My partner still has a blackberry, doesn't he?

430
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,100
 - But he really wants an iPhone.

431
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,940
 - Does he?

432
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:31,940
 - Yeah, he was saying, "Oh, it's a great phone,

433
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
 "but it doesn't take pictures.

434
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,220
 "You can't text, the phone doesn't work.

435
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,060
 "You can't pay music on it."

436
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,460
 And he's really jealous of his wife and kids

437
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,300
 because they've got cool phones

438
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
 and they can snap chat and stuff.

439
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,140
 And he was complaining.

440
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,500
 - That refers to sounds like a terrible phone

441
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,220
 if it can't text, take pictures or doing else.

442
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,420
 - That's actually the reason that he's not

443
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,980
 completely tearing up the Constitution

444
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,220
 and standing for a third term.

445
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,100
 - He would, but he wants that iPhone.

446
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,500
 - When you're the president,

447
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,860
 you still can't get the model of phone that you want.

448
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,820
 - Well, it's because it needs to be heavily modified,

449
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,060
 doesn't it, by the secret service?

450
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,260
 We'll have a phone, the president uses it.

451
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,540
 I think this is why.

452
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,580
 And so an iPhone is a little bit more difficult

453
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,740
 for them to hack into, I think.

454
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,020
 Or they've got to say much trouble

455
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,700
 by the time they've modified his bloody blackberry

456
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,020
 that when he comes back next year

457
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,780
 and says I want an upgrade, they say, "Sorry mate."

458
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,900
 - It's just the secret service.

459
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,980
 They're always modifying things.

460
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,980
 So we've talked before about the presidential cars

461
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,060
 and how they're modified.

462
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,700
 And I just get the idea of a blackberry,

463
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,380
 which has got three inches of armour plating on the outside.

464
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,620
 And there are seven decoys.

465
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,420
 So whenever he goes, "Which one is my phone?"

466
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
 - So another thing about early days of tech

467
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,580
 in the White House, the first ever telephone

468
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,900
 in the White House could only be used to call the treasury.

469
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,620
 And if you wanted to ring the White House,

470
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,300
 the treasury just had to pick up the phone and dial one.

471
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,500
 - That's so cool.

472
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,660
 - The phone number was one.

473
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,340
 - So printing.

474
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,860
 - Yes, printing.

475
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,900
 Let's talk about that.

476
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,740
 Did you know, you know heart, the Harold Angels thing?

477
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,580
 - Yeah.

478
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,420
 - The song.

479
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,260
 - The song.

480
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,380
 Do you know what relation that has to printing?

481
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,380
 - No.

482
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,860
 - That Mendelssohn wrote that tune

483
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,740
 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the printing press.

484
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,740
 - Wow.

485
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,780
 - Yeah, isn't that weird?

486
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,700
 It was for some celebrations in honour of Gutenberg.

487
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,540
 And yeah.

488
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,740
 - I didn't get that from the lyrics.

489
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,820
 I've said, I always thought it was...

490
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
 - Should have been called the Harold Angels print.

491
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,140
 In glory to the newborn Canon H.B. laser jet.

492
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,380
 (all laughing)

493
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,380
 That is very cool.

494
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,980
 - Yeah, so just to clarify,

495
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,780
 aside from these guys silly jokes,

496
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,540
 the lyrics were not the same at the time.

497
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,980
 They were in fact lyrics suitable

498
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,660
 to the celebration of Gutenberg.

499
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,660
 - Well, really so.

500
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,500
 - Yes.

501
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,900
 - It's just the music that we're talking about.

502
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,580
 - It was, yeah, so he wrote the tune

503
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,420
 and then someone else wrote the lyrics about,

504
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,460
 it was called the Gutenberg Cantata.

505
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,300
 - Wow.

506
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,180
 - And then later on it was repurposed.

507
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,660
 - Well, do you guys know the expression to a T

508
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,820
 when you're talking about knowing something very precisely

509
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,900
 that you play the bank robbery into a T?

510
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,660
 - Do you know what the T stands for?

511
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,500
 - No.

512
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,060
 - Tittle.

513
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,580
 And Tittle is the official name for the dot

514
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,740
 in a lowercase i that printers it.

515
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,580
 - Ah, really?

516
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,340
 - That is J.

517
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,780
 So the original phrase was to a Tittle.

518
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,340
 - So what's a jot thing?

519
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,140
 'Cause I know the phrase jot and Tittle.

520
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,900
 - Yeah, that's from the Bible.

521
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,720
 - What?

522
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,300
 - Yeah, to care not a jot or a Tittle.

523
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,220
 - Well, they people, they sound like characters on the Bible.

524
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,500
 - Oh, no, they won't be.

525
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,340
 (all laughing)

526
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,700
 - What kind of weird children's Bible are you reading?

527
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,220
 - Jobs and Tittle. - Jobs and Tittle.

528
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,220
 - And all these weird things.

529
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,340
 - They could, actually they could catch on as fancy names.

530
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,140
 Tittle, Tittle come and do your piano practice.

531
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,620
 Jot, it's definitely Jot is a boy's name

532
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,620
 and Tittle is a girl's name, I think.

533
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,500
 - Well, she's gonna have a rough time at school.

534
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,900
 - Did you know that on printing, publishing,

535
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,380
 the illustrator of the first ever nursery rhyme book

536
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,540
 was sued for selling porn?

537
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,220
 This was a guy called George Bickham, Jr.

538
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,180
 It was in the 1740s.

539
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:41,100
 And the nursery rhyme book was three inches by 1.75 inches,

540
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,340
 which is so sweet.

541
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,660
 (all laughing)

542
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,820
 I know, isn't that cool because it was a book for children,

543
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,980
 so it was child size.

544
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,140
 But then he went on to sell loads of porn,

545
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,780
 which makes me really wonder what was for me illustrations.

546
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,260
 - He put some saucy images in the first children's book.

547
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,660
 - Well, maybe he did, but I don't think he did.

548
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
 (all laughing)

549
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,500
 - Have you heard of the smallest ever inkjet printed picture

550
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,940
 this was done not so long ago?

551
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,460
 It's 0.08 millimeters by one millimeter

552
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,620
 and it's a picture of a few different tropical clownfish.

553
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,500
 It's the same as Nemo, basically.

554
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,780
 And it's unbelievable.

555
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,540
 It's done with a thing called quantum dots.

556
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,660
 The really weird thing is, the dots look

557
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,220
 like a different color according to what size they are.

558
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,220
 So obviously they're all absolutely tiny,

559
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,900
 but the very, very smallest ones look blue.

560
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,820
 There's slightly larger ones look green

561
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,500
 and then the bigger ones look red.

562
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,660
 So you can print different colors using the same ink.

563
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,500
 - What?

564
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,180
 - It's just using this, I think it's something to do with the light,

565
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,620
 but I'm not completely sure.

566
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,300
 - It's obviously, it's obviously something to do with light.

567
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,700
 - That's on the press police.

568
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
 (all laughing)

569
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,180
 - It's on the press police for dummies.

570
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,020
 (upbeat music)

571
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,180
 - Time for fact number three now and that is Alex.

572
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,900
 - My fact this week is that World War Two

573
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,180
 Morse code operators could recognize each other's accents

574
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,020
 over the line.

575
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,020
 - They were speaking in Morse code at the time, presumably.

576
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,100
 - Yes, yeah, so it's not even just World War Two operators.

577
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,940
 There's all operators.

578
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,020
 If you do Morse code a lot, if you're one of those kind of people,

579
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,180
 it's known as your fist.

580
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,500
 If you have a good fist or you have a poor fist,

581
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,340
 that means you've got a very kind of sloppy,

582
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,180
 bad way of typing in Morse code.

583
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,620
 - It means a completely different thing actually

584
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,180
 where I was brought up, but yeah.

585
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,260
 (all laughing)

586
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,140
 - And I grew up in a boxing community.

587
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,300
 - All right, just to make that ultra clear,

588
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,820
 go ahead and jump in, yeah.

589
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,100
 (all laughing)

590
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,220
 - Bit like, I guess it's like an antiation,

591
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,980
 but for Morse code, if you have a good fist,

592
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,980
 you Morse code very, exactly like I'm not doing now.

593
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,540
 You code very, very good.

594
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,380
 (all laughing)

595
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,060
 - Particularly, it's the way that I can never remember.

596
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,900
 - Just to be clear, is it the speed

597
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,460
 with which people are typing the letters or is it?

598
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,340
 - If you read it, it's everything.

599
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,100
 It's the rhythm, which you type.

600
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,220
 It's also, you would Morse differently depending

601
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,060
 on the type of instrument you're using.

602
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,420
 So there are different mechanisms in different things.

603
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,980
 So you would get different rhythms

604
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,140
 or different intonations of your Dawson dashes.

605
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,220
 - Could British Morse code people

606
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
 recognize individual German?

607
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,220
 - Yeah.

608
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,940
 - But it's not like, hello there.

609
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,780
 (all laughing)

610
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,460
 - It's a regional accent, yeah.

611
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,260
 - No, it sounds like it's exactly the equivalent of that.

612
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,500
 - Yeah, I know that there was,

613
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,220
 the people in Bletchley monitoring spy codes

614
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,780
 and speaking a lot with the same people

615
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,300
 from a long way, they never met,

616
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,500
 were able to recognize each other just from the Morse.

617
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,420
 - I remember one story, a lady talking,

618
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,820
 who worked at Bletchley, talking about it,

619
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,500
 and she felt that she knew the person

620
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,180
 who she was listening into so intimately

621
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,020
 that she referred to her as, I think, Maria.

622
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,220
 She gave her a name, and wow.

623
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,820
 - Even though you only hear,

624
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,980
 dot, dot, dash, dot, dash, dot, dot, wow.

625
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,100
 - Classic Maria.

626
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,860
 (all laughing)

627
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,340
 - There's this story about Thomas Edison.

628
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,260
 It's one of those probably apocryphal.

629
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
 After he went deaf, that he and his wife

630
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,380
 would communicate through Morse code.

631
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,660
 And so when they went to the theater,

632
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,620
 she would have his hand on his knee

633
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,900
 and would tap out the lines as he was performed,

634
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
 which, that would be pretty rapid

635
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,140
 and quite irritating, yapping.

636
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,340
 Especially for whoever's in the row in front of them.

637
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,340
 - Yeah.

638
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,900
 - Well, we sure she wasn't a Scotsie trying to say,

639
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,020
 "Excuse me, do I need the toilet?"

640
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,180
 Can you get up and let me know?

641
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,180
 (all laughing)

642
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,700
 - So on communicating in secret using Morse code,

643
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,980
 here is a cool thing.

644
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,060
 During the Second World War,

645
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,260
 there was a British prisoner of war

646
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,940
 who was imprisoned in Germany.

647
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,540
 He was called Major Alexis Castelli,

648
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,820
 and he was a sower.

649
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,940
 So he would sove to pass the time,

650
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,580
 very intricate, beautiful patterns,

651
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,100
 and there are bits of cross stitch.

652
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,020
 And there's one he did that's really nice.

653
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,380
 It says, you know, this piece of work

654
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,340
 was made by Major here at this castle on these dates.

655
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,060
 But around the edges, there are two borders,

656
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,580
 and they are little patterns of dots and dashes.

657
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,740
 And one of them says, "God save the king in Morse code."

658
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,660
 And the other one says, "Excuse my French, fuck Hitler."

659
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,700
 (all laughing)

660
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,740
 And it's amazing, and it was so nice and pretty

661
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,540
 that he was allowed to hang it on the wall

662
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,380
 at the prison camps.

663
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,900
 He was in, and none of the German guards

664
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,420
 ever spotted or deciphered that this was Morse code.

665
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,340
 - So risky, 'cause so many of them

666
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,580
 must have known Morse code.

667
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,420
 It was wartime.

668
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,700
 I thought everyone had to memorize it.

669
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
 - Unbelievable.

670
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,780
 - In 2010, members of the Colombian army

671
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,380
 were being held hostage by the guerrilla army

672
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,900
 in Gambia, the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia.

673
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,540
 And so the Colombian army wanted to get a message to them,

674
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,100
 and they decided the best way to do it

675
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 would be to commission a pop song,

676
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,500
 which had Morse code hidden inside it,

677
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,620
 and then find a way of getting it on air,

678
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,300
 broadcast on radio, so that they could get a message

679
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,460
 to their country.

680
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,260
 So at the various points in the chorus,

681
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,420
 they sing the words, "Listen to this message brother."

682
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,060
 And then after that, the beat is built around a Morse code message

683
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,860
 that says, "Nine people rescued your necks, don't lose hope."

684
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,020
 And they got through it, isn't it?

685
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,860
 - Wow.

686
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,620
 - And then there's an interview with a guy who said,

687
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,820
 "Yeah, I recognise you pretty much immediately,

688
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
 'cause I was expecting Morse code,

689
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,220
 and it was pretty blatant when I heard a,

690
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,700
 "Listen to this message."

691
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,540
 Yeah, it's amazing.

692
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,740
 - And I knew your accent, obviously,

693
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,860
 'cause of that extra long gap,

694
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,300
 if you leave it between the ear and the L.

695
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,620
 - It'd better be a good song as well.

696
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,300
 Otherwise, you just turn the radio off.

697
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,140
 - Yeah, that was the problem.

698
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
 They had to make it good,

699
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,180
 'cause they had to justify forcing radios,

700
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,380
 like, as in they had to try and get it on radio stations,

701
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,100
 so that it could be broadcast as a song on the radio.

702
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,220
 So it couldn't be awful, otherwise,

703
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,060
 people would get suspicious.

704
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,660
 - Yeah, and you'd have to be like, you know,

705
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,740
 Ken hates jazz.

706
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,740
 We can't do that.

707
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,540
 He will switch over immediately.

708
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,900
 Actually, not that useful a message,

709
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,780
 to be honest, if I were sitting there in prison

710
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,340
 and I just finally decoded,

711
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,820
 "Oh, how the, what's the key to how I get out?"

712
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,060
 - We're on our way.

713
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,820
 - I think I just hope you're well.

714
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,700
 - At the moment, we're having a great time

715
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,620
 recording a pop song, but we'll be there soon, yeah.

716
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,980
 - There's Morse code on Mars.

717
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,820
 Anyone?

718
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,660
 - Yep.

719
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,820
 The Curiosity Rover leaves tire tracks

720
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,780
 and it has Morse code in those tire tracks.

721
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,420
 This is JPL, but there's actually a practical use for it.

722
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,820
 You're able to look at a picture

723
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,100
 and they know how big the tire tracks are

724
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,220
 because they design the wheels.

725
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,060
 So then they can be like,

726
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,620
 "Oh, okay, that's that much distance."

727
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,740
 - So very efficient, dead reckoning.

728
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,700
 - Yes, that's exactly what it is, yeah.

729
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,140
 - We should say what JPL stands for

730
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,620
 is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

731
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,220
 which is NASA's the guys who built the rover, right?

732
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,060
 - Yes.

733
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,540
 - That's very cool.

734
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,380
 Do you know what 21 means in Morse code?

735
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,220
 - No.

736
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,220
 - So you used to have all the letters, obviously,

737
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,100
 but it's so, it's such a pain to type out every letter,

738
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,940
 as Alex says.

739
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,740
 So there are about 99 short codes,

740
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,540
 which we're using the numbers from 1 to 99.

741
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,100
 21 is stop for meal.

742
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,940
 So that's why you're not getting a reply.

743
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,980
 88 is love and kisses.

744
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,340
 I really like 28, which is, "Do you get my writing?"

745
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,820
 (laughing)

746
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,140
 - Really insecure hips to do it.

747
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,140
 - What are the themes that are emerging

748
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,260
 in the last message I really want you to draw them out?

749
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,500
 - In, I've just remembered this,

750
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,220
 which is so related to the original fact,

751
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,660
 but now we've slightly off topic,

752
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,580
 but there were people in World War II

753
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,700
 who claimed they could recognize a German accent

754
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,140
 in a pigeon.

755
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,740
 And these were experts,

756
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,260
 'cause there were a lot of pigeon spies

757
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,300
 that people thought were coming over here.

758
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,460
 - Coming over here, taking our information,

759
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,020
 going back to Germany.

760
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,860
 - Exactly.

761
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,220
 And so experts claimed that they could recognize

762
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,260
 a German speaking Italian pigeon.

763
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,620
 - This sounds to me like someone who knows his pigeons,

764
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,060
 and he can tell by looking at them,

765
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,940
 but he comes up with a really clever way

766
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,260
 of sounding like he's the expert.

767
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,900
 Like, just say cool again.

768
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,100
 (laughing)

769
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,900
 He just knows he's got brand dots, that's German,

770
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,460
 but I'm not sure what's happening.

771
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,700
 - Is it the ones which the German spies have a tube

772
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,820
 on their leg, which has a message in it in German?

773
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,980
 - They've got a little monochole.

774
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,460
 (laughing)

775
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,700
 A way that Moore's code has been used recently

776
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,140
 is in a chess tournament last year,

777
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,220
 and it was used by an Italian chess player to cheat,

778
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,100
 but it was quite impressive, so it was one of the biggest,

779
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,180
 I think it was the biggest chess tournament in Italy,

780
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,180
 and this guy was ranked number 51,366 in the world,

781
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,220
 and he got to the penultimate round,

782
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,460
 so apparently the tournament organizers were,

783
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,940
 but it's suspicious up to that point anyway.

784
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,620
 And he kept on, he had his hand constantly under his armpit

785
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,180
 while he was playing,

786
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,260
 and he was blinking in a most unusual manner apparently.

787
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,380
 (laughing)

788
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,220
 - So he kept asking for the same song to be played

789
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,580
 over and over again.

790
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,900
 - So eventually people was a bit dodgy,

791
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,140
 so they asked him to take off his shirt,

792
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,380
 and understandably actually, he said he wouldn't.

793
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,700
 And so then they put him for a metal detector,

794
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,180
 and they found that there was a video camera

795
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,500
 and a little pendant that he was wearing around his neck,

796
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,380
 and then there was a box under his armpit

797
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,980
 with a mass of wires going around his body,

798
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,300
 and that was transmitting signals to him

799
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,860
 from a computer or a friend who was telling him

800
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,020
 - The friend who was only number 49,000 in the world.

801
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,180
 (laughing)

802
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,580
 - It's being cheating, there's a,

803
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,020
 there's a spoke-or-vincan sport,

804
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,340
 a sort of competitive bird tweeting,

805
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,620
 where you have your bird in a box,

806
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,820
 and they measure how many Cisco eats it produces.

807
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,300
 - What's a modern amount of time?

808
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,460
 - A Cisco eat is just the name of the note of a chip,

809
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,660
 and if it goes a Cisco what, then it's a dud.

810
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,900
 But they found, I think fairly recently there was a,

811
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
 it's a competition.

812
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,740
 - So you have a bird,

813
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,980
 and you have to make your bird produce more.

814
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,740
 - You have a bird in a box,

815
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,820
 you don't do anything to make it,

816
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,420
 you've just trained this bird to chirp.

817
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,260
 - Okay.

818
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,580
 - There's a huge amount of cheating

819
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,660
 in the Vincan sport, Finch singing.

820
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,740
 - Or Cheeping.

821
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:04,100
 - To the point where one year they opened up a box,

822
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,460
 'cause they noticed that his bird

823
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,620
 cheaped the exact same number each time,

824
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,260
 and they found a CD play.

825
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,060
 (laughing)

826
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,660
 - It hadn't struck the tournament organizers

827
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,620
 to have sort of transparent boxes.

828
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,100
 - That suspicion was a rouse when he asked

829
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,020
 if he could plug in his Finch.

830
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,980
 (laughing)

831
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,860
 - Does anyone have anything else before we move on?

832
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,180
 - Can we end this section with a stop?

833
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,100
 - Since it's that one's code.

834
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,820
 - Yeah, you know we can, Alex, just stop.

835
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,420
 (upbeat music)

836
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:35,740
 - Okay, time for our final fact this week,

837
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,140
 which is Anna.

838
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,780
 - My fact this week is that Brava Snails

839
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,060
 have thicker shells.

840
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,380
 - This is so good, I love this one.

841
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,100
 - I like the snails, you have thicker.

842
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,340
 - It's like a fridge magnet, saying.

843
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,140
 - Yeah, it is, it's work up ages, what does it mean?

844
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,460
 What are you trying to tell me?

845
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,460
 - If something you tell your children

846
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,460
 is not being bullied in the playground, I think.

847
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,900
 - I can see, you're trying to work out.

848
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,820
 - I'm just figuring out the wording,

849
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,500
 so snails with thicker shells are Brava.

850
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,380
 - What a great question, we don't know.

851
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,900
 So it could be either way around.

852
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,220
 This is a study last year that was published

853
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,540
 in Biology Letters, which is the Royal Society

854
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,860
 Science Journal, published last year,

855
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,980
 and it found that risk taking fresh water snails

856
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,420
 turned to have thicker, stronger, rounder shells.

857
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,140
 But we don't actually know, so we can only hypothesize

858
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,700
 as to whether they've developed stronger shells

859
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,780
 because they're naturally very risk-taking,

860
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,580
 and so they need to mitigate that risk of predation

861
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,940
 by having a stronger shell,

862
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,220
 or whether they had a stronger shell,

863
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,900
 and so they went out and took more risks.

864
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,300
 - I have never noticed a snail taking risks,

865
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,700
 or being conspicuously brave, at burning buildings,

866
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,340
 it's never a snail coming out

867
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,060
 with the orphans over his shoulder.

868
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,820
 - How do you define bravery in a snail?

869
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,820
 Like, what kinds of things?

870
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,260
 - Yeah, climbing up, saving children.

871
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,180
 Yeah, so bolder snails are defined as snails

872
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,260
 who, when you scared them, and they retract

873
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,580
 to their neck back into their shell,

874
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,060
 they then start their neck back out again

875
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,340
 within 10 seconds, and the cowardly snails

876
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,700
 with those who exceeded the 10 second limit

877
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,660
 for sticking their neck back out again.

878
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,180
 And also, I think the bolder snails

879
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,020
 had a wider aperture, so they had a bigger front door,

880
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,020
 essentially.

881
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
 (laughing)

882
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,460
 - That's really disgusting.

883
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,060
 (laughing)

884
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,900
 - That's snail, snails are amazing.

885
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,140
 We've never really talked about snails before.

886
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,580
 - That's unbelievable.

887
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,860
 - That's who the snails go on.

888
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,380
 - So, generally, in snails,

889
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,060
 you can get a left hand of snails and right hand of snails,

890
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,660
 in the sense that some snails have a left spiraling shell

891
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,980
 and some snails have a right spiraling shell.

892
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,420
 The first interesting thing is that,

893
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,340
 in most places around the world,

894
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,620
 the ratio of left spiraled to right spiraled snails

895
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,540
 is roughly the same as ratio of left hand

896
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
 of people to right hand people.

897
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,740
 The reason that there aren't very many

898
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,220
 left hand of snails in most parts of the world

899
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
 is because it's very difficult for a left spiraled

900
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,940
 and right to spiral to snails to have sex.

901
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,900
 In Japan, there's a snail called the Satsuma snail.

902
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,380
 And there are a lot more left spiraling snails

903
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,300
 than right spiraling sounds there,

904
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,900
 because they have a predator,

905
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,500
 which is a snake that likes to eat them.

906
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,900
 And it has real difficulty latching on and biting down

907
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,460
 on snails with left spiraled shells.

908
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,300
 - Wow.

909
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,140
 - So they flourish.

910
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,220
 - That is such a good example of natural selection.

911
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
 - Yeah.

912
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,300
 - Do you hear the story of in New Zealand,

913
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,140
 they have a giant snails that can grow the size of Hamburg,

914
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,700
 is it called the Puele Fanta?

915
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,540
 - Oh.

916
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,940
 - The Puele Fanta.

917
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,260
 And in 2011, their habitat was on a particular,

918
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,460
 I think, plateau that was due to be mined.

919
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,980
 And so the government in a mass operation moved these,

920
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,180
 I think something like 6,000 of these giant snails

921
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,700
 into these high-tech cool rooms, temperature controlled.

922
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,060
 You know what's coming next.

923
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,220
 - Oh no, they died.

924
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,740
 - There was a glitch and the temperature plummeted to zero,

925
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,540
 but no one noticed for ages because they

926
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,220
 didn't constantly check on the snails.

927
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,500
 And half of the snails that hadn't been re-homed.

928
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,260
 So I think something like 800 of 1,600 of these

929
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,100
 very rare snails die.

930
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,940
 They're all killed.

931
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,860
 - Oh, that ate them.

932
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,100
 - Oh, fuck up.

933
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,340
 - Wow.

934
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,700
 - Have you heard of the giant African land snail?

935
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,540
 - No.

936
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,740
 - This is an amazing snail.

937
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,740
 It's massive.

938
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,500
 And they're really popular for eating.

939
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,980
 And people keep on smuggling them around the world.

940
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,140
 It's about 15 centimeters long, normally.

941
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,980
 It's just pretty long, but it gets really big.

942
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,340
 In 2005, there was a passenger coming through Heathrow

943
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,900
 who said she had something small to declare.

944
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,540
 And she walked through the red line.

945
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,940
 They looked in her luggage.

946
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,940
 She had 104 kilos, 16 stone of snails in her luggage.

947
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,460
 - 16 stone.

948
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,340
 - Yeah, alive and with eggs all over the place.

949
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,700
 Well, they're really popular to be eating.

950
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,460
 One farmer in Austria sells snail caviar and snail livers.

951
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,460
 And snail livers are also in spiral shapes.

952
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,620
 - Are they amazing?

953
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,460
 - Amazing.

954
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,460
 Cool.

955
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,940
 You know, speaking of smuggling snails, you know Patricia Heismith,

956
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:45,300
 the novelist who wrote Tanda Mr. Ripley of those books.

957
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,380
 She wrote strangers on a train

958
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,980
 which was adapted into the Hitchcock film.

959
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,180
 She hated people and loved snails at a snail obsession.

960
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,660
 So she used to smuggle snails with her

961
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,100
 and she kept about 300 snails as pets.

962
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
 Took them with her wherever she went.

963
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,380
 When she went to a dinner party,

964
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,940
 she'd always have them in her handbag

965
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,420
 and then she'd get bored.

966
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,340
 Many, many, a good proportion.

967
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,060
 And then she'd whip them out and put them on the table

968
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,980
 and then she'd find the snails, right?

969
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,300
 - The snails, yes.

970
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,460
 - No wonder people didn't like it.

971
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,460
 I know why she didn't like people.

972
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
 - She hated people.

973
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,820
 She sometimes apparently traveled around

974
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,700
 with a snail under each breast.

975
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,340
 (laughing)

976
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,540
 - Why would you invite that person to a dinner party?

977
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,300
 - There was a guy, I like this guy so much.

978
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,180
 He was a charity director called Lloyd Scott.

979
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,420
 And in 2011, he dressed up as a snail

980
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,380
 to do the London marathon.

981
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,500
 It took him 26 days.

982
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,780
 He raised 20,000 pounds doing so.

983
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,620
 One article wrote,

984
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,180
 "He has crawled for 26 days across broken glass,

985
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,220
 "nails, dog feces, enduring cramps, vomiting,

986
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,180
 "and at least one trip to A&E."

987
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,300
 He has said he was reluctant to repeat the experience.

988
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,220
 Right, so he gets to the end of the course.

989
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
 Took him 26 days.

990
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,460
 - I know, and someone stepped on him and squashed him.

991
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,220
 (laughing)

992
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,300
 - He was in a nine foot long snail costume

993
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,460
 dressed as Brian from the magic roundabout.

994
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,500
 He was then sacked by the charity he worked for

995
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,020
 because he hadn't raised enough money doing it.

996
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,900
 - It's because he did cost more money to do it.

997
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,100
 - Yeah, he'd incurred a loss, basically,

998
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,700
 and not raised enough money, and that's a result.

999
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,460
 Imagine just crawling slowly towards the P-45

1000
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,260
 at the other end of the way, it's so unkind.

1001
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,020
 Why wouldn't they sack him during it?

1002
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,620
 Why would they wait until you've done the whole thing?

1003
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,380
 - They do sound as sadistic people.

1004
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,420
 You're right, it's true.

1005
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,020
 - Just cheering him on all the way to the end.

1006
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,500
 - Snails, anuses, are...

1007
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
 (laughing)

1008
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,620
 - Got to talk about snails, anuses, for our snails.

1009
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,020
 Snails anuses are just above their heads.

1010
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,340
 - But they're not there for the whole lot?

1011
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,540
 - No, so they start out at the back of them,

1012
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,340
 and then they undergo the coiling process

1013
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,580
 like the rest of the body.

1014
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,020
 So I think the snail must be thrilled as it begins

1015
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,540
 an embryo that it is bummers all the way at the back of it,

1016
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,620
 doesn't have anything to do with it,

1017
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,740
 and it gradually grows up and around

1018
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,180
 until it's perched right above its eye.

1019
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,660
 - But it's a really weird thing that only happens

1020
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,780
 to specific type of invertebrates,

1021
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,420
 and it's basically a whole body just turns around.

1022
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,180
 - I'm unbelievably glad that only happens

1023
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,580
 to a certain type of invertebrates.

1024
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,500
 - Yeah, the ramifications of the cosmetic industry here

1025
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,380
 would be huge into having bum replacements,

1026
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,980
 so that you looked young and beautiful again,

1027
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,500
 'cause your bum was way your bummers.

1028
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,940
 Instead of on the back of your neck.

1029
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
 - That's a good point.

1030
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,300
 - Although you save an underpants, you just use a hat, right?

1031
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,700
 - Right, point, yeah, pants and hats dub up as one.

1032
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,660
 - That's a small advantage to many disadvantaged people.

1033
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
 - As true, as you get older,

1034
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,580
 you really want your ass to be as far away from you as possible.

1035
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,180
 - I was on pet snails.co.uk.

1036
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,020
 - I'm really confused with pet snails.

1037
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,260
 (laughing)

1038
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,380
 - But they have a list of problems

1039
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,020
 that your snail can have,

1040
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,060
 and the list of problems in killudes,

1041
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,460
 excessive mucous, swollen tentacles,

1042
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:39,020
 and sudden multiple death.

1043
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,820
 There's a page for what happens if I stepped on a snail.

1044
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,660
 What do I do?

1045
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,860
 How can I resuscitate it?

1046
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,700
 - What do you do?

1047
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,540
 - Well, the author then said,

1048
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,700
 "If you found a snail that looks really mangled,

1049
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,020
 or the internal organs sticking out of gaping cracks

1050
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,340
 in the shell, et cetera, please call 111,

1051
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,780
 but it's 999, it's over-stressed."

1052
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,220
 - I euthanase them by stamping on them.

1053
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,060
 It sounds horrible,

1054
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,140
 but it's far better than taking hours to dry out

1055
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,780
 and die from desiccation.

1056
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,900
 - All right, good advice.

1057
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,740
 - Probably worth clarifying,

1058
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,700
 'cause I always thought this is true,

1059
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,740
 and it's not true that snails are built into their shells.

1060
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,140
 They just live in their shells like a herb crab.

1061
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,220
 You don't turn into a slug if you take out a slug.

1062
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,260
 - How many snails did you remove?

1063
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,420
 - I've gone anywhere near them.

1064
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,940
 (laughing)

1065
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,540
 - Have you heard of semi slugs?

1066
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,420
 Does a slightly flaccid slug?

1067
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,820
 (laughing)

1068
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,980
 - I suppose that's what the permanently erect slugs

1069
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,260
 you normally get.

1070
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,420
 - Oh, they're always like that.

1071
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,580
 Oh, me, I'm just saying.

1072
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,500
 (laughing)

1073
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,420
 - You and Patricia Heismet, aren't they?

1074
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,020
 - Semi slugs, they're slugs,

1075
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,380
 which have got a shell on their back,

1076
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,660
 but it's not quite big enough for them

1077
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,380
 to fit the whole body into,

1078
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,420
 but it's not quite completely vestigial yet,

1079
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,100
 so they can kind of cram a bit of themselves into it.

1080
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
 (laughing)

1081
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,900
 - I'm definitely still a size eight.

1082
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,980
 (laughing)

1083
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,980
 I don't know, Boris, yeah.

1084
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,060
 House is looking pretty small these days.

1085
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,660
 (upbeat music)

1086
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:03,340
 - Okay, that's it, that's all of our facts.

1087
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,260
 Thank you so much for listening.

1088
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,220

 - Ed @FoxTosser.

1093
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,020
 - Yeah.

1094
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
 - Which is a reference to Ed's previous book,

1095
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,900
 which is very good, either by that or the Phantom Atlas.

1096
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,180
 And Anna.

1097
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,380
 - You can email podcast@QI.com.

1098
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,780
 - There's also a group Twitter account,

1099
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,980
 which is @QIPodcast,

1100
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
 and if you want to listen to all our previous episodes

1101
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,300
 of no such thing as a fish,

1102
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,740
 you can go to our website,

1103
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,100
 which is qi.com/podcast.

1104
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,180
 Also, the first 52 episodes of fish

1105
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,700
 are now available to buy on iTunes,

1106
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,980
 and they are not available on the website,

1107
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,700
 so if you want to listen to them,

1108
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,580
 you've got to shell out, like a snail.

1109
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,740
 - Okay.

1110
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,020
 - See what you did, man.

1111
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,980
 - We'll be back again next week with another podcast.

1112
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,420
 Thank you so much for listening, and goodbye.

1113
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,000
 (upbeat music)

1114
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,580
 (upbeat music)

1115
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:06,160
 (upbeat music)

1116
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,740
 (upbeat music)
