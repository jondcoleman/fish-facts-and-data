00:00:02,00:00:16,Hello and welcome back to another episode
00:00:16,00:00:18,"of no such thing as a fish, a weekly podcast"
00:00:18,00:00:21,coming to you from the Kiwi offices in Covent Garden.
00:00:21,00:00:22,My name is Andrew Hunter Murray
00:00:22,00:00:24,"and I'm sitting here with Anna Tijinsky,"
00:00:24,00:00:27,Alex Bell and special guest Ed Brooke Hitching.
00:00:27,00:00:29,"Once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:29,00:00:32,with our four favorite facts from the last seven days
00:00:32,00:00:35,"and in no particular order, here we go."
00:00:35,00:00:37,"Starting with you, Ed."
00:00:37,00:00:41,"- In 1875, the British Navy erased 123 islands"
00:00:41,00:00:44,from their charts because they didn't exist.
00:00:44,00:00:46,- The British Navy didn't exist or the islands?
00:00:46,00:00:49,"- Yeah, you were gonna do that."
00:00:49,00:00:52,"No, it's, Phantom Islands were a huge problem"
00:00:52,00:00:54,when we were sorting out our charts.
00:00:54,00:00:57,"They were just, the maps were just cluttered with these things"
00:00:57,00:01:01,"and mainly caused by human error,"
00:01:01,00:01:03,"especially in a time before we could measure longitude,"
00:01:03,00:01:07,you would estimate your position with dead reckoning.
00:01:07,00:01:09,"And because of that, you had huge amounts"
00:01:09,00:01:11,of wildly inaccurate coordinates
00:01:11,00:01:14,"that would be fed back to cartographers,"
00:01:14,00:01:17,painted on maps and presented as facts.
00:01:17,00:01:19,"- So to be fair to them, they were often real islands."
00:01:19,00:01:21,They just weren't anywhere near the places
00:01:21,00:01:23,where they were told that they were.
00:01:23,00:01:25,- To what extent is an island in a different place
00:01:25,00:01:28,before it becomes a different island?
00:01:28,00:01:30,- I'll give them a hundred miles leeway
00:01:30,00:01:31,in any direction.
00:01:31,00:01:32,"- Yeah, it's unbelievable."
00:01:32,00:01:34,They're doing a job half right as well.
00:01:34,00:01:35,You're giving them too much.
00:01:35,00:01:36,- You've gotta be loose with these poor charts.
00:01:36,00:01:37,They didn't have longitude.
00:01:37,00:01:38,- Okay.
00:01:38,00:01:40,- Were there sort of mirages and things
00:01:40,00:01:42,that meant people think they'd seen an island
00:01:42,00:01:42,and they hadn't?
00:01:42,00:01:46,"- Yeah, there's a whole load of crazy natural phenomena"
00:01:46,00:01:48,presumably still out there waiting for you to think
00:01:48,00:01:50,that you are seeing land when you're not.
00:01:50,00:01:52,"I mean, we're talking icebergs,"
00:01:52,00:01:56,but sometimes covered in dirt that can disguise them
00:01:56,00:01:59,"as an island, surrounded by sea gals."
00:01:59,00:01:59,- Did somebody do that?
00:01:59,00:02:01,Did somebody go to an iceberg?
00:02:01,00:02:02,- It's put like a palm tree on it.
00:02:02,00:02:04,- The biggest prank of all time.
00:02:04,00:02:05,- America.
00:02:05,00:02:07,- The whole thing just made up just all the back of the iceberg.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- But there's also things like low-hanging clouds,"
00:02:09,00:02:13,"which doesn't sound like you would mistake the solid land,"
00:02:13,00:02:16,"but it's like this island, the fluffiest island"
00:02:16,00:02:17,and the whole South Pacific.
00:02:17,00:02:18,- Is it still happening?
00:02:18,00:02:19,Do we ever get?
00:02:19,00:02:20,- Yes.
00:02:20,00:02:21,- There's one in 2012.
00:02:21,00:02:22,I was covered.
00:02:22,00:02:23,Sandy Island got undiscovered.
00:02:23,00:02:26,"Yeah, it was in New Caledonia, just in Calsy."
00:02:26,00:02:28,"- Yeah, the North East Coast of Australia."
00:02:28,00:02:30,- It was undiscovered then.
00:02:30,00:02:31,- So everyone thought it was there
00:02:31,00:02:32,and then eventually someone went there
00:02:32,00:02:33,and there was nothing there.
00:02:33,00:02:34,- Wow.
00:02:34,00:02:35,- It had been on maps for a hundred years
00:02:35,00:02:37,and it was discovered to be fake seven years
00:02:37,00:02:39,after you launched Google Maps.
00:02:39,00:02:40,- Yeah.
00:02:40,00:02:41,"- So you could, to a time, find it on Google Maps"
00:02:41,00:02:43,"and you still can, but there's a little annotation saying,"
00:02:43,00:02:44,it's not...
00:02:44,00:02:45,- It does not exist.
00:02:45,00:02:46,- It sees refreshable browser.
00:02:46,00:02:48,"- How embarrassing, if you lived there,"
00:02:48,00:02:49,and you found out it wasn't real.
00:02:49,00:02:52,- I feel like such an idiot.
00:02:52,00:02:54,"- Do you think some people do still try to build houses, though?"
00:02:54,00:02:56,"You know, like if you go on a walk"
00:02:56,00:02:58,and you are insisting that you're following a footpath
00:02:58,00:02:59,"that you've obviously lost it,"
00:02:59,00:03:01,but you just keep hacking through the undergrowth.
00:03:01,00:03:04,Doing there are people who are putting brick upon brick
00:03:04,00:03:04,on a cloud.
00:03:04,00:03:07,"- On a cloud, yeah, yeah."
00:03:07,00:03:08,- There was a radio DJ in the '60s
00:03:08,00:03:10,who claimed to have broadcast a radio show
00:03:10,00:03:13,from a reef called the Maria Teresa Reef
00:03:13,00:03:14,that no one has ever been able to find.
00:03:14,00:03:17,And he swore to his friends that he was there
00:03:17,00:03:18,and the water was lapping up to his knees
00:03:18,00:03:20,and his deck chair was floating away.
00:03:20,00:03:22,- Maybe he just had a sound effect CD
00:03:22,00:03:24,"and he was like, ""Oh, the water's really close."""
00:03:24,00:03:25,- He was in his mum's basement.
00:03:25,00:03:26,"- Yeah, exactly."
00:03:26,00:03:29,"- So three years ago, Pakistan got a new island,"
00:03:29,00:03:30,completely new island.
00:03:30,00:03:32,They had an earthquake in the country
00:03:32,00:03:34,'cause they're quite a couple of tectonic plates
00:03:34,00:03:36,"right up against each other there,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,hence the Himalayas.
00:03:39,00:03:40,"Anyway, after this earthquake,"
00:03:40,00:03:43,it disturbed a pocket of pressurized gas.
00:03:43,00:03:46,"And as a result, this entire section of the seabed"
00:03:46,00:03:49,rose up to the surface and bobbed around for a bit
00:03:49,00:03:52,and until the gas underneath it was going to sort of collapse
00:03:52,00:03:54,or get pressurized and then it sank again.
00:03:54,00:03:57,"But it was so unattractive as an island,"
00:03:57,00:04:00,it was just mud and silt and it was covered in dead fish
00:04:00,00:04:02,which did not realize what was happening to it.
00:04:02,00:04:04,It's not the side of mystical land appearing
00:04:04,00:04:05,out of the sea that we all dream of.
00:04:05,00:04:07,- It was much of a stir.
00:04:07,00:04:07,- No wonder it sank.
00:04:07,00:04:09,It was so horrible to me.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- I think if I were a fish,"
00:04:12,00:04:15,I would manage to swim into the water.
00:04:15,00:04:18,"I mean, how quickly did this island pop up out of it?"
00:04:18,00:04:19,- What if you're a flatfish?
00:04:19,00:04:21,"And you're meant to be on this surface,"
00:04:21,00:04:23,you might not notice as it was rising.
00:04:23,00:04:24,"- Yeah, I see."
00:04:24,00:04:25,- It's like getting scurriedy close.
00:04:25,00:04:28,It's kind of like the fish's version of a tsunami.
00:04:28,00:04:29,- Yes.
00:04:29,00:04:31,- Do you know that there's no map containing the phrase
00:04:31,00:04:32,"""Hibby Dragons""?"
00:04:32,00:04:35,"But there aren't two globes, ancient globes"
00:04:35,00:04:38,"which do have the phrase ""Hibby Dragons"""
00:04:38,00:04:40,or they have the Latin 'cause they were classy back then
00:04:40,00:04:42,which is Hick Sun to Draconis
00:04:42,00:04:45,and one of them is from 1510
00:04:45,00:04:47,and it's one of the first ever European globes
00:04:47,00:04:50,and one of them's from 1504
00:04:50,00:04:51,and it's from ostrich eggs.
00:04:51,00:04:52,That's what they made it out of.
00:04:52,00:04:54,"Take two ostrich eggs, cut them in half,"
00:04:54,00:04:56,"glue them together, draw on globes."
00:04:56,00:04:57,"- Oh wow, yeah."
00:04:57,00:04:59,- Do we think one day the sea will recede
00:04:59,00:05:00,to reveal that there are in fact dragons there?
00:05:00,00:05:02,- Wouldn't that be nice?
00:05:02,00:05:02,- Wouldn't it be?
00:05:02,00:05:04,"- Well, you're getting island floating up"
00:05:04,00:05:06,with the dragon's flopping around like fish.
00:05:06,00:05:07,(laughing)
00:05:07,00:05:08,"- Well, a lot of these monsters,"
00:05:08,00:05:10,they sort of they're painted on for stylistic flourishes
00:05:10,00:05:12,and sometimes it's just not a lot of information.
00:05:12,00:05:13,You've got to fill the blanks.
00:05:13,00:05:14,(laughing)
00:05:14,00:05:16,It's called horror vacuity.
00:05:16,00:05:18,"You know, these cartographers,"
00:05:18,00:05:20,they cannot ignore blank spaces.
00:05:20,00:05:22,They have to fill it in with something.
00:05:22,00:05:24,But there's one particular monster
00:05:24,00:05:26,you sometimes see drawn on maps
00:05:26,00:05:29,of South America in the Patagonian region
00:05:29,00:05:31,"and it's a giant, a giant couple"
00:05:31,00:05:35,and it usually says a Regium Gigantan region of the giants.
00:05:35,00:05:39,The weird thing is that wasn't just a stylistic flourish.
00:05:39,00:05:41,It got to the point in 18th century London
00:05:41,00:05:44,where they really believed there was a race of eight-foot giants
00:05:44,00:05:46,that stalked the landscape in Patagonia
00:05:46,00:05:50,"and to the extent that I think Dr. Matthew Macy,"
00:05:50,00:05:52,"Secretary of the British Royal Society,"
00:05:52,00:05:54,sent a letter to the French Academy of Sciences
00:05:54,00:05:57,saying the existence of giants here is confirmed.
00:05:57,00:05:59,- What?
00:05:59,00:06:01,"- And when they printed their journal,"
00:06:01,00:06:05,it came with a frontispiece illustration of one of the sailors
00:06:05,00:06:08,and British sailors at that time were about five at five.
00:06:08,00:06:10,One of the sailors giving them a biscuit.
00:06:10,00:06:12,- It's just going to piece off.
00:06:12,00:06:13,- So it was a massive bestseller.
00:06:13,00:06:14,People wanted to see it.
00:06:14,00:06:14,"- Oh, wow."
00:06:14,00:06:16,- Maybe they only viewed them from a distance
00:06:16,00:06:18,and it was just that that area had slightly smaller trees.
00:06:18,00:06:23,"- Well, the thing is, they reckon that it was a native tribe"
00:06:23,00:06:26,that no longer exists of maybe six-foot tall men
00:06:26,00:06:28,that still to a very short Englishman
00:06:28,00:06:29,were laterifying.
00:06:29,00:06:32,"- I'm distanced in an element of exaggeration going on there,"
00:06:32,00:06:37,when a six-foot tall man morphs into a hereby giants type.
00:06:37,00:06:39,They had six-foot tall people.
00:06:39,00:06:42,And wasn't Washington older Lincoln six-foot?
00:06:42,00:06:44,- Abraham Lincoln was six-foot-four.
00:06:44,00:06:45,"- I think that's with the hat, though."
00:06:45,00:06:48,- I think it was even bigger with the hat.
00:06:48,00:06:50,"With the hat, he was about seven feet tall."
00:06:50,00:06:50,- Wow.
00:06:50,00:06:51,- Yeah.
00:06:51,00:06:54,- They have a fully functional audio animatronic robot
00:06:54,00:06:55,of him in Disneyland.
00:06:55,00:06:57,- Is it fully functional?
00:06:57,00:06:58,"- Yeah, fully functional."
00:06:58,00:07:00,- Does it emancipate slaves?
00:07:00,00:07:02,"- No, it just stands up, makes a speech."
00:07:02,00:07:03,It's supposed to be exactly like him.
00:07:03,00:07:04,- They're all the presidents.
00:07:04,00:07:06,They're a whole hall for every single president of the United States
00:07:06,00:07:08,and they all get up and talk and make speeches.
00:07:08,00:07:11,"- You watch Vida in YouTube, it's pretty weird and cool."
00:07:11,00:07:12,- And it's very passionate.
00:07:12,00:07:12,- Where is this?
00:07:12,00:07:13,- Disneyland.
00:07:13,00:07:14,"- I'm sorry, when you said it,"
00:07:14,00:07:16,I just had a vision of all of them in a hall
00:07:16,00:07:19,talking at the same time on their own.
00:07:19,00:07:22,"And it's just the most frightening, weird, unsettling."
00:07:22,00:07:24,"- They tag each other in, like restless."
00:07:24,00:07:28,"- On Fictitious Islands, so you were saying"
00:07:28,00:07:31,that there were various reasons that they got it wrong
00:07:31,00:07:32,and they put islands in the wrong places.
00:07:32,00:07:35,"But they did also make them up, didn't they?"
00:07:35,00:07:37,"They, like you say, they wanted stuff to happen."
00:07:37,00:07:39,They didn't like empty space.
00:07:39,00:07:40,"And so I was reading about Benjamin Morel,"
00:07:40,00:07:42,who I assume you're a maps fan.
00:07:42,00:07:47,"- Benjamin Morel, I just find historical liars fascinating."
00:07:47,00:07:49,- So what Benjamin Morel did is he made up
00:07:49,00:07:51,a whole bunch of places in Ireland.
00:07:51,00:07:54,"So he made up this island called New South Greenland,"
00:07:54,00:07:55,"near Antarctica, which didn't exist."
00:07:55,00:07:58,And we thought it existed for a hundred years
00:07:58,00:08:01,until I think a Shackleton expedition undiscovered it
00:08:01,00:08:05,in between 1940 and 1917.
00:08:05,00:08:07,"They went there and said, oh, that's not here."
00:08:07,00:08:10,But why did this guy do that?
00:08:10,00:08:12,"- Well, this is, I mean, voyages at that time"
00:08:12,00:08:15,and probably still are a business operation.
00:08:15,00:08:17,You need to raise funds and sponsorship to do it.
00:08:17,00:08:20,And people are more likely to give you money
00:08:20,00:08:22,"if it's exciting, if you're often an adventure."
00:08:22,00:08:24,All he wanted to do was go and travel.
00:08:24,00:08:26,He just wanted to live at sea.
00:08:26,00:08:28,And so when he came back and he had a particularly
00:08:28,00:08:32,"an eventful trip, he had to sex it up somehow."
00:08:32,00:08:34,"So he invented as buyers island,"
00:08:34,00:08:37,"there's Morels Land, was one of his, he claimed."
00:08:37,00:08:39,"- Oh, that's where the wheels started coming off"
00:08:39,00:08:40,the way he was asked.
00:08:40,00:08:42,And what was the name of that that the locals had for it?
00:08:42,00:08:46,"Oh, Morels Land."
00:08:46,00:08:49,"- And so, yeah, that's how he secured funding."
00:08:49,00:08:54,And so he was known as the biggest lion Pacific
00:08:54,00:08:57,because of this tendency to just invent geography.
00:08:57,00:08:58,- So we should say the reason that Ed knows
00:08:58,00:09:01,so much about this is that you have written a book
00:09:01,00:09:03,"on this very subject, haven't you Ed?"
00:09:03,00:09:06,"- Yeah, it's called the Phantom Atlas."
00:09:06,00:09:07,And it comes out in November 3rd.
00:09:07,00:09:09,And it's basically an Atlas of the world
00:09:09,00:09:13,"as we believed it to be, rather than how it actually existed."
00:09:13,00:09:15,"- There you go, Phantom Atlas, go and buy it."
00:09:15,00:09:17,"Not on the second of November, but on the third."
00:09:17,00:09:19,"'Cause on the second, it won't exist."
00:09:19,00:09:21,"- Yes, you'll be a bit disappointed."
00:09:21,00:09:22,- Yeah.
00:09:22,00:09:24,"There are, isn't there an island somewhere called"
00:09:24,00:09:26,Disappointment Island?
00:09:26,00:09:28,- Maybe it was one that Morel bigged up
00:09:28,00:09:31,and then his son went and visited this paradise.
00:09:31,00:09:33,- I made it ice cream and it's easy to me to say.
00:09:33,00:09:35,- Turn out it's covered in dead fish.
00:09:35,00:09:37,- Disappointment islands.
00:09:37,00:09:41,One of the first Westerners to land there
00:09:41,00:09:46,"was John Byron, who was grandfather of Lord Byron."
00:09:46,00:09:46,- I really though as well.
00:09:46,00:09:49,- The man who discovered the Patagonian Giants.
00:09:49,00:09:50,- Really? - Yeah.
00:09:50,00:09:51,- Was John Byron.
00:09:51,00:09:53,"- Yeah, he was Captain of the Dolphin."
00:09:53,00:09:54,"- Wow. - Oh, cool."
00:09:54,00:09:55,- And they called him Falweather Jack
00:09:55,00:09:57,'cause he had this amazing knack
00:09:57,00:09:59,of sailing always into enormous storms.
00:09:59,00:10:01,"- I think we've met before. - Yes, we've told you."
00:10:01,00:10:03,- So the islands had already been called
00:10:03,00:10:05,the Unfortunate Islands 'cause they didn't have
00:10:05,00:10:07,a decent water supply on them.
00:10:07,00:10:08,And that was by Magellan.
00:10:08,00:10:10,- But they were called Disappointment Island
00:10:10,00:10:10,for a different reason.
00:10:10,00:10:12,It wasn't 'cause there wasn't any water.
00:10:12,00:10:14,It was because John Byron found that the people
00:10:14,00:10:17,who lived there were of a hostile disposition
00:10:17,00:10:18,and they didn't like him.
00:10:18,00:10:19,- That's a dick move.
00:10:19,00:10:20,They had to rename someone.
00:10:20,00:10:22,"That's like, ""You now live on bastard lanes."""
00:10:22,00:10:24,"- I would aggressive, isn't it?"
00:10:24,00:10:26,"- No, we were just a disappointment."
00:10:26,00:10:29,"- Yeah, he didn't call them fierce or frightening,"
00:10:29,00:10:30,which I think they would have been more flattered by
00:10:30,00:10:31,to call someone Disappointment.
00:10:31,00:10:33,- You've been a real disappointment.
00:10:33,00:10:35,"Yeah, we were really expecting good things"
00:10:35,00:10:37,from these islands and...
00:10:37,00:10:38,- I bet he was really nice to their face as well.
00:10:38,00:10:40,- It was really nice.
00:10:40,00:10:41,"- Lovely time, guys."
00:10:41,00:10:43,- Thank you for the Candy Floss Brilliant Islands.
00:10:43,00:10:45,We'll definitely call it that when we get back.
00:10:45,00:10:47,(upbeat music)
00:10:47,00:10:52,"Okay, time now for fact number two,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,which is my fact this week is that the White House
00:10:55,00:10:58,only got the ability to print on double-sided paper
00:10:58,00:11:00,this year.
00:11:00,00:11:02,- And was that the staff weren't trained well enough
00:11:02,00:11:03,to understand?
00:11:03,00:11:05,- It's a very hard little clickbox to find.
00:11:05,00:11:06,- It's really easy.
00:11:06,00:11:06,- It's very hard.
00:11:06,00:11:07,- They've had the ability.
00:11:07,00:11:08,They just...
00:11:08,00:11:10,"- No, this is the amazing thing"
00:11:10,00:11:11,is that they have not had the ability.
00:11:11,00:11:12,It's incredible.
00:11:12,00:11:15,"The White House has just had a huge technological overhaul,"
00:11:15,00:11:18,which has meant that they can now print double-sided.
00:11:18,00:11:20,They can do color printing.
00:11:20,00:11:24,They don't all have to use blackberry phones.
00:11:24,00:11:27,It's incredibly difficult to upgrade any technology
00:11:27,00:11:30,"in the White House, but partly because of security"
00:11:30,00:11:31,"and partly because it's very complicated,"
00:11:31,00:11:34,but also there are four different offices
00:11:34,00:11:36,which look after White House tech.
00:11:36,00:11:38,So it's a complete nightmare.
00:11:38,00:11:40,"It's the National Security Council,"
00:11:40,00:11:42,"Executive Office of the President,"
00:11:42,00:11:45,the Secret Services and the White House Communications Agency.
00:11:45,00:11:48,"And between them, nothing has been achieved for the last"
00:11:48,00:11:49,- Even to eat all of that expertise.
00:11:49,00:11:51,They still can't get the opportunity to work.
00:11:51,00:11:52,No one's got any hope.
00:11:52,00:11:53,- No.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"- And they even, one thing they did,"
00:11:54,00:11:57,they had to remove lots of spare wiring
00:11:57,00:11:58,that was just left in the walls of the building
00:11:58,00:12:01,from previous systems that were no longer in use.
00:12:01,00:12:05,"They removed 13,000 pounds of wiring."
00:12:05,00:12:07,"So the White House has just lost 13,000 pounds in weight."
00:12:07,00:12:11,"- So when they renovated the situation room in 2067,"
00:12:11,00:12:15,"up until that point, they were using cathode ray tube TV screens"
00:12:15,00:12:17,and fax machines and photos from the 80s.
00:12:17,00:12:18,"Like, you're absolutely right."
00:12:18,00:12:19,It was a completely diet situation.
00:12:19,00:12:22,And apparently it was a really disruptive overhaul.
00:12:22,00:12:24,They found bits of a windows
00:12:24,00:12:26,and the remains of a sunken courtyard
00:12:26,00:12:28,that had been left over by previous presidents.
00:12:28,00:12:29,They didn't know it was there.
00:12:29,00:12:33,"- So I think Roosevelt built in the White House,"
00:12:33,00:12:34,warm swimming pool and he used it
00:12:34,00:12:37,for therapeutic swimming for his polio.
00:12:37,00:12:38,So this was in the 1930s.
00:12:38,00:12:40,There was a big opening in 1933.
00:12:40,00:12:42,That was inside the White House.
00:12:42,00:12:43,Various other presidents used it
00:12:43,00:12:46,"and then Nixon, fun lover that he was,"
00:12:46,00:12:49,decided to cover it up and build the press.
00:12:49,00:12:50,- Classic Nixon.
00:12:50,00:12:52,(laughing)
00:12:52,00:12:54,- But he also installed the bowling alley there.
00:12:54,00:12:56,"So you know, he's nice and all."
00:12:56,00:12:57,"- That's true, yeah, yeah."
00:12:57,00:13:00,- So Nixon covered it up and typically
00:13:00,00:13:02,and he turned it into a press briefing room.
00:13:02,00:13:04,But we only realized quite recently
00:13:04,00:13:05,when they were excavating the White House
00:13:05,00:13:06,or doing some building work.
00:13:06,00:13:08,So the swimming pool is actually completely intact
00:13:08,00:13:09,underneath it.
00:13:09,00:13:10,"So underneath this floor,"
00:13:10,00:13:12,underneath where the main White House press secretary stands
00:13:12,00:13:14,is the deep end of the swimming pool
00:13:14,00:13:16,and then goes up to the shallow end underneath there.
00:13:16,00:13:18,- That's a fun metaphor for any of the secretary.
00:13:18,00:13:20,We're putting you in the deep end.
00:13:20,00:13:22,Presumably it's been drained.
00:13:22,00:13:23,"- I think it has been drained, yes."
00:13:23,00:13:26,"- Although Hillary Clinton expressed a while ago,"
00:13:26,00:13:28,"I think when Bill was president,"
00:13:28,00:13:30,she expressed a desire to have that swimming pool back.
00:13:30,00:13:32,So you never know if she wins.
00:13:32,00:13:33,She might...
00:13:33,00:13:34,- Stop all press briefings.
00:13:34,00:13:36,"- Stop the press briefings, get the pool back."
00:13:36,00:13:38,That's gonna be a campaign slogan.
00:13:38,00:13:38,- It's only we can have both
00:13:38,00:13:41,and you have inflatable floating chairs
00:13:41,00:13:42,for the press people.
00:13:42,00:13:44,- That is a good idea.
00:13:44,00:13:45,- And then to do length off and down there.
00:13:45,00:13:46,- And then the press secretary
00:13:46,00:13:48,can have a flamingo or something
00:13:48,00:13:49,an inflatable flamingo to be on
00:13:49,00:13:50,to show that position.
00:13:50,00:13:51,(laughing)
00:13:51,00:13:54,"- You know, the secret service had to hide"
00:13:54,00:13:56,the front doorbell on the north side
00:13:56,00:13:58,"of the White House from Calvin Coolidge,"
00:13:58,00:14:01,"the president, because he would prank them."
00:14:01,00:14:02,And every time someone rang the doorbell
00:14:02,00:14:04,"that wasn't expected, obviously the secret service"
00:14:04,00:14:05,had to rush it.
00:14:05,00:14:07,We're talking 1929.
00:14:07,00:14:09,And he just loved doing it and then hiding in a bush
00:14:09,00:14:11,and watching them arrive and be completely confused.
00:14:11,00:14:12,(laughing)
00:14:12,00:14:14,"So when they finally figured out what he was doing,"
00:14:14,00:14:16,and this is from an article in Time.
00:14:16,00:14:17,I'm not pulling this completely out.
00:14:17,00:14:18,- Wow.
00:14:18,00:14:20,"- They hid the doorbell from him,"
00:14:20,00:14:21,so he couldn't do it again.
00:14:21,00:14:23,"After that, he was leaving bags of flaming dog shit"
00:14:23,00:14:24,on the doorbells.
00:14:24,00:14:25,(laughing)
00:14:25,00:14:26,- Of his own house.
00:14:26,00:14:28,"- My partner still has a blackberry, doesn't he?"
00:14:28,00:14:30,- But he really wants an iPhone.
00:14:30,00:14:30,- Does he?
00:14:30,00:14:31,"- Yeah, he was saying, ""Oh, it's a great phone,"
00:14:31,00:14:32,"""but it doesn't take pictures."
00:14:32,00:14:34,"""You can't text, the phone doesn't work."
00:14:34,00:14:35,"""You can't pay music on it."""
00:14:35,00:14:36,And he's really jealous of his wife and kids
00:14:36,00:14:37,because they've got cool phones
00:14:37,00:14:38,and they can snap chat and stuff.
00:14:38,00:14:39,And he was complaining.
00:14:39,00:14:40,- That refers to sounds like a terrible phone
00:14:40,00:14:43,"if it can't text, take pictures or doing else."
00:14:43,00:14:45,- That's actually the reason that he's not
00:14:45,00:14:46,completely tearing up the Constitution
00:14:46,00:14:48,and standing for a third term.
00:14:48,00:14:51,"- He would, but he wants that iPhone."
00:14:51,00:14:52,"- When you're the president,"
00:14:52,00:14:54,you still can't get the model of phone that you want.
00:14:54,00:14:56,"- Well, it's because it needs to be heavily modified,"
00:14:56,00:14:58,"doesn't it, by the secret service?"
00:14:58,00:14:59,"We'll have a phone, the president uses it."
00:14:59,00:15:00,I think this is why.
00:15:00,00:15:02,And so an iPhone is a little bit more difficult
00:15:02,00:15:03,"for them to hack into, I think."
00:15:03,00:15:05,Or they've got to say much trouble
00:15:05,00:15:06,by the time they've modified his bloody blackberry
00:15:06,00:15:08,that when he comes back next year
00:15:08,00:15:09,"and says I want an upgrade, they say, ""Sorry mate."""
00:15:09,00:15:10,- It's just the secret service.
00:15:10,00:15:11,They're always modifying things.
00:15:11,00:15:14,So we've talked before about the presidential cars
00:15:14,00:15:16,and how they're modified.
00:15:16,00:15:17,"And I just get the idea of a blackberry,"
00:15:17,00:15:20,which has got three inches of armour plating on the outside.
00:15:20,00:15:22,And there are seven decoys.
00:15:22,00:15:25,"So whenever he goes, ""Which one is my phone?"""
00:15:25,00:15:27,- So another thing about early days of tech
00:15:27,00:15:29,"in the White House, the first ever telephone"
00:15:29,00:15:32,in the White House could only be used to call the treasury.
00:15:32,00:15:34,"And if you wanted to ring the White House,"
00:15:34,00:15:37,the treasury just had to pick up the phone and dial one.
00:15:37,00:15:38,- That's so cool.
00:15:38,00:15:39,- The phone number was one.
00:15:39,00:15:41,- So printing.
00:15:41,00:15:42,"- Yes, printing."
00:15:42,00:15:43,Let's talk about that.
00:15:43,00:15:46,"Did you know, you know heart, the Harold Angels thing?"
00:15:46,00:15:47,- Yeah.
00:15:47,00:15:48,- The song.
00:15:48,00:15:49,- The song.
00:15:49,00:15:51,Do you know what relation that has to printing?
00:15:51,00:15:52,- No.
00:15:52,00:15:54,- That Mendelssohn wrote that tune
00:15:54,00:15:58,to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the printing press.
00:15:58,00:15:59,- Wow.
00:15:59,00:16:00,"- Yeah, isn't that weird?"
00:16:00,00:16:03,It was for some celebrations in honour of Gutenberg.
00:16:03,00:16:04,And yeah.
00:16:04,00:16:05,- I didn't get that from the lyrics.
00:16:05,00:16:06,"I've said, I always thought it was..."
00:16:06,00:16:08,- Should have been called the Harold Angels print.
00:16:08,00:16:12,In glory to the newborn Canon H.B. laser jet.
00:16:12,00:16:14,(all laughing)
00:16:14,00:16:15,That is very cool.
00:16:15,00:16:16,"- Yeah, so just to clarify,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,"aside from these guys silly jokes,"
00:16:18,00:16:21,the lyrics were not the same at the time.
00:16:21,00:16:22,They were in fact lyrics suitable
00:16:22,00:16:24,to the celebration of Gutenberg.
00:16:24,00:16:25,"- Well, really so."
00:16:25,00:16:26,- Yes.
00:16:26,00:16:27,- It's just the music that we're talking about.
00:16:27,00:16:29,"- It was, yeah, so he wrote the tune"
00:16:29,00:16:31,"and then someone else wrote the lyrics about,"
00:16:31,00:16:33,it was called the Gutenberg Cantata.
00:16:33,00:16:34,- Wow.
00:16:34,00:16:36,- And then later on it was repurposed.
00:16:36,00:16:39,"- Well, do you guys know the expression to a T"
00:16:39,00:16:41,when you're talking about knowing something very precisely
00:16:41,00:16:43,that you play the bank robbery into a T?
00:16:43,00:16:45,- Do you know what the T stands for?
00:16:45,00:16:46,- No.
00:16:46,00:16:48,- Tittle.
00:16:48,00:16:50,And Tittle is the official name for the dot
00:16:50,00:16:52,in a lowercase i that printers it.
00:16:52,00:16:53,"- Ah, really?"
00:16:53,00:16:54,- That is J.
00:16:54,00:16:56,So the original phrase was to a Tittle.
00:16:56,00:16:58,- So what's a jot thing?
00:16:58,00:17:00,'Cause I know the phrase jot and Tittle.
00:17:00,00:17:01,"- Yeah, that's from the Bible."
00:17:01,00:17:02,- What?
00:17:02,00:17:04,"- Yeah, to care not a jot or a Tittle."
00:17:04,00:17:07,"- Well, they people, they sound like characters on the Bible."
00:17:07,00:17:08,"- Oh, no, they won't be."
00:17:08,00:17:09,(all laughing)
00:17:09,00:17:11,- What kind of weird children's Bible are you reading?
00:17:11,00:17:13,- Jobs and Tittle. - Jobs and Tittle.
00:17:13,00:17:14,- And all these weird things.
00:17:14,00:17:17,"- They could, actually they could catch on as fancy names."
00:17:17,00:17:21,"Tittle, Tittle come and do your piano practice."
00:17:21,00:17:23,"Jot, it's definitely Jot is a boy's name"
00:17:23,00:17:25,"and Tittle is a girl's name, I think."
00:17:25,00:17:27,"- Well, she's gonna have a rough time at school."
00:17:27,00:17:29,"- Did you know that on printing, publishing,"
00:17:29,00:17:33,the illustrator of the first ever nursery rhyme book
00:17:33,00:17:35,was sued for selling porn?
00:17:35,00:17:37,"This was a guy called George Bickham, Jr."
00:17:37,00:17:38,It was in the 1740s.
00:17:38,00:17:41,"And the nursery rhyme book was three inches by 1.75 inches,"
00:17:41,00:17:42,which is so sweet.
00:17:42,00:17:43,(all laughing)
00:17:43,00:17:45,"I know, isn't that cool because it was a book for children,"
00:17:45,00:17:46,so it was child size.
00:17:46,00:17:49,"But then he went on to sell loads of porn,"
00:17:49,00:17:51,which makes me really wonder what was for me illustrations.
00:17:51,00:17:54,- He put some saucy images in the first children's book.
00:17:54,00:17:56,"- Well, maybe he did, but I don't think he did."
00:17:56,00:17:59,(all laughing)
00:17:59,00:18:02,- Have you heard of the smallest ever inkjet printed picture
00:18:02,00:18:03,this was done not so long ago?
00:18:03,00:18:08,It's 0.08 millimeters by one millimeter
00:18:08,00:18:11,and it's a picture of a few different tropical clownfish.
00:18:11,00:18:13,"It's the same as Nemo, basically."
00:18:13,00:18:14,And it's unbelievable.
00:18:14,00:18:17,It's done with a thing called quantum dots.
00:18:17,00:18:20,"The really weird thing is, the dots look"
00:18:20,00:18:23,like a different color according to what size they are.
00:18:23,00:18:25,"So obviously they're all absolutely tiny,"
00:18:25,00:18:27,"but the very, very smallest ones look blue."
00:18:27,00:18:29,There's slightly larger ones look green
00:18:29,00:18:31,and then the bigger ones look red.
00:18:31,00:18:35,So you can print different colors using the same ink.
00:18:35,00:18:36,- What?
00:18:36,00:18:39,"- It's just using this, I think it's something to do with the light,"
00:18:39,00:18:40,but I'm not completely sure.
00:18:40,00:18:43,"- It's obviously, it's obviously something to do with light."
00:18:43,00:18:44,- That's on the press police.
00:18:44,00:18:45,(all laughing)
00:18:45,00:18:47,- It's on the press police for dummies.
00:18:47,00:18:50,(upbeat music)
00:18:50,00:18:55,- Time for fact number three now and that is Alex.
00:18:55,00:18:56,- My fact this week is that World War Two
00:18:56,00:19:00,Morse code operators could recognize each other's accents
00:19:00,00:19:01,over the line.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"- They were speaking in Morse code at the time, presumably."
00:19:04,00:19:07,"- Yes, yeah, so it's not even just World War Two operators."
00:19:07,00:19:07,There's all operators.
00:19:07,00:19:11,"If you do Morse code a lot, if you're one of those kind of people,"
00:19:11,00:19:12,it's known as your fist.
00:19:12,00:19:14,"If you have a good fist or you have a poor fist,"
00:19:14,00:19:16,"that means you've got a very kind of sloppy,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,bad way of typing in Morse code.
00:19:18,00:19:19,- It means a completely different thing actually
00:19:19,00:19:21,"where I was brought up, but yeah."
00:19:21,00:19:23,(all laughing)
00:19:23,00:19:25,- And I grew up in a boxing community.
00:19:25,00:19:27,"- All right, just to make that ultra clear,"
00:19:27,00:19:28,"go ahead and jump in, yeah."
00:19:28,00:19:30,(all laughing)
00:19:30,00:19:32,"- Bit like, I guess it's like an antiation,"
00:19:32,00:19:33,"but for Morse code, if you have a good fist,"
00:19:33,00:19:38,"you Morse code very, exactly like I'm not doing now."
00:19:38,00:19:42,"You code very, very good."
00:19:42,00:19:43,(all laughing)
00:19:43,00:19:45,"- Particularly, it's the way that I can never remember."
00:19:45,00:19:46,"- Just to be clear, is it the speed"
00:19:46,00:19:49,with which people are typing the letters or is it?
00:19:49,00:19:50,"- If you read it, it's everything."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"It's the rhythm, which you type."
00:19:52,00:19:55,"It's also, you would Morse differently depending"
00:19:55,00:19:57,on the type of instrument you're using.
00:19:57,00:19:59,So there are different mechanisms in different things.
00:19:59,00:20:00,So you would get different rhythms
00:20:00,00:20:04,or different intonations of your Dawson dashes.
00:20:04,00:20:06,- Could British Morse code people
00:20:06,00:20:08,recognize individual German?
00:20:08,00:20:09,- Yeah.
00:20:09,00:20:10,"- But it's not like, hello there."
00:20:10,00:20:11,(all laughing)
00:20:11,00:20:13,"- It's a regional accent, yeah."
00:20:13,00:20:15,"- No, it sounds like it's exactly the equivalent of that."
00:20:15,00:20:17,"- Yeah, I know that there was,"
00:20:17,00:20:20,the people in Bletchley monitoring spy codes
00:20:20,00:20:21,and speaking a lot with the same people
00:20:21,00:20:23,"from a long way, they never met,"
00:20:23,00:20:25,were able to recognize each other just from the Morse.
00:20:25,00:20:27,"- I remember one story, a lady talking,"
00:20:27,00:20:28,"who worked at Bletchley, talking about it,"
00:20:28,00:20:30,and she felt that she knew the person
00:20:30,00:20:32,who she was listening into so intimately
00:20:32,00:20:34,"that she referred to her as, I think, Maria."
00:20:34,00:20:36,"She gave her a name, and wow."
00:20:36,00:20:37,"- Even though you only hear,"
00:20:37,00:20:40,"dot, dot, dash, dot, dash, dot, dot, wow."
00:20:40,00:20:42,- Classic Maria.
00:20:42,00:20:44,(all laughing)
00:20:44,00:20:47,- There's this story about Thomas Edison.
00:20:47,00:20:49,It's one of those probably apocryphal.
00:20:49,00:20:51,"After he went deaf, that he and his wife"
00:20:51,00:20:53,would communicate through Morse code.
00:20:53,00:20:54,"And so when they went to the theater,"
00:20:54,00:20:56,she would have his hand on his knee
00:20:56,00:20:59,"and would tap out the lines as he was performed,"
00:20:59,00:21:01,"which, that would be pretty rapid"
00:21:01,00:21:03,"and quite irritating, yapping."
00:21:03,00:21:06,Especially for whoever's in the row in front of them.
00:21:06,00:21:07,- Yeah.
00:21:07,00:21:08,"- Well, we sure she wasn't a Scotsie trying to say,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,"""Excuse me, do I need the toilet?"""
00:21:10,00:21:11,Can you get up and let me know?
00:21:11,00:21:12,(all laughing)
00:21:12,00:21:14,"- So on communicating in secret using Morse code,"
00:21:14,00:21:15,here is a cool thing.
00:21:15,00:21:17,"During the Second World War,"
00:21:17,00:21:19,there was a British prisoner of war
00:21:19,00:21:21,who was imprisoned in Germany.
00:21:21,00:21:24,"He was called Major Alexis Castelli,"
00:21:24,00:21:26,and he was a sower.
00:21:26,00:21:28,"So he would sove to pass the time,"
00:21:28,00:21:30,"very intricate, beautiful patterns,"
00:21:30,00:21:32,and there are bits of cross stitch.
00:21:32,00:21:34,And there's one he did that's really nice.
00:21:34,00:21:35,"It says, you know, this piece of work"
00:21:35,00:21:38,was made by Major here at this castle on these dates.
00:21:38,00:21:41,"But around the edges, there are two borders,"
00:21:41,00:21:44,and they are little patterns of dots and dashes.
00:21:44,00:21:48,"And one of them says, ""God save the king in Morse code."""
00:21:48,00:21:51,"And the other one says, ""Excuse my French, fuck Hitler."""
00:21:51,00:21:54,(all laughing)
00:21:54,00:21:57,"And it's amazing, and it was so nice and pretty"
00:21:57,00:21:59,that he was allowed to hang it on the wall
00:21:59,00:22:00,at the prison camps.
00:22:00,00:22:01,"He was in, and none of the German guards"
00:22:01,00:22:04,ever spotted or deciphered that this was Morse code.
00:22:04,00:22:06,"- So risky, 'cause so many of them"
00:22:06,00:22:07,must have known Morse code.
00:22:07,00:22:08,It was wartime.
00:22:08,00:22:09,I thought everyone had to memorize it.
00:22:09,00:22:10,- Unbelievable.
00:22:10,00:22:13,"- In 2010, members of the Colombian army"
00:22:13,00:22:16,were being held hostage by the guerrilla army
00:22:16,00:22:18,"in Gambia, the revolutionary armed forces of Colombia."
00:22:18,00:22:21,"And so the Colombian army wanted to get a message to them,"
00:22:21,00:22:23,and they decided the best way to do it
00:22:23,00:22:25,"would be to commission a pop song,"
00:22:25,00:22:27,"which had Morse code hidden inside it,"
00:22:27,00:22:29,"and then find a way of getting it on air,"
00:22:29,00:22:32,"broadcast on radio, so that they could get a message"
00:22:32,00:22:33,to their country.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"So at the various points in the chorus,"
00:22:35,00:22:37,"they sing the words, ""Listen to this message brother."""
00:22:37,00:22:42,"And then after that, the beat is built around a Morse code message"
00:22:42,00:22:44,"that says, ""Nine people rescued your necks, don't lose hope."""
00:22:44,00:22:46,"And they got through it, isn't it?"
00:22:46,00:22:46,- Wow.
00:22:46,00:22:48,"- And then there's an interview with a guy who said,"
00:22:48,00:22:49,"""Yeah, I recognise you pretty much immediately,"
00:22:49,00:22:50,"'cause I was expecting Morse code,"
00:22:50,00:22:52,"and it was pretty blatant when I heard a,"
00:22:52,00:22:53,"""Listen to this message."""
00:22:53,00:22:54,"Yeah, it's amazing."
00:22:54,00:22:55,"- And I knew your accent, obviously,"
00:22:55,00:22:56,"'cause of that extra long gap,"
00:22:56,00:22:59,if you leave it between the ear and the L.
00:22:59,00:23:00,- It'd better be a good song as well.
00:23:00,00:23:02,"Otherwise, you just turn the radio off."
00:23:02,00:23:03,"- Yeah, that was the problem."
00:23:03,00:23:04,"They had to make it good,"
00:23:04,00:23:05,"'cause they had to justify forcing radios,"
00:23:05,00:23:07,"like, as in they had to try and get it on radio stations,"
00:23:07,00:23:10,so that it could be broadcast as a song on the radio.
00:23:10,00:23:11,"So it couldn't be awful, otherwise,"
00:23:11,00:23:12,people would get suspicious.
00:23:12,00:23:13,"- Yeah, and you'd have to be like, you know,"
00:23:13,00:23:14,Ken hates jazz.
00:23:14,00:23:15,We can't do that.
00:23:15,00:23:18,He will switch over immediately.
00:23:18,00:23:19,"Actually, not that useful a message,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,"to be honest, if I were sitting there in prison"
00:23:21,00:23:23,"and I just finally decoded,"
00:23:23,00:23:25,"""Oh, how the, what's the key to how I get out?"""
00:23:25,00:23:27,- We're on our way.
00:23:27,00:23:28,- I think I just hope you're well.
00:23:28,00:23:30,"- At the moment, we're having a great time"
00:23:30,00:23:33,"recording a pop song, but we'll be there soon, yeah."
00:23:33,00:23:36,- There's Morse code on Mars.
00:23:36,00:23:37,Anyone?
00:23:37,00:23:38,- Yep.
00:23:38,00:23:40,The Curiosity Rover leaves tire tracks
00:23:40,00:23:42,and it has Morse code in those tire tracks.
00:23:42,00:23:45,"This is JPL, but there's actually a practical use for it."
00:23:45,00:23:46,You're able to look at a picture
00:23:46,00:23:49,and they know how big the tire tracks are
00:23:49,00:23:50,because they design the wheels.
00:23:50,00:23:51,"So then they can be like,"
00:23:51,00:23:52,"""Oh, okay, that's that much distance."""
00:23:52,00:23:54,"- So very efficient, dead reckoning."
00:23:54,00:23:56,"- Yes, that's exactly what it is, yeah."
00:23:56,00:23:58,- We should say what JPL stands for
00:23:58,00:23:59,"is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,"
00:23:59,00:24:02,"which is NASA's the guys who built the rover, right?"
00:24:02,00:24:03,- Yes.
00:24:03,00:24:04,- That's very cool.
00:24:04,00:24:07,Do you know what 21 means in Morse code?
00:24:07,00:24:08,- No.
00:24:08,00:24:09,"- So you used to have all the letters, obviously,"
00:24:09,00:24:12,"but it's so, it's such a pain to type out every letter,"
00:24:12,00:24:12,as Alex says.
00:24:12,00:24:14,"So there are about 99 short codes,"
00:24:14,00:24:16,which we're using the numbers from 1 to 99.
00:24:16,00:24:18,21 is stop for meal.
00:24:18,00:24:20,So that's why you're not getting a reply.
00:24:20,00:24:22,88 is love and kisses.
00:24:22,00:24:26,"I really like 28, which is, ""Do you get my writing?"""
00:24:26,00:24:28,(laughing)
00:24:28,00:24:30,- Really insecure hips to do it.
00:24:30,00:24:32,- What are the themes that are emerging
00:24:32,00:24:34,in the last message I really want you to draw them out?
00:24:34,00:24:35,"- In, I've just remembered this,"
00:24:35,00:24:37,"which is so related to the original fact,"
00:24:37,00:24:38,"but now we've slightly off topic,"
00:24:38,00:24:40,but there were people in World War II
00:24:40,00:24:42,who claimed they could recognize a German accent
00:24:42,00:24:44,in a pigeon.
00:24:44,00:24:45,"And these were experts,"
00:24:45,00:24:47,'cause there were a lot of pigeon spies
00:24:47,00:24:49,that people thought were coming over here.
00:24:49,00:24:52,"- Coming over here, taking our information,"
00:24:52,00:24:54,going back to Germany.
00:24:54,00:24:55,- Exactly.
00:24:55,00:24:58,And so experts claimed that they could recognize
00:24:58,00:25:00,a German speaking Italian pigeon.
00:25:00,00:25:02,"- This sounds to me like someone who knows his pigeons,"
00:25:02,00:25:04,"and he can tell by looking at them,"
00:25:04,00:25:05,but he comes up with a really clever way
00:25:05,00:25:07,of sounding like he's the expert.
00:25:07,00:25:08,"Like, just say cool again."
00:25:08,00:25:10,(laughing)
00:25:10,00:25:11,"He just knows he's got brand dots, that's German,"
00:25:11,00:25:13,but I'm not sure what's happening.
00:25:13,00:25:15,- Is it the ones which the German spies have a tube
00:25:15,00:25:18,"on their leg, which has a message in it in German?"
00:25:18,00:25:19,- They've got a little monochole.
00:25:19,00:25:21,(laughing)
00:25:21,00:25:23,A way that Moore's code has been used recently
00:25:23,00:25:26,"is in a chess tournament last year,"
00:25:26,00:25:30,"and it was used by an Italian chess player to cheat,"
00:25:30,00:25:32,"but it was quite impressive, so it was one of the biggest,"
00:25:32,00:25:34,"I think it was the biggest chess tournament in Italy,"
00:25:34,00:25:39,"and this guy was ranked number 51,366 in the world,"
00:25:39,00:25:41,"and he got to the penultimate round,"
00:25:41,00:25:43,"so apparently the tournament organizers were,"
00:25:43,00:25:45,but it's suspicious up to that point anyway.
00:25:45,00:25:49,"And he kept on, he had his hand constantly under his armpit"
00:25:49,00:25:51,"while he was playing,"
00:25:51,00:25:54,and he was blinking in a most unusual manner apparently.
00:25:54,00:25:55,(laughing)
00:25:55,00:25:58,- So he kept asking for the same song to be played
00:25:58,00:25:59,over and over again.
00:25:59,00:26:01,"- So eventually people was a bit dodgy,"
00:26:01,00:26:04,"so they asked him to take off his shirt,"
00:26:04,00:26:06,"and understandably actually, he said he wouldn't."
00:26:06,00:26:08,"And so then they put him for a metal detector,"
00:26:08,00:26:11,and they found that there was a video camera
00:26:11,00:26:13,"and a little pendant that he was wearing around his neck,"
00:26:13,00:26:15,and then there was a box under his armpit
00:26:15,00:26:17,"with a mass of wires going around his body,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,and that was transmitting signals to him
00:26:20,00:26:22,from a computer or a friend who was telling him
00:26:22,00:26:26,"- The friend who was only number 49,000 in the world."
00:26:26,00:26:27,(laughing)
00:26:27,00:26:28,"- It's being cheating, there's a,"
00:26:28,00:26:30,"there's a spoke-or-vincan sport,"
00:26:30,00:26:32,"a sort of competitive bird tweeting,"
00:26:32,00:26:33,"where you have your bird in a box,"
00:26:33,00:26:36,and they measure how many Cisco eats it produces.
00:26:36,00:26:38,- What's a modern amount of time?
00:26:38,00:26:41,"- A Cisco eat is just the name of the note of a chip,"
00:26:41,00:26:43,"and if it goes a Cisco what, then it's a dud."
00:26:43,00:26:45,"But they found, I think fairly recently there was a,"
00:26:45,00:26:46,it's a competition.
00:26:46,00:26:47,"- So you have a bird,"
00:26:47,00:26:48,and you have to make your bird produce more.
00:26:48,00:26:49,"- You have a bird in a box,"
00:26:49,00:26:50,"you don't do anything to make it,"
00:26:50,00:26:52,you've just trained this bird to chirp.
00:26:52,00:26:53,- Okay.
00:26:53,00:26:54,- There's a huge amount of cheating
00:26:54,00:26:56,"in the Vincan sport, Finch singing."
00:26:56,00:26:57,- Or Cheeping.
00:26:57,00:27:04,"- To the point where one year they opened up a box,"
00:27:04,00:27:05,'cause they noticed that his bird
00:27:05,00:27:07,"cheaped the exact same number each time,"
00:27:07,00:27:09,and they found a CD play.
00:27:09,00:27:11,(laughing)
00:27:11,00:27:12,- It hadn't struck the tournament organizers
00:27:12,00:27:14,to have sort of transparent boxes.
00:27:14,00:27:16,- That suspicion was a rouse when he asked
00:27:16,00:27:18,if he could plug in his Finch.
00:27:18,00:27:19,(laughing)
00:27:19,00:27:21,- Does anyone have anything else before we move on?
00:27:21,00:27:24,- Can we end this section with a stop?
00:27:24,00:27:26,- Since it's that one's code.
00:27:26,00:27:28,"- Yeah, you know we can, Alex, just stop."
00:27:28,00:27:31,(upbeat music)
00:27:31,00:27:35,"- Okay, time for our final fact this week,"
00:27:35,00:27:37,which is Anna.
00:27:37,00:27:38,- My fact this week is that Brava Snails
00:27:38,00:27:41,have thicker shells.
00:27:41,00:27:42,"- This is so good, I love this one."
00:27:42,00:27:44,"- I like the snails, you have thicker."
00:27:44,00:27:46,"- It's like a fridge magnet, saying."
00:27:46,00:27:49,"- Yeah, it is, it's work up ages, what does it mean?"
00:27:49,00:27:50,What are you trying to tell me?
00:27:50,00:27:51,- If something you tell your children
00:27:51,00:27:53,"is not being bullied in the playground, I think."
00:27:53,00:27:54,"- I can see, you're trying to work out."
00:27:54,00:27:55,"- I'm just figuring out the wording,"
00:27:55,00:27:59,so snails with thicker shells are Brava.
00:27:59,00:28:01,"- What a great question, we don't know."
00:28:01,00:28:02,So it could be either way around.
00:28:02,00:28:05,This is a study last year that was published
00:28:05,00:28:07,"in Biology Letters, which is the Royal Society"
00:28:07,00:28:09,"Science Journal, published last year,"
00:28:09,00:28:12,and it found that risk taking fresh water snails
00:28:12,00:28:16,"turned to have thicker, stronger, rounder shells."
00:28:16,00:28:19,"But we don't actually know, so we can only hypothesize"
00:28:19,00:28:21,as to whether they've developed stronger shells
00:28:21,00:28:23,"because they're naturally very risk-taking,"
00:28:23,00:28:26,and so they need to mitigate that risk of predation
00:28:26,00:28:27,"by having a stronger shell,"
00:28:27,00:28:30,"or whether they had a stronger shell,"
00:28:30,00:28:32,and so they went out and took more risks.
00:28:32,00:28:36,"- I have never noticed a snail taking risks,"
00:28:36,00:28:39,"or being conspicuously brave, at burning buildings,"
00:28:39,00:28:41,it's never a snail coming out
00:28:41,00:28:43,with the orphans over his shoulder.
00:28:43,00:28:44,- How do you define bravery in a snail?
00:28:44,00:28:45,"Like, what kinds of things?"
00:28:45,00:28:48,"- Yeah, climbing up, saving children."
00:28:48,00:28:50,"Yeah, so bolder snails are defined as snails"
00:28:50,00:28:52,"who, when you scared them, and they retract"
00:28:52,00:28:53,"to their neck back into their shell,"
00:28:53,00:28:55,they then start their neck back out again
00:28:55,00:28:57,"within 10 seconds, and the cowardly snails"
00:28:57,00:28:59,with those who exceeded the 10 second limit
00:28:59,00:29:01,for sticking their neck back out again.
00:29:01,00:29:03,"And also, I think the bolder snails"
00:29:03,00:29:06,"had a wider aperture, so they had a bigger front door,"
00:29:06,00:29:07,essentially.
00:29:07,00:29:08,(laughing)
00:29:08,00:29:09,- That's really disgusting.
00:29:09,00:29:12,(laughing)
00:29:12,00:29:13,"- That's snail, snails are amazing."
00:29:13,00:29:15,We've never really talked about snails before.
00:29:15,00:29:16,- That's unbelievable.
00:29:16,00:29:18,- That's who the snails go on.
00:29:18,00:29:20,"- So, generally, in snails,"
00:29:20,00:29:22,"you can get a left hand of snails and right hand of snails,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,in the sense that some snails have a left spiraling shell
00:29:24,00:29:26,and some snails have a right spiraling shell.
00:29:26,00:29:28,"The first interesting thing is that,"
00:29:28,00:29:30,"in most places around the world,"
00:29:30,00:29:33,the ratio of left spiraled to right spiraled snails
00:29:33,00:29:35,is roughly the same as ratio of left hand
00:29:35,00:29:36,of people to right hand people.
00:29:36,00:29:38,The reason that there aren't very many
00:29:38,00:29:40,left hand of snails in most parts of the world
00:29:40,00:29:42,is because it's very difficult for a left spiraled
00:29:42,00:29:44,and right to spiral to snails to have sex.
00:29:44,00:29:47,"In Japan, there's a snail called the Satsuma snail."
00:29:47,00:29:50,And there are a lot more left spiraling snails
00:29:50,00:29:51,"than right spiraling sounds there,"
00:29:51,00:29:52,"because they have a predator,"
00:29:52,00:29:55,which is a snake that likes to eat them.
00:29:55,00:29:58,And it has real difficulty latching on and biting down
00:29:58,00:30:00,on snails with left spiraled shells.
00:30:00,00:30:01,- Wow.
00:30:01,00:30:02,- So they flourish.
00:30:02,00:30:04,- That is such a good example of natural selection.
00:30:04,00:30:05,- Yeah.
00:30:05,00:30:07,"- Do you hear the story of in New Zealand,"
00:30:07,00:30:10,"they have a giant snails that can grow the size of Hamburg,"
00:30:10,00:30:11,is it called the Puele Fanta?
00:30:11,00:30:12,- Oh.
00:30:12,00:30:13,- The Puele Fanta.
00:30:13,00:30:18,"And in 2011, their habitat was on a particular,"
00:30:18,00:30:20,"I think, plateau that was due to be mined."
00:30:20,00:30:22,"And so the government in a mass operation moved these,"
00:30:22,00:30:26,"I think something like 6,000 of these giant snails"
00:30:26,00:30:29,"into these high-tech cool rooms, temperature controlled."
00:30:29,00:30:31,You know what's coming next.
00:30:31,00:30:32,"- Oh no, they died."
00:30:32,00:30:35,"- There was a glitch and the temperature plummeted to zero,"
00:30:35,00:30:37,but no one noticed for ages because they
00:30:37,00:30:40,didn't constantly check on the snails.
00:30:40,00:30:43,And half of the snails that hadn't been re-homed.
00:30:43,00:30:46,"So I think something like 800 of 1,600 of these"
00:30:46,00:30:48,very rare snails die.
00:30:48,00:30:48,They're all killed.
00:30:48,00:30:49,"- Oh, that ate them."
00:30:49,00:30:51,"- Oh, fuck up."
00:30:51,00:30:52,- Wow.
00:30:52,00:30:54,- Have you heard of the giant African land snail?
00:30:54,00:30:55,- No.
00:30:55,00:30:56,- This is an amazing snail.
00:30:56,00:30:57,It's massive.
00:30:57,00:31:00,And they're really popular for eating.
00:31:00,00:31:02,And people keep on smuggling them around the world.
00:31:02,00:31:05,"It's about 15 centimeters long, normally."
00:31:05,00:31:06,"It's just pretty long, but it gets really big."
00:31:06,00:31:09,"In 2005, there was a passenger coming through Heathrow"
00:31:09,00:31:11,who said she had something small to declare.
00:31:11,00:31:13,And she walked through the red line.
00:31:13,00:31:14,They looked in her luggage.
00:31:14,00:31:20,"She had 104 kilos, 16 stone of snails in her luggage."
00:31:20,00:31:22,- 16 stone.
00:31:22,00:31:26,"- Yeah, alive and with eggs all over the place."
00:31:26,00:31:27,"Well, they're really popular to be eating."
00:31:27,00:31:32,One farmer in Austria sells snail caviar and snail livers.
00:31:32,00:31:35,And snail livers are also in spiral shapes.
00:31:35,00:31:36,- Are they amazing?
00:31:36,00:31:37,- Amazing.
00:31:37,00:31:38,Cool.
00:31:38,00:31:40,"You know, speaking of smuggling snails, you know Patricia Heismith,"
00:31:40,00:31:45,the novelist who wrote Tanda Mr. Ripley of those books.
00:31:45,00:31:46,She wrote strangers on a train
00:31:46,00:31:48,which was adapted into the Hitchcock film.
00:31:48,00:31:53,She hated people and loved snails at a snail obsession.
00:31:53,00:31:54,So she used to smuggle snails with her
00:31:54,00:31:57,and she kept about 300 snails as pets.
00:31:57,00:31:58,Took them with her wherever she went.
00:31:58,00:31:59,"When she went to a dinner party,"
00:31:59,00:32:00,she'd always have them in her handbag
00:32:00,00:32:02,and then she'd get bored.
00:32:02,00:32:04,"Many, many, a good proportion."
00:32:04,00:32:06,And then she'd whip them out and put them on the table
00:32:06,00:32:07,"and then she'd find the snails, right?"
00:32:07,00:32:09,"- The snails, yes."
00:32:09,00:32:10,- No wonder people didn't like it.
00:32:10,00:32:11,I know why she didn't like people.
00:32:11,00:32:12,- She hated people.
00:32:12,00:32:13,She sometimes apparently traveled around
00:32:13,00:32:15,with a snail under each breast.
00:32:15,00:32:17,(laughing)
00:32:17,00:32:20,- Why would you invite that person to a dinner party?
00:32:20,00:32:23,"- There was a guy, I like this guy so much."
00:32:23,00:32:25,He was a charity director called Lloyd Scott.
00:32:25,00:32:27,"And in 2011, he dressed up as a snail"
00:32:27,00:32:29,to do the London marathon.
00:32:29,00:32:31,It took him 26 days.
00:32:31,00:32:33,"He raised 20,000 pounds doing so."
00:32:33,00:32:34,"One article wrote,"
00:32:34,00:32:37,"""He has crawled for 26 days across broken glass,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,"""nails, dog feces, enduring cramps, vomiting,"
00:32:40,00:32:42,"""and at least one trip to A&E."""
00:32:42,00:32:45,He has said he was reluctant to repeat the experience.
00:32:45,00:32:47,"Right, so he gets to the end of the course."
00:32:47,00:32:48,Took him 26 days.
00:32:48,00:32:50,"- I know, and someone stepped on him and squashed him."
00:32:50,00:32:51,(laughing)
00:32:51,00:32:53,- He was in a nine foot long snail costume
00:32:53,00:32:55,dressed as Brian from the magic roundabout.
00:32:55,00:32:58,He was then sacked by the charity he worked for
00:32:58,00:33:01,because he hadn't raised enough money doing it.
00:33:01,00:33:02,- It's because he did cost more money to do it.
00:33:02,00:33:05,"- Yeah, he'd incurred a loss, basically,"
00:33:05,00:33:07,"and not raised enough money, and that's a result."
00:33:07,00:33:10,Imagine just crawling slowly towards the P-45
00:33:10,00:33:13,"at the other end of the way, it's so unkind."
00:33:13,00:33:15,Why wouldn't they sack him during it?
00:33:15,00:33:17,Why would they wait until you've done the whole thing?
00:33:17,00:33:19,- They do sound as sadistic people.
00:33:19,00:33:21,"You're right, it's true."
00:33:21,00:33:24,- Just cheering him on all the way to the end.
00:33:24,00:33:26,"- Snails, anuses, are..."
00:33:26,00:33:27,(laughing)
00:33:27,00:33:29,"- Got to talk about snails, anuses, for our snails."
00:33:29,00:33:32,Snails anuses are just above their heads.
00:33:32,00:33:33,- But they're not there for the whole lot?
00:33:33,00:33:35,"- No, so they start out at the back of them,"
00:33:35,00:33:37,and then they undergo the coiling process
00:33:37,00:33:38,like the rest of the body.
00:33:38,00:33:41,So I think the snail must be thrilled as it begins
00:33:41,00:33:43,"an embryo that it is bummers all the way at the back of it,"
00:33:43,00:33:44,"doesn't have anything to do with it,"
00:33:44,00:33:46,and it gradually grows up and around
00:33:46,00:33:48,until it's perched right above its eye.
00:33:48,00:33:49,- But it's a really weird thing that only happens
00:33:49,00:33:50,"to specific type of invertebrates,"
00:33:50,00:33:52,and it's basically a whole body just turns around.
00:33:52,00:33:54,- I'm unbelievably glad that only happens
00:33:54,00:33:55,to a certain type of invertebrates.
00:33:55,00:33:58,"- Yeah, the ramifications of the cosmetic industry here"
00:33:58,00:34:01,"would be huge into having bum replacements,"
00:34:01,00:34:02,"so that you looked young and beautiful again,"
00:34:02,00:34:04,'cause your bum was way your bummers.
00:34:04,00:34:05,Instead of on the back of your neck.
00:34:05,00:34:06,- That's a good point.
00:34:06,00:34:09,"- Although you save an underpants, you just use a hat, right?"
00:34:09,00:34:11,"- Right, point, yeah, pants and hats dub up as one."
00:34:11,00:34:14,- That's a small advantage to many disadvantaged people.
00:34:14,00:34:15,"- As true, as you get older,"
00:34:15,00:34:18,you really want your ass to be as far away from you as possible.
00:34:18,00:34:22,- I was on pet snails.co.uk.
00:34:22,00:34:24,- I'm really confused with pet snails.
00:34:24,00:34:26,(laughing)
00:34:26,00:34:28,- But they have a list of problems
00:34:28,00:34:30,"that your snail can have,"
00:34:30,00:34:32,"and the list of problems in killudes,"
00:34:32,00:34:36,"excessive mucous, swollen tentacles,"
00:34:36,00:34:39,and sudden multiple death.
00:34:39,00:34:42,There's a page for what happens if I stepped on a snail.
00:34:42,00:34:43,What do I do?
00:34:43,00:34:44,How can I resuscitate it?
00:34:44,00:34:45,- What do you do?
00:34:45,00:34:46,"- Well, the author then said,"
00:34:46,00:34:48,"""If you found a snail that looks really mangled,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,or the internal organs sticking out of gaping cracks
00:34:51,00:34:53,"in the shell, et cetera, please call 111,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,"but it's 999, it's over-stressed."""
00:34:56,00:34:59,- I euthanase them by stamping on them.
00:34:59,00:35:00,"It sounds horrible,"
00:35:00,00:35:02,but it's far better than taking hours to dry out
00:35:02,00:35:03,and die from desiccation.
00:35:03,00:35:04,"- All right, good advice."
00:35:04,00:35:05,"- Probably worth clarifying,"
00:35:05,00:35:06,"'cause I always thought this is true,"
00:35:06,00:35:09,and it's not true that snails are built into their shells.
00:35:09,00:35:12,They just live in their shells like a herb crab.
00:35:12,00:35:15,You don't turn into a slug if you take out a slug.
00:35:15,00:35:17,- How many snails did you remove?
00:35:17,00:35:18,- I've gone anywhere near them.
00:35:18,00:35:19,(laughing)
00:35:19,00:35:21,- Have you heard of semi slugs?
00:35:21,00:35:23,Does a slightly flaccid slug?
00:35:23,00:35:25,(laughing)
00:35:25,00:35:27,- I suppose that's what the permanently erect slugs
00:35:27,00:35:29,you normally get.
00:35:29,00:35:30,"- Oh, they're always like that."
00:35:30,00:35:31,"Oh, me, I'm just saying."
00:35:31,00:35:34,(laughing)
00:35:34,00:35:36,"- You and Patricia Heismet, aren't they?"
00:35:36,00:35:40,"- Semi slugs, they're slugs,"
00:35:40,00:35:41,"which have got a shell on their back,"
00:35:41,00:35:42,but it's not quite big enough for them
00:35:42,00:35:44,"to fit the whole body into,"
00:35:44,00:35:46,"but it's not quite completely vestigial yet,"
00:35:46,00:35:49,so they can kind of cram a bit of themselves into it.
00:35:49,00:35:50,(laughing)
00:35:50,00:35:51,- I'm definitely still a size eight.
00:35:51,00:35:52,(laughing)
