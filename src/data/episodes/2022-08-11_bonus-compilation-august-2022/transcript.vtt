 [Music]

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:16.700
 Hi everyone, James here. Welcome to your second ever bit of bonus material for members of Club Fish.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.300
 And that is a compilation of some outtakes from the last month.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.000
 Now, a bit of behind the scenes stuff. When we record fish in the office, we tend to record for about an hour and a half, sometimes a little bit more.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.600
 And what you get is only an hour. That's because we cut it right down to try and make it as fun as possible.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.800
 But what that means is sometimes we lose some really, really good materials. Some stuff that we really liked, some facts that we really liked, some silly jokes that we really liked.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800
 There was just no space for them. And now we have a space for more stuff.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.200
 So instead of putting compilations out every now and then, when we're on holiday or over Christmas, we're going to put them out regularly on this channel.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:03.700
 Really hope you enjoy this. Anyway, these things are always great fun to make and really good fun for me to listen back to all those bits that we cut out.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 Don't forget, this is stuff that you would not have heard if you hadn't signed up for Club Fish. So thank you so much for doing that.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 We really do appreciate you supporting Fish. And here we go on with the outtakes.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.900
 They've done DNA mapping on Richard the Third's body. I don't think we've mentioned this. We talked ages ago about when Richard the Third's body was dug up.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 Episode one. Cast your minds back. You don't remember it, but later, then shame on you.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.700
 So they've DNA mapped it. I think it's mainly someone called Professor Turi King, who's gone through doing this DNA mapping.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.400
 And she talks a lot about how, you know, when someone like Josh Whitcombe goes on, "Who do you think you are?" and says, "Oh, I'm descended from Edward the First."

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.900
 Turi King will pipe up and say, "Literally everyone is." Or like, "Six million people are."

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 They always cut that scene out at the end when he's crying, Turi comes on. Mate, big deal.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 Anyway, they've done the DNA mapping, taking Richard's body and then comparing it to the people who should be descended from him today.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 And the Royal Family also should be descended from him because I think they shared an uncle, the Royal Family, today.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 And there is no relation. So we know for sure that in the 19 links in the chain of Royal Families from Richard the Third down to the Royal Family today,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.900
 someone was illegitimate.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.400
 Oh, cool. Gotts, what great gotts. Good gotts, isn't it?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.900
 George the Third.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.400
 That's really exciting though.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400
 Yeah, scandalous.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.900
 Who do you think you aren't?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.900
 Who do you think is your aunt?

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.900
 Well, she's your mum, actually. And the milkman's your dad.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:49.900
 My phone presents that photo, James, of you and me with a koala, more often than any other emotionally significant photo of my life.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 Pretty much every other day my phone says to me, "Remember this?"

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 That was a great moment. Yeah, it was. It was amazing.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.900
 The Haudenosaunee people up in New York and in Canada, they have some really cool legends.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.900
 A lot of their legends are really rooted in La Crosse because it was such an important thing.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.900
 But La Crosse was how bats were invented, again, according to their legend.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 The animal.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 The animal, yes.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.900
 Really?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:21.900
 Yeah. So this was this old legend, again legend, which is that there was a game between the birds and the four-legged animals.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.900
 And so the birds had a wise old owl, the animals had a bear, and a mouse and a squirrel ran up to the four-legged animals and went,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900
 "Well, where are we playing? What position are we in that high-pitched voice?"

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.900
 And the four-legged animal said, "Well, you're way too small and crap. Go away. You're not playing."

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.900
 So they went up to the birds' team and they said, "Well, can we play for you?"

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.900
 And the birds were like, "What are we going to do?"

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.900
 And so they made them some wings. They made one of them wings out of leather and it turned into a bat.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 Oh, I thought you were going to say that they had sex with the mouse and then the offspring had wings.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.900
 That would have been slightly more viable, almost.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900
 Not really.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.900
 In the last year, New Yorkers made 311 complaints about other people having sex.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.900
 It's almost all volume-related.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.900
 Alright, it's not, "Why am I not having sex?"

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.900
 Well, there may be a subtext in these emails, I don't know.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.900
 They're hogging all the sex!

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.900
 Some of them were seasonal, so there was an email from a Manhattan complainant which noted that, and I'm quoting here,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.900
 "Some guy is singing jingle balls at the top of his voice."

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900
 While having sex?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
 Apparently so.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.900
 Brilliant.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.900
 [Laughter]

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 How did they know that he was having sex?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.900
 Because his wife was called "One Horse Open Slay."

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 [Laughter]

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.900
 It'd be so nice if everyone in the next department is all together at the same time.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 Hey!

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 [Laughter]

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.900
 The Haas Avocado was invented by a guy called Rudolph Haas, who must have found it hard to get through customs.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
 [Laughter]

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.900
 That's incredible.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.900
 He wanted to make some new avocados because he'd seen a magazine with a picture of an avocado tree on it

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.900
 and dollar bills were the avocado would be.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.900
 And it was like an advert saying, "You can make money from avocados."

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 And so he started getting loads of avocado seeds from loads of different places and planting them and seeing which good ones would come.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.900
 And then he found these Haas ones and they were amazing, like, you know, incredible.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 But he couldn't remember where he got the seed from, so we don't actually know where it came from.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900
 Oh, wow!

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.900
 And he didn't patent it, so people could just buy his avocado and then take his seeds and then build their own plantation.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.900
 So he made no money out of it, and he was still a postman towards the end of his life.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.900
 Karen Haas-Raila, who is one of his descendants, said that it was really good for the family.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.900
 And her grandmother, who is the wife of Rudolph Haas, said that they would always make avocados in their salads

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.900
 and would be really proud of these family avocados, even though they didn't make any money from them.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.900
 Nice.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.900
 So I would be a bit timid to try and approach the patent office with an avocado.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.900
 I wouldn't know how to go about it.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900
 Yeah?

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.900
 Like, "No promise, this is a new kind of avocado."

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.900
 "Oh, right, where'd you get it from?"

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.900
 "I don't know."

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.900
 I see a pint, yeah.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.900
 Yeah.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.900
 And all the guys are queuing up with their, like, inventions when they're inventing a new kind of mousetrap or a new kind of door.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
 And he's desperately trying to get to the front of the queue.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.900
 And he's the ones that are the more brownie ones, the dark ones.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.900
 The dark ones, I think.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.900
 The green ones.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.900
 Because I don't care why people don't eat the green ones.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.900
 I think I'm not a very good taster, but I think they taste as good.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.900
 And my local shop does avocados that are bigger than a melon.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.900
 It's genuinely extraordinary.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.900
 Oh, really?

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900
 I should send, I should put, I'll get someone to put a photo onto it.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.900
 Because I've seen some big apples in my tire.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.900
 I don't know if I've ever said this on the show.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.900
 Oh, Christ, we're back here.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:43.900
 Bigger than a melon?

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:44.900
 Bigger than a melon?

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.900
 I don't want to be part of this big apple crew, but yeah, bigger than a melon.

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.900
 What?

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.900
 I don't know.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.900
 No, that's a watermelon you're holding.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.900
 Yeah, not even a watermelon.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.900
 No, but I have seen, there is a kind, there is a new kind of Godzilla avocado on the market.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.900
 And they're sort of twice, three times the size of...

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.900
 I imagine going to the Peyton office dragging along this enormous avocado.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.900
 Rolling it.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.900
 They're chasing after the Peyton officer like Indiana Jones.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.900
 Do you know what they eat?

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900
 Because they get fed by the scientists.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.900
 Monkeys.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.900
 Bananas.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.900
 I've got fruit here.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.900
 It's such a section that you're right.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900
 They mostly monkey food.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.900
 This is the weird thing about the island is we act like it's all the monkeys living wild,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.900
 a chance to study them in their natural habitats, except the researchers do have to go and feed

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.900
 them every day.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.900
 But did you hear about the monkey food?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.900
 Purina monkey chow.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.900
 Purina?

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.900
 Yeah.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.900
 It's a kind of sort of dry biscuit-y stuff, but it contains all the nutrients that a growing

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.900
 monkey needs.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900
 It's good for them.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.900
 But the only reason I mentioned that is there was a guy called Adam Scott, Canadian.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:52.900
 And in the early 2000s, he set himself a challenge of living for a week on nothing except monkey

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.900
 chow.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.900
 Because it said it's good for all primates and great apes.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.900
 And he said, "Well, I'm a great ape.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.900
 And I can blog."

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.900
 That's amazing.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.900
 And what happened?

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.900
 He now lives up a tree.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.900
 He lost four pounds.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.900
 He threw his feces at the researchers.

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.900
 So day three, he said, "I can smell every hamburger being cooked within five miles of my house."

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.900
 I think because he was so sick of this horrible stuff.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.900
 Yeah.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.900
 Day four, moderate desire to fling poop.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.900
 Come on.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.900
 No way.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.900
 Day five, he wrote, "Next person who tells me to go 30 days is dead."

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.900
 He didn't enjoy it much.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.900
 La Crosse has appeared only twice ever in the Olympics.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.900
 So it was the 1904 Olympics was the first one.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.900
 And then the 1908 Olympics.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.900
 And in the first one, in 1904, there was only three teams that were competing.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900
 So there was two from Canada, one for America.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.900
 There was meant to be one more for America, but they didn't make it in time.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.900
 So you had a bronze silver.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.900
 Wait a minute.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900
 It was in St. Louis.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.900
 So it was in America.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.900
 Yeah, I know.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.900
 How did they not make it in time?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.900
 What was it?

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.900
 They were slated to play, but they just didn't.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.900
 OK.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.900
 Yeah.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.900
 So you had the Canada Shamrock La Crosse team.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:03.900
 You had America's St. Louis Amateur Athletics Association.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.900
 Then you had Canada's Mohawk Indian team.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.900
 And that was an amazing team that they didn't play in the next Olympics.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.900
 But all of their team members were Native Americans.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.900
 And they all have these Native American names that are listed in their own Wikipedia pages.

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.900
 So you've got Black Hawk.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.900
 You've got Almighty Voice.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.900
 You've got Lightfoot.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:25.900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.900
 Almighty Voice would be the captain, wouldn't he?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:28.900
 Hang on.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.900
 Rain in Face was another snake eater.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.900
 And they all have their own on the official Olympic website.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.900
 They all have their own biographies.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.900
 You all want to share a room with Man Afraid of Soap.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.900
 He's one of the only people who has actually a bit of biography that kind of remains.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.900
 If you read their biographies, it sort of says little is known about them at the time.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.900
 We don't have much.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.900
 His real name was Joseph Isaacs.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.900
 His son actually became quite a famous La Crosse player called Bill Isaacs.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.900
 And he was put into the Canadian La Crosse Hall of Fame.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.900
 He was one of the first inductees.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.900
 And every one of the other biographies, they seem to kind of like say we've got nothing.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:14.900
 And then just mention something completely random just to sort of bulk out the article.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.900
 So the guy who's called Lightfoot.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.900
 They say nothing really known about him.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:25.900
 He's no relation to Gordon Lightfoot, the Canadian folk singer who sang at the opening ceremony at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.900
 Okay.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.900
 Good to know.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.900
 Although he's from the same area.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.900
 Good to know.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.900
 Yeah.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.900
 I've got a fact about the first airport in Ireland.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.900
 Oh yeah.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.900
 Guess what the ground was made of?

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.900
 Moss.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.900
 Oh, very nice guess.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:40.900
 No.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:41.900
 Jelly.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.900
 Well, I would have thought peat usually in Ireland.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.900
 Yeah.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.900
 Yeah.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.900
 No.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:47.900
 It was water.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.900
 It was a floating airport.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.900
 So what was the ground made of?

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.900
 Water.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.900
 As I explained.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.900
 It's not so much a trick question.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.900
 It's a very misleading one.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.900
 So water airplanes that land on water.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.900
 Flying boats, as they were called.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.900
 It was the Foynes Flying Boat Station.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.900
 And I only mentioned it because it had this incredible, partly because of that brilliant trick question I just put you all through.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.900
 But also because one of the planes it had, it was an early cross Atlantic flight.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.900
 It was called the Boeing 314 Flying Boat.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.900
 It was so luxurious, right?

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.900
 So it was, it ran overnight flights.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.900
 I think they were quite slow at the time.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.900
 So it would have taken a bit longer to get there.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:33.900
 It had a beautiful dining room with 14 seats in it that you could sort of book a space in.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.900
 Your shoes would be polished outside your cabin overnight.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.900
 And it had a celestial observation turret and a honeymoon suite.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.900
 Oh, God.

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.900
 How cool were planes in Ireland?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.900
 I'd be complaining about people shagging up there probably.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.900
 So email subject line, mile high club dash again.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.900
 Excavation mark.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.900
 Okay, so let's do a bit of Watson Harkins back today.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.900
 Oh, my God.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.900
 I have the phrenology head.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.900
 Oh, so cool.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.900
 So this is a phrenology head that I have from home.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.900
 So it's like, what would you say?

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.900
 A ceramic head.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.900
 And then it's got little words on the skull.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.900
 And wherever your bump is, that's supposed to tell you something about it.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.900
 So where would you say is the biggest bump on your head?

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900
 I've got a bump, sort of, like.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.900
 Okay, so above your left eye.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:23.900
 Yeah, it's a bit of a bump there.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.900
 And it's probably about maybe three-fifths of the way around.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.900
 So that is between memory and wonder.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.900
 Oh, okay.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.900
 So you're like, you remember wonderers.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.900
 I remember false things.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.900
 I should have better checked out how big that is on my head.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:44.900
 I've got a big one back here.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.900
 It's a mole.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.900
 You should get that checked out.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:54.900
 Around marriage, I would say.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.900
 What does that mean? You marry loads of times?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.900
 I think it's how keen you are on being marriage.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.900
 Being marriage.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.900
 I don't think it's how many times, but I think it's about how exorious you are.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.900
 How keen you are on...

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.900
 Amative, I think, they would say.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.900
 Do you want to do your own while we're here?

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.900
 Give us a lump.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.900
 Heads just don't have lumps.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900
 Perfectly smooth.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.900
 I did mine earlier just to say.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.900
 I did some self-frenologising.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.900
 And it turns out I have bumps in the areas for observing, knowing,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.900
 conscientiousness and the love of children and animals.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:36.900
 Why did you kick that puppy the other day then?

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.900
 In Washington, Papinecla was addressing some audience and they sang a song to him

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:48.900
 to the tune of Finicule Finicula, which went...

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.900
 The cancer test, you know.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.900
 What?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.900
 The cancer test, you know.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.900
 No, no, I know. It's just like there's football chance at his speech.

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.900
 He's a very popular man.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.900
 Wow.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900
 That's really cool.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.900
 I think they could have found something that rhymes better with Papinecola.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.900
 That's really bad.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.900
 What did they do instead of the Finicule Finicula, Finicule Finicula?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.900
 I don't know.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.900
 This is from his obituary, which, weirdly, doesn't miss the full lyrics of the song.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:21.900
 I'm trying to think, yeah, the vagina, vagina, or cervixi, vagina, cervixi, vagina.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:22.900
 Something like that.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.900
 Sorry.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.900
 Philopia.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.900
 That's better.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.900
 Just on Emily and Sue, one quick thing.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.900
 The letters that they wrote to each other, there's some great lines in there.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.900
 So, Emily said of her and Sue that they are the only poets

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.900
 and everyone else's prose.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.900
 This is an example of how much she liked her.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.900
 That's romantic.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.900
 And another one, "I fancy you very often descending to the schoolroom

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.900
 with a plump binomial theorem, struggling in your hand,

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.900
 which you must dissect and exhibit to your uncomprehending ones."

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.900
 You've made that sound like a euphemism for once,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.900
 because she did play on words.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.900
 I don't think that is.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.900
 You don't think plump binomial theorem?

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.900
 Binomial theorem.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.900
 Are you hearing nothing here, Anna?

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:08.900
 That was a bit weird.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.900
 I'm going to be honest.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900
 That slightly turned me on, James.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.900
 I don't know how that happened.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.900
 I'm a bit worried.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.900
 Awesome Fowler, who was a brother of Lorenzo.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.900
 He did a thing where he invented the idea of an octagonal house.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.900
 So, he thought that everyone should have houses that were octagons.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900
 Okay.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900
 Yeah.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.900
 And he thought that the idea is that the perfect shape for a house would be a circle,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.900
 because it would be easier to warm.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.900
 It wouldn't get so cold all the time.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.900
 But no sofas fit in it.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.900
 Yeah.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.900
 You have to invent round sofas as well.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.900
 Then you're paying for your customized sofa.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.900
 It's going to cost a fortune.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.900
 Well, that's why he thought octagonal is better,

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:52.900
 because octagonal at least has the good part of having sides.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:53.900
 Yes.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900
 But it has also the good part of being almost a circle.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.900
 And also, in an octagon, the angles are 135 degrees,

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.900
 and that is the same angle as a typical bay window.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.900
 So, he said that the architects are already able to make these things,

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.900
 because they're making bay windows,

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.900
 where they just go one better and have an octagonal house.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900
 What was Mr. Follows?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.900
 Oh, his was the Dynaxian.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.900
 Dynaxian.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.900
 Yeah, the sphere.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.900
 His was the Buckyball.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.900
 Yeah, exactly.

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.900
 Whatever that is.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.900
 It's hexagons and pentagons.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.900
 Isn't the modern football something like a Buckyball?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.900
 Yes, that's right.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.900
 Yeah.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.900
 I would live in an octagonal house.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.900
 Yeah.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.900
 Like a shot.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.900
 I wouldn't say no to it.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.900
 Would you seek out an octagonal house?

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.900
 No.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.900
 If you knew it was available.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.900
 Oh, if I knew it was available, yeah.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.900
 You could type it into right move.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.900
 Is that an auction or the one of the teams?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.900
 Yeah, it is.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.900
 Three vegans, garden, octagon.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.900
 Number of faces.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.900
 Yes.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.900
 But yeah, there was actually a group who set up an octagon city in Kansas,

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:52.900
 where everyone was going to live in octagonal houses in 1856.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:57.900
 These were followers of the famous vegetarian Henry S. Club,

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.900
 who I tweeted about the other day.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:06.900
 He was the first president of the American Vegetarian Society, Henry S. Club.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.900
 And his followers set up this city of octagonal houses.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.900
 It's so annoying that they weren't S Club 8, the band.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.900
 Because that would have been an absolute slam dunk.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.900
 Yes.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.900
 There was S Club 8, wasn't there?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.900
 S Club Juniors became S Club 8.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.900
 Oh, really?

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.900
 Did they?

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900
 Oh, well.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900
 Maybe.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.900
 Maybe not.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.900
 Was it a nod to S Club 1?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.900
 Octagon City, yeah.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.900
 Anyway, this city did not make it through the winter.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.900
 What do you mean?

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900
 How many people died?

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900
 I believe, as far as I could tell, no one died.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.900
 They just decided, let's go back to our double-shaped houses.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900
 Oh, OK.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.900
 I can't picture shapes very well.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.900
 If you stacked octagons next to each other, can you make a grid?

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.900
 I know you can with hexagons, because that's sort of like a beehive.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.900
 I don't know.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.900
 I don't know.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:48.900
 That's the answer.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900
 Wow.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.900
 Because that would be good, wouldn't it?

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.900
 Yeah, that would be great.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.900
 Not good if you live in the house in the middle.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.900
 Not in the middle.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.900
 No, that's the fucking nightmare.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.900
 You had to go through everyone else's house to get to your house.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:02.900
 So embarrassing.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.900
 You've got windows in every room, but they all look out onto someone else's living room.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.900
 This is a terrible idea.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:15.900
 There was Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia was born at Claridge's, because he was in exile.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:21.900
 And on that day, the UK declared, apparently declared, Claridge's to be in Yugoslav territory.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.900
 Now, is that--

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.900
 I've heard that.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.900
 I read that, too.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.900
 I think they declared that.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.900
 They might have declared it, but whether it had any actual basis in law, I'm not sure.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.900
 Who has authority over Claridge's?

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.900
 Is it the British government, or is it the management of Claridge's?

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:37.900
 I mean, when was this, 1945?

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:42.900
 If Churchill came to you and said to Claridge's as the manager, you need to make this Britain,

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.900
 would you say no?

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.900
 He's just won the war.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.900
 I would say, oh, yeah.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.900
 But I think, basically, they ceremonially say it's part of that.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.900
 But actually, all the rules of Britain still--

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.900
 All the rules of Claridge's still apply.

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.900
 So you can't shoplift a kettle.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.900
 Which is legal in Yugoslavia.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.900
 Exactly.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.900
 Ultrasound technology.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.900
 Do you know what it was used on before?

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.900
 It was used for pregnancies, Gens.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.900
 Ultrasound.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.900
 I don't think you'll get it.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.900
 To tell the inside of something that you can't look into.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.900
 A safe.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.900
 A safe, yeah, exactly.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.900
 Oh, nice.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.900
 No, it was used in shipyards and the military before it was used to scan pregnant women.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.900
 So it was used to check for flaws in welds or the integrity and armor plating in tanks.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900
 Cool, nice.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.900
 Yeah, and it was this very militaristic engineering system.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:40.900
 And then a gynecologist called Ian Donald in 1955, he sort of thought to himself, I bet

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.900
 that has a use in my field.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.900
 And he asked-- he asked, I think, a shipyard or somewhere if he could use the ultrasound

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.900
 technology to try and tell the difference between some tissue samples.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.900
 And one of them was just normal tissue.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.900
 No, one of them was an ovarian cyst, which you need to be able to detect.

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.900
 And one of them was a beef steak.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.900
 And so-- and he could tell the difference between them.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.900
 That's always useful to be able to tell the difference between those two things.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900
 Certainly, in an Aberdeen Angus restaurant, it is.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.900
 And it's a necessary precaution to take.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.900
 Yeah, but the early ultrasound prototype, it looked like a gun turret.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.900
 It was incredibly militaristic looking, the thing that you were pointing at.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.900
 Oh, really?

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.900
 It was a sort of a pregnant belly, so they had to make it a bit more--

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.900
 I suppose not.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.900
 I don't mind a gun turret pointing at me, as long as nothing is propelled out of it.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.900
 Yeah, but you can't guarantee that's not going to happen, right?

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.900
 I would like the doctor to guarantee that first.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.900
 You don't want a doctor with an itchy trigger finger.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.900
 You're right.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.900
 This is loaded, just in case.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900
 The safety's probably on.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:46.900
 Did you guys read the recent story from Shannon Airport in Ireland?

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.900
 Shannon Airport is quite controversial, because it's used as a stopover for soldiers.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:54.900
 So Ireland stays neutral in a lot of wars that America's not neutral in.

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:57.900
 And then America needs to refuel.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.900
 And sometimes the soldiers need a good night's sleep before they pop over to Afghanistan.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.900
 So they stop up in Shannon Airport.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.900
 A lot of Irish people get quite annoyed about this, understandably.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.900
 But actually, a couple of weeks ago, two Americans who were over 80

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.900
 were fined 5,000 euros because they broke into Shannon Airport.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.900
 So these guys sound so great.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.900
 They are called Tarak Kauff and Ken Mayers.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.900
 And they're respectively 80 and 85 years old.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.900
 They're ex-American soldiers, but they're now super anti-war.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.900
 And they use bolt cutters to access the runway area.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.900
 And so they were going to search all the US planes there for weapons.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.900
 But they were put in prison.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.900
 They were put in prison for 13 days.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.900
 For breaking into an airport and trying to steal weapons?

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:41.900
 Ridiculous.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.900
 Sorry, they weren't trying to steal weapons or make that very clear.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.900
 They wanted to search some weapons to expose the fact that, you know, war is bad and stuff.

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900
 What war is bad?

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.900
 And stop dropping these truth bombs.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.900
 Well, that's why their action is needed.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.900
 So you guys can learn.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.900
 Do you know Gordon Brown's, what his name actually is?

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.900
 Oh, it's James, isn't it?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.900
 It is. James Brown.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.900
 So I read this thing in a, this is actually in Mark Mason's book that I was browsing the other day.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.900
 Gordon Brown's actual name is James Brown.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.900
 And Tony Blair's dad, his birth name was Parsons.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.900
 So Tony Blair is almost Tony Parsons.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.900
 So we almost had Tony.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.900
 Whose Tony Parsons?

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.900
 Tony Parsons is like, hang on.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900
 I don't know who that is.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.900
 There's an Alan Parsons.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.900
 Oh, wait, is Tony Parsons, wasn't a famous comedian?

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.900
 Oh, Tony Parsons?

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:36.900
 Tony Parsons.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.900
 Wow, I forgot the wrong person.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.900
 Well, scratch that.

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.900
 Who's that Parsons who was in Mark the Week?

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.900
 What's his first name?

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.900
 Andy Parsons.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900
 Oh, Andy Parsons.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.900
 Shit, I just thought he was a really famous, like, 90s, 80s comedian.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:52.900
 Who am I thinking of?

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.900
 Well, Andy Parsons is pretty famous.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:54.900
 What was the band?

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:55.900
 The Alan Parsons Project.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.900
 The Alan Parsons Project.

00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:57.900
 Well, scratch that.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.900
 No, no, we keep this up.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900
 Apparently, a way, if you are at the gynecologist and you're feeling quite tense,

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.900
 small talk is the way that they get most people to calm down.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.900
 I read this article where doctors were talking about where can you just

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.900
 absolutely get a patient to just relax and just start saying random,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.900
 stupid stuff, completely relaxes the person, which is a nice thing to know.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.900
 But I was also reading in the same article about the sort of,

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.900
 like, discoveries they make while they're down there at the gynecologist.

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:32.900
 Because sometimes it's not just as simple as doing the test.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:34.900
 Sometimes we haven't washed for a while.

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.900
 There are various structures in there.

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.900
 Well, the structures retain foreign bodies is an interesting thing.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.900
 They all talk about their favorite thing they've collected from inside a vagina.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.900
 That word.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:44.900
 While they've been looking at it.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.900
 So it's everything from marbles through to LEGOs.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.900
 Is this woman who's forgotten her handbag a need to store thing?

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.900
 A handbag?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.900
 No, it's my vagina.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:24:00.900
 There was a species found in 2016, a kind of poultice orb web spider.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.900
 Is it a spider?

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.900
 It is a spider.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.900
 And from one side, it looks like a leaf.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.900
 And from the other side, it looks like a dead leaf.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.900
 So living leaf on one side, dead leaf on the other, right?

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.900
 The first one was found in 2016.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.900
 And it basically has, it looks so much like a leaf.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.900
 So the only problem is this spider has not yet been classified properly by scientists.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:23.900
 Can you guess why?

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.900
 Because they can't find it.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.900
 They can't find any.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.900
 Because it just looks like a leaf.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.900
 We show it's not just a leaf.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.900
 That's the other theory.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.900
 Basically, they haven't found any more.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.900
 That's incredible.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.900
 2013, England went a bit healthy with its choices for cricketers and what they're eating.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:44.900
 So when, and they seem to have got a lot of crap for it as well by the newspapers.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:51.900
 So when they went to Australia for the ashes in 2013, 2014, they brought with them an 82 page cookbook.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.900
 And it was full of very healthy meals.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.900
 So lots of things like mung bean and spinach curry that they were trying to eat.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.900
 And the Aussies were obviously not eating healthily.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:10.900
 In fact, in 2012, the Aussies were sponsored by KFC, the official restaurant of Australian cricket.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.900
 It's said on their website.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.900
 Also, you can't catch cricket balls with greasy fingers, can you?

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.900
 Oh, that's true.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.900
 Yeah, that's true.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.900
 But so they lost, England lost that series 5-0.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.900
 You could catch the ball in a bucket.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.900
 That might be helpful.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.900
 They say he had hands like buckets if you can catch really well.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:28.900
 There we go.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:29.900
 There we go.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900
 What if he just has buckets on his hands, you know.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.900
 And then, yeah.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.900
 And then the following summer, when England was back on its own ground, India was over.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.900
 And there was a thing where it was spotted by the press that India had ordered when they were doing their practices by the nets.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.900
 They'd ordered a bunch of McDonald's and Nando's to come.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:53.900
 And so there was a Daily Mirror headline that later read, because England were getting battered again, mung beans 0, Big Macs 3.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:58.900
 And it was just a big thing at the time to say, "Stop eating good, crap food is what's going to get you through it."

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.900
 I think it was more about our natural talent at the game at that time.

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:04.900
 Yeah, I don't follow...

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.900
 Stop getting battered and get something battered.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:08.900
 Something along those lines.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.900
 I'm surprised they didn't do something with word battered.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.900
 Such a loss to the headline industry.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:13.900
 Oh, no.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:14.900
 Yeah.

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.900
 I was reading stories about disasters within gynecology.

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.900
 And I read a story by a guy called Jason James.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.900
 He works at Baptist Hospital in Miami.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.900
 And he had a patient come in and she had lots of...

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.900
 What she thought was a terrible case of genital herpes, which I believe it was.

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.900
 And there was lots of lesions and discomfort.

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.900
 So he prescribed her pills, but he also gave her some cream.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.900
 So he went into his drawer and he ripped open this pack and got out of tube and gave her this cream.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.900
 And she went home.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.900
 A few days later, she calls up.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.900
 She says, "I'm not sure the cream thing is working.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.900
 It's a bit weird.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.900
 All my lesions have gone blue."

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.900
 He said, "What?"

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.900
 And she said, "I don't know.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.900
 This thing you've given me is a bit odd."

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.900
 And he went, "What the hell is she talking about?"

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.900
 She said, "It's got like..."

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.900
 So he went into his drawer and he picked up where the pack was of the stuff that he'd got,

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.900
 picked it out, realized he hadn't given her cream, but it was a pack of blue highlighters.

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:17.900
 And what she'd been doing was taking the lid off and highlighting each little lesion in blue for days before...

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.900
 And then she said, "They've all gone blue."

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:21.900
 This woman sounds like a bit of an idiot herself.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.900
 I mean, I don't trust the doctor in this transaction.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.900
 He gave someone a blue highlighter instead of a tube of cream.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:32.900
 I know doctors are overworked and on the sled, but that is quite bad.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.900
 I know.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.900
 And also, does that mean that he was highlighting his notes with...

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.900
 Yeah, a lesion cream.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:46.900
 He fessed up to it and said, "But at least we'll be able to find the lesions when you come in now."

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:48.900
 Oh, good a funny doctor.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.900
 He's the worst medical malpractice.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.900
 Well, there was also another person who advised people apply yoghurt to similar things.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:58.900
 Oh, yeah.

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.900
 This is quite a famous person in the '70s called Carol Downer.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.900
 I think she's still alive.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.900
 She was a feminist campaigner, sort of slightly against the speculums.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.900
 The speculums became a bit of a feminist issue,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.900
 because the idea was you're putting women in this vulnerable position, lying on their backs,

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.900
 while a man, as it almost always was in those days,

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.900
 shoves an instrument up your front bottom.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:22.900
 And so, Carol Downer led this campaign that was like women should be investigating themselves,

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.900
 rather than having to rely on men to do it.

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.900
 So, she used to travel around with a whole bunch of specular showing women how to use it.

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:30.900
 Right.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.900
 But she advised that if, with their speculum, they looked up, I guess, with a mirror,

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:39.900
 and saw something dodgy, she advised applying some yoghurt.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.900
 I always thought applying yoghurt to thrushworks, doesn't it?

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.900
 But, you know, that little corner with all the bits of chocolate and you don't put that.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:48.900
 Yeah, yeah.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:52.900
 That's your treat for after a successful dosing.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.900
 It seems not impossible, because it's all yeasty cultured stuff, isn't it?

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.900
 Well, maybe it's for a yeast infection. I can't remember.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.900
 It is a yeast infection.

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.900
 I mean, Jen Gunter, the doctor, would probably say don't put anything there.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.900
 Where is she, then?

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:05.900
 Is she still in the news?

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.900
 She still pops up from time to time.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.900
 A friend of the podcast, Jen Gunter, who just pops up to occasionally say,

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.900
 "Don't put glitter up there, or don't put marbles up there, or don't..."

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.900
 What if you want to really impress your dog?

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:20.900
 Do you know where the first mention of armwrestling comes from, we think?

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.900
 The Bible.

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.900
 Oh, that's a nice one.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:24.900
 It's a bloody Bible.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.900
 I actually don't know if someone has scoured all the ancient texts for armwrestling mentions back.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.900
 Balev.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:30.900
 But nice again.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.900
 The Epic of Gilgamesh.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:32.900
 It's all...

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.900
 It's in a cuneiform tablet.

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.900
 There are lots of claims about tablets.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.900
 Yeah.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:37.900
 And drawings.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.900
 So there are lots of claims that it's like ancient Egypt and Greece,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.900
 and you can see all these pictures of people who do look like they're armwrestling,

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.900
 but they haven't got a table to armwrestle on,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.900
 and they're probably just doing a country dance.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.900
 But in Japan, it's been a big deal for many hundreds of years.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.900
 And this is Udezumo, which is Fight of the Hands.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.900
 And the first description of it is from 712 AD.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.900
 And this is where it's actually two gods who did it,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.900
 to decide who won all the Japanese islands for themselves,

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.900
 and then one crushed the other one's hand,

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.900
 as we know can happen and fled in terror,

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.900
 and so the other god won all the islands.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.900
 Were you on the armwrestling archive website, Anna, in finding this fact?

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.900
 I can't remember.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:18.900
 Okay, well I hope you were, just because I found this fact on there,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900
 which I haven't got verified.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.900
 This is more of a shout-out to anyone who has information about this thing.

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.900
 But that website, had a lot of information about armwrestling,

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.900
 goes into all the claims that it's in ancient Egyptian freezes,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:31.900
 and kind of says there's really not much evidence that they're actually armwrestling.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:32.900
 Oh yeah, I think it was that.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.900
 Yeah, yeah.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.900
 So this website claims that ancient Japan also had foot wrestling,

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.900
 neck wrestling, called kubihiki,

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.900
 finger wrestling, Ubesumo, and buttock wrestling.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.900
 It was the same website.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.900
 So what is buttock wrestling?

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.900
 This is what I want to know.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.900
 Because on the website, it just says buttock wrestling, brackets, width-wise.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.900
 What does that mean?

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.900
 Does it mean like banging your bum like you're doing a dance?

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:00.900
 I think it must be.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.900
 But how much time did you spend?

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.900
 Because I think I probably spent 45 minutes trying to find out what buttock wrestling was.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.900
 And if you just Google, if you Google that phrase,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.900
 you do get some pretty, pretty rum results.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.900
 That's so funny.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.900
 Yeah, you probably went in a different direction to me with that result.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.900
 I still spent 45 minutes doing it, all right?

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.900
 I read this tidy story that when Hitler was growing in power,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.900
 and the movie industry were at the point where they were going to start doing movies

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:31.900
 that were making fun of him.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.900
 So the one that kind of really hit home was The Great Dictator,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.900
 which we've spoken about in the podcast before,

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.900
 the Charlie Chaplin one.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.900
 But before that, there was a movie that came out,

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.900
 which was the first movie to openly mock Hitler,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.900
 and it was called "You Nasty Spy,"

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.900
 spelled N-A-Z-T-Y,

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.900
 and it was the Three Stooges.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.900
 Really?

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.900
 The Three Stooges, yeah.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.900
 So they did it whereby The Dictator, and it was played by Moe,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.900
 and he was the dictator of Moronica,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.900
 and so you talk to the morons and so on,

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.900
 and it's a short movie, and it came out at a time when they weren't real.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:06.900
 There was a lot of weird stuff going on in Hollywood

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:09.900
 where they didn't want to show anti-German movies,

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.900
 because they still weren't sure what side they were sitting on in total.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.900
 And this got under the censors because it was a short film,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.900
 so it didn't have the kind of attention that, say,

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.900
 the Chaplin film would have had if it came out at the time.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.900
 So it came out, and there's a story that's online,

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.900
 and I can't find that it's true, so I'm more saying this

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:29.900
 just to ask any listener if they know.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.900
 Supposedly the Three Stooges were on Hitler's death list as a result.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.900
 His personal death list.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.900
 I'd love to see the SS trying to kill them

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.900
 by poking them in the eye and then, you know...

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.900
 Yeah, amazing, yeah, I really want to see it.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.900
 "You Nasty Spy."

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.900
 Well, they won Item 3 on the list.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.900
 As one item, not individuals.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.900
 The Three Stooges.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.900
 It'd be annoying if you were working your way through the list.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.900
 This is three!

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:05.900
 Okay, that's it. That's all of the outtakes.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.900
 We'll finish on Andy empathising with the SS.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900
