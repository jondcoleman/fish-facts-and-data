00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:16,700
 Hi everyone, James here. Welcome to your second ever bit of bonus material for members of Club Fish.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,300
 And that is a compilation of some outtakes from the last month.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,000
 Now, a bit of behind the scenes stuff. When we record fish in the office, we tend to record for about an hour and a half, sometimes a little bit more.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,600
 And what you get is only an hour. That's because we cut it right down to try and make it as fun as possible.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,800
 But what that means is sometimes we lose some really, really good materials. Some stuff that we really liked, some facts that we really liked, some silly jokes that we really liked.

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,800
 There was just no space for them. And now we have a space for more stuff.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:56,200
 So instead of putting compilations out every now and then, when we're on holiday or over Christmas, we're going to put them out regularly on this channel.

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,700
 Really hope you enjoy this. Anyway, these things are always great fun to make and really good fun for me to listen back to all those bits that we cut out.

10
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,700
 Don't forget, this is stuff that you would not have heard if you hadn't signed up for Club Fish. So thank you so much for doing that.

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,200
 We really do appreciate you supporting Fish. And here we go on with the outtakes.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,900
 They've done DNA mapping on Richard the Third's body. I don't think we've mentioned this. We talked ages ago about when Richard the Third's body was dug up.

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,100
 Episode one. Cast your minds back. You don't remember it, but later, then shame on you.

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:36,700
 So they've DNA mapped it. I think it's mainly someone called Professor Turi King, who's gone through doing this DNA mapping.

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,400
 And she talks a lot about how, you know, when someone like Josh Whitcombe goes on, "Who do you think you are?" and says, "Oh, I'm descended from Edward the First."

16
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,900
 Turi King will pipe up and say, "Literally everyone is." Or like, "Six million people are."

17
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:55,900
 They always cut that scene out at the end when he's crying, Turi comes on. Mate, big deal.

18
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,900
 Anyway, they've done the DNA mapping, taking Richard's body and then comparing it to the people who should be descended from him today.

19
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,900
 And the Royal Family also should be descended from him because I think they shared an uncle, the Royal Family, today.

20
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:17,400
 And there is no relation. So we know for sure that in the 19 links in the chain of Royal Families from Richard the Third down to the Royal Family today,

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,900
 someone was illegitimate.

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,400
 Oh, cool. Gotts, what great gotts. Good gotts, isn't it?

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,900
 George the Third.

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,400
 That's really exciting though.

25
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 Yeah, scandalous.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,900
 Who do you think you aren't?

27
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,900
 Who do you think is your aunt?

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,900
 Well, she's your mum, actually. And the milkman's your dad.

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:49,900
 My phone presents that photo, James, of you and me with a koala, more often than any other emotionally significant photo of my life.

30
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,900
 Pretty much every other day my phone says to me, "Remember this?"

31
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,900
 That was a great moment. Yeah, it was. It was amazing.

32
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,900
 The Haudenosaunee people up in New York and in Canada, they have some really cool legends.

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
 A lot of their legends are really rooted in La Crosse because it was such an important thing.

34
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,900
 But La Crosse was how bats were invented, again, according to their legend.

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
 The animal.

36
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
 The animal, yes.

37
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
 Really?

38
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,900
 Yeah. So this was this old legend, again legend, which is that there was a game between the birds and the four-legged animals.

39
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 And so the birds had a wise old owl, the animals had a bear, and a mouse and a squirrel ran up to the four-legged animals and went,

40
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,900
 "Well, where are we playing? What position are we in that high-pitched voice?"

41
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,900
 And the four-legged animal said, "Well, you're way too small and crap. Go away. You're not playing."

42
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
 So they went up to the birds' team and they said, "Well, can we play for you?"

43
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
 And the birds were like, "What are we going to do?"

44
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,900
 And so they made them some wings. They made one of them wings out of leather and it turned into a bat.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,900
 Oh, I thought you were going to say that they had sex with the mouse and then the offspring had wings.

46
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,900
 That would have been slightly more viable, almost.

47
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
 Not really.

48
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,900
 In the last year, New Yorkers made 311 complaints about other people having sex.

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,900
 It's almost all volume-related.

50
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
 Alright, it's not, "Why am I not having sex?"

51
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,900
 Well, there may be a subtext in these emails, I don't know.

52
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,900
 They're hogging all the sex!

53
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,900
 Some of them were seasonal, so there was an email from a Manhattan complainant which noted that, and I'm quoting here,

54
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,900
 "Some guy is singing jingle balls at the top of his voice."

55
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
 While having sex?

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,900
 Apparently so.

57
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
 Brilliant.

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,900
 [Laughter]

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
 How did they know that he was having sex?

60
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,900
 Because his wife was called "One Horse Open Slay."

61
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
 [Laughter]

62
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,900
 It'd be so nice if everyone in the next department is all together at the same time.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
 Hey!

64
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,900
 [Laughter]

65
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,900
 The Haas Avocado was invented by a guy called Rudolph Haas, who must have found it hard to get through customs.

66
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,900
 [Laughter]

67
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,900
 That's incredible.

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,900
 He wanted to make some new avocados because he'd seen a magazine with a picture of an avocado tree on it

69
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,900
 and dollar bills were the avocado would be.

70
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,900
 And it was like an advert saying, "You can make money from avocados."

71
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,900
 And so he started getting loads of avocado seeds from loads of different places and planting them and seeing which good ones would come.

72
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 And then he found these Haas ones and they were amazing, like, you know, incredible.

73
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,900
 But he couldn't remember where he got the seed from, so we don't actually know where it came from.

74
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
 Oh, wow!

75
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:31,900
 And he didn't patent it, so people could just buy his avocado and then take his seeds and then build their own plantation.

76
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
 So he made no money out of it, and he was still a postman towards the end of his life.

77
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:42,900
 Karen Haas-Raila, who is one of his descendants, said that it was really good for the family.

78
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,900
 And her grandmother, who is the wife of Rudolph Haas, said that they would always make avocados in their salads

79
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,900
 and would be really proud of these family avocados, even though they didn't make any money from them.

80
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
 Nice.

81
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,900
 So I would be a bit timid to try and approach the patent office with an avocado.

82
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,900
 I wouldn't know how to go about it.

83
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,900
 Yeah?

84
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
 Like, "No promise, this is a new kind of avocado."

85
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,900
 "Oh, right, where'd you get it from?"

86
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,900
 "I don't know."

87
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,900
 I see a pint, yeah.

88
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
 Yeah.

89
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,900
 And all the guys are queuing up with their, like, inventions when they're inventing a new kind of mousetrap or a new kind of door.

90
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,900
 And he's desperately trying to get to the front of the queue.

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,900
 And he's the ones that are the more brownie ones, the dark ones.

92
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
 The dark ones, I think.

93
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,900
 The green ones.

94
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
 Because I don't care why people don't eat the green ones.

95
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
 I think I'm not a very good taster, but I think they taste as good.

96
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,900
 And my local shop does avocados that are bigger than a melon.

97
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,900
 It's genuinely extraordinary.

98
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,900
 Oh, really?

99
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,900
 I should send, I should put, I'll get someone to put a photo onto it.

100
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,900
 Because I've seen some big apples in my tire.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,900
 I don't know if I've ever said this on the show.

102
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
 Oh, Christ, we're back here.

103
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,900
 Bigger than a melon?

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
 Bigger than a melon?

105
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
 I don't want to be part of this big apple crew, but yeah, bigger than a melon.

106
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,900
 What?

107
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
 I don't know.

108
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
 No, that's a watermelon you're holding.

109
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
 Yeah, not even a watermelon.

110
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,900
 No, but I have seen, there is a kind, there is a new kind of Godzilla avocado on the market.

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
 And they're sort of twice, three times the size of...

112
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,900
 I imagine going to the Peyton office dragging along this enormous avocado.

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
 Rolling it.

114
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,900
 They're chasing after the Peyton officer like Indiana Jones.

115
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,900
 Do you know what they eat?

116
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
 Because they get fed by the scientists.

117
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
 Monkeys.

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
 Bananas.

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,900
 I've got fruit here.

120
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,900
 It's such a section that you're right.

121
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
 They mostly monkey food.

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,900
 This is the weird thing about the island is we act like it's all the monkeys living wild,

123
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,900
 a chance to study them in their natural habitats, except the researchers do have to go and feed

124
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,900
 them every day.

125
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,900
 But did you hear about the monkey food?

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,900
 Purina monkey chow.

127
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
 Purina?

128
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
 Yeah.

129
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,900
 It's a kind of sort of dry biscuit-y stuff, but it contains all the nutrients that a growing

130
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
 monkey needs.

131
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,900
 It's good for them.

132
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
 But the only reason I mentioned that is there was a guy called Adam Scott, Canadian.

133
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,900
 And in the early 2000s, he set himself a challenge of living for a week on nothing except monkey

134
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,900
 chow.

135
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,900
 Because it said it's good for all primates and great apes.

136
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
 And he said, "Well, I'm a great ape.

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
 And I can blog."

138
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
 That's amazing.

139
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
 And what happened?

140
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
 He now lives up a tree.

141
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
 He lost four pounds.

142
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
 He threw his feces at the researchers.

143
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,900
 So day three, he said, "I can smell every hamburger being cooked within five miles of my house."

144
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
 I think because he was so sick of this horrible stuff.

145
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,900
 Yeah.

146
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,900
 Day four, moderate desire to fling poop.

147
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,900
 Come on.

148
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,900
 No way.

149
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 Day five, he wrote, "Next person who tells me to go 30 days is dead."

150
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
 He didn't enjoy it much.

151
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,900
 La Crosse has appeared only twice ever in the Olympics.

152
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,900
 So it was the 1904 Olympics was the first one.

153
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,900
 And then the 1908 Olympics.

154
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,900
 And in the first one, in 1904, there was only three teams that were competing.

155
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
 So there was two from Canada, one for America.

156
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,900
 There was meant to be one more for America, but they didn't make it in time.

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,900
 So you had a bronze silver.

158
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
 Wait a minute.

159
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
 It was in St. Louis.

160
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,900
 So it was in America.

161
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
 Yeah, I know.

162
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,900
 How did they not make it in time?

163
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
 What was it?

164
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,900
 They were slated to play, but they just didn't.

165
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
 OK.

166
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
 Yeah.

167
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
 So you had the Canada Shamrock La Crosse team.

168
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,900
 You had America's St. Louis Amateur Athletics Association.

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,900
 Then you had Canada's Mohawk Indian team.

170
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,900
 And that was an amazing team that they didn't play in the next Olympics.

171
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,900
 But all of their team members were Native Americans.

172
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,900
 And they all have these Native American names that are listed in their own Wikipedia pages.

173
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
 So you've got Black Hawk.

174
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
 You've got Almighty Voice.

175
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
 You've got Lightfoot.

176
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

177
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,900
 Almighty Voice would be the captain, wouldn't he?

178
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,900
 Hang on.

179
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

180
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

181
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,900
 Rain in Face was another snake eater.

182
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,900
 And they all have their own on the official Olympic website.

183
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,900
 They all have their own biographies.

184
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,900
 You all want to share a room with Man Afraid of Soap.

185
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,900
 He's one of the only people who has actually a bit of biography that kind of remains.

186
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,900
 If you read their biographies, it sort of says little is known about them at the time.

187
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
 We don't have much.

188
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
 Man Afraid of Soap.

189
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,900
 His real name was Joseph Isaacs.

190
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,900
 His son actually became quite a famous La Crosse player called Bill Isaacs.

191
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
 And he was put into the Canadian La Crosse Hall of Fame.

192
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,900
 He was one of the first inductees.

193
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,900
 And every one of the other biographies, they seem to kind of like say we've got nothing.

194
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,900
 And then just mention something completely random just to sort of bulk out the article.

195
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
 So the guy who's called Lightfoot.

196
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
 They say nothing really known about him.

197
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:25,900
 He's no relation to Gordon Lightfoot, the Canadian folk singer who sang at the opening ceremony at the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.

198
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
 Okay.

199
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:27,900
 Good to know.

200
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,900
 Although he's from the same area.

201
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
 Good to know.

202
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,900
 Yeah.

203
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
 I've got a fact about the first airport in Ireland.

204
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
 Oh yeah.

205
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,900
 Guess what the ground was made of?

206
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
 Moss.

207
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
 Oh, very nice guess.

208
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
 No.

209
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,900
 Jelly.

210
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
 Well, I would have thought peat usually in Ireland.

211
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
 Yeah.

212
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 Yeah.

213
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,900
 No.

214
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
 It was water.

215
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
 It was a floating airport.

216
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
 So what was the ground made of?

217
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,900
 Water.

218
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,900
 As I explained.

219
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,900
 It's not so much a trick question.

220
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
 It's a very misleading one.

221
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,900
 So water airplanes that land on water.

222
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,900
 Flying boats, as they were called.

223
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,900
 It was the Foynes Flying Boat Station.

224
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,900
 And I only mentioned it because it had this incredible, partly because of that brilliant trick question I just put you all through.

225
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,900
 But also because one of the planes it had, it was an early cross Atlantic flight.

226
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
 It was called the Boeing 314 Flying Boat.

227
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
 It was so luxurious, right?

228
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,900
 So it was, it ran overnight flights.

229
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
 I think they were quite slow at the time.

230
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,900
 So it would have taken a bit longer to get there.

231
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,900
 It had a beautiful dining room with 14 seats in it that you could sort of book a space in.

232
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,900
 Your shoes would be polished outside your cabin overnight.

233
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
 And it had a celestial observation turret and a honeymoon suite.

234
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
 Oh, God.

235
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
 How cool were planes in Ireland?

236
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
 I'd be complaining about people shagging up there probably.

237
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,900
 So email subject line, mile high club dash again.

238
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,900
 Excavation mark.

239
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
 Okay, so let's do a bit of Watson Harkins back today.

240
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
 Oh, my God.

241
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
 I have the phrenology head.

242
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
 Oh, so cool.

243
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,900
 So this is a phrenology head that I have from home.

244
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
 So it's like, what would you say?

245
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,900
 A ceramic head.

246
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,900
 And then it's got little words on the skull.

247
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,900
 And wherever your bump is, that's supposed to tell you something about it.

248
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
 So where would you say is the biggest bump on your head?

249
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,900
 I've got a bump, sort of, like.

250
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
 Okay, so above your left eye.

251
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
 Yeah, it's a bit of a bump there.

252
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,900
 And it's probably about maybe three-fifths of the way around.

253
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,900
 So that is between memory and wonder.

254
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
 Oh, okay.

255
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
 So you're like, you remember wonderers.

256
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
 I remember false things.

257
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,900
 I should have better checked out how big that is on my head.

258
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,900
 I've got a big one back here.

259
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
 It's a mole.

260
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
 You should get that checked out.

261
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,900
 Around marriage, I would say.

262
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
 What does that mean? You marry loads of times?

263
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,900
 I think it's how keen you are on being marriage.

264
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
 Being marriage.

265
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,900
 I don't think it's how many times, but I think it's about how exorious you are.

266
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
 How keen you are on...

267
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,900
 Amative, I think, they would say.

268
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,900
 Do you want to do your own while we're here?

269
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
 Give us a lump.

270
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
 Heads just don't have lumps.

271
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
 Perfectly smooth.

272
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,900
 I did mine earlier just to say.

273
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
 I did some self-frenologising.

274
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,900
 And it turns out I have bumps in the areas for observing, knowing,

275
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,900
 conscientiousness and the love of children and animals.

276
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,900
 Why did you kick that puppy the other day then?

277
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:41,900
 In Washington, Papinecla was addressing some audience and they sang a song to him

278
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:48,900
 to the tune of Finicule Finicula, which went...

279
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
 The cancer test, you know.

280
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
 What?

281
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
 The cancer test, you know.

282
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,900
 No, no, I know. It's just like there's football chance at his speech.

283
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
 He's a very popular man.

284
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
 Wow.

285
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
 That's really cool.

286
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
 I think they could have found something that rhymes better with Papinecola.

287
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
 That's really bad.

288
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,900
 What did they do instead of the Finicule Finicula, Finicule Finicula?

289
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
 I don't know.

290
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,900
 This is from his obituary, which, weirdly, doesn't miss the full lyrics of the song.

291
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:21,900
 I'm trying to think, yeah, the vagina, vagina, or cervixi, vagina, cervixi, vagina.

292
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
 Something like that.

293
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
 Sorry.

294
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
 Philopia.

295
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,900
 That's better.

296
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,900
 Just on Emily and Sue, one quick thing.

297
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
 The letters that they wrote to each other, there's some great lines in there.

298
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,900
 So, Emily said of her and Sue that they are the only poets

299
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
 and everyone else's prose.

300
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
 This is an example of how much she liked her.

301
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
 That's romantic.

302
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,900
 And another one, "I fancy you very often descending to the schoolroom

303
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
 with a plump binomial theorem, struggling in your hand,

304
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,900
 which you must dissect and exhibit to your uncomprehending ones."

305
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
 You've made that sound like a euphemism for once,

306
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
 because she did play on words.

307
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
 I don't think that is.

308
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,900
 You don't think plump binomial theorem?

309
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
 Binomial theorem.

310
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
 Are you hearing nothing here, Anna?

311
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
 That was a bit weird.

312
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
 I'm going to be honest.

313
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,900
 That slightly turned me on, James.

314
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,900
 I don't know how that happened.

315
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
 I'm a bit worried.

316
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,900
 Awesome Fowler, who was a brother of Lorenzo.

317
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,900
 He did a thing where he invented the idea of an octagonal house.

318
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,900
 So, he thought that everyone should have houses that were octagons.

319
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
 Okay.

320
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
 Yeah.

321
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,900
 And he thought that the idea is that the perfect shape for a house would be a circle,

322
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
 because it would be easier to warm.

323
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
 It wouldn't get so cold all the time.

324
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
 But no sofas fit in it.

325
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
 Yeah.

326
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,900
 You have to invent round sofas as well.

327
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,900
 Then you're paying for your customized sofa.

328
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,900
 It's going to cost a fortune.

329
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
 Well, that's why he thought octagonal is better,

330
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,900
 because octagonal at least has the good part of having sides.

331
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
 Yes.

332
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
 But it has also the good part of being almost a circle.

333
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,900
 And also, in an octagon, the angles are 135 degrees,

334
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
 and that is the same angle as a typical bay window.

335
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,900
 So, he said that the architects are already able to make these things,

336
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
 because they're making bay windows,

337
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,900
 where they just go one better and have an octagonal house.

338
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
 What was Mr. Follows?

339
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,900
 Oh, his was the Dynaxian.

340
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
 Dynaxian.

341
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
 Yeah, the sphere.

342
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
 His was the Buckyball.

343
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,900
 Yeah, exactly.

344
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
 Whatever that is.

345
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
 It's hexagons and pentagons.

346
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
 Isn't the modern football something like a Buckyball?

347
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
 Yes, that's right.

348
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
 Yeah.

349
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,900
 I would live in an octagonal house.

350
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,900
 Yeah.

351
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,900
 Like a shot.

352
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,900
 I wouldn't say no to it.

353
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
 Would you seek out an octagonal house?

354
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,900
 No.

355
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
 If you knew it was available.

356
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
 Oh, if I knew it was available, yeah.

357
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
 You could type it into right move.

358
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
 Is that an auction or the one of the teams?

359
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
 Yeah, it is.

360
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
 Three vegans, garden, octagon.

361
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
 Number of faces.

362
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,900
 Yes.

363
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,900
 But yeah, there was actually a group who set up an octagon city in Kansas,

364
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
 where everyone was going to live in octagonal houses in 1856.

365
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:57,900
 These were followers of the famous vegetarian Henry S. Club,

366
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
 who I tweeted about the other day.

367
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,900
 He was the first president of the American Vegetarian Society, Henry S. Club.

368
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,900
 And his followers set up this city of octagonal houses.

369
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,900
 It's so annoying that they weren't S Club 8, the band.

370
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
 Because that would have been an absolute slam dunk.

371
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
 Yes.

372
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
 There was S Club 8, wasn't there?

373
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
 S Club Juniors became S Club 8.

374
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,900
 Oh, really?

375
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,900
 Did they?

376
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
 Oh, well.

377
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
 Maybe.

378
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
 Maybe not.

379
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
 Was it a nod to S Club 1?

380
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,900
 Octagon City, yeah.

381
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,900
 Anyway, this city did not make it through the winter.

382
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
 What do you mean?

383
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
 How many people died?

384
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
 I believe, as far as I could tell, no one died.

385
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
 They just decided, let's go back to our double-shaped houses.

386
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,900
 Oh, OK.

387
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
 I can't picture shapes very well.

388
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,900
 If you stacked octagons next to each other, can you make a grid?

389
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:45,900
 I know you can with hexagons, because that's sort of like a beehive.

390
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,900
 I don't know.

391
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
 I don't know.

392
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
 That's the answer.

393
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
 Wow.

394
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
 Because that would be good, wouldn't it?

395
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,900
 Yeah, that would be great.

396
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
 Not good if you live in the house in the middle.

397
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
 Not in the middle.

398
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
 No, that's the fucking nightmare.

399
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,900
 You had to go through everyone else's house to get to your house.

400
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,900
 So embarrassing.

401
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
 You've got windows in every room, but they all look out onto someone else's living room.

402
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,900
 This is a terrible idea.

403
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:15,900
 There was Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia was born at Claridge's, because he was in exile.

404
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,900
 And on that day, the UK declared, apparently declared, Claridge's to be in Yugoslav territory.

405
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,900
 Now, is that--

406
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,900
 I've heard that.

407
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
 I read that, too.

408
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,900
 I think they declared that.

409
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:30,900
 They might have declared it, but whether it had any actual basis in law, I'm not sure.

410
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
 Who has authority over Claridge's?

411
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,900
 Is it the British government, or is it the management of Claridge's?

412
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
 I mean, when was this, 1945?

413
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,900
 If Churchill came to you and said to Claridge's as the manager, you need to make this Britain,

414
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
 would you say no?

415
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
 He's just won the war.

416
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
 I would say, oh, yeah.

417
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
 Oh, yeah.

418
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,900
 But I think, basically, they ceremonially say it's part of that.

419
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,900
 But actually, all the rules of Britain still--

420
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
 All the rules of Claridge's still apply.

421
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,900
 So you can't shoplift a kettle.

422
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 Which is legal in Yugoslavia.

423
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
 Exactly.

424
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
 Ultrasound technology.

425
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
 Do you know what it was used on before?

426
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
 It was used for pregnancies, Gens.

427
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
 Ultrasound.

428
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
 I don't think you'll get it.

429
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,900
 To tell the inside of something that you can't look into.

430
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
 Oh, yeah.

431
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
 A safe.

432
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
 A safe, yeah, exactly.

433
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
 Oh, nice.

434
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,900
 No, it was used in shipyards and the military before it was used to scan pregnant women.

435
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,900
 So it was used to check for flaws in welds or the integrity and armor plating in tanks.

436
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,900
 Cool, nice.

437
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
 Yeah, and it was this very militaristic engineering system.

438
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,900
 And then a gynecologist called Ian Donald in 1955, he sort of thought to himself, I bet

439
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
 that has a use in my field.

440
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,900
 And he asked-- he asked, I think, a shipyard or somewhere if he could use the ultrasound

441
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:51,900
 technology to try and tell the difference between some tissue samples.

442
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
 And one of them was just normal tissue.

443
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,900
 No, one of them was an ovarian cyst, which you need to be able to detect.

444
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
 And one of them was a beef steak.

445
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,900
 And so-- and he could tell the difference between them.

446
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,900
 That's always useful to be able to tell the difference between those two things.

447
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
 Certainly, in an Aberdeen Angus restaurant, it is.

448
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
 And it's a necessary precaution to take.

449
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,900
 Yeah, but the early ultrasound prototype, it looked like a gun turret.

450
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
 It was incredibly militaristic looking, the thing that you were pointing at.

451
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,900
 Oh, really?

452
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,900
 It was a sort of a pregnant belly, so they had to make it a bit more--

453
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,900
 I suppose not.

454
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
 I don't mind a gun turret pointing at me, as long as nothing is propelled out of it.

455
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,900
 Yeah, but you can't guarantee that's not going to happen, right?

456
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,900
 I would like the doctor to guarantee that first.

457
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,900
 You don't want a doctor with an itchy trigger finger.

458
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
 You're right.

459
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
 This is loaded, just in case.

460
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,900
 The safety's probably on.

461
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,900
 Did you guys read the recent story from Shannon Airport in Ireland?

462
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,900
 Shannon Airport is quite controversial, because it's used as a stopover for soldiers.

463
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,900
 So Ireland stays neutral in a lot of wars that America's not neutral in.

464
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,900
 And then America needs to refuel.

465
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,900
 And sometimes the soldiers need a good night's sleep before they pop over to Afghanistan.

466
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
 So they stop up in Shannon Airport.

467
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
 A lot of Irish people get quite annoyed about this, understandably.

468
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,900
 But actually, a couple of weeks ago, two Americans who were over 80

469
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,900
 were fined 5,000 euros because they broke into Shannon Airport.

470
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
 So these guys sound so great.

471
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,900
 They are called Tarak Kauff and Ken Mayers.

472
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
 And they're respectively 80 and 85 years old.

473
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
 They're ex-American soldiers, but they're now super anti-war.

474
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 And they use bolt cutters to access the runway area.

475
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,900
 And so they were going to search all the US planes there for weapons.

476
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
 But they were put in prison.

477
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
 They were put in prison for 13 days.

478
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 For breaking into an airport and trying to steal weapons?

479
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
 Ridiculous.

480
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,900
 Sorry, they weren't trying to steal weapons or make that very clear.

481
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,900
 They wanted to search some weapons to expose the fact that, you know, war is bad and stuff.

482
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,900
 What war is bad?

483
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
 And stop dropping these truth bombs.

484
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 Well, that's why their action is needed.

485
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
 So you guys can learn.

486
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
 Do you know Gordon Brown's, what his name actually is?

487
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,900
 Oh, it's James, isn't it?

488
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
 It is. James Brown.

489
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,900
 So I read this thing in a, this is actually in Mark Mason's book that I was browsing the other day.

490
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
 Gordon Brown's actual name is James Brown.

491
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,900
 And Tony Blair's dad, his birth name was Parsons.

492
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,900
 So Tony Blair is almost Tony Parsons.

493
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
 So we almost had Tony.

494
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,900
 Whose Tony Parsons?

495
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,900
 Tony Parsons is like, hang on.

496
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,900
 I don't know who that is.

497
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
 There's an Alan Parsons.

498
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,900
 Oh, wait, is Tony Parsons, wasn't a famous comedian?

499
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,900
 Oh, Tony Parsons?

500
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
 Tony Parsons.

501
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
 Wow, I forgot the wrong person.

502
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,900
 Well, scratch that.

503
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
 Who's that Parsons who was in Mark the Week?

504
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
 What's his first name?

505
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
 Andy Parsons.

506
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
 Oh, Andy Parsons.

507
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,900
 Shit, I just thought he was a really famous, like, 90s, 80s comedian.

508
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
 Who am I thinking of?

509
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
 Well, Andy Parsons is pretty famous.

510
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,900
 What was the band?

511
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
 The Alan Parsons Project.

512
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,900
 The Alan Parsons Project.

513
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
 Well, scratch that.

514
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,900
 No, no, we keep this up.

515
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 Apparently, a way, if you are at the gynecologist and you're feeling quite tense,

516
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,900
 small talk is the way that they get most people to calm down.

517
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,900
 I read this article where doctors were talking about where can you just

518
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,900
 absolutely get a patient to just relax and just start saying random,

519
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,900
 stupid stuff, completely relaxes the person, which is a nice thing to know.

520
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,900
 But I was also reading in the same article about the sort of,

521
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,900
 like, discoveries they make while they're down there at the gynecologist.

522
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,900
 Because sometimes it's not just as simple as doing the test.

523
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
 Sometimes we haven't washed for a while.

524
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
 There are various structures in there.

525
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
 Well, the structures retain foreign bodies is an interesting thing.

526
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,900
 They all talk about their favorite thing they've collected from inside a vagina.

527
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,900
 That word.

528
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,900
 While they've been looking at it.

529
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
 So it's everything from marbles through to LEGOs.

530
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,900
 Is this woman who's forgotten her handbag a need to store thing?

531
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
 A handbag?

532
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,900
 No, it's my vagina.

533
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,900
 There was a species found in 2016, a kind of poultice orb web spider.

534
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
 Oh, yeah.

535
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
 Is it a spider?

536
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
 It is a spider.

537
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
 And from one side, it looks like a leaf.

538
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,900
 And from the other side, it looks like a dead leaf.

539
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
 So living leaf on one side, dead leaf on the other, right?

540
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
 The first one was found in 2016.

541
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,900
 And it basically has, it looks so much like a leaf.

542
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,900
 So the only problem is this spider has not yet been classified properly by scientists.

543
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
 Can you guess why?

544
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
 Because they can't find it.

545
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
 They can't find any.

546
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
 Because it just looks like a leaf.

547
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
 We show it's not just a leaf.

548
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
 That's the other theory.

549
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,900
 Basically, they haven't found any more.

550
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
 That's incredible.

551
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,900
 2013, England went a bit healthy with its choices for cricketers and what they're eating.

552
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,900
 So when, and they seem to have got a lot of crap for it as well by the newspapers.

553
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:51,900
 So when they went to Australia for the ashes in 2013, 2014, they brought with them an 82 page cookbook.

554
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
 And it was full of very healthy meals.

555
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,900
 So lots of things like mung bean and spinach curry that they were trying to eat.

556
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,900
 And the Aussies were obviously not eating healthily.

557
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,900
 In fact, in 2012, the Aussies were sponsored by KFC, the official restaurant of Australian cricket.

558
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
 It's said on their website.

559
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,900
 Also, you can't catch cricket balls with greasy fingers, can you?

560
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
 Oh, that's true.

561
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
 Yeah, that's true.

562
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,900
 But so they lost, England lost that series 5-0.

563
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,900
 You could catch the ball in a bucket.

564
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,900
 That might be helpful.

565
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,900
 They say he had hands like buckets if you can catch really well.

566
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,900
 There we go.

567
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,900
 There we go.

568
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,900
 What if he just has buckets on his hands, you know.

569
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,900
 And then, yeah.

570
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,900
 And then the following summer, when England was back on its own ground, India was over.

571
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,900
 And there was a thing where it was spotted by the press that India had ordered when they were doing their practices by the nets.

572
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
 They'd ordered a bunch of McDonald's and Nando's to come.

573
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:53,900
 And so there was a Daily Mirror headline that later read, because England were getting battered again, mung beans 0, Big Macs 3.

574
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,900
 And it was just a big thing at the time to say, "Stop eating good, crap food is what's going to get you through it."

575
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,900
 I think it was more about our natural talent at the game at that time.

576
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,900
 Yeah, I don't follow...

577
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
 Stop getting battered and get something battered.

578
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,900
 Something along those lines.

579
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,900
 I'm surprised they didn't do something with word battered.

580
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
 Such a loss to the headline industry.

581
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
 Oh, no.

582
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,900
 Yeah.

583
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,900
 I was reading stories about disasters within gynecology.

584
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,900
 And I read a story by a guy called Jason James.

585
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,900
 He works at Baptist Hospital in Miami.

586
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,900
 And he had a patient come in and she had lots of...

587
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,900
 What she thought was a terrible case of genital herpes, which I believe it was.

588
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,900
 And there was lots of lesions and discomfort.

589
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,900
 So he prescribed her pills, but he also gave her some cream.

590
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,900
 So he went into his drawer and he ripped open this pack and got out of tube and gave her this cream.

591
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,900
 And she went home.

592
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,900
 A few days later, she calls up.

593
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,900
 She says, "I'm not sure the cream thing is working.

594
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
 It's a bit weird.

595
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,900
 All my lesions have gone blue."

596
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,900
 He said, "What?"

597
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
 And she said, "I don't know.

598
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
 This thing you've given me is a bit odd."

599
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,900
 And he went, "What the hell is she talking about?"

600
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,900
 She said, "It's got like..."

601
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,900
 So he went into his drawer and he picked up where the pack was of the stuff that he'd got,

602
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,900
 picked it out, realized he hadn't given her cream, but it was a pack of blue highlighters.

603
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:17,900
 And what she'd been doing was taking the lid off and highlighting each little lesion in blue for days before...

604
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,900
 And then she said, "They've all gone blue."

605
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,900
 This woman sounds like a bit of an idiot herself.

606
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
 I mean, I don't trust the doctor in this transaction.

607
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,900
 He gave someone a blue highlighter instead of a tube of cream.

608
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,900
 I know doctors are overworked and on the sled, but that is quite bad.

609
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,900
 I know.

610
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,900
 And also, does that mean that he was highlighting his notes with...

611
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
 Yeah, a lesion cream.

612
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:46,900
 He fessed up to it and said, "But at least we'll be able to find the lesions when you come in now."

613
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,900
 Oh, good a funny doctor.

614
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,900
 He's the worst medical malpractice.

615
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,900
 Well, there was also another person who advised people apply yoghurt to similar things.

616
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
 Oh, yeah.

617
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,900
 This is quite a famous person in the '70s called Carol Downer.

618
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,900
 I think she's still alive.

619
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:05,900
 She was a feminist campaigner, sort of slightly against the speculums.

620
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,900
 The speculums became a bit of a feminist issue,

621
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,900
 because the idea was you're putting women in this vulnerable position, lying on their backs,

622
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,900
 while a man, as it almost always was in those days,

623
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,900
 shoves an instrument up your front bottom.

624
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:22,900
 And so, Carol Downer led this campaign that was like women should be investigating themselves,

625
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
 rather than having to rely on men to do it.

626
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,900
 So, she used to travel around with a whole bunch of specular showing women how to use it.

627
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,900
 Right.

628
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,900
 But she advised that if, with their speculum, they looked up, I guess, with a mirror,

629
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,900
 and saw something dodgy, she advised applying some yoghurt.

630
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 I always thought applying yoghurt to thrushworks, doesn't it?

631
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,900
 But, you know, that little corner with all the bits of chocolate and you don't put that.

632
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,900
 Yeah, yeah.

633
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,900
 That's your treat for after a successful dosing.

634
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,900
 It seems not impossible, because it's all yeasty cultured stuff, isn't it?

635
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,900
 Well, maybe it's for a yeast infection. I can't remember.

636
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,900
 It is a yeast infection.

637
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,900
 I mean, Jen Gunter, the doctor, would probably say don't put anything there.

638
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,900
 Where is she, then?

639
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
 Is she still in the news?

640
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
 She still pops up from time to time.

641
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
 A friend of the podcast, Jen Gunter, who just pops up to occasionally say,

642
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,900
 "Don't put glitter up there, or don't put marbles up there, or don't..."

643
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,900
 What if you want to really impress your dog?

644
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 Do you know where the first mention of armwrestling comes from, we think?

645
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
 The Bible.

646
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
 Oh, that's a nice one.

647
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
 It's a bloody Bible.

648
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,900
 I actually don't know if someone has scoured all the ancient texts for armwrestling mentions back.

649
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,900
 Balev.

650
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,900
 But nice again.

651
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
 The Epic of Gilgamesh.

652
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,900
 It's all...

653
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
 It's in a cuneiform tablet.

654
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,900
 There are lots of claims about tablets.

655
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,900
 Yeah.

656
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,900
 And drawings.

657
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,900
 So there are lots of claims that it's like ancient Egypt and Greece,

658
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,900
 and you can see all these pictures of people who do look like they're armwrestling,

659
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,900
 but they haven't got a table to armwrestle on,

660
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,900
 and they're probably just doing a country dance.

661
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,900
 But in Japan, it's been a big deal for many hundreds of years.

662
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,900
 And this is Udezumo, which is Fight of the Hands.

663
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,900
 And the first description of it is from 712 AD.

664
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,900
 And this is where it's actually two gods who did it,

665
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,900
 to decide who won all the Japanese islands for themselves,

666
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
 and then one crushed the other one's hand,

667
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,900
 as we know can happen and fled in terror,

668
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
 and so the other god won all the islands.

669
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,900
 Were you on the armwrestling archive website, Anna, in finding this fact?

670
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
 I can't remember.

671
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,900
 Okay, well I hope you were, just because I found this fact on there,

672
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,900
 which I haven't got verified.

673
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,900
 This is more of a shout-out to anyone who has information about this thing.

674
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,900
 But that website, had a lot of information about armwrestling,

675
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,900
 goes into all the claims that it's in ancient Egyptian freezes,

676
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,900
 and kind of says there's really not much evidence that they're actually armwrestling.

677
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,900
 Oh yeah, I think it was that.

678
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
 Yeah, yeah.

679
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,900
 So this website claims that ancient Japan also had foot wrestling,

680
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,900
 neck wrestling, called kubihiki,

681
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:46,900
 finger wrestling, Ubesumo, and buttock wrestling.

682
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,900
 It was the same website.

683
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,900
 So what is buttock wrestling?

684
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,900
 This is what I want to know.

685
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,900
 Because on the website, it just says buttock wrestling, brackets, width-wise.

686
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
 What does that mean?

687
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,900
 Does it mean like banging your bum like you're doing a dance?

688
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
 I think it must be.

689
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,900
 But how much time did you spend?

690
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,900
 Because I think I probably spent 45 minutes trying to find out what buttock wrestling was.

691
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:11,900
 And if you just Google, if you Google that phrase,

692
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,900
 you do get some pretty, pretty rum results.

693
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,900
 That's so funny.

694
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,900
 Yeah, you probably went in a different direction to me with that result.

695
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,900
 I still spent 45 minutes doing it, all right?

696
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:25,900
 I read this tidy story that when Hitler was growing in power,

697
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:29,900
 and the movie industry were at the point where they were going to start doing movies

698
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,900
 that were making fun of him.

699
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,900
 So the one that kind of really hit home was The Great Dictator,

700
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
 which we've spoken about in the podcast before,

701
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
 the Charlie Chaplin one.

702
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,900
 But before that, there was a movie that came out,

703
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
 which was the first movie to openly mock Hitler,

704
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,900
 and it was called "You Nasty Spy,"

705
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,900
 spelled N-A-Z-T-Y,

706
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,900
 and it was the Three Stooges.

707
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,900
 Really?

708
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,900
 The Three Stooges, yeah.

709
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,900
 So they did it whereby The Dictator, and it was played by Moe,

710
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
 and he was the dictator of Moronica,

711
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,900
 and so you talk to the morons and so on,

712
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,900
 and it's a short movie, and it came out at a time when they weren't real.

713
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,900
 There was a lot of weird stuff going on in Hollywood

714
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,900
 where they didn't want to show anti-German movies,

715
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,900
 because they still weren't sure what side they were sitting on in total.

716
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,900
 And this got under the censors because it was a short film,

717
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,900
 so it didn't have the kind of attention that, say,

718
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
 the Chaplin film would have had if it came out at the time.

719
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
 So it came out, and there's a story that's online,

720
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,900
 and I can't find that it's true, so I'm more saying this

721
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
 just to ask any listener if they know.

722
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,900
 Supposedly the Three Stooges were on Hitler's death list as a result.

723
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,900
 His personal death list.

724
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 I'd love to see the SS trying to kill them

725
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,900
 by poking them in the eye and then, you know...

726
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,900
 Yeah, amazing, yeah, I really want to see it.

727
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,900
 "You Nasty Spy."

728
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,900
 Well, they won Item 3 on the list.

729
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
 As one item, not individuals.

730
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,900
 The Three Stooges.

731
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
 It'd be annoying if you were working your way through the list.

732
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,900
 This is three!

733
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:05,900
 Okay, that's it. That's all of the outtakes.

734
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,900
 We'll finish on Andy empathising with the SS.

735
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,900
 Thank you so much for listening to this,

736
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,900
 and thank you again for subscribing to Clubfish.

737
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
 We really do appreciate it, like I say,

738
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,900
 and we'll be back in a couple of weeks

739
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
 with another bit of bonus material.

740
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,900
 I think we'll be back to Andy's mailbox.

741
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
 So if you have any comments about the things

742
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
 that we've said on the podcast,

743
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
 if we've got things wrong,

744
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
 if you've got some additional facts,

745
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,900
 then send them over to podcast@qi.com,

746
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,900

747
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,900
