1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 (slow rock music)

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,380
 (speaking in foreign language)

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,960
 (upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,540
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:18,300
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,520
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
 this week coming to you from the Stan Comedy Club

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
 in Newcastle.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,400
 (audience cheering)

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
 (audience cheering)

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,280
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,100
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
 and no particular order.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,280
 Here we go, starting with you, Andy.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
 - My fact this week is that Britain exports

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
 over 50,000 boomerangs every year to Australia.

20
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,460
 (audience laughing)

21
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,480
 - And then imports them again, presumably.

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,480
 (audience laughing)

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,880
 - Yeah, this is just something that happens.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 This is, who knew that the post-Brexit Britain

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,320
 is gonna be boomerangs to Australia,

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,800
 Colton, Newcastle. - Is this a recent thing?

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,400
 - Oh, by the way, the phrase Colton, Newcastle,

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,120
 is that well known here?

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
 - Yeah.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,280
 - Yeah, 'cause we tried it on some people in London,

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,920
 like young people, and they'd never heard of it.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,760
 - Yeah. - That's true.

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,440
 - Actually, anyone under the age of about 25

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,360
 in London had heard of it, maybe 30 even.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
 But actually, they import Colt and Newcastle, don't they?

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
 Oh, don't you?

37
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
 Well, do you?

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,480
 (audience laughing)

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,320
 Yes, you do.

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,160
 - Great.

41
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,960
 (audience laughing)

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,720
 - In 2013, Newcastle imported 4.9 million tons

43
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,620
 of Colt, the second most in the UK

44
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,460
 after somewhere in Scotland.

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,920
 - Wow. - No way.

46
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
 - What are they doing with it?

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,640
 (audience laughing)

48
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,960
 - Do you all get some?

49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 Is that--

50
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
 - I think, yeah, then it's sent around the country

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,240
 for people to burn them.

52
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,040
 - That's what you do with Colt.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,240
 - No, I know what you do with Colt.

54
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,200
 I just didn't know what Newcastle was doing with Colt.

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
 - What special thing?

56
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,120
 Do you think Newcastle does with Colt?

57
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,680
 Well, apparently, they just send it back out again.

58
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,680
 (audience laughing)

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,520
 - It's like the boomerangs.

60
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
 - The thing is, Dad, right?

61
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,000
 The UK is an island, and when we bring stuff in,

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,680
 it has to go into a pot, and Newcastle's

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,840
 one of the best pots we have.

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
 - Now I get it.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,200
 I thought you meant like Manchester was sending Colt.

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,440
 - I thought Newport was just collecting Colt,

67
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,800
 and then when now you can have it back.

68
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
 - Newport is somewhere else.

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,800
 (audience laughing)

70
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,000
 - Wait, so what's happened?

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 - Oh my God.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,920
 - Can we recap?

73
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,560
 What's--

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,360
 - Don't worry, I think you're trying to learn enough toes.

75
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,640
 It's a good thing James just said,

76
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
 "They've got the best pot, kiss us."

77
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
 (audience laughing)

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,120
 So we've won a few people over with that.

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,560
 - Anyway, my fact this week is that Britain exports

80
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,400
 over 50,000 boomerangs a year to Australia.

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
 - I looked at these boomerangs,

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,760
 and they don't look very boomerang-like.

83
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,080
 - Well, wait till they hit you in the back of the head, James.

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,640
 - No, well, they're toy boomerangs.

85
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,440
 - Yeah, they got three sticky outfits, I think.

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,280
 - That's true.

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,120
 - Are you sure?

88
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
 That's like fidget spinners, right?

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,360
 - Yeah, they look like fidget spinners.

90
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,200
 - Yeah.

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,040
 - Big ones.

92
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,000
 - But they're called sports boomerangs or something.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
 - Yeah.

94
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,680
 - Yeah.

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,080
 - And they basically fly for miles and they do come back.

96
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,920
 - Yeah.

97
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,280
 - And the really cool thing is the guy who runs the company

98
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,200
 which sells them, his name is David Strang, okay?

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,920
 And he moved from Scotland to Australia at the age of eight,

100
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,800
 and then at the age of 20, he came back.

101
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
 (audience laughing)

102
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,840
 - Can I just ask, just a bug says,

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,600
 "Did we all just exclusively look for facts

104
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,560
 "where something went away and came back?"

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,080
 (audience laughing)

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,640
 - So it's just him, isn't it?

107
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,520
 It's just this one guy, this one company

108
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
 that's making them an expert in them.

109
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,000
 Is that right?

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
 - That's right, yeah.

111
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,560
 - So you know the song, my boomerang won't come back?

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,400
 - Yeah.

113
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,240
 - My boomerang.

114
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
 - I tell you, no.

115
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,400
 (audience laughing)

116
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
 - It's a song, comedy song.

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
 It's a comedy song.

118
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
 - It's a comedy song.

119
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,760
 - Oh yeah, 50s, my boomerang won't come back.

120
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,320
 Everyone else knows it, right?

121
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,800
 - You guys are?

122
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,120
 - It's really famous song.

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,360
 - Like six people are saying, yeah.

124
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,320
 How many, how many people don't know it?

125
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,920
 (audience cheering)

126
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,160
 I mean, that's huge.

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
 - That's, yeah.

128
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,520
 - All right, minority, do you know who produced that song?

129
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,960
 A certain George Martin, who went on

130
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,800
 to produce more famous songs by The Beatles.

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
 So The Beatles, you've been the guy

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
 who wrote Game of Thrones.

133
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,040
 (audience laughing)

134
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,600
 I did not, that was his big break.

135
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,640
 My boomerang won't come back,

136
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
 and then she went on to make The Beatles, yeah.

137
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
 - In the course of researching this,

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,920
 I actually listened to that song on repeat

139
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,280
 for about two days now.

140
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,120
 - Did you?

141
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
 - Yeah, it's very good.

142
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,120
 - He is good.

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,480
 - By these days, it's a bit culturally insensitive.

144
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,760
 So, I'm not gonna praise it.

145
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,080
 (audience laughing)

146
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,880
 - Do you know who else owned boomerangs?

147
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,080
 - Tutankamoon.

148
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,040
 - Oh, yes, it's full of boomerangs.

149
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,880
 - No.

150
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,720
 - It was okay.

151
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,120
 - It was full of boomerangs.

152
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,960
 (audience laughing)

153
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,320
 - If we get through these boomerangs,

154
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,640
 you might find something.

155
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
 (audience laughing)

156
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,920
 - Tutankamoon back as soon as you're done.

157
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,120
 - Oh my God.

158
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,440
 - No.

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
 All right, I'm sorry.

160
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
 (audience laughing)

161
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,920
 - So, do you know what is the world record

162
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,600
 longest time a boomerang has been in the air?

163
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
 - No.

164
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,960
 - Do you want to have a guess in minutes?

165
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
 - Minutes.

166
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
 - Three minutes.

167
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,160
 - Thirty-seven minutes.

168
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,560
 - Thirty-seven minutes.

169
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,600
 (audience laughing)

170
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,320
 - What do you think a bird flew off with it?

171
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,840
 (audience laughing)

172
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,840
 - Well, the answer is 1,440 minutes and nine seconds.

173
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,320
 - Come on.

174
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
 (audience laughing)

175
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,160
 - Don't, don't.

176
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,400
 - For less than a house at home,

177
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
 Dan's whacking his finger at me.

178
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
 Like, and I told you so, hey.

179
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
 - Can you explain to me?

180
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,320
 - I can, and you're not gonna like it.

181
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
 (audience laughing)

182
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,160
 - It's space, right?

183
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
 - It's a guy called Jay Parrott,

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,240
 and he was at the South Pole, and he threw it,

185
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,680
 so it went through all of the different time zones.

186
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,760
 So, technically, it went around 24 hours.

187
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,840
 - Ah, that's awesome.

188
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,400
 - I'm not the only one who didn't like it.

189
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
 (audience laughing)

190
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,640
 - I actually have the world, the Guinness World Record,

191
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,520
 for the longest distance of--

192
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,840
 - You have a congratulations.

193
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,160
 - No, sorry. - No, sorry.

194
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,000
 - Yeah.

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
 (audience cheering)

196
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
 - I can't.

197
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,680
 - I can't.

198
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,000
 - You hide your talent under a bottle then.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,440
 (audience laughing)

200
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
 Imagine if that was true.

201
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,240
 This was the first time we'd ever heard of it.

202
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,000
 - I like to brag.

203
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,480
 - Yeah, no, 2005, the Guinness World Record

204
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,920
 was set for the longest throw of a boomerang,

205
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,560
 and do you wanna have a guess of how far that was?

206
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,560
 - Oh, 80,000 miles.

207
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
 (audience laughing)

208
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,000
 - If you could take my question seriously, man.

209
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 (audience laughing)

210
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,840
 - James, do you wanna have a guess?

211
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:07,760
 - Well, let's say I think it would be about 300, 400 yards.

212
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,240
 - I've got it written down here, sir, for real.

213
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,120
 - Okay, great.

214
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
 (audience laughing)

215
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,080
 - So why don't you have a guess anyway, Anna?

216
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
 - Is it?

217
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
 - I only have 428, 7 meters.

218
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,600
 (audience laughing)

219
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,080
 - Well, I've got it in feet, so I don't know what that is.

220
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
 (audience laughing)

221
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,440
 - So yeah, you might be right.

222
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,400
 - Tell me in feet, and I'll convert it for you.

223
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,880
 - 1,401, put it on.

224
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,400
 - 427 meters.

225
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,040
 (audience laughing)

226
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,560
 - So Anna was closest.

227
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,000
 (audience laughing)

228
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,320
 - So this was set in Queensland, in Australia,

229
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,400
 and it was set by a guy called Mr. Shumy.

230
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,240
 And Mr. Shumy, when he was asked about it, he said,

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
 it wasn't really a boomerang throw,

232
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,040
 admitted Shumy, as it didn't come back.

233
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,400
 (audience laughing)

234
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,720
 But weirdly, the Guinness World Records thought

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
 we'll just accept it.

236
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,160
 - 'Cause the record should be zero meters.

237
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,400
 - Exactly, exactly, yeah.

238
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,200
 - Well, the record for a returning one,

239
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
 which I think is the one that should really stand,

240
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,720
 is a Swiss guy actually, who threw it 238 meters out,

241
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,920
 and then 238 meters back, which is further altogether

242
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,960
 than Mr. Shumy, isn't it?

243
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,680
 - Again, you've thrown numbers that I don't understand.

244
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
 (audience laughing)

245
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,280
 - It is.

246
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,280
 (audience laughing)

247
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,000
 - We need to move on to our second fact.

248
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,640
 Okay, so it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

249
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,960
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the Catalan region

250
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,560
 does regular checks of websites that end with .cat

251
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
 to check that they're about Catalonia and not about cats.

252
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
 (audience laughing)

253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,560
 - Are they the only two options?

254
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
 - Well, no, but it seems, basically,

255
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,640
 they want all of the websites that are .cat,

256
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,280
 'cause that's the Catalan domain name.

257
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,720
 They want them to all be about Catalonia,

258
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,880
 but actually everyone else wants to put cats on the internet.

259
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,760
 And when you put cats on the internet,

260
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,160
 what you're gonna do, you're gonna put .cat, right?

261
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,960
 And so people do it all the time.

262
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,040
 And every now and then, they have to do an audit,

263
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,640
 and they give people six months to shut the down their website,

264
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,480
 or add a translation tool to translate their website

265
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
 into Catalan.

266
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,240
 So there is a website called, is it Nian on Nian?

267
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,400
 Does anyone know Nian?

268
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,800
 So it's Nian, you'll all know about it.

269
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,960
 It's like a little cartoon cat that's got like a rainbow on it,

270
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,560
 and it's a stupid song that happens.

271
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,120
 And that was Nian.cat, and they were told they had to take it down

272
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,160
 until they put a translation tool.

273
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,400
 And so now you can watch Nian cat in Catalan.

274
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,240
 - Wow.

275
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
 - Thank God.

276
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,000
 Yeah, but it's really for the Catalan people,

277
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,520
 it's really important, obviously, a lot in the news at the moment,

278
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,920
 but I think they were the first sort of group of people

279
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,520
 rather than the country to have their own top-level internet,

280
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,360
 the main name.

281
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,800
 - Yeah, there were only eight top-level domains were allowed,

282
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,880
 and then the Catalonia people said,

283
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
 "No, we want a night, we want it to be our own space."

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,680
 - And it was because one of the guys who organized it was Catalan.

285
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,840
 So that kind of helped.

286
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,680
 - It was really?

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,560
 - Yeah, he was called Amadou Abriel, E Abriel.

288
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,400
 And he was a lion.

289
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,840
 And he was kind of part of the top-level internet thing.

290
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,960
 But he was Catalan, so he kind of managed to pull a few strings.

291
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,640
 - They are very active internet users, though, apparently.

292
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,480
 - Cats, yeah.

293
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
 - The cats.

294
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,120
 It's them that are posting all these pictures of themselves.

295
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,520
 The Catalonians too, though.

296
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,600
 So in 2013, Catalan was the eighth most-used language

297
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,520
 on blogs online, which is kind of extraordinary,

298
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,680
 given that they're hot like eight million,

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,200
 eight to 10 million Catalan speakers.

300
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,840
 They love the internet.

301
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,760
 - It'll never catch on.

302
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,560
 - I think I heard that blogging is massive.

303
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
 - Yeah.

304
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,240
 - I'm sorry.

305
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,160
 - Because it is dad.

306
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,000
 - Yeah.

307
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,640
 - And I have this thing.

308
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
 It's called Myspace.

309
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,480
 - And you go on.

310
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,320
 No, it's because they're obviously they want to be independent

311
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,760
 from Spain, a lot of people in Catalonia.

312
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
 So they blog and they have message boards,

313
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,960
 which are all about Catalonian issues.

314
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,760
 And it's a very sort of adhesive identity, basically.

315
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,600
 - Yes.

316
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,880
 - Did you read about the guy, though,

317
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,560
 who has started a cat-based internet thing

318
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,360
 that is really cool?

319
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,920
 He started stalking cats around the world,

320
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,200
 and then he started posting up where they live online.

321
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,240
 So what happens is, if you post a picture of your cat on Flickr,

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,400
 or like one of the other ones, Instagram.

323
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,840
 (audience laughing)

324
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,680
 - Ask Jeeves.

325
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,600
 You put a cat on the Jeeves.

326
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
 - You can put a cat on Ask Jeeves.

327
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,880
 And he'll take the cat, and he'll scrape all the data

328
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,720
 from behind it.

329
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 - Oh!

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 - All the message.

331
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,960
 - Who is this pervert?

332
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,080
 Why are you telling us about him?

333
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,040
 - He's not a pervert.

334
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,200
 He's someone who's trying to highlight the security problems

335
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
 online with posting your pictures up,

336
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,720
 because you often accidentally geotag yourself

337
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,960
 when you put pictures up.

338
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,040
 And so he's created this map of the world,

339
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,640
 and you can see all the cats that live in certain places.

340
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,960
 So if you've ever posted a picture of your cat up,

341
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,600
 then you can go to where you live,

342
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,560
 and your cat may well be there.

343
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,600
 Or you might go to near where you live and see your cat,

344
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
 and then you'll know that it's cheating on you,

345
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,440
 and someone else has been posting pictures of your cat.

346
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
 - Oh, wow.

347
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
 - But that's clever, right?

348
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,120
 So he's not posting pictures of actual people,

349
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,440
 'cause that would be a bit creepy,

350
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,480
 but he's just posting pictures of their cats.

351
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,840
 - Wasn't it the case that one of the greatest hackers

352
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,040
 that the internet has ever seen was caught,

353
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,240
 and they tried to break into his system to work out

354
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,920
 just to get into his computer to see what he'd done,

355
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,280
 and they're like, "Oh, he's gonna have the most intense

356
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
 "pass or whatever."

357
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,760
 And it turned out his password was his cat's name,

358
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,200
 and one, two, three, four.

359
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,360
 (audience laughing)

360
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,520
 - Yeah, that was--

361
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,680
 Scientists in Japan have studied cats recently,

362
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,800
 and they found that they do recognize their owner's voices,

363
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
 but they then choose to ignore them.

364
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,320
 (audience laughing)

365
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
 So they played the cat a recording of the owner

366
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
 shouting the cat's name,

367
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,560
 and then they played another recording of a stranger

368
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,880
 shouting the same cat's name.

369
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,400
 They found that the cats have a much greater response

370
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,960
 to the owner shouting their name than to a stranger,

371
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,480
 but they still do not get up.

372
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,480
 (audience laughing)

373
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,480
 But dogs are catching up online, right?

374
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,240
 In the last couple of years, I think dogs have become

375
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,600
 as prevalent online, whereas cats used to be much better,

376
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,080
 and I think the idea is that the age of the smartphone

377
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,200
 has meant that it's more friendly to dogs,

378
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,880
 because smartphones, I am told, are good at videos,

379
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,360
 and streaming them and dogs are a bit more video-friendly.

380
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,960
 So cats are very image-friendly,

381
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,920
 'cause they are still for 99.9% of the day.

382
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,080
 (audience laughing)

383
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:56,240
 But now we can actually do the video thing,

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,640
 and post that up easily and watch it,

385
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
 then dogs work better.

386
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,520
 And so now it's about 50/50 in terms of how many

387
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
 are being posted respectively.

388
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,400
 - I did not know that was the reason.

389
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,240
 - That's interesting.

390
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,240
 - It's a theory.

391
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,080
 - I don't know.

392
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,680
 - There is that place where you can feed a cat

393
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,720
 that's 4,000 miles away, can't you?

394
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
 - Oh yeah.

395
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
 - Oh, that's right.

396
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,240
 - Yeah.

397
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,440
 - There's a webcam set up for a cat sanctuary in,

398
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,760
 I wanna say Russia, and you can move a toy remotely,

399
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,960
 and you have to wait for ages in a queue,

400
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,080
 while other people get to move the toy around remotely.

401
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,040
 We did it at the office.

402
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
 We're not there that day.

403
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
 - I was, yeah.

404
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,880
 - Yeah, that was great.

405
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,440
 - Of course, a very long after this, yeah.

406
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,880
 (audience laughing)

407
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,600
 So I was looking into all these dot something sites.

408
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,800
 As we say, like, dot cat things get misappropriated

409
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,560
 for the country that they're meant to represent.

410
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,120
 So obviously, dot XXX is for porn or websites,

411
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,520
 and that one is not a country, obviously.

412
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,480
 Or if it is, "I wanna go there sometime."

413
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,680
 I don't know, Maradavikid.

414
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,280
 (audience laughing)

415
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,240
 But, dot XXX is one that is allowed,

416
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,400
 because what they wanna do is try and separate the porn

417
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,040
 so that you can actually identify it.

418
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,320
 The problem is no one's using it,

419
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
 because then people can say you're definitely using porn

420
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,040
 as opposed to a dot com website.

421
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,680
 - You could just say, "Oh no, I thought it was for people

422
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,080
 who are 30."

423
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,960
 (audience laughing)

424
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,960
 And Roman.

425
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,200
 (audience laughing)

426
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
 - That's true.

427
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,280
 - So anyway, but there's other ones.

428
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,760
 Dot AC is the Ascension Islands.

429
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,080
 They have a population of 806,

430
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,760
 and that's used largely for academicwebsites.ac.

431
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,000
 It's also used for, and I had no idea this was a big thing.

432
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,680
 Air conditioning industries.

433
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,840
 They, it's a huge thing, air conditioning industries,

434
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,560
 and they use Asc.la is for Laos,

435
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,800
 or Laos, and that's being properly marketed

436
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,560
 as for Los Angeles to use that.

437
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,320
 And then I found Dot TV,

438
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,000
 and I remember Dot TV is a famous one because it's too blue.

439
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
 So I looked at, there's a list you can see

440
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,400
 the most famous Dot TV websites that you can get.

441
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,040
 And I found last night, and I was up,

442
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,320
 'cause I've got, I've just had a son,

443
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,800
 so I was up at about 3am after feeding him

444
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
 with a bottle, and my wife was asleep,

445
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,600
 and I was doing research for tonight's show.

446
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,560
 And I found, right there, up on the list,

447
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,280
 there's all these different Dot TVs,

448
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
 hamster porn, Dot TV.

449
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,040
 - Oh, Daniel.

450
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,920
 And I saw it, and I thought,

451
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,680
 there's no way I'm not clicking that.

452
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,080
 (audience laughing)

453
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,680
 So I clicked on it,

454
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,480
 and I was brought to hamsterporn.tv,

455
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,200
 and, annoyingly, it was just a regular human porn site.

456
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,680
 There were just a bunch of,

457
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
 - That must have been really annoying.

458
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 - It was overnight.

459
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,600
 So it was all these just screen grabs of videos

460
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,960
 of humans doing porn.

461
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,040
 And as I was looking through it and just slightly upset,

462
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,360
 my wife woke up.

463
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,160
 (audience laughing)

464
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,560
 And she looked up, and she saw the screen,

465
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
 and she looked at me and went,

466
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,040
 "What are you doing? Are you looking at porn?"

467
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,880
 And I said, "No, honey, sorry,

468
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,720
 "I thought it was going to be a side of hamster porn."

469
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,720
 (audience laughing)

470
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,760
 And she literally said nothing,

471
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,320
 and turned around in the bed and went back to sleep.

472
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,680
 I can't believe you have roped us all into your lie here.

473
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
 (audience laughing)

474
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,360
 - A week on Friday,

475
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,880
 you're going to make your wife listen to it,

476
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 and go, "See?"

477
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
 (audience laughing)

478
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
 The new top level domains, though,

479
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
 just to get nerdy.

480
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,320
 That's a new thing.

481
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,360
 So the .xxx is a new thing.

482
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,280
 And so it used to only be that you're country,

483
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,160
 the .coms, the .co.uks.

484
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
 But now we can register stuff at things like,

485
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,440
 there's a big long list you can read,

486
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,440
 but .hair, .wow, . weirdly, . good,

487
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,320
 . weirdly. - Dot weirdly is lovely.

488
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,280
 (audience laughing)

489
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
 We should do us a . weirdly, isn't it?

490
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,400
 - Sorry, there's no . weirdly.

491
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,640
 I was interjecting on myself.

492
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
 But there is . Ferreiro and . roche,

493
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,080
 but there's not . Ferreiro, roche.

494
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,440
 And there's also . off,

495
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,760
 which just feels like you need to start registering

496
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,600
 the sods and the boggles and the .xx . off

497
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,200
 before they get snapped up.

498
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,720
 - Just a really quick geeky top level domain name fact.

499
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,560
 - Yeah.

500
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,320
 - For Montenegro, country of Montenegro.

501
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,000
 It was Yugoslavia, and then it went to Montenegro.

502
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,040
 And so the top level domain went from .u to .me.

503
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
 - Thank you.

504
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,880
 - Oh, God, that's awesome.

505
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,720
 - That's sort of like Bruce Forsyth kind of website.

506
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,360
 - Wait, no, like a chuckle brother's website.

507
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,200
 - Yeah.

508
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 (audience laughing)

509
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,760
 - I think you were thinking nice to see you.

510
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,000
 - That's what I was thinking to see you.

511
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,840
 - To see me. - To see you.

512
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,000
 - To see me, to see you.

513
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,240
 (audience laughing)

514
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,720
 - Thank you, James.

515
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,880
 - Yes.

516
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,800
 - We should move on.

517
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
 (audience laughing)

518
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,120
 It is time for fact number three,

519
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,240
 and that is Chazinski.

520
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,880
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that

521
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,560
 when Walmart opened in Germany,

522
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,800
 it scrapped its policy of making employees smile at customers

523
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,200
 because the Germans found it too weird.

524
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,800
 (audience laughing)

525
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,040
 This is a genuine problem.

526
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,280
 So Walmart started opening up stores in Germany in 1998,

527
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,040
 and they ended up in 95 stores opening,

528
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,680
 and it was just a disaster really,

529
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,120
 and Germany didn't really get along

530
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,280
 with Walmart very well.

531
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,240
 And one of the main reasons was these golden Walmart rules

532
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,600
 that they have in America, and they are,

533
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,960
 if a customer comes within 10 feet of view,

534
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,240
 you have to smile sweetly and offer help.

535
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,440
 And this is known as the 10 foot rule.

536
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,960
 And other things like, if a shopper made a complaint,

537
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,600
 it needs to be dealt with by sundown.

538
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,120
 That's called the sundown rule.

539
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,240
 And customers' bags have to be packed at checkout.

540
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,160
 And it turned out they did this in Germany,

541
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,880
 and they did various studies, researchers looked

542
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,440
 at how it was playing, and it was playing badly.

543
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,120
 So smiling was interpreted as flirting or creepy.

544
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,640
 And the head of the Walmart trade union said in Germany,

545
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,960
 just said, "German's don't behave that way.

546
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,360
 We don't do this smiling."

547
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,520
 And then the biggest German research institute said,

548
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,960
 "In Germany, if people try putting stuff in a bag for you,

549
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,840
 the customer will just think,

550
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
 "Hey, I just paid for that.

551
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,680
 That's mine.

552
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,160
 What are you doing putting in a bag?"

553
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
 So it didn't work.

554
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,000
 And it was just very interesting.

555
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,960
 So they had to cancel the policy,

556
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,520
 just because it's very different customer service

557
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,520
 in America to outside of America, turned out.

558
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,360
 It was amazing.

559
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,240
 I don't think Germany is being unsmily, though.

560
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,720
 I think it's that America is very smiley.

561
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,560
 Yeah.

562
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,640
 But the 10-foot rule thing, does that apply

563
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,560
 even if there's a shelf in between you and the customer?

564
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,880
 Ah, yeah.

565
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,760
 Yeah, you have to run all the way around.

566
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,200
 Yeah, and so Walmart's not in Germany anymore, is it?

567
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,720
 No.

568
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,920
 But they all closed down.

569
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,760
 I read one other thing that they thought

570
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,120
 maybe was one reason why it didn't work.

571
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,880
 And that is because Walmart employees

572
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,280
 are required every morning to stand in formation

573
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,040
 and chant "Wall-Mart," and "Wall-Mart," and they thought

574
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,280
 maybe the Germans didn't really like standing in a row

575
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,560
 chanting things for obvious reasons.

576
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,320
 They also-- they would always make them do the charm,

577
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,480
 which is like, "Give me a W. Give me an A."

578
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,200
 And apparently, lots of staff used to just hide

579
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,880
 in the toilets for that part, as I think a lot of us would,

580
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,680
 if you were forced to do that every day.

581
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,840
 And also, they had to chant every morning at the morning

582
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,520
 meeting at the end of every meeting.

583
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 The boss would say, "Who is number one?"

584
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,040
 And all the staff would have to chant.

585
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,960
 The customer, of course.

586
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,720
 So I think staff spent a lot of time in the bathrooms.

587
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,080
 Magic and a work and just chanting, no such thing as a fish.

588
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,920
 No such thing as a fish.

589
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,360
 Well, if you turned up on time a bit more often, you'd see.

590
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:39,280
 In fact, that goes for all three of you, may I say.

591
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
 So in some countries, I read the New York Times

592
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,040
 said that they've had trouble in various places.

593
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,160
 In Korea, apparently, they ran into trouble

594
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:52,000
 because they had taller racks than those of local rivals.

595
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,160
 And so it was just a bit harder to reach this stuff,

596
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,200
 and customers would have to get on ladders.

597
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,960
 So I was like, oh, maybe the average height

598
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,200
 in Korea is a bit shorter.

599
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,960
 I looked it up.

600
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,680
 Koreans are exactly the same average height as British people.

601
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,160
 So just apparently, they slightly overshot

602
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,920
 the shelf height in Walmart.

603
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,240
 But Walmart's ladder sales went hugely through the roof.

604
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,560
 It is like a cult, though.

605
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,280
 I was reading a blog by a guy called--

606
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,800
 Sorry, Andy, a blog is where people just put thoughts

607
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,760
 and stuff, yeah.

608
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,840
 I was reading a blog by an ex-wormart employee

609
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,520
 who was saying that they get really obsessed with box cutters.

610
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,040
 So they get given a box cutter when

611
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,800
 they join as a member of staff.

612
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,480
 This is in America.

613
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,640
 And he said, staff go a heapship for these box cutters.

614
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,560
 And every staff meetings, they would

615
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,800
 have Sam Walton trivia contest.

616
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,320
 Now, Sam Walton is the guy who founded Walmart.

617
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,280
 I don't know how much trivia there is about Sam Walton,

618
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,600
 but apparently enough to have a trivia quiz on him,

619
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
 every staff meeting.

620
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,040
 And where the answer is always, Sam Walton.

621
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,640
 Yeah.

622
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,440
 Is Sam Walton the best person ever?

623
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,560
 Yes, correct.

624
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,560
 Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

625
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,680
 And then the winner of that quiz, who locked onto that,

626
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,120
 would get a slightly petter box cutter.

627
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,240
 And then this member of staff said they

628
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,400
 used to taunt the other staff with their slightly better box

629
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,200
 cutters.

630
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,280
 But that's quite aggressive.

631
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,280
 Yeah, with a knife.

632
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,800
 [LAUGHTER]

633
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,880
 Oh, my, my, my, my.

634
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,240
 So I was looking at, like, smiling around the world,

635
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,320
 happiness with different countries.

636
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,840
 You always get these things where all the countries are

637
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,640
 ordered by how happy they are, don't you?

638
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,960
 And usually the same people in, like,

639
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,680
 customary or something.

640
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,200
 But Denmark has won it for the last few years.

641
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,800
 And this year, they were beaten by Norway

642
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,880
 into second place.

643
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,360
 But actually, the guy in charge of happiness in Denmark

644
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,720
 said he was, he was very happy for them.

645
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,840
 [LAUGHTER]

646
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,200
 A lying bastard.

647
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,680
 Said we don't have a monopoly on happiness.

648
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,840
 Wow.

649
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,000
 That's, I mean, but that's the ultimate happy sentence

650
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,800
 to lose the happiness competition.

651
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,560
 That's almost, we're going to have to take the prize off you.

652
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,440
 That guy just went uber happy.

653
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,160
 That's insane.

654
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,120
 Yeah, and that's obviously why he did it, the cynical bastard.

655
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,440
 He said, he said that.

656
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,000
 And then he went, are we back at the top spot?

657
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,920
 Yeah, great.

658
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,560
 And when McDonald's opened in Russia, in fact,

659
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,880
 where, you know, the service industry

660
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,920
 has slightly different cultural norms,

661
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,480
 staff would talk how to smile.

662
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,800
 The Russian staff would talk how to smile,

663
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,800
 because it's not a particularly normal thing.

664
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,440
 And actually, there was a study that was done

665
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,040
 looking at how different countries view smiling.

666
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,160
 And in Russia, most people view someone who

667
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,960
 smiles a lot as quite stupid, whereas in America,

668
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,600
 and actually in Britain, we view them as a bit more intelligent,

669
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,440
 in fact, if someone smiles at you and they engage with you.

670
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,480
 It all depends, I would say, on context.

671
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,320
 If someone's smiling at you on the bus, and they won't stop.

672
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,040
 It is true, though, actually, in Russia,

673
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,920
 because my wife's Russian, so I go to Russia occasionally,

674
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,560
 and they just don't smitling photographs.

675
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,360
 They do a bit now, but in the olden days,

676
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,440
 they really wouldn't smile in photographs.

677
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,680
 And there was very much frowned upon.

678
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,760
 [LAUGHTER]

679
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

680
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,080
 I almost bottled out of that joke, I'm with her.

681
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,800
 And I thought there's no word to go with it.

682
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,600
 But it is actually true.

683
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,120
 Yeah.

684
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,880
 If you see old pictures of Russians even from the '80s and '90s,

685
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,040
 they're just very--

686
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,040
 Yeah.

687
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,560
 Americans used to be really serious.

688
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,040
 They used to have a reputation of being serious

689
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,520
 until the mid-19th century.

690
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,600
 Any.

691
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,480
 Well, didn't-- so I was just thinking of the very old photos

692
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,160
 that used to get taken when nobody's smiling.

693
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,480
 And you often read that in the reason

694
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,840
 that no one's smiling is because they--

695
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,080
 that just was the thing.

696
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,320
 You just don't smile.

697
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,560
 I didn't realize it's because of the long exposure of the photo.

698
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,000
 So it takes so long for the photo to be taken.

699
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,240
 And you don't know exactly what point it's going to be.

700
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,120
 You just had to keep a normal face.

701
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
 I mean, not in the 1980s.

702
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,600
 We had a camera technology had come quite long.

703
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,320
 No, no, no.

704
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,400
 I mean, the super-old school--

705
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,160
 we're talking like, I guess, the BC.

706
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,120
 Before cameras.

707
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
 Yeah.

708
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,880
 [LAUGHTER]

709
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,720
 But so because, yeah, the exposure was too long.

710
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,040
 So to hold a smile, to hold the cheese,

711
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,080
 it would be so long that you would just look pained.

712
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,120
 And it would be, yeah.

713
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,600
 I have read a debunk of that, actually, just for the record,

714
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,360
 that maybe the exposure wasn't quite as long as we thought.

715
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
 Maybe it was only about 30 seconds

716
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,600
 and anyone could hold a smile for 30 seconds.

717
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,440
 But I don't know.

718
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,120
 No, but they were just getting used to smiles back then.

719
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,920
 It would have felt a lot longer.

720
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760
 Yeah.

721
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,560
 They could have had a happiness hat.

722
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,680
 This was something in the news a few years ago.

723
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,600
 And the happiness of that was a hat, obviously.

724
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
 And it was made of metal.

725
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
 And it had these kind of metal bits coming down the side.

726
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,840
 And then it had a metal spike.

727
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,880
 And whenever it sensed that you were frowning,

728
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,720
 it would stab you in the head with a spike.

729
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,240
 I remind you to smile.

730
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,880
 Oh, god.

731
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,400
 Really?

732
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:49,920
 Sorry.

733
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,440
 Which shopping chain was this?

734
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,080
 Where was this?

735
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,680
 It was just one guy who invented it.

736
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,000
 All right.

737
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,480
 But he hit the news.

738
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,680
 Yeah.

739
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,600
 Wow.

740
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,840
 Should we move on to our final fact?

741
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,360
 Yeah, we should.

742
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

743
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,360
 And that is my fact.

744
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,200
 My fact this week is that it is really easy

745
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,200
 to beat chimpanzees at the game Rock Paper Scissors.

746
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,720
 Yeah, they're shit at it.

747
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,760
 Chimpanzees have recently been taught to play.

748
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,720
 Stone Paper Scissors, Rock Paper Scissors,

749
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
 Rush Ambo, whatever you call the game.

750
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,160
 And they actually-- the flip side is,

751
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,560
 they actually know how to play Stone Paper Scissors.

752
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,600
 It's amazing.

753
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,440
 And they can learn it to the level of what

754
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,200
 a four-year-old would learn it.

755
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,680
 So you could actually, at the moment,

756
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,200
 they've only been playing with computer simulation.

757
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,600
 So playing against a computer or an iPad.

758
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,080
 But if you were to play them, you could actually

759
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,840
 have a genuine game with the movements of Rock Paper Scissors

760
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,800
 and beat them.

761
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,160
 The reason you can beat them is they're really bad at learning

762
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,000
 from their mistakes.

763
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,360
 So whereas four-year-olds will make a mistake

764
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,240
 and go, I need to adjust.

765
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,000
 chimpanzees will be like, I'll use paper again.

766
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,840
 And then afterwards, when they're beating again,

767
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,160
 they'll be like, I'll go for paper this time.

768
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,120
 And then when you beat them again, he's

769
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,760
 not going to see what's coming next.

770
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,360
 Good old trusty paper.

771
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,160
 And then--

772
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,200
 If I was playing against them, I might think

773
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,680
 they're not going to be stupid enough to go for paper again.

774
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,840
 That's why I would probably lose.

775
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,480
 I still saw about the matter she lost.

776
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,880
 Actually, they're a lot better than you'd think, then.

777
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,160
 It's interesting, because it took them--

778
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,640
 the chimpanzees who learned it-- I think on seven chimpanzees

779
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,840
 and five of them managed to master it.

780
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,800
 It did take them 100 days to learn it.

781
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,680
 So it's a very, very long time for them to learn.

782
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,520
 Yeah, there it is.

783
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,160
 It's a simple game.

784
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,440
 I mean, I don't want to brag.

785
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,120
 I got it in about 30 days, anyway.

786
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,960
 But the really tricky thing that the chimpanzees didn't get

787
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,880
 was the circular nature of it.

788
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,240
 So they understood rock beat scissors.

789
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
 And then they understood, OK, scissors beat paper.

790
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,280
 But they found it hard to get the head around paper

791
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,480
 then beats rock.

792
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,000
 Really?

793
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
 That makes it even more weird that they

794
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,880
 went for paper every time.

795
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
 [LAUGHTER]

796
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
 But actually, I'm with them.

797
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,000
 Why does paper beat rock?

798
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,080
 I mean, I know it covers it.

799
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
 You're rapping.

800
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,680
 You're rapping.

801
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,720
 But that's not beaten, is it?

802
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,160
 I mean, scissors is actually demolishing the paper, isn't it?

803
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,400
 And the rock is demolishing the scissors.

804
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,280
 Yeah, but if you hide a rock in some paper,

805
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
 you can smuggle it into a recycling bin.

806
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,240
 [LAUGHTER]

807
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,040
 Got it.

808
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,280
 Yeah.

809
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,320
 In Japan, it's a tiger village chief

810
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,880
 and the village chief's mother, right?

811
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,560
 And that's that sort of thing.

812
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,720
 And so the village chief's mother kills the village chief,

813
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,160
 because she's angry with him.

814
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,640
 The village chief kills the tiger,

815
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,040
 and the tiger kills the village chief's mother.

816
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,800
 Do you know the Indonesian version?

817
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,640
 No.

818
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,040
 And human elephant.

819
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,320
 So the human tramples the elephant--

820
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,480
 [LAUGHTER]

821
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,720
 There's tiny elephants, they have an Indonesian.

822
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,960
 I think I got confused between ant and elephant and--

823
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,160
 and it focks me.

824
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,960
 Sorry.

825
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,560
 The human tramples the ant.

826
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,720
 The human tramples the ant.

827
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,400
 Then the elephant squashes the human.

828
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,040
 But then the ant beats the elephant by--

829
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:17,880
 The tramples it.

830
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,360
 Yeah.

831
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,680
 Is that the ant gets into the elephant's ear,

832
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
 and it tickles it?

833
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,680
 Ah.

834
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,200
 Really?

835
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,920
 I read that the ant crawls up the elephant's trunk

836
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,280
 and eats its brain.

837
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,320
 Maybe-- oh, sorry, I have a sick--

838
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
 Oh, I had parental guide long on.

839
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,880
 [LAUGHTER]

840
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,720
 It's-- so I am very confused by the chimp fight.

841
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,080
 I didn't realize they were less good than us,

842
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,720
 because there's no such thing as being good at rock paper

843
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,400
 scissors.

844
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,880
 There is no strategy.

845
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,080
 You can't love for me on mistakes,

846
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,520
 because we all basically make the same mistakes,

847
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,840
 and we can't really predict each other.

848
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,680
 Particularly.

849
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,600
 I mean, if you're really a pro, if you may be--

850
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,760
 If you've obviously not been on the rock paper scissors website,

851
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,880
 they have a lot of tactics on that.

852
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,840
 One thing is if your opponent pays scissors in the first go,

853
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,920
 you can tell by how wide the scissors

854
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,800
 is what they're going to do in the next go.

855
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,520
 No, you can't.

856
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,880
 Well, no, you can't.

857
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,600
 I mean, they say you can.

858
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,960
 They have another-- apparently, this is a trendy strategy.

859
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,360
 It's the exclusion strategy.

860
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,840
 OK, so you never play say rock, and you keep doing different ones.

861
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,600
 You keep doing paper or scissors, and your opponent just

862
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,320
 gets obsessed by the fact that you've never played rock,

863
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,840
 and it just fucks with their mind.

864
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,640
 That's great.

865
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,480
 It's a good idea, right?

866
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,040
 And that's the trendy strategy.

867
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,200
 That's the trendy one.

868
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
 Now, that's how to be cool as someone who

869
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,040
 subscribes to rockpapersizzas.com.

870
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,080
 You don't actually have to subscribe to a website.

871
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,840
 You can just-- you can just go there and then go away.

872
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,440
 Some of them you do, like, hamsterpawn.com.

873
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,520
 Children are very hard to play at rockpapersizzas.

874
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,280
 I mean, they're very good at playing it,

875
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,640
 because their choices are genuinely random.

876
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,120
 Yeah.

877
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,640
 They haven't yet mastered the gambits that James is discussing,

878
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,800
 so they're much likely just to go with whatever.

879
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,040
 And that makes them quite hard to beat.

880
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,800
 Right.

881
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,440
 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

882
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,840
 You don't want to overthink it.

883
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,120
 Hey, I found a cool thing about chimpanzees.

884
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,640
 Chimpanzees can recognize each other by face, like we do.

885
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,360
 But if they're just walking along and a chimpanzee's

886
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,720
 facing the other way, and the butt is showing,

887
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,640
 they'll see the butt and be like, Greg, they

888
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,400
 have an understanding of Bums that they can just--

889
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,640
 if you put like a lineup of Bums in front of them,

890
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,560
 they'd be like Mark Sonia, Alice, John.

891
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,080
 Is that what chimp lineups are?

892
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,200
 Is it like any of these people, the people who pick

893
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,320
 pocketed you the other day, Mrs. Chimp?

894
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,680
 And then she's like that bum there, yeah.

895
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,400
 Yeah, it's good, because once you've robbed someone,

896
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,280
 you run away, don't you?

897
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,360
 So you're likely to see the bum.

898
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,040
 Perfect.

899
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,800
 Yes.

900
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,720
 Exactly.

901
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,080
 Oh, there was-- I heard an amazing burl-growry.

902
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,680
 Burl-- burl-growry.

903
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,320
 Rubbery?

904
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,160
 Rubbery, right?

905
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,120
 We did the audiobook the other day for the book that we've done.

906
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,800
 And it took forever for me to say basic words like that.

907
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,000
 The best one was when you misread February as January.

908
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,280
 It was truly bizarre.

909
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,480
 Yeah, so there was this fact that we found the other day,

910
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,000
 which is that a burglar is always most likely

911
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,840
 going to knock on your door before they burgle you.

912
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,800
 Isn't that weird?

913
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,160
 Is that so they can check if someone's in?

914
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,040
 Yeah, basically.

915
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:34,560
 Yeah, that makes sense.

916
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,240
 If you're going to get robbed, they're just always

917
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,560
 going to knock for us, like in a polite fashion,

918
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,880
 as opposed to just breaking a window or whatever.

919
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,800
 Yeah, I don't think it's our politeness that they're doing it,

920
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,320
 but yeah.

921
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,040
 [LAUGHTER]

922
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,880
 So have you read the thing about chimps

923
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,400
 that they, according to the New York Times,

924
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,640
 have the ability to cook if only someone would give them

925
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,320
 an oven?

926
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,960
 This is what scientists--

927
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,800
 I'm like that.

928
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,680
 This is something the scientists have just concluded.

929
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,200
 And they did this in a study where the researcher in Volvo

930
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,880
 said, we invented a magic cooking device

931
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,560
 to test it on the chimps.

932
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,560
 As they explained it, it's two plastic bowls.

933
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,800
 And the chimps are raw potato in one of the plastic bowls.

934
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,560
 And then in the other one, there's a cooked potato,

935
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,000
 and you maneuver the bowls to make the chimps think

936
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,240
 that his raw potato has been cooked.

937
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,640
 Why this guy didn't just use the already existing oven

938
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,400
 that we have, I don't know.

939
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,160
 But it turns out that chimps do prefer--

940
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,680
 if you give them a bit of raw potato,

941
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,000
 they prefer to put it in the plastic bowl that will then

942
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 magically cook the potato and then to eat the cooked potato.

943
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,560
 Then just to eat it raw.

944
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,840
 And so that kind of shows that chimps have self-control.

945
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,360
 They're willing to postpone the potato to make it taste nicer.

946
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,160
 And also, according to the scientists who did the experiment,

947
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:51,000
 it said, it shows they have the causal understanding

948
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,320
 to make the leap to cooking, which I would argue,

949
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,480
 believing that you're putting a raw potato into a plastic bowl

950
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,280
 and then leaving it for 10 seconds before getting a cooked one,

951
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,240
 is not having the causal understanding.

952
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,000
 Yeah, that's true.

953
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,760
 I didn't know they preferred cooked food.

954
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,520
 Yeah, neither did I.

955
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,040
 But I don't know how my microwave works.

956
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,600
 If you told me that some scientists just

957
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,400
 replace it with a cooked risotto.

958
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,360
 I'll buy it.

959
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,480
 OK, should we wrap up?

960
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,760
 OK, that is all our facts.

961
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,840

 You Andy or--

967
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,280
 Excuse me.

968
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,600
 Me, Andy.

969
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,720
 Chuckle Brothers.

970
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,840
 I can't see what that was, Bruce Porsoy.

971
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:45,760
 Um, it's an anti-clomax now, but Andrew Hunter M.

972
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
 James?

973
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
 It's James Harkin.

974
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,840

981

 It's out November 2nd, and we're about to give one away, actually,

982
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,080
 to one of the members of the audience who sent us a fact.

983
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,160
 James, you've got the facts.

984
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:09,680
 I have.

985
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,880
 It is from Scott Robinson.

986
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,440
 And the fact is that cleaning your teeth

987
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,720
 is the only time you get to clean your skeleton.

988
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,080
 That's so cool.

989
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:20,280
 So creepy.

990
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,560
 So creepy.

991
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,160
 Is that true?

992
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
 That's our skeleton?

993
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
 Not quite true, you just said.

994
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,720
 Whoa, we've not had this on the show before.

995
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,240
 Who shouted fight?

996
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:39,440
 I think what we can do is a game of rock paper scissors.

997
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,880
 Oh, yes, yes.

998
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,760
 So this guy here, who, the quibbler, I'm going to call you.

999
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,240
 If you show in front of your chest what you want to do for rock paper scissors,

1000
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,080
 and then we'll get Scott to shout out what he wants to do,

1001
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,640
 and we'll see if there's a winner.

1002
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,440
 Oh, wow.

1003
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,240
 This is so exciting.

1004
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,200
 So wait, I can't see it.

1005
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,520
 Yeah, I can see it.

1006
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
 I can see it.

1007
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,720
 OK, Scott shout out.

1008
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,520
 What have you got?

1009
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,640
 His Scott's the winner.

1010
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,680
 Yeah, it was me.

1011
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:12,640
 Scott, come and grab a book from us.

1012
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,840
 We'll be here.

1013
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,240
 You went for paper.

1014
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,160
 Let's do it again.

1015
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,120
 He'll never do paper again.

1016
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,000
 Oh, that.

1017
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,520
 He won't do paper.

1018
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,480
 OK, well, we'll be back again next week with another episode.

1019
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,160
 Thank you so much for being here, everyone.

1020
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,240
 Thank you so, so much.

1021
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,320
 We'll see you again next week.

1022
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,160
 Goodbye.
