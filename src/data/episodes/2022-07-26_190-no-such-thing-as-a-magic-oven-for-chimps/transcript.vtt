00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 (slow rock music)

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.380
 (speaking in foreign language)

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.960
 (upbeat music)

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.540
 (upbeat music)

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:18.300
 - Hello, and welcome to another episode

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.520
 of "No Such Thing as a Fish" a weekly podcast

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.000
 this week coming to you from the Stan Comedy Club

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400
 in Newcastle.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.400
 (audience cheering)

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.400
 (audience cheering)

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.280
 - My name is Dan Schreiber.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.100
 I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.440
 Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.520
 And once again, we have gathered around the microphones

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.840
 with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.360
 and no particular order.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.280
 Here we go, starting with you, Andy.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 - My fact this week is that Britain exports

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.480
 over 50,000 boomerangs every year to Australia.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.460
 (audience laughing)

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.480
 - And then imports them again, presumably.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.880
 - Yeah, this is just something that happens.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 This is, who knew that the post-Brexit Britain

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 is gonna be boomerangs to Australia,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800
 Colton, Newcastle. - Is this a recent thing?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.400
 - Oh, by the way, the phrase Colton, Newcastle,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.120
 is that well known here?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.960
 - Yeah.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.280
 - Yeah, 'cause we tried it on some people in London,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 like young people, and they'd never heard of it.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.760
 - Yeah. - That's true.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.440
 - Actually, anyone under the age of about 25

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.360
 in London had heard of it, maybe 30 even.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.960
 But actually, they import Colt and Newcastle, don't they?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.800
 Oh, don't you?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.000
 Well, do you?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.480
 (audience laughing)

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.320
 Yes, you do.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.160
 - Great.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.960
 (audience laughing)

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.720
 - In 2013, Newcastle imported 4.9 million tons

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.620
 of Colt, the second most in the UK

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.460
 after somewhere in Scotland.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.920
 - Wow. - No way.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.720
 - What are they doing with it?

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.640
 (audience laughing)

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.960
 - Do you all get some?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 Is that--

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.280
 - I think, yeah, then it's sent around the country

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.240
 for people to burn them.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.040
 - That's what you do with Colt.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.240
 - No, I know what you do with Colt.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.200
 I just didn't know what Newcastle was doing with Colt.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.200
 - What special thing?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.120
 Do you think Newcastle does with Colt?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.680
 Well, apparently, they just send it back out again.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.680
 (audience laughing)

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.520
 - It's like the boomerangs.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520
 - The thing is, Dad, right?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.000
 The UK is an island, and when we bring stuff in,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680
 it has to go into a pot, and Newcastle's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.840
 one of the best pots we have.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.680
 - Now I get it.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.200
 I thought you meant like Manchester was sending Colt.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.440
 - I thought Newport was just collecting Colt,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800
 and then when now you can have it back.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800
 - Newport is somewhere else.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.800
 (audience laughing)

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 - Wait, so what's happened?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 - Oh my God.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.920
 - Can we recap?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.560
 What's--

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.360
 - Don't worry, I think you're trying to learn enough toes.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.640
 It's a good thing James just said,

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.640
 "They've got the best pot, kiss us."

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.040
 (audience laughing)

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.120
 So we've won a few people over with that.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.560
 - Anyway, my fact this week is that Britain exports

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.400
 over 50,000 boomerangs a year to Australia.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080
 - I looked at these boomerangs,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.760
 and they don't look very boomerang-like.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.080
 - Well, wait till they hit you in the back of the head, James.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.640
 - No, well, they're toy boomerangs.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.440
 - Yeah, they got three sticky outfits, I think.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.280
 - That's true.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 - Are you sure?

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
 That's like fidget spinners, right?

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.360
 - Yeah, they look like fidget spinners.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.200
 - Yeah.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.040
 - Big ones.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.000
 - But they're called sports boomerangs or something.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.840
 - Yeah.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.680
 - Yeah.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.080
 - And they basically fly for miles and they do come back.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.920
 - Yeah.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.280
 - And the really cool thing is the guy who runs the company

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.200
 which sells them, his name is David Strang, okay?

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.920
 And he moved from Scotland to Australia at the age of eight,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.800
 and then at the age of 20, he came back.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.800
 (audience laughing)

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.840
 - Can I just ask, just a bug says,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.600
 "Did we all just exclusively look for facts

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.560
 "where something went away and came back?"

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.080
 (audience laughing)

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.640
 - So it's just him, isn't it?

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.520
 It's just this one guy, this one company

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.160
 that's making them an expert in them.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.000
 Is that right?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.840
 - That's right, yeah.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.560
 - So you know the song, my boomerang won't come back?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.400
 - Yeah.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.240
 - My boomerang.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.080
 - I tell you, no.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.400
 (audience laughing)

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.080
 - It's a song, comedy song.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.920
 It's a comedy song.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.760
 - It's a comedy song.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.760
 - Oh yeah, 50s, my boomerang won't come back.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.320
 Everyone else knows it, right?

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.800
 - You guys are?

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.120
 - It's really famous song.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.360
 - Like six people are saying, yeah.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.320
 How many, how many people don't know it?

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.920
 (audience cheering)

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.160
 I mean, that's huge.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.560
 - That's, yeah.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.520
 - All right, minority, do you know who produced that song?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.960
 A certain George Martin, who went on

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.800
 to produce more famous songs by The Beatles.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.000
 So The Beatles, you've been the guy

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.480
 who wrote Game of Thrones.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.040
 (audience laughing)

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.600
 I did not, that was his big break.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.640
 My boomerang won't come back,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.280
 and then she went on to make The Beatles, yeah.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 - In the course of researching this,

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.920
 I actually listened to that song on repeat

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.280
 for about two days now.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.120
 - Did you?

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.280
 - Yeah, it's very good.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.120
 - He is good.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.480
 - By these days, it's a bit culturally insensitive.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.760
 So, I'm not gonna praise it.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.080
 (audience laughing)

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.880
 - Do you know who else owned boomerangs?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.080
 - Tutankamoon.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.040
 - Oh, yes, it's full of boomerangs.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.880
 - No.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.720
 - It was okay.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.120
 - It was full of boomerangs.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 (audience laughing)

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.320
 - If we get through these boomerangs,

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.640
 you might find something.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.440
 (audience laughing)

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.920
 - Tutankamoon back as soon as you're done.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.120
 - Oh my God.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.440
 - No.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.880
 All right, I'm sorry.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.720
 (audience laughing)

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.920
 - So, do you know what is the world record

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.600
 longest time a boomerang has been in the air?

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.440
 - No.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.960
 - Do you want to have a guess in minutes?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 - Minutes.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 - Three minutes.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.160
 - Thirty-seven minutes.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.560
 - Thirty-seven minutes.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.600
 (audience laughing)

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.320
 - What do you think a bird flew off with it?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.840
 (audience laughing)

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.840
 - Well, the answer is 1,440 minutes and nine seconds.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.320
 - Come on.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.320
 (audience laughing)

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.160
 - Don't, don't.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.400
 - For less than a house at home,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.680
 Dan's whacking his finger at me.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.960
 Like, and I told you so, hey.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960
 - Can you explain to me?

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.320
 - I can, and you're not gonna like it.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.320
 (audience laughing)

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.160
 - It's space, right?

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.440
 - It's a guy called Jay Parrott,

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.240
 and he was at the South Pole, and he threw it,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.680
 so it went through all of the different time zones.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.760
 So, technically, it went around 24 hours.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.840
 - Ah, that's awesome.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.400
 - I'm not the only one who didn't like it.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 (audience laughing)

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.640
 - I actually have the world, the Guinness World Record,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.520
 for the longest distance of--

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.840
 - You have a congratulations.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.160
 - No, sorry. - No, sorry.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.000
 - Yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.680
 (audience cheering)

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.840
 - I can't.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.680
 - I can't.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.000
 - You hide your talent under a bottle then.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.440
 (audience laughing)

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.680
 Imagine if that was true.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.240
 This was the first time we'd ever heard of it.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.000
 - I like to brag.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.480
 - Yeah, no, 2005, the Guinness World Record

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.920
 was set for the longest throw of a boomerang,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.560
 and do you wanna have a guess of how far that was?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.560
 - Oh, 80,000 miles.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.360
 (audience laughing)

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.000
 - If you could take my question seriously, man.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 (audience laughing)

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.840
 - James, do you wanna have a guess?

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.760
 - Well, let's say I think it would be about 300, 400 yards.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.240
 - I've got it written down here, sir, for real.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.120
 - Okay, great.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.120
 (audience laughing)

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.080
 - So why don't you have a guess anyway, Anna?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.080
 - Is it?

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.080
 - I only have 428, 7 meters.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.600
 (audience laughing)

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.080
 - Well, I've got it in feet, so I don't know what that is.

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.080
 (audience laughing)

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.440
 - So yeah, you might be right.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.400
 - Tell me in feet, and I'll convert it for you.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.880
 - 1,401, put it on.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.400
 - 427 meters.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.040
 (audience laughing)

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.560
 - So Anna was closest.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.000
 (audience laughing)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.320
 - So this was set in Queensland, in Australia,

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.400
 and it was set by a guy called Mr. Shumy.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.240
 And Mr. Shumy, when he was asked about it, he said,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.360
 it wasn't really a boomerang throw,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.040
 admitted Shumy, as it didn't come back.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.400
 (audience laughing)

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.720
 But weirdly, the Guinness World Records thought

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.560
 we'll just accept it.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.160
 - 'Cause the record should be zero meters.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.400
 - Exactly, exactly, yeah.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.200
 - Well, the record for a returning one,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.040
 which I think is the one that should really stand,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.720
 is a Swiss guy actually, who threw it 238 meters out,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.920
 and then 238 meters back, which is further altogether

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.960
 than Mr. Shumy, isn't it?

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.680
 - Again, you've thrown numbers that I don't understand.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.440
 (audience laughing)

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.280
 - It is.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.280
 (audience laughing)

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.000
 - We need to move on to our second fact.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.640
 Okay, so it is time for fact number two, and that is James.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.960
 - Okay, my fact this week is that the Catalan region

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.560
 does regular checks of websites that end with .cat

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.240
 to check that they're about Catalonia and not about cats.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.240
 (audience laughing)

00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.560
 - Are they the only two options?

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.560
 - Well, no, but it seems, basically,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.640
 they want all of the websites that are .cat,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.280
 'cause that's the Catalan domain name.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.720
 They want them to all be about Catalonia,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.880
 but actually everyone else wants to put cats on the internet.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.760
 And when you put cats on the internet,

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.160
 what you're gonna do, you're gonna put .cat, right?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.960
 And so people do it all the time.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.040
 And every now and then, they have to do an audit,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.640
 and they give people six months to shut the down their website,

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.480
 or add a translation tool to translate their website

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.480
 into Catalan.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.240
 So there is a website called, is it Nian on Nian?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.400
 Does anyone know Nian?

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.800
 So it's Nian, you'll all know about it.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.960
 It's like a little cartoon cat that's got like a rainbow on it,

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.560
 and it's a stupid song that happens.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.120
 And that was Nian.cat, and they were told they had to take it down

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.160
 until they put a translation tool.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.400
 And so now you can watch Nian cat in Catalan.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.240
 - Wow.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.400
 - Thank God.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.000
 Yeah, but it's really for the Catalan people,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.520
 it's really important, obviously, a lot in the news at the moment,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.920
 but I think they were the first sort of group of people

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.520
 rather than the country to have their own top-level internet,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.360
 the main name.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.800
 - Yeah, there were only eight top-level domains were allowed,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.880
 and then the Catalonia people said,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.000
 "No, we want a night, we want it to be our own space."

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.680
 - And it was because one of the guys who organized it was Catalan.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.840
 So that kind of helped.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.680
 - It was really?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.560
 - Yeah, he was called Amadou Abriel, E Abriel.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.400
 And he was a lion.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.840
 And he was kind of part of the top-level internet thing.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.960
 But he was Catalan, so he kind of managed to pull a few strings.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.640
 - They are very active internet users, though, apparently.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.480
 - Cats, yeah.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320
 - The cats.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.120
 It's them that are posting all these pictures of themselves.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.520
 The Catalonians too, though.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.600
 So in 2013, Catalan was the eighth most-used language

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.520
 on blogs online, which is kind of extraordinary,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.680
 given that they're hot like eight million,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.200
 eight to 10 million Catalan speakers.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.840
 They love the internet.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.760
 - It'll never catch on.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.560
 - I think I heard that blogging is massive.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.400
 - Yeah.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.240
 - I'm sorry.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.160
 - Because it is dad.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.000
 - Yeah.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.640
 - And I have this thing.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640
 It's called Myspace.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.480
 - And you go on.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.320
 No, it's because they're obviously they want to be independent

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.760
 from Spain, a lot of people in Catalonia.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.680
 So they blog and they have message boards,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.960
 which are all about Catalonian issues.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.760
 And it's a very sort of adhesive identity, basically.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.600
 - Yes.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.880
 - Did you read about the guy, though,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.560
 who has started a cat-based internet thing

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.360
 that is really cool?

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.920
 He started stalking cats around the world,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.200
 and then he started posting up where they live online.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.240
 So what happens is, if you post a picture of your cat on Flickr,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.400
 or like one of the other ones, Instagram.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.840
 (audience laughing)

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.680
 - Ask Jeeves.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.600
 You put a cat on the Jeeves.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.080
 - You can put a cat on Ask Jeeves.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.880
 And he'll take the cat, and he'll scrape all the data

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.720
 from behind it.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720
 - Oh!

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720
 - All the message.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.960
 - Who is this pervert?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.080
 Why are you telling us about him?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.040
 - He's not a pervert.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.200
 He's someone who's trying to highlight the security problems

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.480
 online with posting your pictures up,

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.720
 because you often accidentally geotag yourself

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.960
 when you put pictures up.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.040
 And so he's created this map of the world,

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:18.640
 and you can see all the cats that live in certain places.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.960
 So if you've ever posted a picture of your cat up,

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.600
 then you can go to where you live,

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.560
 and your cat may well be there.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.600
 Or you might go to near where you live and see your cat,

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.360
 and then you'll know that it's cheating on you,

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.440
 and someone else has been posting pictures of your cat.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.440
 - Oh, wow.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:34.440
 - But that's clever, right?

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.120
 So he's not posting pictures of actual people,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.440
 'cause that would be a bit creepy,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.480
 but he's just posting pictures of their cats.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.840
 - Wasn't it the case that one of the greatest hackers

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.040
 that the internet has ever seen was caught,

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:47.240
 and they tried to break into his system to work out

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.920
 just to get into his computer to see what he'd done,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.280
 and they're like, "Oh, he's gonna have the most intense

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.440
 "pass or whatever."

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.760
 And it turned out his password was his cat's name,

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:55.200
 and one, two, three, four.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.360
 (audience laughing)

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.520
 - Yeah, that was--

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.680
 Scientists in Japan have studied cats recently,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.800
 and they found that they do recognize their owner's voices,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.800
 but they then choose to ignore them.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.320
 (audience laughing)

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.480
 So they played the cat a recording of the owner

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480
 shouting the cat's name,

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.560
 and then they played another recording of a stranger

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.880
 shouting the same cat's name.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.400
 They found that the cats have a much greater response

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.960
 to the owner shouting their name than to a stranger,

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:23.480
 but they still do not get up.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.480
 (audience laughing)

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.480
 But dogs are catching up online, right?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.240
 In the last couple of years, I think dogs have become

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.600
 as prevalent online, whereas cats used to be much better,

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.080
 and I think the idea is that the age of the smartphone

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.200
 has meant that it's more friendly to dogs,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.880
 because smartphones, I am told, are good at videos,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.360
 and streaming them and dogs are a bit more video-friendly.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.960
 So cats are very image-friendly,

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.920
 'cause they are still for 99.9% of the day.

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.080
 (audience laughing)

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.240
 But now we can actually do the video thing,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.640
 and post that up easily and watch it,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640
 then dogs work better.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.520
 And so now it's about 50/50 in terms of how many

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.920
 are being posted respectively.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.400
 - I did not know that was the reason.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.240
 - That's interesting.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.240
 - It's a theory.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.080
 - I don't know.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.680
 - There is that place where you can feed a cat

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.720
 that's 4,000 miles away, can't you?

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.560
 - Oh yeah.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.400
 - Oh, that's right.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.240
 - Yeah.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.440
 - There's a webcam set up for a cat sanctuary in,

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.760
 I wanna say Russia, and you can move a toy remotely,

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.960
 and you have to wait for ages in a queue,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.080
 while other people get to move the toy around remotely.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.040
 We did it at the office.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040
 We're not there that day.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040
 - I was, yeah.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.880
 - Yeah, that was great.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.440
 - Of course, a very long after this, yeah.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.880
 (audience laughing)

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.600
 So I was looking into all these dot something sites.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.800
 As we say, like, dot cat things get misappropriated

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.560
 for the country that they're meant to represent.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.120
 So obviously, dot XXX is for porn or websites,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.520
 and that one is not a country, obviously.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.480
 Or if it is, "I wanna go there sometime."

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.680
 I don't know, Maradavikid.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.280
 (audience laughing)

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.240
 But, dot XXX is one that is allowed,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.400
 because what they wanna do is try and separate the porn

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.040
 so that you can actually identify it.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.320
 The problem is no one's using it,

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.800
 because then people can say you're definitely using porn

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.040
 as opposed to a dot com website.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.680
 - You could just say, "Oh no, I thought it was for people

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.080
 who are 30."

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.960
 (audience laughing)

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960
 And Roman.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.200
 (audience laughing)

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.160
 - That's true.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.280
 - So anyway, but there's other ones.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.760
 Dot AC is the Ascension Islands.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.080
 They have a population of 806,

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.760
 and that's used largely for academicwebsites.ac.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.000
 It's also used for, and I had no idea this was a big thing.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.680
 Air conditioning industries.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.840
 They, it's a huge thing, air conditioning industries,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.560
 and they use Asc.la is for Laos,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.800
 or Laos, and that's being properly marketed

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.560
 as for Los Angeles to use that.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.320
 And then I found Dot TV,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.000
 and I remember Dot TV is a famous one because it's too blue.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.440
 So I looked at, there's a list you can see

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.400
 the most famous Dot TV websites that you can get.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.040
 And I found last night, and I was up,

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.320
 'cause I've got, I've just had a son,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.800
 so I was up at about 3am after feeding him

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.400
 with a bottle, and my wife was asleep,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.600
 and I was doing research for tonight's show.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.560
 And I found, right there, up on the list,

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.280
 there's all these different Dot TVs,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.280
 hamster porn, Dot TV.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:15.040
 - Oh, Daniel.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.920
 And I saw it, and I thought,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.680
 there's no way I'm not clicking that.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:21.080
 (audience laughing)

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.680
 So I clicked on it,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.480
 and I was brought to hamsterporn.tv,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:30.200
 and, annoyingly, it was just a regular human porn site.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.680
 There were just a bunch of,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.880
 - That must have been really annoying.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.880
 - It was overnight.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.600
 So it was all these just screen grabs of videos

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.960
 of humans doing porn.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.040
 And as I was looking through it and just slightly upset,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.360
 my wife woke up.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.160
 (audience laughing)

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.560
 And she looked up, and she saw the screen,

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.240
 and she looked at me and went,

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.040
 "What are you doing? Are you looking at porn?"

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.880
 And I said, "No, honey, sorry,

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.720
 "I thought it was going to be a side of hamster porn."

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.720
 (audience laughing)

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:05.760
 And she literally said nothing,

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.320
 and turned around in the bed and went back to sleep.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.680
 I can't believe you have roped us all into your lie here.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.440
 (audience laughing)

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.360
 - A week on Friday,

00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.880
 you're going to make your wife listen to it,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880
 and go, "See?"

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.480
 (audience laughing)

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:20.480
 The new top level domains, though,

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480
 just to get nerdy.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.320
 That's a new thing.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.360
 So the .xxx is a new thing.

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.280
 And so it used to only be that you're country,

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.160
 the .coms, the .co.uks.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.960
 But now we can register stuff at things like,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.440
 there's a big long list you can read,

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.440
 but .hair, .wow, . weirdly, . good,

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.320
 . weirdly. - Dot weirdly is lovely.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.280
 (audience laughing)

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.760
 We should do us a . weirdly, isn't it?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.400
 - Sorry, there's no . weirdly.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.640
 I was interjecting on myself.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.320
 But there is . Ferreiro and . roche,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.080
 but there's not . Ferreiro, roche.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:52.440
 And there's also . off,

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.760
 which just feels like you need to start registering

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.600
 the sods and the boggles and the .xx . off

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.200
 before they get snapped up.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.720
 - Just a really quick geeky top level domain name fact.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.560
 - Yeah.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.320
 - For Montenegro, country of Montenegro.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.000
 It was Yugoslavia, and then it went to Montenegro.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.040
 And so the top level domain went from .u to .me.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040
 - Thank you.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.880
 - Oh, God, that's awesome.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.720
 - That's sort of like Bruce Forsyth kind of website.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.360
 - Wait, no, like a chuckle brother's website.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.200
 - Yeah.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.200
 (audience laughing)

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.760
 - I think you were thinking nice to see you.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.000
 - That's what I was thinking to see you.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.840
 - To see me. - To see you.

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.000
 - To see me, to see you.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.240
 (audience laughing)

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.720
 - Thank you, James.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.880
 - Yes.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:39.800
 - We should move on.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.320
 (audience laughing)

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.120
 It is time for fact number three,

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.240
 and that is Chazinski.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.880
 - Yeah, my fact this week is that

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.560
 when Walmart opened in Germany,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.800
 it scrapped its policy of making employees smile at customers

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.200
 because the Germans found it too weird.

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.800
 (audience laughing)

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.040
 This is a genuine problem.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.280
 So Walmart started opening up stores in Germany in 1998,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.040
 and they ended up in 95 stores opening,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.680
 and it was just a disaster really,

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.120
 and Germany didn't really get along

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.280
 with Walmart very well.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.240
 And one of the main reasons was these golden Walmart rules

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.600
 that they have in America, and they are,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.960
 if a customer comes within 10 feet of view,

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.240
 you have to smile sweetly and offer help.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.440
 And this is known as the 10 foot rule.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.960
 And other things like, if a shopper made a complaint,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.600
 it needs to be dealt with by sundown.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.120
 That's called the sundown rule.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.240
 And customers' bags have to be packed at checkout.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.160
 And it turned out they did this in Germany,

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.880
 and they did various studies, researchers looked

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.440
 at how it was playing, and it was playing badly.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.120
 So smiling was interpreted as flirting or creepy.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.640
 And the head of the Walmart trade union said in Germany,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.960
 just said, "German's don't behave that way.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.360
 We don't do this smiling."

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.520
 And then the biggest German research institute said,

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.960
 "In Germany, if people try putting stuff in a bag for you,

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.840
 the customer will just think,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840
 "Hey, I just paid for that.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.680
 That's mine.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.160
 What are you doing putting in a bag?"

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.160
 So it didn't work.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.000
 And it was just very interesting.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.960
 So they had to cancel the policy,

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.520
 just because it's very different customer service

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.520
 in America to outside of America, turned out.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.360
 It was amazing.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.240
 I don't think Germany is being unsmily, though.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.720
 I think it's that America is very smiley.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.560
 Yeah.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.640
 But the 10-foot rule thing, does that apply

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:26.560
 even if there's a shelf in between you and the customer?

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.880
 Ah, yeah.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.760
 Yeah, you have to run all the way around.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.200
 Yeah, and so Walmart's not in Germany anymore, is it?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.720
 No.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.920
 But they all closed down.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.760
 I read one other thing that they thought

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.120
 maybe was one reason why it didn't work.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.880
 And that is because Walmart employees

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.280
 are required every morning to stand in formation

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:49.040
 and chant "Wall-Mart," and "Wall-Mart," and they thought

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.280
 maybe the Germans didn't really like standing in a row

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.560
 chanting things for obvious reasons.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.320
 They also-- they would always make them do the charm,

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.480
 which is like, "Give me a W. Give me an A."

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.200
 And apparently, lots of staff used to just hide

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.880
 in the toilets for that part, as I think a lot of us would,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.680
 if you were forced to do that every day.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.840
 And also, they had to chant every morning at the morning

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.520
 meeting at the end of every meeting.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.520
 The boss would say, "Who is number one?"

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.040
 And all the staff would have to chant.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.960
 The customer, of course.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.720
 So I think staff spent a lot of time in the bathrooms.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.080
 Magic and a work and just chanting, no such thing as a fish.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.920
 No such thing as a fish.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.360
 Well, if you turned up on time a bit more often, you'd see.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:39.280
 In fact, that goes for all three of you, may I say.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.040
 So in some countries, I read the New York Times

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.040
 said that they've had trouble in various places.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.160
 In Korea, apparently, they ran into trouble

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.000
 because they had taller racks than those of local rivals.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.160
 And so it was just a bit harder to reach this stuff,

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.200
 and customers would have to get on ladders.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.960
 So I was like, oh, maybe the average height

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.200
 in Korea is a bit shorter.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:21:59.960
 I looked it up.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.680
 Koreans are exactly the same average height as British people.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.160
 So just apparently, they slightly overshot

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.920
 the shelf height in Walmart.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.240
 But Walmart's ladder sales went hugely through the roof.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.560
 It is like a cult, though.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.280
 I was reading a blog by a guy called--

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.800
 Sorry, Andy, a blog is where people just put thoughts

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.760
 and stuff, yeah.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.840
 I was reading a blog by an ex-wormart employee

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.520
 who was saying that they get really obsessed with box cutters.

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.040
 So they get given a box cutter when

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.800
 they join as a member of staff.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:30.480
 This is in America.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.640
 And he said, staff go a heapship for these box cutters.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.560
 And every staff meetings, they would

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.800
 have Sam Walton trivia contest.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.320
 Now, Sam Walton is the guy who founded Walmart.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.280
 I don't know how much trivia there is about Sam Walton,

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.600
 but apparently enough to have a trivia quiz on him,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.800
 every staff meeting.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.040
 And where the answer is always, Sam Walton.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:50.640
 Yeah.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.440
 Is Sam Walton the best person ever?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.560
 Yes, correct.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.560
 Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.680
 And then the winner of that quiz, who locked onto that,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.120
 would get a slightly petter box cutter.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.240
 And then this member of staff said they

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.400
 used to taunt the other staff with their slightly better box

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.200
 cutters.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.280
 But that's quite aggressive.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.280
 Yeah, with a knife.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.800
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.880
 Oh, my, my, my, my.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.240
 So I was looking at, like, smiling around the world,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.320
 happiness with different countries.

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.840
 You always get these things where all the countries are

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:25.640
 ordered by how happy they are, don't you?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:26.960
 And usually the same people in, like,

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.680
 customary or something.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.200
 But Denmark has won it for the last few years.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.800
 And this year, they were beaten by Norway

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.880
 into second place.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.360
 But actually, the guy in charge of happiness in Denmark

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.720
 said he was, he was very happy for them.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.840
 [LAUGHTER]

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.200
 A lying bastard.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.680
 Said we don't have a monopoly on happiness.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.840
 Wow.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.000
 That's, I mean, but that's the ultimate happy sentence

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.800
 to lose the happiness competition.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.560
 That's almost, we're going to have to take the prize off you.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.440
 That guy just went uber happy.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.160
 That's insane.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.120
 Yeah, and that's obviously why he did it, the cynical bastard.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.440
 He said, he said that.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.000
 And then he went, are we back at the top spot?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.920
 Yeah, great.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.560
 And when McDonald's opened in Russia, in fact,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.880
 where, you know, the service industry

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.920
 has slightly different cultural norms,

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.480
 staff would talk how to smile.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.800
 The Russian staff would talk how to smile,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800
 because it's not a particularly normal thing.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.440
 And actually, there was a study that was done

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.040
 looking at how different countries view smiling.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.160
 And in Russia, most people view someone who

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.960
 smiles a lot as quite stupid, whereas in America,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.600
 and actually in Britain, we view them as a bit more intelligent,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.440
 in fact, if someone smiles at you and they engage with you.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.480
 It all depends, I would say, on context.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:49.320
 If someone's smiling at you on the bus, and they won't stop.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.040
 It is true, though, actually, in Russia,

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.920
 because my wife's Russian, so I go to Russia occasionally,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.560
 and they just don't smitling photographs.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.360
 They do a bit now, but in the olden days,

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.440
 they really wouldn't smile in photographs.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.680
 And there was very much frowned upon.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.760
 [LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.000
 Oh, I'm sorry.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.080
 I almost bottled out of that joke, I'm with her.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.800
 And I thought there's no word to go with it.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.600
 But it is actually true.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.120
 Yeah.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:18.880
 If you see old pictures of Russians even from the '80s and '90s,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.040
 they're just very--

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.040
 Yeah.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.560
 Americans used to be really serious.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.040
 They used to have a reputation of being serious

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.520
 until the mid-19th century.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.600
 Any.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.480
 Well, didn't-- so I was just thinking of the very old photos

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.160
 that used to get taken when nobody's smiling.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.480
 And you often read that in the reason

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.840
 that no one's smiling is because they--

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.080
 that just was the thing.

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.320
 You just don't smile.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.560
 I didn't realize it's because of the long exposure of the photo.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.000
 So it takes so long for the photo to be taken.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.240
 And you don't know exactly what point it's going to be.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.120
 You just had to keep a normal face.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.960
 I mean, not in the 1980s.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.600
 We had a camera technology had come quite long.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:53.320
 No, no, no.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.400
 I mean, the super-old school--

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.160
 we're talking like, I guess, the BC.

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.120
 Before cameras.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.120
 Yeah.

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:05.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.720
 But so because, yeah, the exposure was too long.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:11.040
 So to hold a smile, to hold the cheese,

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:14.080
 it would be so long that you would just look pained.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.120
 And it would be, yeah.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.600
 I have read a debunk of that, actually, just for the record,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.360
 that maybe the exposure wasn't quite as long as we thought.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.880
 Maybe it was only about 30 seconds

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.600
 and anyone could hold a smile for 30 seconds.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.440
 But I don't know.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.120
 No, but they were just getting used to smiles back then.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.920
 It would have felt a lot longer.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.760
 Yeah.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.560
 They could have had a happiness hat.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.680
 This was something in the news a few years ago.

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.600
 And the happiness of that was a hat, obviously.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.200
 And it was made of metal.

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.000
 And it had these kind of metal bits coming down the side.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.840
 And then it had a metal spike.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.880
 And whenever it sensed that you were frowning,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.720
 it would stab you in the head with a spike.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.240
 I remind you to smile.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.880
 Oh, god.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.400
 Really?

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:49.920
 Sorry.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.440
 Which shopping chain was this?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.080
 Where was this?

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.680
 It was just one guy who invented it.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.000
 All right.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.480
 But he hit the news.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.680
 Yeah.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.600
 Wow.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.840
 Should we move on to our final fact?

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.360
 Yeah, we should.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.000
 OK, it is time for our final fact of the show.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.360
 And that is my fact.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.200
 My fact this week is that it is really easy

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:17.200
 to beat chimpanzees at the game Rock Paper Scissors.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.720
 Yeah, they're shit at it.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.760
 Chimpanzees have recently been taught to play.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.720
 Stone Paper Scissors, Rock Paper Scissors,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.880
 Rush Ambo, whatever you call the game.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.160
 And they actually-- the flip side is,

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.560
 they actually know how to play Stone Paper Scissors.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.600
 It's amazing.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.440
 And they can learn it to the level of what

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.200
 a four-year-old would learn it.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.680
 So you could actually, at the moment,

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.200
 they've only been playing with computer simulation.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.600
 So playing against a computer or an iPad.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.080
 But if you were to play them, you could actually

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.840
 have a genuine game with the movements of Rock Paper Scissors

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.800
 and beat them.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.160
 The reason you can beat them is they're really bad at learning

00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.000
 from their mistakes.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.360
 So whereas four-year-olds will make a mistake

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.240
 and go, I need to adjust.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.000
 chimpanzees will be like, I'll use paper again.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.840
 And then afterwards, when they're beating again,

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:07.160
 they'll be like, I'll go for paper this time.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:09.120
 And then when you beat them again, he's

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.760
 not going to see what's coming next.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.360
 Good old trusty paper.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.160
 And then--

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.200
 If I was playing against them, I might think

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.680
 they're not going to be stupid enough to go for paper again.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.840
 That's why I would probably lose.

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.480
 I still saw about the matter she lost.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.880
 Actually, they're a lot better than you'd think, then.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.160
 It's interesting, because it took them--

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.640
 the chimpanzees who learned it-- I think on seven chimpanzees

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.840
 and five of them managed to master it.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.800
 It did take them 100 days to learn it.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.680
 So it's a very, very long time for them to learn.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.520
 Yeah, there it is.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:43.160
 It's a simple game.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.440
 I mean, I don't want to brag.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.120
 I got it in about 30 days, anyway.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.960
 But the really tricky thing that the chimpanzees didn't get

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.880
 was the circular nature of it.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.240
 So they understood rock beat scissors.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.320
 And then they understood, OK, scissors beat paper.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.280
 But they found it hard to get the head around paper

00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.480
 then beats rock.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.000
 Really?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.400
 That makes it even more weird that they

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.880
 went for paper every time.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.080
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.600
 But actually, I'm with them.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.000
 Why does paper beat rock?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.080
 I mean, I know it covers it.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080
 You're rapping.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:11.680
 You're rapping.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:13.720
 But that's not beaten, is it?

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:18.160
 I mean, scissors is actually demolishing the paper, isn't it?

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.400
 And the rock is demolishing the scissors.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.280
 Yeah, but if you hide a rock in some paper,

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.040
 you can smuggle it into a recycling bin.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.240
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.040
 Got it.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.280
 Yeah.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.320
 In Japan, it's a tiger village chief

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.880
 and the village chief's mother, right?

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.560
 And that's that sort of thing.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.720
 And so the village chief's mother kills the village chief,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.160
 because she's angry with him.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.640
 The village chief kills the tiger,

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.040
 and the tiger kills the village chief's mother.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.800
 Do you know the Indonesian version?

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.640
 No.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.040
 And human elephant.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.320
 So the human tramples the elephant--

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.480
 [LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.720
 There's tiny elephants, they have an Indonesian.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.960
 I think I got confused between ant and elephant and--

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.160
 and it focks me.

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.960
 Sorry.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.560
 The human tramples the ant.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.720
 The human tramples the ant.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.400
 Then the elephant squashes the human.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.040
 But then the ant beats the elephant by--

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.880
 The tramples it.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.360
 Yeah.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.680
 Is that the ant gets into the elephant's ear,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.960
 and it tickles it?

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.680
 Ah.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.200
 Really?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.920
 I read that the ant crawls up the elephant's trunk

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.280
 and eats its brain.

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.320
 Maybe-- oh, sorry, I have a sick--

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.400
 Oh, I had parental guide long on.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.880
 [LAUGHTER]

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.720
 It's-- so I am very confused by the chimp fight.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.080
 I didn't realize they were less good than us,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.720
 because there's no such thing as being good at rock paper

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.400
 scissors.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.880
 There is no strategy.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.080
 You can't love for me on mistakes,

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.520
 because we all basically make the same mistakes,

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.840
 and we can't really predict each other.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.680
 Particularly.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.600
 I mean, if you're really a pro, if you may be--

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.760
 If you've obviously not been on the rock paper scissors website,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.880
 they have a lot of tactics on that.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:03.840
 One thing is if your opponent pays scissors in the first go,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.920
 you can tell by how wide the scissors

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.800
 is what they're going to do in the next go.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.520
 No, you can't.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.880
 Well, no, you can't.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.600
 I mean, they say you can.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.960
 They have another-- apparently, this is a trendy strategy.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.360
 It's the exclusion strategy.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.840
 OK, so you never play say rock, and you keep doing different ones.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.600
 You keep doing paper or scissors, and your opponent just

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:28.320
 gets obsessed by the fact that you've never played rock,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.840
 and it just fucks with their mind.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.640
 That's great.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.480
 It's a good idea, right?

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.040
 And that's the trendy strategy.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.200
 That's the trendy one.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.880
 Now, that's how to be cool as someone who

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.040
 subscribes to rockpapersizzas.com.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.080
 You don't actually have to subscribe to a website.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.840
 You can just-- you can just go there and then go away.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.440
 Some of them you do, like, hamsterpawn.com.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.520
 Children are very hard to play at rockpapersizzas.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.280
 I mean, they're very good at playing it,

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.640
 because their choices are genuinely random.

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.120
 Yeah.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.640
 They haven't yet mastered the gambits that James is discussing,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.800
 so they're much likely just to go with whatever.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.040
 And that makes them quite hard to beat.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.800
 Right.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.440
 Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.840
 You don't want to overthink it.

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.120
 Hey, I found a cool thing about chimpanzees.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.640
 Chimpanzees can recognize each other by face, like we do.

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.360
 But if they're just walking along and a chimpanzee's

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.720
 facing the other way, and the butt is showing,

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.640
 they'll see the butt and be like, Greg, they

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.400
 have an understanding of Bums that they can just--

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.640
 if you put like a lineup of Bums in front of them,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.560
 they'd be like Mark Sonia, Alice, John.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:43.080
 Is that what chimp lineups are?

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.200
 Is it like any of these people, the people who pick

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.320
 pocketed you the other day, Mrs. Chimp?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.680
 And then she's like that bum there, yeah.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.400
 Yeah, it's good, because once you've robbed someone,

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.280
 you run away, don't you?

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.360
 So you're likely to see the bum.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.040
 Perfect.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:55.800
 Yes.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.720
 Exactly.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:01.080
 Oh, there was-- I heard an amazing burl-growry.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.680
 Burl-- burl-growry.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.320
 Rubbery?

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.160
 Rubbery, right?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.120
 We did the audiobook the other day for the book that we've done.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.800
 And it took forever for me to say basic words like that.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:18.000
 The best one was when you misread February as January.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.280
 It was truly bizarre.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.480
 Yeah, so there was this fact that we found the other day,

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.000
 which is that a burglar is always most likely

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.840
 going to knock on your door before they burgle you.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.800
 Isn't that weird?

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.160
 Is that so they can check if someone's in?

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.040
 Yeah, basically.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:34.560
 Yeah, that makes sense.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.240
 If you're going to get robbed, they're just always

00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.560
 going to knock for us, like in a polite fashion,

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.880
 as opposed to just breaking a window or whatever.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.800
 Yeah, I don't think it's our politeness that they're doing it,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.320
 but yeah.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.040
 [LAUGHTER]

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.880
 So have you read the thing about chimps

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.400
 that they, according to the New York Times,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.640
 have the ability to cook if only someone would give them

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.320
 an oven?

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.960
 This is what scientists--

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.800
 I'm like that.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.680
 This is something the scientists have just concluded.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:04.200
 And they did this in a study where the researcher in Volvo

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.880
 said, we invented a magic cooking device

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.560
 to test it on the chimps.

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.560
 As they explained it, it's two plastic bowls.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.800
 And the chimps are raw potato in one of the plastic bowls.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.560
 And then in the other one, there's a cooked potato,

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.000
 and you maneuver the bowls to make the chimps think

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.240
 that his raw potato has been cooked.

00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:25.640
 Why this guy didn't just use the already existing oven

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.400
 that we have, I don't know.

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:30.160
 But it turns out that chimps do prefer--

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.680
 if you give them a bit of raw potato,

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.000
 they prefer to put it in the plastic bowl that will then

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
 magically cook the potato and then to eat the cooked potato.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.560
 Then just to eat it raw.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.840
 And so that kind of shows that chimps have self-control.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.360
 They're willing to postpone the potato to make it taste nicer.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.160
 And also, according to the scientists who did the experiment,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.000
 it said, it shows they have the causal understanding

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.320
 to make the leap to cooking, which I would argue,

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.480
 believing that you're putting a raw potato into a plastic bowl

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:59.280
 and then leaving it for 10 seconds before getting a cooked one,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.240
 is not having the causal understanding.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.000
 Yeah, that's true.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.760
 I didn't know they preferred cooked food.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.520
 Yeah, neither did I.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.040
 But I don't know how my microwave works.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.600
 If you told me that some scientists just

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.400
 replace it with a cooked risotto.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.360
 I'll buy it.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.480
 OK, should we wrap up?

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.760
 OK, that is all our facts.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.840
 Thank you so much for listening.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.680

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.200
 I'm on that Shri Beland.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.840
 You Andy or--

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.280
 Excuse me.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.600
 Me, Andy.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.720
 Chuckle Brothers.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.840
 I can't see what that was, Bruce Porsoy.

00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:45.760
 Um, it's an anti-clomax now, but Andrew Hunter M.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.760
 James?

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.760
 It's James Harkin.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.840
 And Chazinski.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.840

 You can also buy our new book, The Book of the Year.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.760
 It's out November 2nd, and we're about to give one away, actually,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.080
 to one of the members of the audience who sent us a fact.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.160
 James, you've got the facts.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:09.680
 I have.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.880
 It is from Scott Robinson.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.440
 And the fact is that cleaning your teeth

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.720
 is the only time you get to clean your skeleton.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.080
 That's so cool.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:20.280
 So creepy.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.560
 So creepy.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.160
 Is that true?

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160
 That's our skeleton?

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160
 Not quite true, you just said.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.720
 Whoa, we've not had this on the show before.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.240
 Who shouted fight?

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:39.440
 I think what we can do is a game of rock paper scissors.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.880
 Oh, yes, yes.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.760
 So this guy here, who, the quibbler, I'm going to call you.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.240
 If you show in front of your chest what you want to do for rock paper scissors,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.080
 and then we'll get Scott to shout out what he wants to do,

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.640
 and we'll see if there's a winner.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:55.440
 Oh, wow.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.240
 This is so exciting.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.200
 So wait, I can't see it.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.520
 Yeah, I can see it.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.520
 I can see it.

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.720
 OK, Scott shout out.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.520
 What have you got?

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.640
 His Scott's the winner.

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.680
 Yeah, it was me.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:12.640
 Scott, come and grab a book from us.

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.840
 We'll be here.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.240
 You went for paper.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.160
 Let's do it again.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.120
 He'll never do paper again.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.000
 Oh, that.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.520
