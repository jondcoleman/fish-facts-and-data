00:00:00,00:00:02,(slow rock music)
00:00:02,00:00:05,(speaking in foreign language)
00:00:05,00:00:07,(upbeat music)
00:00:07,00:00:10,(upbeat music)
00:00:10,00:00:18,"- Hello, and welcome to another episode"
00:00:18,00:00:21,"of ""No Such Thing as a Fish"" a weekly podcast"
00:00:21,00:00:24,this week coming to you from the Stan Comedy Club
00:00:24,00:00:25,in Newcastle.
00:00:25,00:00:28,(audience cheering)
00:00:28,00:00:31,(audience cheering)
00:00:31,00:00:38,- My name is Dan Schreiber.
00:00:38,00:00:41,"I am sitting here with Anna Chazinski,"
00:00:41,00:00:43,"Andrew Hunter Murray, and James Harkin."
00:00:43,00:00:46,"And once again, we have gathered around the microphones"
00:00:46,00:00:49,"with our four favorite facts from the last seven days,"
00:00:49,00:00:51,and no particular order.
00:00:51,00:00:54,"Here we go, starting with you, Andy."
00:00:54,00:00:56,- My fact this week is that Britain exports
00:00:56,00:01:01,"over 50,000 boomerangs every year to Australia."
00:01:01,00:01:04,(audience laughing)
00:01:04,00:01:06,"- And then imports them again, presumably."
00:01:06,00:01:09,(audience laughing)
00:01:09,00:01:12,"- Yeah, this is just something that happens."
00:01:12,00:01:16,"This is, who knew that the post-Brexit Britain"
00:01:16,00:01:19,"is gonna be boomerangs to Australia,"
00:01:19,00:01:21,"Colton, Newcastle. - Is this a recent thing?"
00:01:21,00:01:23,"- Oh, by the way, the phrase Colton, Newcastle,"
00:01:23,00:01:25,is that well known here?
00:01:25,00:01:25,- Yeah.
00:01:25,00:01:27,"- Yeah, 'cause we tried it on some people in London,"
00:01:27,00:01:28,"like young people, and they'd never heard of it."
00:01:28,00:01:29,- Yeah. - That's true.
00:01:29,00:01:31,"- Actually, anyone under the age of about 25"
00:01:31,00:01:33,"in London had heard of it, maybe 30 even."
00:01:33,00:01:36,"But actually, they import Colt and Newcastle, don't they?"
00:01:36,00:01:37,"Oh, don't you?"
00:01:37,00:01:40,"Well, do you?"
00:01:40,00:01:41,(audience laughing)
00:01:41,00:01:42,"Yes, you do."
00:01:42,00:01:43,- Great.
00:01:43,00:01:44,(audience laughing)
00:01:44,00:01:49,"- In 2013, Newcastle imported 4.9 million tons"
00:01:49,00:01:52,"of Colt, the second most in the UK"
00:01:52,00:01:53,after somewhere in Scotland.
00:01:53,00:01:54,- Wow. - No way.
00:01:54,00:01:56,- What are they doing with it?
00:01:56,00:01:58,(audience laughing)
00:01:58,00:01:59,- Do you all get some?
00:01:59,00:02:00,Is that--
00:02:00,00:02:03,"- I think, yeah, then it's sent around the country"
00:02:03,00:02:05,for people to burn them.
00:02:05,00:02:07,- That's what you do with Colt.
00:02:07,00:02:09,"- No, I know what you do with Colt."
00:02:09,00:02:11,I just didn't know what Newcastle was doing with Colt.
00:02:11,00:02:12,- What special thing?
00:02:12,00:02:14,Do you think Newcastle does with Colt?
00:02:14,00:02:16,"Well, apparently, they just send it back out again."
00:02:16,00:02:17,(audience laughing)
00:02:17,00:02:19,- It's like the boomerangs.
00:02:19,00:02:20,"- The thing is, Dad, right?"
00:02:20,00:02:23,"The UK is an island, and when we bring stuff in,"
00:02:23,00:02:24,"it has to go into a pot, and Newcastle's"
00:02:24,00:02:25,one of the best pots we have.
00:02:25,00:02:26,- Now I get it.
00:02:26,00:02:30,I thought you meant like Manchester was sending Colt.
00:02:30,00:02:32,"- I thought Newport was just collecting Colt,"
00:02:32,00:02:34,and then when now you can have it back.
00:02:34,00:02:36,- Newport is somewhere else.
00:02:36,00:02:39,(audience laughing)
00:02:39,00:02:47,"- Wait, so what's happened?"
00:02:47,00:02:48,- Oh my God.
00:02:48,00:02:48,- Can we recap?
00:02:48,00:02:50,What's--
00:02:50,00:02:52,"- Don't worry, I think you're trying to learn enough toes."
00:02:52,00:02:53,"It's a good thing James just said,"
00:02:53,00:02:55,"""They've got the best pot, kiss us."""
00:02:55,00:02:57,(audience laughing)
00:02:57,00:02:59,So we've won a few people over with that.
00:02:59,00:03:01,"- Anyway, my fact this week is that Britain exports"
00:03:01,00:03:04,"over 50,000 boomerangs a year to Australia."
00:03:04,00:03:06,"- I looked at these boomerangs,"
00:03:06,00:03:08,and they don't look very boomerang-like.
00:03:08,00:03:12,"- Well, wait till they hit you in the back of the head, James."
00:03:12,00:03:13,"- No, well, they're toy boomerangs."
00:03:13,00:03:16,"- Yeah, they got three sticky outfits, I think."
00:03:16,00:03:17,- That's true.
00:03:17,00:03:18,- Are you sure?
00:03:18,00:03:19,"That's like fidget spinners, right?"
00:03:19,00:03:20,"- Yeah, they look like fidget spinners."
00:03:20,00:03:21,- Yeah.
00:03:21,00:03:22,- Big ones.
00:03:22,00:03:24,- But they're called sports boomerangs or something.
00:03:24,00:03:24,- Yeah.
00:03:24,00:03:25,- Yeah.
00:03:25,00:03:27,- And they basically fly for miles and they do come back.
00:03:27,00:03:27,- Yeah.
00:03:27,00:03:30,- And the really cool thing is the guy who runs the company
00:03:30,00:03:33,"which sells them, his name is David Strang, okay?"
00:03:33,00:03:36,"And he moved from Scotland to Australia at the age of eight,"
00:03:36,00:03:39,"and then at the age of 20, he came back."
00:03:39,00:03:42,(audience laughing)
00:03:42,00:03:47,"- Can I just ask, just a bug says,"
00:03:47,00:03:50,"""Did we all just exclusively look for facts"
00:03:50,00:03:52,"""where something went away and came back?"""
00:03:52,00:03:54,(audience laughing)
00:03:54,00:03:55,"- So it's just him, isn't it?"
00:03:55,00:03:57,"It's just this one guy, this one company"
00:03:57,00:03:59,that's making them an expert in them.
00:03:59,00:04:00,Is that right?
00:04:00,00:04:00,"- That's right, yeah."
00:04:00,00:04:02,"- So you know the song, my boomerang won't come back?"
00:04:02,00:04:03,- Yeah.
00:04:03,00:04:04,- My boomerang.
00:04:04,00:04:05,"- I tell you, no."
00:04:05,00:04:06,(audience laughing)
00:04:06,00:04:08,"- It's a song, comedy song."
00:04:08,00:04:08,It's a comedy song.
00:04:08,00:04:09,- It's a comedy song.
00:04:09,00:04:12,"- Oh yeah, 50s, my boomerang won't come back."
00:04:12,00:04:14,"Everyone else knows it, right?"
00:04:14,00:04:15,- You guys are?
00:04:15,00:04:17,- It's really famous song.
00:04:17,00:04:18,"- Like six people are saying, yeah."
00:04:18,00:04:21,"How many, how many people don't know it?"
00:04:21,00:04:22,(audience cheering)
00:04:22,00:04:24,"I mean, that's huge."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"- That's, yeah."
00:04:25,00:04:28,"- All right, minority, do you know who produced that song?"
00:04:28,00:04:31,"A certain George Martin, who went on"
00:04:31,00:04:34,to produce more famous songs by The Beatles.
00:04:34,00:04:36,"So The Beatles, you've been the guy"
00:04:36,00:04:37,who wrote Game of Thrones.
00:04:37,00:04:41,(audience laughing)
00:04:41,00:04:43,"I did not, that was his big break."
00:04:43,00:04:44,"My boomerang won't come back,"
00:04:44,00:04:46,"and then she went on to make The Beatles, yeah."
00:04:46,00:04:47,"- In the course of researching this,"
00:04:47,00:04:48,I actually listened to that song on repeat
00:04:48,00:04:50,for about two days now.
00:04:50,00:04:51,- Did you?
00:04:51,00:04:52,"- Yeah, it's very good."
00:04:52,00:04:53,- He is good.
00:04:53,00:04:54,"- By these days, it's a bit culturally insensitive."
00:04:54,00:04:56,"So, I'm not gonna praise it."
00:04:56,00:05:00,(audience laughing)
00:05:00,00:05:03,- Do you know who else owned boomerangs?
00:05:03,00:05:05,- Tutankamoon.
00:05:05,00:05:08,"- Oh, yes, it's full of boomerangs."
00:05:08,00:05:08,- No.
00:05:08,00:05:09,- It was okay.
00:05:09,00:05:11,- It was full of boomerangs.
00:05:11,00:05:11,(audience laughing)
00:05:11,00:05:13,"- If we get through these boomerangs,"
00:05:13,00:05:14,you might find something.
00:05:14,00:05:16,(audience laughing)
00:05:16,00:05:18,- Tutankamoon back as soon as you're done.
00:05:18,00:05:20,- Oh my God.
00:05:20,00:05:21,- No.
00:05:21,00:05:22,"All right, I'm sorry."
00:05:22,00:05:23,(audience laughing)
00:05:23,00:05:25,"- So, do you know what is the world record"
00:05:25,00:05:28,longest time a boomerang has been in the air?
00:05:28,00:05:29,- No.
00:05:29,00:05:31,- Do you want to have a guess in minutes?
00:05:31,00:05:32,- Minutes.
00:05:32,00:05:35,- Three minutes.
00:05:35,00:05:37,- Thirty-seven minutes.
00:05:37,00:05:38,- Thirty-seven minutes.
00:05:38,00:05:39,(audience laughing)
00:05:39,00:05:41,- What do you think a bird flew off with it?
00:05:41,00:05:43,(audience laughing)
00:05:43,00:05:48,"- Well, the answer is 1,440 minutes and nine seconds."
00:05:48,00:05:50,- Come on.
00:05:50,00:05:51,(audience laughing)
00:05:51,00:05:52,"- Don't, don't."
00:05:52,00:05:54,"- For less than a house at home,"
00:05:54,00:05:55,Dan's whacking his finger at me.
00:05:55,00:05:57,"Like, and I told you so, hey."
00:05:57,00:05:58,- Can you explain to me?
00:05:58,00:06:01,"- I can, and you're not gonna like it."
00:06:01,00:06:02,(audience laughing)
00:06:02,00:06:03,"- It's space, right?"
00:06:03,00:06:05,"- It's a guy called Jay Parrott,"
00:06:05,00:06:08,"and he was at the South Pole, and he threw it,"
00:06:08,00:06:10,so it went through all of the different time zones.
00:06:10,00:06:12,"So, technically, it went around 24 hours."
00:06:12,00:06:15,"- Ah, that's awesome."
00:06:15,00:06:17,- I'm not the only one who didn't like it.
00:06:17,00:06:19,(audience laughing)
00:06:19,00:06:23,"- I actually have the world, the Guinness World Record,"
00:06:23,00:06:25,for the longest distance of--
00:06:25,00:06:26,- You have a congratulations.
00:06:26,00:06:28,"- No, sorry. - No, sorry."
00:06:28,00:06:29,- Yeah.
00:06:29,00:06:30,(audience cheering)
00:06:30,00:06:31,- I can't.
00:06:31,00:06:32,- I can't.
00:06:32,00:06:36,- You hide your talent under a bottle then.
00:06:36,00:06:37,(audience laughing)
00:06:37,00:06:38,Imagine if that was true.
00:06:38,00:06:41,This was the first time we'd ever heard of it.
00:06:41,00:06:43,- I like to brag.
00:06:43,00:06:46,"- Yeah, no, 2005, the Guinness World Record"
00:06:46,00:06:48,"was set for the longest throw of a boomerang,"
00:06:48,00:06:51,and do you wanna have a guess of how far that was?
00:06:51,00:06:54,"- Oh, 80,000 miles."
00:06:54,00:06:57,(audience laughing)
00:06:57,00:06:59,"- If you could take my question seriously, man."
00:06:59,00:07:01,(audience laughing)
00:07:01,00:07:02,"- James, do you wanna have a guess?"
00:07:02,00:07:07,"- Well, let's say I think it would be about 300, 400 yards."
00:07:07,00:07:09,"- I've got it written down here, sir, for real."
00:07:09,00:07:10,"- Okay, great."
00:07:10,00:07:11,(audience laughing)
00:07:11,00:07:13,"- So why don't you have a guess anyway, Anna?"
00:07:13,00:07:14,- Is it?
00:07:14,00:07:18,"- I only have 428, 7 meters."
00:07:18,00:07:19,(audience laughing)
00:07:19,00:07:22,"- Well, I've got it in feet, so I don't know what that is."
00:07:22,00:07:25,(audience laughing)
00:07:25,00:07:27,"- So yeah, you might be right."
00:07:27,00:07:29,"- Tell me in feet, and I'll convert it for you."
00:07:29,00:07:30,"- 1,401, put it on."
00:07:30,00:07:32,- 427 meters.
00:07:32,00:07:35,(audience laughing)
00:07:35,00:07:36,- So Anna was closest.
00:07:36,00:07:39,(audience laughing)
00:07:39,00:07:42,"- So this was set in Queensland, in Australia,"
00:07:42,00:07:46,and it was set by a guy called Mr. Shumy.
00:07:46,00:07:50,"And Mr. Shumy, when he was asked about it, he said,"
00:07:50,00:07:53,"it wasn't really a boomerang throw,"
00:07:53,00:07:57,"admitted Shumy, as it didn't come back."
00:07:57,00:07:58,(audience laughing)
00:07:58,00:08:00,"But weirdly, the Guinness World Records thought"
00:08:00,00:08:01,we'll just accept it.
00:08:01,00:08:03,- 'Cause the record should be zero meters.
00:08:03,00:08:05,"- Exactly, exactly, yeah."
00:08:05,00:08:07,"- Well, the record for a returning one,"
00:08:07,00:08:09,"which I think is the one that should really stand,"
00:08:09,00:08:13,"is a Swiss guy actually, who threw it 238 meters out,"
00:08:13,00:08:17,"and then 238 meters back, which is further altogether"
00:08:17,00:08:20,"than Mr. Shumy, isn't it?"
00:08:20,00:08:23,"- Again, you've thrown numbers that I don't understand."
00:08:23,00:08:25,(audience laughing)
00:08:25,00:08:26,- It is.
00:08:26,00:08:29,(audience laughing)
00:08:29,00:08:35,- We need to move on to our second fact.
00:08:35,00:08:38,"Okay, so it is time for fact number two, and that is James."
00:08:38,00:08:41,"- Okay, my fact this week is that the Catalan region"
00:08:41,00:08:46,does regular checks of websites that end with .cat
00:08:46,00:08:50,to check that they're about Catalonia and not about cats.
00:08:50,00:08:53,(audience laughing)
00:08:53,00:09:00,- Are they the only two options?
00:09:00,00:09:02,"- Well, no, but it seems, basically,"
00:09:02,00:09:04,"they want all of the websites that are .cat,"
00:09:04,00:09:07,'cause that's the Catalan domain name.
00:09:07,00:09:09,"They want them to all be about Catalonia,"
00:09:09,00:09:12,but actually everyone else wants to put cats on the internet.
00:09:12,00:09:14,"And when you put cats on the internet,"
00:09:14,00:09:17,"what you're gonna do, you're gonna put .cat, right?"
00:09:17,00:09:18,And so people do it all the time.
00:09:18,00:09:22,"And every now and then, they have to do an audit,"
00:09:22,00:09:25,"and they give people six months to shut the down their website,"
00:09:25,00:09:29,or add a translation tool to translate their website
00:09:29,00:09:30,into Catalan.
00:09:31,00:09:35,"So there is a website called, is it Nian on Nian?"
00:09:35,00:09:36,Does anyone know Nian?
00:09:36,00:09:37,"So it's Nian, you'll all know about it."
00:09:37,00:09:40,"It's like a little cartoon cat that's got like a rainbow on it,"
00:09:40,00:09:43,and it's a stupid song that happens.
00:09:43,00:09:47,"And that was Nian.cat, and they were told they had to take it down"
00:09:47,00:09:49,until they put a translation tool.
00:09:49,00:09:52,And so now you can watch Nian cat in Catalan.
00:09:52,00:09:54,- Wow.
00:09:54,00:09:55,- Thank God.
00:09:55,00:10:01,"Yeah, but it's really for the Catalan people,"
00:10:01,00:10:03,"it's really important, obviously, a lot in the news at the moment,"
00:10:03,00:10:06,but I think they were the first sort of group of people
00:10:06,00:10:09,"rather than the country to have their own top-level internet,"
00:10:09,00:10:10,the main name.
00:10:10,00:10:13,"- Yeah, there were only eight top-level domains were allowed,"
00:10:13,00:10:14,"and then the Catalonia people said,"
00:10:14,00:10:18,"""No, we want a night, we want it to be our own space."""
00:10:18,00:10:21,- And it was because one of the guys who organized it was Catalan.
00:10:21,00:10:22,So that kind of helped.
00:10:22,00:10:23,- It was really?
00:10:23,00:10:26,"- Yeah, he was called Amadou Abriel, E Abriel."
00:10:26,00:10:27,And he was a lion.
00:10:27,00:10:30,And he was kind of part of the top-level internet thing.
00:10:30,00:10:34,"But he was Catalan, so he kind of managed to pull a few strings."
00:10:34,00:10:38,"- They are very active internet users, though, apparently."
00:10:38,00:10:39,"- Cats, yeah."
00:10:39,00:10:40,- The cats.
00:10:40,00:10:44,It's them that are posting all these pictures of themselves.
00:10:44,00:10:45,"The Catalonians too, though."
00:10:45,00:10:49,"So in 2013, Catalan was the eighth most-used language"
00:10:49,00:10:52,"on blogs online, which is kind of extraordinary,"
00:10:52,00:10:55,"given that they're hot like eight million,"
00:10:55,00:10:58,eight to 10 million Catalan speakers.
00:10:58,00:10:59,They love the internet.
00:10:59,00:11:01,- It'll never catch on.
00:11:01,00:11:05,- I think I heard that blogging is massive.
00:11:05,00:11:06,- Yeah.
00:11:06,00:11:07,- I'm sorry.
00:11:07,00:11:09,- Because it is dad.
00:11:09,00:11:10,- Yeah.
00:11:10,00:11:11,- And I have this thing.
00:11:11,00:11:12,It's called Myspace.
00:11:12,00:11:15,- And you go on.
00:11:15,00:11:19,"No, it's because they're obviously they want to be independent"
00:11:19,00:11:20,"from Spain, a lot of people in Catalonia."
00:11:20,00:11:22,"So they blog and they have message boards,"
00:11:22,00:11:24,which are all about Catalonian issues.
00:11:24,00:11:27,"And it's a very sort of adhesive identity, basically."
00:11:27,00:11:28,- Yes.
00:11:28,00:11:30,"- Did you read about the guy, though,"
00:11:30,00:11:34,who has started a cat-based internet thing
00:11:34,00:11:36,that is really cool?
00:11:36,00:11:39,"He started stalking cats around the world,"
00:11:39,00:11:44,and then he started posting up where they live online.
00:11:44,00:11:48,"So what happens is, if you post a picture of your cat on Flickr,"
00:11:48,00:11:51,"or like one of the other ones, Instagram."
00:11:51,00:11:53,(audience laughing)
00:11:53,00:11:54,- Ask Jeeves.
00:11:54,00:11:56,You put a cat on the Jeeves.
00:11:56,00:11:58,- You can put a cat on Ask Jeeves.
00:11:58,00:12:00,"And he'll take the cat, and he'll scrape all the data"
00:12:00,00:12:01,from behind it.
00:12:01,00:12:02,- Oh!
00:12:02,00:12:03,- All the message.
00:12:03,00:12:04,- Who is this pervert?
00:12:04,00:12:06,Why are you telling us about him?
00:12:06,00:12:07,- He's not a pervert.
00:12:07,00:12:09,He's someone who's trying to highlight the security problems
00:12:09,00:12:10,"online with posting your pictures up,"
00:12:10,00:12:12,because you often accidentally geotag yourself
00:12:12,00:12:13,when you put pictures up.
00:12:13,00:12:16,"And so he's created this map of the world,"
00:12:16,00:12:18,and you can see all the cats that live in certain places.
00:12:18,00:12:20,"So if you've ever posted a picture of your cat up,"
00:12:20,00:12:22,"then you can go to where you live,"
00:12:22,00:12:24,and your cat may well be there.
00:12:24,00:12:27,"Or you might go to near where you live and see your cat,"
00:12:27,00:12:29,"and then you'll know that it's cheating on you,"
00:12:29,00:12:32,and someone else has been posting pictures of your cat.
00:12:32,00:12:33,"- Oh, wow."
00:12:33,00:12:34,"- But that's clever, right?"
00:12:34,00:12:36,"So he's not posting pictures of actual people,"
00:12:36,00:12:37,"'cause that would be a bit creepy,"
00:12:37,00:12:39,but he's just posting pictures of their cats.
00:12:39,00:12:41,- Wasn't it the case that one of the greatest hackers
00:12:41,00:12:44,"that the internet has ever seen was caught,"
00:12:44,00:12:47,and they tried to break into his system to work out
00:12:47,00:12:48,"just to get into his computer to see what he'd done,"
00:12:48,00:12:50,"and they're like, ""Oh, he's gonna have the most intense"
00:12:50,00:12:51,"""pass or whatever."""
00:12:51,00:12:53,"And it turned out his password was his cat's name,"
00:12:53,00:12:55,"and one, two, three, four."
00:12:55,00:12:56,(audience laughing)
00:12:56,00:12:57,"- Yeah, that was--"
00:12:57,00:13:00,"Scientists in Japan have studied cats recently,"
00:13:00,00:13:04,"and they found that they do recognize their owner's voices,"
00:13:04,00:13:06,but they then choose to ignore them.
00:13:06,00:13:08,(audience laughing)
00:13:08,00:13:12,So they played the cat a recording of the owner
00:13:12,00:13:13,"shouting the cat's name,"
00:13:13,00:13:15,and then they played another recording of a stranger
00:13:15,00:13:16,shouting the same cat's name.
00:13:16,00:13:19,They found that the cats have a much greater response
00:13:19,00:13:21,"to the owner shouting their name than to a stranger,"
00:13:21,00:13:23,but they still do not get up.
00:13:23,00:13:26,(audience laughing)
00:13:27,00:13:30,"But dogs are catching up online, right?"
00:13:30,00:13:33,"In the last couple of years, I think dogs have become"
00:13:33,00:13:36,"as prevalent online, whereas cats used to be much better,"
00:13:36,00:13:40,and I think the idea is that the age of the smartphone
00:13:40,00:13:42,"has meant that it's more friendly to dogs,"
00:13:42,00:13:45,"because smartphones, I am told, are good at videos,"
00:13:45,00:13:48,and streaming them and dogs are a bit more video-friendly.
00:13:48,00:13:49,"So cats are very image-friendly,"
00:13:49,00:13:52,'cause they are still for 99.9% of the day.
00:13:52,00:13:54,(audience laughing)
00:13:54,00:13:56,"But now we can actually do the video thing,"
00:13:56,00:13:57,"and post that up easily and watch it,"
00:13:57,00:13:58,then dogs work better.
00:13:58,00:14:01,And so now it's about 50/50 in terms of how many
00:14:01,00:14:02,are being posted respectively.
00:14:02,00:14:04,- I did not know that was the reason.
00:14:04,00:14:05,- That's interesting.
00:14:05,00:14:06,- It's a theory.
00:14:06,00:14:07,- I don't know.
00:14:07,00:14:08,- There is that place where you can feed a cat
00:14:08,00:14:10,"that's 4,000 miles away, can't you?"
00:14:10,00:14:11,- Oh yeah.
00:14:11,00:14:12,"- Oh, that's right."
00:14:12,00:14:13,- Yeah.
00:14:13,00:14:16,"- There's a webcam set up for a cat sanctuary in,"
00:14:16,00:14:19,"I wanna say Russia, and you can move a toy remotely,"
00:14:19,00:14:21,"and you have to wait for ages in a queue,"
00:14:21,00:14:25,while other people get to move the toy around remotely.
00:14:25,00:14:26,We did it at the office.
00:14:26,00:14:27,We're not there that day.
00:14:27,00:14:28,"- I was, yeah."
00:14:28,00:14:28,"- Yeah, that was great."
00:14:28,00:14:30,"- Of course, a very long after this, yeah."
00:14:30,00:14:31,(audience laughing)
00:14:31,00:14:35,So I was looking into all these dot something sites.
00:14:35,00:14:38,"As we say, like, dot cat things get misappropriated"
00:14:38,00:14:41,for the country that they're meant to represent.
00:14:41,00:14:46,"So obviously, dot XXX is for porn or websites,"
00:14:46,00:14:48,"and that one is not a country, obviously."
00:14:48,00:14:53,"Or if it is, ""I wanna go there sometime."""
00:14:53,00:14:54,"I don't know, Maradavikid."
00:14:54,00:14:56,(audience laughing)
00:14:56,00:14:59,"But, dot XXX is one that is allowed,"
00:14:59,00:15:01,because what they wanna do is try and separate the porn
00:15:01,00:15:03,so that you can actually identify it.
00:15:03,00:15:04,"The problem is no one's using it,"
00:15:04,00:15:06,because then people can say you're definitely using porn
00:15:06,00:15:08,as opposed to a dot com website.
00:15:08,00:15:09,"- You could just say, ""Oh no, I thought it was for people"
00:15:09,00:15:11,"who are 30."""
00:15:11,00:15:12,(audience laughing)
00:15:12,00:15:14,And Roman.
00:15:14,00:15:17,(audience laughing)
00:15:17,00:15:19,- That's true.
00:15:19,00:15:21,"- So anyway, but there's other ones."
00:15:21,00:15:23,Dot AC is the Ascension Islands.
00:15:23,00:15:26,"They have a population of 806,"
00:15:26,00:15:29,and that's used largely for academicwebsites.ac.
00:15:29,00:15:33,"It's also used for, and I had no idea this was a big thing."
00:15:33,00:15:34,Air conditioning industries.
00:15:34,00:15:37,"They, it's a huge thing, air conditioning industries,"
00:15:37,00:15:41,"and they use Asc.la is for Laos,"
00:15:41,00:15:44,"or Laos, and that's being properly marketed"
00:15:44,00:15:47,as for Los Angeles to use that.
00:15:47,00:15:49,"And then I found Dot TV,"
00:15:49,00:15:52,and I remember Dot TV is a famous one because it's too blue.
00:15:52,00:15:53,"So I looked at, there's a list you can see"
00:15:53,00:15:56,the most famous Dot TV websites that you can get.
00:15:56,00:15:58,"And I found last night, and I was up,"
00:15:58,00:15:59,"'cause I've got, I've just had a son,"
00:15:59,00:16:02,so I was up at about 3am after feeding him
00:16:02,00:16:04,"with a bottle, and my wife was asleep,"
00:16:04,00:16:06,and I was doing research for tonight's show.
00:16:06,00:16:09,"And I found, right there, up on the list,"
00:16:09,00:16:11,"there's all these different Dot TVs,"
00:16:11,00:16:13,"hamster porn, Dot TV."
00:16:13,00:16:15,"- Oh, Daniel."
00:16:15,00:16:16,"And I saw it, and I thought,"
00:16:16,00:16:18,there's no way I'm not clicking that.
00:16:18,00:16:21,(audience laughing)
00:16:21,00:16:22,"So I clicked on it,"
00:16:22,00:16:25,"and I was brought to hamsterporn.tv,"
00:16:25,00:16:30,"and, annoyingly, it was just a regular human porn site."
00:16:30,00:16:31,"There were just a bunch of,"
00:16:31,00:16:32,- That must have been really annoying.
00:16:32,00:16:33,- It was overnight.
00:16:33,00:16:36,So it was all these just screen grabs of videos
00:16:36,00:16:38,of humans doing porn.
00:16:38,00:16:42,"And as I was looking through it and just slightly upset,"
00:16:42,00:16:43,my wife woke up.
00:16:43,00:16:46,(audience laughing)
00:16:46,00:16:48,"And she looked up, and she saw the screen,"
00:16:48,00:16:50,"and she looked at me and went,"
00:16:50,00:16:53,"""What are you doing? Are you looking at porn?"""
00:16:53,00:16:54,"And I said, ""No, honey, sorry,"
00:16:54,00:16:57,"""I thought it was going to be a side of hamster porn."""
00:16:57,00:17:00,(audience laughing)
00:17:00,00:17:05,"And she literally said nothing,"
00:17:05,00:17:08,and turned around in the bed and went back to sleep.
00:17:08,00:17:11,I can't believe you have roped us all into your lie here.
00:17:11,00:17:13,(audience laughing)
00:17:13,00:17:14,"- A week on Friday,"
00:17:14,00:17:15,"you're going to make your wife listen to it,"
00:17:15,00:17:16,"and go, ""See?"""
00:17:16,00:17:18,(audience laughing)
00:17:18,00:17:20,"The new top level domains, though,"
00:17:20,00:17:21,just to get nerdy.
00:17:21,00:17:22,That's a new thing.
00:17:22,00:17:24,So the .xxx is a new thing.
00:17:24,00:17:26,"And so it used to only be that you're country,"
00:17:26,00:17:28,"the .coms, the .co.uks."
00:17:28,00:17:30,"But now we can register stuff at things like,"
00:17:30,00:17:32,"there's a big long list you can read,"
00:17:32,00:17:37,"but .hair, .wow, . weirdly, . good,"
00:17:37,00:17:39,. weirdly. - Dot weirdly is lovely.
00:17:39,00:17:40,(audience laughing)
00:17:40,00:17:41,"We should do us a . weirdly, isn't it?"
00:17:41,00:17:43,"- Sorry, there's no . weirdly."
00:17:43,00:17:44,I was interjecting on myself.
00:17:44,00:17:48,"But there is . Ferreiro and . roche,"
00:17:48,00:17:51,"but there's not . Ferreiro, roche."
00:17:51,00:17:52,"And there's also . off,"
00:17:52,00:17:54,which just feels like you need to start registering
00:17:54,00:17:58,the sods and the boggles and the .xx . off
00:17:58,00:18:00,before they get snapped up.
00:18:00,00:18:03,- Just a really quick geeky top level domain name fact.
00:18:03,00:18:04,- Yeah.
00:18:04,00:18:07,"- For Montenegro, country of Montenegro."
00:18:07,00:18:10,"It was Yugoslavia, and then it went to Montenegro."
00:18:10,00:18:14,And so the top level domain went from .u to .me.
00:18:14,00:18:15,- Thank you.
00:18:15,00:18:17,"- Oh, God, that's awesome."
00:18:17,00:18:21,- That's sort of like Bruce Forsyth kind of website.
00:18:21,00:18:23,"- Wait, no, like a chuckle brother's website."
00:18:23,00:18:24,- Yeah.
00:18:24,00:18:27,(audience laughing)
00:18:27,00:18:31,- I think you were thinking nice to see you.
00:18:31,00:18:33,- That's what I was thinking to see you.
00:18:33,00:18:33,- To see me. - To see you.
00:18:33,00:18:35,"- To see me, to see you."
00:18:35,00:18:36,(audience laughing)
00:18:36,00:18:37,"- Thank you, James."
00:18:37,00:18:38,- Yes.
00:18:38,00:18:39,- We should move on.
00:18:39,00:18:41,(audience laughing)
00:18:41,00:18:43,"It is time for fact number three,"
00:18:43,00:18:45,and that is Chazinski.
00:18:45,00:18:46,"- Yeah, my fact this week is that"
00:18:46,00:18:49,"when Walmart opened in Germany,"
00:18:49,00:18:53,it scrapped its policy of making employees smile at customers
00:18:53,00:18:56,because the Germans found it too weird.
00:18:56,00:18:59,(audience laughing)
00:18:59,00:19:01,This is a genuine problem.
00:19:01,00:19:04,"So Walmart started opening up stores in Germany in 1998,"
00:19:04,00:19:06,"and they ended up in 95 stores opening,"
00:19:06,00:19:07,"and it was just a disaster really,"
00:19:07,00:19:09,and Germany didn't really get along
00:19:09,00:19:10,with Walmart very well.
00:19:10,00:19:14,And one of the main reasons was these golden Walmart rules
00:19:14,00:19:16,"that they have in America, and they are,"
00:19:16,00:19:18,"if a customer comes within 10 feet of view,"
00:19:18,00:19:21,you have to smile sweetly and offer help.
00:19:21,00:19:23,And this is known as the 10 foot rule.
00:19:23,00:19:26,"And other things like, if a shopper made a complaint,"
00:19:26,00:19:28,it needs to be dealt with by sundown.
00:19:28,00:19:30,That's called the sundown rule.
00:19:30,00:19:33,And customers' bags have to be packed at checkout.
00:19:33,00:19:35,"And it turned out they did this in Germany,"
00:19:35,00:19:37,"and they did various studies, researchers looked"
00:19:37,00:19:40,"at how it was playing, and it was playing badly."
00:19:40,00:19:44,So smiling was interpreted as flirting or creepy.
00:19:44,00:19:48,"And the head of the Walmart trade union said in Germany,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,"just said, ""German's don't behave that way."
00:19:50,00:19:52,"We don't do this smiling."""
00:19:52,00:19:55,"And then the biggest German research institute said,"
00:19:55,00:19:58,"""In Germany, if people try putting stuff in a bag for you,"
00:19:58,00:19:59,"the customer will just think,"
00:19:59,00:20:00,"""Hey, I just paid for that."
00:20:00,00:20:01,That's mine.
00:20:01,00:20:04,"What are you doing putting in a bag?"""
00:20:04,00:20:05,So it didn't work.
00:20:05,00:20:06,And it was just very interesting.
00:20:06,00:20:07,"So they had to cancel the policy,"
00:20:07,00:20:10,just because it's very different customer service
00:20:10,00:20:13,"in America to outside of America, turned out."
00:20:13,00:20:14,It was amazing.
00:20:14,00:20:16,"I don't think Germany is being unsmily, though."
00:20:16,00:20:18,I think it's that America is very smiley.
00:20:18,00:20:19,Yeah.
00:20:19,00:20:21,"But the 10-foot rule thing, does that apply"
00:20:21,00:20:26,even if there's a shelf in between you and the customer?
00:20:26,00:20:27,"Ah, yeah."
00:20:27,00:20:31,"Yeah, you have to run all the way around."
00:20:31,00:20:34,"Yeah, and so Walmart's not in Germany anymore, is it?"
00:20:34,00:20:34,No.
00:20:34,00:20:35,But they all closed down.
00:20:35,00:20:37,I read one other thing that they thought
00:20:37,00:20:40,maybe was one reason why it didn't work.
00:20:40,00:20:41,And that is because Walmart employees
00:20:41,00:20:44,are required every morning to stand in formation
00:20:44,00:20:49,"and chant ""Wall-Mart,"" and ""Wall-Mart,"" and they thought"
00:20:49,00:20:52,maybe the Germans didn't really like standing in a row
00:20:52,00:20:56,chanting things for obvious reasons.
00:20:56,00:20:59,"They also-- they would always make them do the charm,"
00:20:59,00:21:03,"which is like, ""Give me a W. Give me an A."""
00:21:03,00:21:05,"And apparently, lots of staff used to just hide"
00:21:05,00:21:08,"in the toilets for that part, as I think a lot of us would,"
00:21:08,00:21:10,if you were forced to do that every day.
00:21:10,00:21:12,"And also, they had to chant every morning at the morning"
00:21:12,00:21:14,meeting at the end of every meeting.
00:21:14,00:21:16,"The boss would say, ""Who is number one?"""
00:21:16,00:21:18,And all the staff would have to chant.
00:21:18,00:21:19,"The customer, of course."
00:21:19,00:21:23,So I think staff spent a lot of time in the bathrooms.
00:21:23,00:21:28,"Magic and a work and just chanting, no such thing as a fish."
00:21:28,00:21:28,No such thing as a fish.
00:21:28,00:21:31,"Well, if you turned up on time a bit more often, you'd see."
00:21:31,00:21:39,"In fact, that goes for all three of you, may I say."
00:21:39,00:21:41,"So in some countries, I read the New York Times"
00:21:41,00:21:45,said that they've had trouble in various places.
00:21:45,00:21:48,"In Korea, apparently, they ran into trouble"
00:21:48,00:21:52,because they had taller racks than those of local rivals.
00:21:52,00:21:54,"And so it was just a bit harder to reach this stuff,"
00:21:54,00:21:56,and customers would have to get on ladders.
00:21:56,00:21:57,"So I was like, oh, maybe the average height"
00:21:57,00:21:59,in Korea is a bit shorter.
00:21:59,00:21:59,I looked it up.
00:21:59,00:22:02,Koreans are exactly the same average height as British people.
00:22:02,00:22:05,"So just apparently, they slightly overshot"
00:22:05,00:22:06,the shelf height in Walmart.
00:22:06,00:22:11,But Walmart's ladder sales went hugely through the roof.
00:22:11,00:22:12,"It is like a cult, though."
00:22:12,00:22:16,I was reading a blog by a guy called--
00:22:16,00:22:20,"Sorry, Andy, a blog is where people just put thoughts"
00:22:20,00:22:21,"and stuff, yeah."
00:22:21,00:22:23,I was reading a blog by an ex-wormart employee
00:22:23,00:22:26,who was saying that they get really obsessed with box cutters.
00:22:26,00:22:28,So they get given a box cutter when
00:22:28,00:22:29,they join as a member of staff.
00:22:29,00:22:30,This is in America.
00:22:30,00:22:33,"And he said, staff go a heapship for these box cutters."
00:22:33,00:22:36,"And every staff meetings, they would"
00:22:36,00:22:38,have Sam Walton trivia contest.
00:22:38,00:22:41,"Now, Sam Walton is the guy who founded Walmart."
00:22:41,00:22:43,"I don't know how much trivia there is about Sam Walton,"
00:22:43,00:22:45,"but apparently enough to have a trivia quiz on him,"
00:22:45,00:22:46,every staff meeting.
00:22:46,00:22:50,"And where the answer is always, Sam Walton."
00:22:50,00:22:50,Yeah.
00:22:50,00:22:52,Is Sam Walton the best person ever?
00:22:52,00:22:53,"Yes, correct."
00:22:53,00:22:57,"Oh, my, oh, my, oh, my, oh, my."
00:22:57,00:22:59,"And then the winner of that quiz, who locked onto that,"
00:22:59,00:23:02,would get a slightly petter box cutter.
00:23:02,00:23:04,And then this member of staff said they
00:23:04,00:23:07,used to taunt the other staff with their slightly better box
00:23:07,00:23:08,cutters.
00:23:08,00:23:09,But that's quite aggressive.
00:23:09,00:23:10,"Yeah, with a knife."
00:23:10,00:23:12,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:12,00:23:15,"Oh, my, my, my, my."
00:23:15,00:23:19,"So I was looking at, like, smiling around the world,"
00:23:19,00:23:21,happiness with different countries.
00:23:21,00:23:23,You always get these things where all the countries are
00:23:23,00:23:25,"ordered by how happy they are, don't you?"
00:23:25,00:23:26,"And usually the same people in, like,"
00:23:26,00:23:28,customary or something.
00:23:28,00:23:31,But Denmark has won it for the last few years.
00:23:31,00:23:33,"And this year, they were beaten by Norway"
00:23:33,00:23:35,into second place.
00:23:35,00:23:39,"But actually, the guy in charge of happiness in Denmark"
00:23:39,00:23:41,"said he was, he was very happy for them."
00:23:41,00:23:44,[LAUGHTER]
00:23:44,00:23:47,A lying bastard.
00:23:47,00:23:49,Said we don't have a monopoly on happiness.
00:23:49,00:23:50,Wow.
00:23:50,00:23:54,"That's, I mean, but that's the ultimate happy sentence"
00:23:54,00:23:55,to lose the happiness competition.
00:23:55,00:23:58,"That's almost, we're going to have to take the prize off you."
00:23:58,00:24:00,That guy just went uber happy.
00:24:00,00:24:01,That's insane.
00:24:01,00:24:04,"Yeah, and that's obviously why he did it, the cynical bastard."
00:24:04,00:24:05,"He said, he said that."
00:24:05,00:24:07,"And then he went, are we back at the top spot?"
00:24:07,00:24:09,"Yeah, great."
00:24:09,00:24:12,"And when McDonald's opened in Russia, in fact,"
00:24:12,00:24:15,"where, you know, the service industry"
00:24:15,00:24:17,"has slightly different cultural norms,"
00:24:17,00:24:19,staff would talk how to smile.
00:24:19,00:24:20,"The Russian staff would talk how to smile,"
00:24:20,00:24:22,because it's not a particularly normal thing.
00:24:22,00:24:24,"And actually, there was a study that was done"
00:24:24,00:24:27,looking at how different countries view smiling.
00:24:27,00:24:29,"And in Russia, most people view someone who"
00:24:29,00:24:32,"smiles a lot as quite stupid, whereas in America,"
00:24:32,00:24:35,"and actually in Britain, we view them as a bit more intelligent,"
00:24:35,00:24:38,"in fact, if someone smiles at you and they engage with you."
00:24:38,00:24:42,"It all depends, I would say, on context."
00:24:42,00:24:49,"If someone's smiling at you on the bus, and they won't stop."
00:24:49,00:24:51,"It is true, though, actually, in Russia,"
00:24:51,00:24:53,"because my wife's Russian, so I go to Russia occasionally,"
00:24:53,00:24:56,and they just don't smitling photographs.
00:24:56,00:24:58,"They do a bit now, but in the olden days,"
00:24:58,00:25:00,they really wouldn't smile in photographs.
00:25:00,00:25:02,And there was very much frowned upon.
00:25:02,00:25:04,[LAUGHTER]
00:25:04,00:25:08,"Oh, I'm sorry."
00:25:08,00:25:11,"I almost bottled out of that joke, I'm with her."
00:25:11,00:25:12,And I thought there's no word to go with it.
00:25:12,00:25:14,But it is actually true.
00:25:14,00:25:15,Yeah.
00:25:15,00:25:18,"If you see old pictures of Russians even from the '80s and '90s,"
00:25:18,00:25:20,they're just very--
00:25:20,00:25:21,Yeah.
00:25:21,00:25:22,Americans used to be really serious.
00:25:22,00:25:24,They used to have a reputation of being serious
00:25:24,00:25:25,until the mid-19th century.
00:25:25,00:25:26,Any.
00:25:26,00:25:29,"Well, didn't-- so I was just thinking of the very old photos"
00:25:29,00:25:31,that used to get taken when nobody's smiling.
00:25:31,00:25:33,And you often read that in the reason
00:25:33,00:25:35,that no one's smiling is because they--
00:25:35,00:25:37,that just was the thing.
00:25:37,00:25:38,You just don't smile.
00:25:38,00:25:41,I didn't realize it's because of the long exposure of the photo.
00:25:41,00:25:45,So it takes so long for the photo to be taken.
00:25:45,00:25:47,And you don't know exactly what point it's going to be.
00:25:47,00:25:49,You just had to keep a normal face.
00:25:49,00:25:50,"I mean, not in the 1980s."
00:25:50,00:25:52,We had a camera technology had come quite long.
00:25:52,00:25:53,"No, no, no."
00:25:53,00:25:56,"I mean, the super-old school--"
00:25:56,00:26:01,"we're talking like, I guess, the BC."
00:26:01,00:26:02,Before cameras.
00:26:02,00:26:03,Yeah.
00:26:03,00:26:05,[LAUGHTER]
00:26:05,00:26:08,"But so because, yeah, the exposure was too long."
00:26:08,00:26:11,"So to hold a smile, to hold the cheese,"
00:26:11,00:26:14,it would be so long that you would just look pained.
00:26:14,00:26:15,"And it would be, yeah."
00:26:15,00:26:17,"I have read a debunk of that, actually, just for the record,"
00:26:17,00:26:20,that maybe the exposure wasn't quite as long as we thought.
00:26:20,00:26:21,Maybe it was only about 30 seconds
00:26:21,00:26:23,and anyone could hold a smile for 30 seconds.
00:26:23,00:26:24,But I don't know.
00:26:24,00:26:26,"No, but they were just getting used to smiles back then."
00:26:26,00:26:27,It would have felt a lot longer.
00:26:27,00:26:28,Yeah.
00:26:28,00:26:30,They could have had a happiness hat.
00:26:30,00:26:32,This was something in the news a few years ago.
00:26:32,00:26:35,"And the happiness of that was a hat, obviously."
00:26:35,00:26:37,And it was made of metal.
00:26:37,00:26:40,And it had these kind of metal bits coming down the side.
00:26:40,00:26:41,And then it had a metal spike.
00:26:41,00:26:43,"And whenever it sensed that you were frowning,"
00:26:43,00:26:46,it would stab you in the head with a spike.
00:26:46,00:26:48,I remind you to smile.
00:26:48,00:26:48,"Oh, god."
00:26:48,00:26:49,Really?
00:26:49,00:26:49,Sorry.
00:26:49,00:26:53,Which shopping chain was this?
00:26:53,00:26:55,Where was this?
00:26:55,00:26:56,It was just one guy who invented it.
00:26:56,00:26:58,All right.
00:26:58,00:26:59,But he hit the news.
00:26:59,00:27:00,Yeah.
00:27:00,00:27:01,Wow.
00:27:01,00:27:02,Should we move on to our final fact?
00:27:02,00:27:03,"Yeah, we should."
00:27:03,00:27:06,"OK, it is time for our final fact of the show."
00:27:06,00:27:07,And that is my fact.
00:27:07,00:27:11,My fact this week is that it is really easy
00:27:11,00:27:17,to beat chimpanzees at the game Rock Paper Scissors.
00:27:17,00:27:19,"Yeah, they're shit at it."
00:27:19,00:27:22,Chimpanzees have recently been taught to play.
00:27:22,00:27:24,"Stone Paper Scissors, Rock Paper Scissors,"
00:27:24,00:27:26,"Rush Ambo, whatever you call the game."
00:27:26,00:27:31,"And they actually-- the flip side is,"
00:27:31,00:27:33,they actually know how to play Stone Paper Scissors.
00:27:33,00:27:34,It's amazing.
00:27:34,00:27:36,And they can learn it to the level of what
00:27:36,00:27:38,a four-year-old would learn it.
00:27:38,00:27:39,"So you could actually, at the moment,"
00:27:39,00:27:42,they've only been playing with computer simulation.
00:27:42,00:27:44,So playing against a computer or an iPad.
00:27:44,00:27:47,"But if you were to play them, you could actually"
00:27:47,00:27:49,have a genuine game with the movements of Rock Paper Scissors
00:27:49,00:27:50,and beat them.
00:27:50,00:27:53,The reason you can beat them is they're really bad at learning
00:27:53,00:27:54,from their mistakes.
00:27:54,00:27:56,So whereas four-year-olds will make a mistake
00:27:56,00:27:58,"and go, I need to adjust."
00:27:58,00:28:01,"chimpanzees will be like, I'll use paper again."
00:28:01,00:28:03,"And then afterwards, when they're beating again,"
00:28:03,00:28:07,"they'll be like, I'll go for paper this time."
00:28:07,00:28:09,"And then when you beat them again, he's"
00:28:09,00:28:11,not going to see what's coming next.
00:28:11,00:28:14,Good old trusty paper.
00:28:14,00:28:15,And then--
00:28:15,00:28:17,"If I was playing against them, I might think"
00:28:17,00:28:20,they're not going to be stupid enough to go for paper again.
00:28:20,00:28:21,That's why I would probably lose.
00:28:21,00:28:25,I still saw about the matter she lost.
00:28:25,00:28:28,"Actually, they're a lot better than you'd think, then."
00:28:28,00:28:31,"It's interesting, because it took them--"
00:28:31,00:28:33,the chimpanzees who learned it-- I think on seven chimpanzees
00:28:33,00:28:35,and five of them managed to master it.
00:28:35,00:28:38,It did take them 100 days to learn it.
00:28:38,00:28:40,"So it's a very, very long time for them to learn."
00:28:40,00:28:41,"Yeah, there it is."
00:28:41,00:28:43,It's a simple game.
00:28:43,00:28:44,"I mean, I don't want to brag."
00:28:44,00:28:47,"I got it in about 30 days, anyway."
00:28:47,00:28:49,But the really tricky thing that the chimpanzees didn't get
00:28:49,00:28:51,was the circular nature of it.
00:28:51,00:28:54,So they understood rock beat scissors.
00:28:54,00:28:56,"And then they understood, OK, scissors beat paper."
00:28:56,00:28:58,But they found it hard to get the head around paper
00:28:58,00:28:59,then beats rock.
00:28:59,00:29:00,Really?
00:29:00,00:29:01,That makes it even more weird that they
00:29:01,00:29:02,went for paper every time.
00:29:02,00:29:06,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:06,00:29:07,"But actually, I'm with them."
00:29:07,00:29:09,Why does paper beat rock?
00:29:09,00:29:10,"I mean, I know it covers it."
00:29:10,00:29:11,You're rapping.
00:29:11,00:29:11,You're rapping.
00:29:11,00:29:13,"But that's not beaten, is it?"
00:29:13,00:29:18,"I mean, scissors is actually demolishing the paper, isn't it?"
00:29:18,00:29:20,And the rock is demolishing the scissors.
00:29:20,00:29:22,"Yeah, but if you hide a rock in some paper,"
00:29:22,00:29:24,you can smuggle it into a recycling bin.
00:29:24,00:29:28,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:28,00:29:29,Got it.
00:29:29,00:29:30,Yeah.
00:29:30,00:29:33,"In Japan, it's a tiger village chief"
00:29:33,00:29:36,"and the village chief's mother, right?"
00:29:36,00:29:38,And that's that sort of thing.
00:29:38,00:29:40,"And so the village chief's mother kills the village chief,"
00:29:40,00:29:42,because she's angry with him.
00:29:42,00:29:43,"The village chief kills the tiger,"
00:29:43,00:29:46,and the tiger kills the village chief's mother.
00:29:46,00:29:47,Do you know the Indonesian version?
00:29:47,00:29:48,No.
00:29:48,00:29:51,And human elephant.
00:29:51,00:29:53,So the human tramples the elephant--
00:29:53,00:29:58,[LAUGHTER]
00:29:58,00:30:01,"There's tiny elephants, they have an Indonesian."
00:30:01,00:30:05,I think I got confused between ant and elephant and--
00:30:05,00:30:07,and it focks me.
00:30:07,00:30:08,Sorry.
00:30:08,00:30:11,The human tramples the ant.
00:30:11,00:30:12,The human tramples the ant.
00:30:12,00:30:14,Then the elephant squashes the human.
00:30:14,00:30:17,But then the ant beats the elephant by--
00:30:17,00:30:17,The tramples it.
00:30:17,00:30:20,Yeah.
00:30:20,00:30:23,"Is that the ant gets into the elephant's ear,"
00:30:23,00:30:24,and it tickles it?
00:30:24,00:30:26,Ah.
00:30:26,00:30:27,Really?
00:30:27,00:30:28,I read that the ant crawls up the elephant's trunk
00:30:28,00:30:30,and eats its brain.
00:30:30,00:30:32,"Maybe-- oh, sorry, I have a sick--"
00:30:32,00:30:34,"Oh, I had parental guide long on."
00:30:34,00:30:37,[LAUGHTER]
00:30:37,00:30:39,It's-- so I am very confused by the chimp fight.
00:30:39,00:30:41,"I didn't realize they were less good than us,"
00:30:41,00:30:42,because there's no such thing as being good at rock paper
00:30:42,00:30:43,scissors.
00:30:43,00:30:44,There is no strategy.
00:30:44,00:30:46,"You can't love for me on mistakes,"
00:30:46,00:30:48,"because we all basically make the same mistakes,"
00:30:48,00:30:50,and we can't really predict each other.
00:30:50,00:30:51,Particularly.
00:30:51,00:30:54,"I mean, if you're really a pro, if you may be--"
00:30:54,00:30:57,"If you've obviously not been on the rock paper scissors website,"
00:30:57,00:30:59,they have a lot of tactics on that.
00:30:59,00:31:03,"One thing is if your opponent pays scissors in the first go,"
00:31:03,00:31:05,you can tell by how wide the scissors
00:31:05,00:31:07,is what they're going to do in the next go.
00:31:07,00:31:09,"No, you can't."
00:31:09,00:31:10,"Well, no, you can't."
00:31:10,00:31:13,"I mean, they say you can."
00:31:13,00:31:16,"They have another-- apparently, this is a trendy strategy."
00:31:16,00:31:19,It's the exclusion strategy.
00:31:19,00:31:22,"OK, so you never play say rock, and you keep doing different ones."
00:31:22,00:31:25,"You keep doing paper or scissors, and your opponent just"
00:31:25,00:31:28,"gets obsessed by the fact that you've never played rock,"
00:31:28,00:31:30,and it just fucks with their mind.
00:31:30,00:31:31,That's great.
00:31:31,00:31:32,"It's a good idea, right?"
00:31:32,00:31:34,And that's the trendy strategy.
00:31:34,00:31:35,That's the trendy one.
00:31:35,00:31:36,"Now, that's how to be cool as someone who"
00:31:36,00:31:40,subscribes to rockpapersizzas.com.
00:31:40,00:31:42,You don't actually have to subscribe to a website.
00:31:42,00:31:47,You can just-- you can just go there and then go away.
00:31:47,00:31:52,"Some of them you do, like, hamsterpawn.com."
00:31:52,00:31:54,Children are very hard to play at rockpapersizzas.
00:31:54,00:31:56,"I mean, they're very good at playing it,"
00:31:56,00:31:58,because their choices are genuinely random.
00:31:58,00:31:59,Yeah.
00:31:59,00:32:04,"They haven't yet mastered the gambits that James is discussing,"
00:32:04,00:32:06,so they're much likely just to go with whatever.
00:32:06,00:32:08,And that makes them quite hard to beat.
00:32:08,00:32:08,Right.
00:32:08,00:32:10,"Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
00:32:10,00:32:11,You don't want to overthink it.
00:32:11,00:32:15,"Hey, I found a cool thing about chimpanzees."
00:32:15,00:32:20,"Chimpanzees can recognize each other by face, like we do."
00:32:20,00:32:23,But if they're just walking along and a chimpanzee's
00:32:23,00:32:26,"facing the other way, and the butt is showing,"
00:32:26,00:32:30,"they'll see the butt and be like, Greg, they"
00:32:30,00:32:34,have an understanding of Bums that they can just--
00:32:34,00:32:37,"if you put like a lineup of Bums in front of them,"
00:32:37,00:32:40,"they'd be like Mark Sonia, Alice, John."
00:32:40,00:32:43,Is that what chimp lineups are?
00:32:43,00:32:46,"Is it like any of these people, the people who pick"
00:32:46,00:32:48,"pocketed you the other day, Mrs. Chimp?"
00:32:48,00:32:50,"And then she's like that bum there, yeah."
00:32:50,00:32:52,"Yeah, it's good, because once you've robbed someone,"
00:32:52,00:32:53,"you run away, don't you?"
00:32:53,00:32:54,So you're likely to see the bum.
00:32:54,00:32:55,Perfect.
00:32:55,00:32:55,Yes.
00:32:55,00:32:56,Exactly.
00:32:56,00:33:01,"Oh, there was-- I heard an amazing burl-growry."
00:33:01,00:33:03,Burl-- burl-growry.
00:33:03,00:33:04,Rubbery?
00:33:04,00:33:07,"Rubbery, right?"
00:33:07,00:33:10,We did the audiobook the other day for the book that we've done.
00:33:10,00:33:13,And it took forever for me to say basic words like that.
00:33:13,00:33:18,The best one was when you misread February as January.
00:33:18,00:33:20,It was truly bizarre.
00:33:20,00:33:23,"Yeah, so there was this fact that we found the other day,"
00:33:23,00:33:27,which is that a burglar is always most likely
00:33:27,00:33:30,going to knock on your door before they burgle you.
00:33:30,00:33:31,Isn't that weird?
00:33:31,00:33:33,Is that so they can check if someone's in?
00:33:33,00:33:34,"Yeah, basically."
00:33:34,00:33:34,"Yeah, that makes sense."
00:33:34,00:33:36,"If you're going to get robbed, they're just always"
00:33:36,00:33:38,"going to knock for us, like in a polite fashion,"
00:33:38,00:33:40,as opposed to just breaking a window or whatever.
00:33:40,00:33:42,"Yeah, I don't think it's our politeness that they're doing it,"
00:33:42,00:33:43,but yeah.
00:33:43,00:33:46,[LAUGHTER]
00:33:46,00:33:47,So have you read the thing about chimps
00:33:47,00:33:50,"that they, according to the New York Times,"
00:33:50,00:33:53,have the ability to cook if only someone would give them
00:33:53,00:33:55,an oven?
00:33:55,00:33:56,This is what scientists--
00:33:56,00:33:59,I'm like that.
00:33:59,00:34:01,This is something the scientists have just concluded.
00:34:01,00:34:04,And they did this in a study where the researcher in Volvo
00:34:04,00:34:07,"said, we invented a magic cooking device"
00:34:07,00:34:09,to test it on the chimps.
00:34:09,00:34:11,"As they explained it, it's two plastic bowls."
00:34:11,00:34:14,And the chimps are raw potato in one of the plastic bowls.
00:34:14,00:34:17,"And then in the other one, there's a cooked potato,"
00:34:17,00:34:20,and you maneuver the bowls to make the chimps think
00:34:20,00:34:22,that his raw potato has been cooked.
00:34:22,00:34:25,Why this guy didn't just use the already existing oven
00:34:25,00:34:27,"that we have, I don't know."
00:34:27,00:34:30,But it turns out that chimps do prefer--
00:34:30,00:34:31,"if you give them a bit of raw potato,"
00:34:31,00:34:34,they prefer to put it in the plastic bowl that will then
00:34:34,00:34:37,magically cook the potato and then to eat the cooked potato.
00:34:37,00:34:38,Then just to eat it raw.
00:34:38,00:34:41,And so that kind of shows that chimps have self-control.
00:34:41,00:34:45,They're willing to postpone the potato to make it taste nicer.
00:34:45,00:34:48,"And also, according to the scientists who did the experiment,"
00:34:48,00:34:51,"it said, it shows they have the causal understanding"
00:34:51,00:34:53,"to make the leap to cooking, which I would argue,"
00:34:53,00:34:56,believing that you're putting a raw potato into a plastic bowl
00:34:56,00:34:59,"and then leaving it for 10 seconds before getting a cooked one,"
00:34:59,00:35:01,is not having the causal understanding.
00:35:01,00:35:02,"Yeah, that's true."
00:35:02,00:35:03,I didn't know they preferred cooked food.
00:35:03,00:35:05,"Yeah, neither did I."
00:35:05,00:35:08,But I don't know how my microwave works.
00:35:08,00:35:09,If you told me that some scientists just
00:35:09,00:35:13,replace it with a cooked risotto.
00:35:13,00:35:15,I'll buy it.
00:35:15,00:35:16,"OK, should we wrap up?"
00:35:16,00:35:18,"OK, that is all our facts."
00:35:18,00:35:19,Thank you so much for listening.
00:35:19,00:35:21,If you'd like to get in contact with any of us

00:35:36,00:35:38,"I can't see what that was, Bruce Porsoy."
00:35:38,00:35:45,"Um, it's an anti-clomax now, but Andrew Hunter M."

00:36:00,00:36:02,"You can also buy our new book, The Book of the Year."
00:36:02,00:36:05,"It's out November 2nd, and we're about to give one away, actually,"
00:36:05,00:36:08,to one of the members of the audience who sent us a fact.
00:36:08,00:36:09,"James, you've got the facts."
00:36:09,00:36:09,I have.
00:36:09,00:36:11,It is from Scott Robinson.
00:36:11,00:36:14,And the fact is that cleaning your teeth
00:36:14,00:36:18,is the only time you get to clean your skeleton.
00:36:18,00:36:20,That's so cool.
00:36:20,00:36:20,So creepy.
00:36:20,00:36:23,So creepy.
00:36:23,00:36:24,Is that true?
00:36:24,00:36:25,That's our skeleton?
00:36:25,00:36:26,"Not quite true, you just said."
00:36:26,00:36:29,"Whoa, we've not had this on the show before."
00:36:29,00:36:31,Who shouted fight?
00:36:31,00:36:39,I think what we can do is a game of rock paper scissors.
00:36:39,00:36:40,"Oh, yes, yes."
00:36:40,00:36:45,"So this guy here, who, the quibbler, I'm going to call you."
00:36:45,00:36:50,"If you show in front of your chest what you want to do for rock paper scissors,"
00:36:50,00:36:53,"and then we'll get Scott to shout out what he wants to do,"
00:36:53,00:36:54,and we'll see if there's a winner.
00:36:54,00:36:55,"Oh, wow."
00:36:55,00:36:56,This is so exciting.
00:36:56,00:36:57,"So wait, I can't see it."
00:36:57,00:36:58,"Yeah, I can see it."
00:36:58,00:36:59,I can see it.
00:36:59,00:37:00,"OK, Scott shout out."
00:37:00,00:37:02,What have you got?
00:37:02,00:37:03,His Scott's the winner.
00:37:03,00:37:04,"Yeah, it was me."
00:37:04,00:37:12,"Scott, come and grab a book from us."
00:37:12,00:37:13,We'll be here.
00:37:13,00:37:15,You went for paper.
00:37:15,00:37:20,Let's do it again.
00:37:20,00:37:21,He'll never do paper again.
00:37:21,00:37:22,"Oh, that."
00:37:22,00:37:24,He won't do paper.
00:37:24,00:37:28,"OK, well, we'll be back again next week with another episode."
00:37:28,00:37:30,"Thank you so much for being here, everyone."
00:37:30,00:37:31,"Thank you so, so much."
00:37:31,00:37:32,We'll see you again next week.
00:37:32,00:37:33,Goodbye.
