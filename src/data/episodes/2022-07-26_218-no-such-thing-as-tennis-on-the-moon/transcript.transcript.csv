00:00:00,00:00:23,It's a weekly podcast coming to you from the QI offices in Covenant Garden.
00:00:23,00:00:28,"My name is Dan Schreiber and I'm sitting here with Andrew Hunter Murray, James Harkin,"
00:00:28,00:00:33,"and Anichesinski, and once again we have gathered around the microphones with our four favorite"
00:00:33,00:00:37,facts of the last seven days at a no particular order.
00:00:37,00:00:38,Here we go.
00:00:38,00:00:43,"Starting with fact number one, and that's my fact this week, my fact is that in an attempt"
00:00:43,00:00:48,"to work out who the murderer and Charles Dickens' last unfinished novel was, the lead character"
00:00:48,00:00:52,was put on trial.
00:00:52,00:00:53,So this is the mystery of Edwin Druid.
00:00:53,00:00:58,"Yeah, this was the final novel of Charles Dickens that he was serializing in a newspaper"
00:00:58,00:00:59,that were meant to be 12 installments.
00:00:59,00:01:03,He only got as far as six before he passed away.
00:01:03,00:01:07,"And as it was, the lead character, Edwin Druid, goes, he disappears."
00:01:07,00:01:09,And so we never know what happened to him.
00:01:09,00:01:15,And people ever since have been trying to work it out by looking for clues within it.
00:01:15,00:01:16,And so on.
00:01:16,00:01:21,"And in 1914, a mock trial was put on as part of an attempt to try and work out who might"
00:01:21,00:01:22,have murdered him.
00:01:22,00:01:25,"And the lead character of the book, John Jasper, was put on trial."
00:01:25,00:01:30,And it was full of celebrities. The judge of the trial was G.K. Chesterton.
00:01:30,00:01:32,The foreman of the jury was George Bernard Shaw.
00:01:32,00:01:35,"It was a very, very cool trial."
00:01:35,00:01:38,And did they find him innocent or guilty or?
00:01:38,00:01:41,"No, they, I think they wanted to go for manslaughter in the end."
00:01:41,00:01:46,"But then, yeah, G.K. Chesterton and got a very impatient with everyone and found everyone"
00:01:46,00:01:48,guilty of contempt of court by the end of the day.
00:01:48,00:01:49,Nice.
00:01:49,00:01:50,"Except himself, right?"
00:01:50,00:01:51,Except himself.
00:01:51,00:01:54,"Yeah, but when do you get a judge finding himself guilty of contempt of court, that's super"
00:01:54,00:01:55,rare.
00:01:55,00:01:56,That's happened.
00:01:56,00:01:58,I remember that happening in America in the last few years.
00:01:58,00:01:59,Really?
00:01:59,00:02:00,Yeah.
00:02:00,00:02:01,Wow.
00:02:01,00:02:03,Is that a really good moral judge or an extremely immoral judge?
00:02:03,00:02:04,It's hard to say.
00:02:04,00:02:08,"Because he just looked to himself and gone, ""God, even I can see that I'm terrible."""
00:02:08,00:02:13,"My feeling is, and I might be wrong about this, maybe a judge had his mobile phone on or"
00:02:13,00:02:14,something.
00:02:14,00:02:17,And then he got a call and he kind of found himself in contempt or something.
00:02:17,00:02:18,"Oh, yeah."
00:02:18,00:02:19,"That rings a bell, yeah."
00:02:19,00:02:20,It's really good.
00:02:20,00:02:24,"So fans of this novel are called Drew Idz, which I think is very clever."
00:02:24,00:02:25,Yes.
00:02:25,00:02:27,"Or ""Drewdians,"" or ""Drewdists."""
00:02:27,00:02:28,Yeah.
00:02:28,00:02:29,Yeah.
00:02:29,00:02:34,There's a whole website where you can read every single possible scenario or sort of outcome
00:02:34,00:02:36,of what might have happened to Edwin Druid.
00:02:36,00:02:40,"And there's hundreds of over the years, just so many people have been trying to work it"
00:02:40,00:02:41,out.
00:02:41,00:02:44,There's been four movies that have been made of the book where different outcomes have
00:02:44,00:02:46,been revealed at the end.
00:02:46,00:02:51,There was a Broadway musical whereby the audience actually voted on who they thought it
00:02:51,00:02:53,was at the end of the show.
00:02:53,00:02:54,"It wasn't only that, was it?"
00:02:54,00:02:55,So this musical was a really big deal.
00:02:55,00:02:58,"I'd never actually heard of it, but it won five Tony Awards."
00:02:58,00:03:03,"I think it won Best Musical in the 80s and Best Actor, I think."
00:03:03,00:03:08,"But the audience got to vote on who killed Edwin Druid, and they also got to vote on various"
00:03:08,00:03:09,other things.
00:03:09,00:03:13,"So they got to vote on what was the identity of Dick Dattery, which was unknown at the"
00:03:13,00:03:17,"time Dick and Stop Writing, and they got to vote on which couple would become romantically"
00:03:17,00:03:18,involved in the end.
00:03:18,00:03:23,And all the actors had to train up to be able to perform any scene of any of these possible
00:03:23,00:03:24,outcomes.
00:03:24,00:03:29,"When I was a child, I had a computer game called Star Wars Chess, and there obviously there"
00:03:29,00:03:34,"was a good team and an evil team, all characters from Star Wars, and every single possible move"
00:03:34,00:03:38,"combination that you made, there was a little cutscene showing you how R2D2 defeated Darth"
00:03:38,00:03:39,Vader.
00:03:39,00:03:43,"Yeah, but not for every single possible game of chess, because it's like trillions."
00:03:43,00:03:44,"No, trillions."
00:03:44,00:03:45,For every piece combo.
00:03:45,00:03:46,Right.
00:03:46,00:03:50,So you would always have a good rook defeating an evil pawn or you would have it.
00:03:50,00:03:51,It was brilliant.
00:03:51,00:03:56,"Yeah, I have surprised actually because it sounds very geeky that, and you never really"
00:03:56,00:03:58,struck me as a kind of person who would like that kind of thing.
00:03:58,00:03:59,"Yeah, weird, isn't it?"
00:03:59,00:04:00,I'm thinking of which.
00:04:00,00:04:02,Has anyone else been in a mock trial in their life?
00:04:02,00:04:03,No.
00:04:03,00:04:04,Yes.
00:04:04,00:04:05,Have you?
00:04:05,00:04:06,What?
00:04:06,00:04:07,A wide school.
00:04:07,00:04:08,"Yeah, same."
00:04:08,00:04:09,Yeah.
00:04:09,00:04:10,"For what, what did you both do?"
00:04:10,00:04:11,"I'm asking it turned out, and I was livid."
00:04:11,00:04:12,"No, I'm joking."
00:04:12,00:04:13,I was a lawyer in the mock trial.
00:04:13,00:04:14,"Yeah, me too."
00:04:14,00:04:15,"Yeah, yeah."
00:04:15,00:04:16,It's really fun.
00:04:16,00:04:17,That's so fun.
00:04:17,00:04:18,And what?
00:04:18,00:04:23,"In fact, about a case, so mine was a fight in a pub, so I'm going to have been hit with a"
00:04:23,00:04:24,"poor queue, I think."
00:04:24,00:04:25,"Oh, yeah."
00:04:25,00:04:29,"And they give you lots of different eyewitness accounts, and you have to then hold a trial."
00:04:29,00:04:31,"And you sometimes, I think we went to an actual court to do this."
00:04:31,00:04:32,Did you?
00:04:32,00:04:33,Very exciting.
00:04:33,00:04:34,Wow.
00:04:34,00:04:35,Yeah.
00:04:35,00:04:38,"Are you just, you were a juvenile delinquent and you've kind of hospitalized it as a game?"
00:04:38,00:04:39,That's it.
00:04:39,00:04:40,Yeah.
00:04:40,00:04:43,And we went to a court when we were kids at school.
00:04:43,00:04:44,Yeah.
00:04:44,00:04:50,"And I remember it because we were there basically a load of kids, and these people just kept coming"
00:04:50,00:04:54,"up, and they'd all be beating each other up the night before, because it was like, wow,"
00:04:54,00:04:58,"it was basically people who'd been locked up that night for assault, and then they were"
00:04:58,00:05:01,coming in doing their pleas and stuff like that.
00:05:01,00:05:03,This is your school trip.
00:05:03,00:05:06,"What else went to old towers, but yeah, probably me."
00:05:06,00:05:09,"We sort of went to the Battle of Hastings site, and I mean, that, in a sense, was a lot"
00:05:09,00:05:14,"of people beating each other up, so I think maybe it was just, um, to prepare a"
00:05:14,00:05:15,service for the future.
00:05:15,00:05:16,God.
00:05:16,00:05:20,"It's weird that they felt they need to investigate it though, because Dickens did actually finish"
00:05:20,00:05:21,"at Wendru, didn't he?"
00:05:21,00:05:22,What?
00:05:22,00:05:23,Did he?
00:05:23,00:05:24,"He finished it, um, no."
00:05:24,00:05:25,No.
00:05:25,00:05:34,"Yeah, he finished it in 1873, um, so he died in 1870, but he did finish it him with a medium,"
00:05:34,00:05:39,"but it was, but it was with a medium called Thomas Power James, which I think is really"
00:05:39,00:05:42,"cool, and this book, oh, it was the mystery of everyone drew part two, and he published"
00:05:42,00:05:47,"part one, kind of cockily, under his own name now, Thomas Power James, and then part two was"
00:05:47,00:05:51,"what the meat, what he'd learned from Dickens' ghost, and it had two prefaces at the start of"
00:05:51,00:05:55,"it, one from Thomas Power James, who was saying this is such a privilege to be able to write"
00:05:55,00:06:01,"with Dickens, and then the other from Dickens himself, saying, ""You'll notice my suit."""
00:06:01,00:06:08,"So there is a story that Dickens wrote to Queen Victoria a few months before his death,"
00:06:08,00:06:12,"and he was saying to her, ""Would you like a spoiler of what happened to Edwin Druid,"
00:06:12,00:06:15,"and she wrote back, and she said, 'No, I'm fine, thank you.'"""
00:06:15,00:06:19,"Out, she offered her a little more of it in advance of her subjects, and she said, ""That's"
00:06:19,00:06:24,"cool, I'm enjoying the instruments,"" or whatever she said, but we could have had Queen Victoria"
00:06:24,00:06:27,"solving the mystery of what happened to Edwin Druid, which would have been very cool."
00:06:27,00:06:28,Wow.
00:06:28,00:06:33,"Well, supposedly the illustrator of the book claimed to have known who the murderer was,"
00:06:33,00:06:40,"so his name was Luke Fields, and he had given instructions by Dickens that John Jasper,"
00:06:40,00:06:46,"he wear a net tie, and the idea was that Jasper strangles Edwin Druid with it, and he used"
00:06:46,00:06:51,to have a close collaboration obviously with Dickens because he liked to seed things that
00:06:51,00:06:54,"would appear later in the story, so maybe he did do it."
00:06:54,00:06:55,"We didn't even know that Edwin Druid died, though."
00:06:55,00:06:56,"No, we don't."
00:06:56,00:06:59,"At the time the book ends, he has just disappeared, he might come back."
00:06:59,00:07:03,"Most people at the time kind of thought that he was just, he hadn't died, didn't they?"
00:07:03,00:07:04,Yeah.
00:07:04,00:07:05,That was like prevailing theory at the time.
00:07:05,00:07:06,"Well, there's another character."
00:07:06,00:07:07,Did you mention him?
00:07:07,00:07:08,Dick Dachery.
00:07:08,00:07:09,Yeah.
00:07:09,00:07:10,I know.
00:07:10,00:07:14,That would mean so much more to me if I knew that the story was.
00:07:14,00:07:15,Have you guys read this?
00:07:15,00:07:16,I haven't.
00:07:16,00:07:17,I started reading it today and I was too hung up.
00:07:17,00:07:18,I got about five pages.
00:07:18,00:07:19,I would have thought you would.
00:07:19,00:07:20,"Anna, because you read loads of Dickens."
00:07:20,00:07:31,"I chose not to read the one that's only half finished, but I do really want to now, partly"
00:07:31,00:07:35,"because people say that it's so impossible to work out what might have happened, like"
00:07:35,00:07:38,there was one woman who adapted it for the BBC and she had to finish it a few years
00:07:38,00:07:39,ago.
00:07:39,00:07:42,"And she said, a lot of people know that Dickens didn't finish Erwin Druid."
00:07:42,00:07:47,"What they don't know is that he died intentionally so that he didn't have to, because he literally"
00:07:47,00:07:51,had no idea how to tie up all these new sets.
00:07:51,00:07:52,Stephen King hasn't unfinished work.
00:07:52,00:07:55,"Now, he's still alive, obviously, but he hasn't unfinished work."
00:07:55,00:08:01,Is it just a thing he's working on at the moment?
00:08:01,00:08:02,It's called The Plant.
00:08:02,00:08:03,"Oh, yeah."
00:08:03,00:08:06,"It's a really interesting experiment he did, so he published it chapter by chapter online"
00:08:06,00:08:07,just like Dickens.
00:08:07,00:08:11,"And he asked people to pay for it online, a dollar per chapter."
00:08:11,00:08:15,"And he said, if the number of people paying for this dips below 75% of the people who are downloading"
00:08:15,00:08:18,"it and reading it, then I will stop writing it."
00:08:18,00:08:21,And that's exactly what happened after about five chapters.
00:08:21,00:08:22,Really?
00:08:22,00:08:27,"Yeah, so some people were really annoyed, because they'd paid six or seven dollars and they"
00:08:27,00:08:31,"didn't get a finished story, but by part four, only 46% of people who downloaded it were"
00:08:31,00:08:32,paying for it.
00:08:32,00:08:33,Really?
00:08:33,00:08:34,Is it bad?
00:08:34,00:08:35,Have you looked at it?
00:08:35,00:08:36,I haven't.
00:08:36,00:08:37,Do you know what it's about?
00:08:37,00:08:39,It's an author who I think receives a creepy gift of a plant.
00:08:39,00:08:42,"I mean, it doesn't exactly sound like a shining dog."
00:08:42,00:08:43,Yeah.
00:08:43,00:08:47,"No, I've heard it's very good, and it was just for that reason."
00:08:47,00:08:51,He was testing the internet model of commerce.
00:08:51,00:08:55,"It didn't work for him, but he did release, if you remember, his book The Green Mile, which"
00:08:55,00:08:58,"was transformed, was made into a movie."
00:08:58,00:08:59,Transformed.
00:08:59,00:09:01,Logistically into the film.
00:09:01,00:09:04,"We don't have the book anymore, because it was transformed into a film."
00:09:04,00:09:06,"Transformed into the film, transform it."
00:09:06,00:09:10,"So, The Green Mile, he did that with the Dickens model as well."
00:09:10,00:09:15,"He put out single chapters, and because the idea was, Dickens always used to end on a cliffhanger,"
00:09:15,00:09:16,"and he thought, could I do that?"
00:09:16,00:09:20,And could I generate a whole book where I was forcing myself month by month to reveal the
00:09:20,00:09:21,next chapter?
00:09:21,00:09:22,"And yeah, so that's what The Green Mile is."
00:09:22,00:09:26,"There's one book that we'll never read, so I looked at it a bit on published novels."
00:09:26,00:09:27,"Oh, yeah."
00:09:27,00:09:32,"And Evelyn War wrote his first novel, actually, called The Temple at Thatch in 1925."
00:09:32,00:09:38,"And then he gave a draft to his friend, Harold Ackton, and Ackton gave it quite bad review."
00:09:38,00:09:43,"So, he wrote a letter to Evelyn War, suggesting that he'd do it in a few elegant copies for"
00:09:43,00:09:47,"the friends who really love you, and then he gave a list of the suggested friends, and"
00:09:47,00:09:48,they were all the idiots they knew.
00:09:48,00:09:54,"And Evelyn War was so upset by this, so devastated that he walked down to the sea, he took"
00:09:54,00:09:58,"all his clothes off, he left a note with a Euripides quote about how the sea can wash"
00:09:58,00:10:03,"away all ills, and then he swam into the sea intending to commit suicide, and he was stung"
00:10:03,00:10:06,"by a jellyfish, so he gave up and returned ashore."
00:10:06,00:10:07,Wow.
00:10:07,00:10:11,"So, yeah, it was for a jellyfish."
00:10:11,00:10:13,We would not have Bride said revisited.
00:10:13,00:10:17,"You don't hear people taking off all their clothes and going into the sea these days, do"
00:10:17,00:10:18,you?
00:10:18,00:10:19,"No, it used to be."
00:10:19,00:10:20,"No, that used to be a thing, didn't it?"
00:10:20,00:10:21,I think so.
00:10:21,00:10:25,"Craig Venter, who's famous for sequencing DNA, he did that as well."
00:10:25,00:10:31,"He, I think he was fighting in the Vietnam War, and he wasn't a clever tactic, was it?"
00:10:31,00:10:35,"Right, what we'll do is we'll all leave our clothes at the shore, they'll think they've"
00:10:35,00:10:36,won.
00:10:36,00:10:38,"Actually, we've gone around in a big boat."
00:10:38,00:10:42,"No, he, that's not what happened Andy."
00:10:42,00:10:43,"You weren't there, man."
00:10:43,00:10:44,"Yeah, you weren't there, man."
00:10:44,00:10:47,"No, he got very depressed, and he swam out to sea."
00:10:47,00:10:51,"I think he did exactly that, took all of his clothes off, and then while he was quite"
00:10:51,00:10:55,"far out, he suddenly had an epithet that he wanted to live and that he had, he wanted to do"
00:10:55,00:10:59,"well in science and so on, and he turned around to come back, and that supposedly is the big"
00:10:59,00:11:03,"problem when you swim too far out, and people have a change of mind."
00:11:03,00:11:06,You're too far out to have the energy to swim all the way back.
00:11:06,00:11:10,"And so he said that was the hardest struggle of anything, but yeah, because he lost all"
00:11:10,00:11:11,his energy.
00:11:11,00:11:15,"And then in this moment of sort of near death, he realized he wanted to live."
00:11:15,00:11:17,You don't have into Terry Pratchett's unfinished works.
00:11:17,00:11:21,I think he had about ten novels on the go at the time he died in sort of in various stages
00:11:21,00:11:25,"of completion, obviously, so so much place in the others, but they were crushed by a steam"
00:11:25,00:11:26,roller after he died.
00:11:26,00:11:27,"Oh, by accident?"
00:11:27,00:11:28,"No, it was deliberate."
00:11:28,00:11:29,All right.
00:11:29,00:11:32,He decreed in his world that he wanted them to be crushed by a steam roller.
00:11:32,00:11:33,But it's paper.
00:11:33,00:11:34,"No, it's a hard time."
00:11:34,00:11:35,"No, it's a hard time."
00:11:35,00:11:36,He's got it.
00:11:36,00:11:37,"Yeah, yeah."
00:11:37,00:11:38,Yeah.
00:11:38,00:11:41,"I mean, how's this piece of paper?"
00:11:41,00:11:44,"Oh no, this piece of paper is completely flammable."
00:11:44,00:11:50,"It's done by a vintage steam roller or a steam fair, and it was called Lord Jericho, the"
00:11:50,00:11:51,steam roller.
00:11:51,00:11:52,Sounds quite cool.
00:11:52,00:11:53,Good name for a steam roller.
00:11:53,00:11:54,"Yeah, it is."
00:11:54,00:11:55,Yeah.
00:11:55,00:11:59,"And it's now, it was done as part of a celebration of opening of an exhibition for all his work,"
00:11:59,00:12:03,"and that's now part of the exhibition, his broken hard drive."
00:12:03,00:12:07,"I think Dickens didn't know what happened to the end of Edwin Druid, because I didn't realize"
00:12:07,00:12:12,"that the ending of great expectations, I think quite famously originally was different,"
00:12:12,00:12:16,"which is so satisfying, because it's always been kind of an annoying ending where spoilers"
00:12:16,00:12:18,guys close your ears if you haven't read it.
00:12:18,00:12:24,"So Estella and Pip obviously end up together, quite abruptly at the end, sort of end up together."
00:12:24,00:12:27,"They walk off into the sun set together and the last line is something like, I saw no"
00:12:27,00:12:31,"more shadow of her leaving my side, something like that."
00:12:31,00:12:35,"But in his original one, he properly sent it off to the publishers and stuff, and they'd"
00:12:35,00:12:39,"split up Estella heard, she was widowed, she then married someone else, they had a little"
00:12:39,00:12:43,"meeting and he went, oh how sad, I guess we'll never be together."
00:12:43,00:12:48,"And then he sent that to the publishers, went on holiday with his mate, who was a guy called"
00:12:48,00:12:53,"Edward Bulla-Litten, and went on holiday with him, showed him this, and he's his friend said,"
00:12:53,00:12:56,"that's too miserable, you've got to change it immediately."
00:12:56,00:13:00,"And so he immediately, quickly, hurriedly changed it and had them end up together."
00:13:00,00:13:04,"It's quite good as an author, if someone says that's crap, you need to change it to actually"
00:13:04,00:13:05,"do it, isn't it?"
00:13:05,00:13:06,I know.
00:13:06,00:13:09,"He would have just gone, nope, salt off mate, yeah."
00:13:09,00:13:13,"Bulla-Litten was kind of the leading author of his time and his word, no one really reads"
00:13:13,00:13:17,"him anymore, but he came up with the phrases, the great unwashed and the pen is mightier"
00:13:17,00:13:18,than the sword.
00:13:18,00:13:20,Two phrases I use every day.
00:13:20,00:13:25,"Andy, why don't you not get on the bus?"
00:13:25,00:13:29,"Because I haven't had my show yet, and so I am feeling a bit like the great unwashed."
00:13:29,00:13:30,Okay.
00:13:30,00:13:33,That's never the context in which it is.
00:13:33,00:13:38,You're just using non-metaphorically idiotic.
00:13:38,00:13:40,Why are you attacking that person with a pen?
00:13:40,00:13:44,"Well, the thing is James, the pen is mightier than the sword, right?"
00:13:44,00:13:48,"My sword is absolutely tiny, but I've had this special novelty samurai pen belt."
00:13:48,00:13:52,I could take your head off.
00:13:52,00:14:00,"Okay, is time for fact number two, and that is Chazinski."
00:14:00,00:14:06,"My fact this week is that in the past 10 years, the number of registered pinball players worldwide"
00:14:06,00:14:10,"has gone from 500 to over 100,000."
00:14:10,00:14:12,That's a big increase.
00:14:12,00:14:13,It's a big jump.
00:14:13,00:14:14,How?
00:14:14,00:14:15,People have got really into it.
00:14:15,00:14:17,Why do you have to register?
00:14:17,00:14:20,"You were allowed to play pinball without being officially registered, but then there is"
00:14:20,00:14:25,"the International Flip of Pinball Association, which is where you officially register if you"
00:14:25,00:14:28,want to take part in competitions or just be recognised as a player.
00:14:28,00:14:34,"I think it was measured by them in 2006, and there were 500 official players, and then NBC"
00:14:34,00:14:36,"reported last year, there were over 100,000."
00:14:36,00:14:38,And this is huge comeback.
00:14:38,00:14:41,Do you have to sign the register of pinballers?
00:14:41,00:14:42,What do you mean?
00:14:42,00:14:45,"Well, just normally when there's a register, you have to sign the register."
00:14:45,00:14:46,Do you?
00:14:46,00:14:47,Yeah.
00:14:47,00:14:48,No.
00:14:48,00:14:50,"You don't have to sign the sex offender's register, do you?"
00:14:50,00:14:52,"Well, I don't know, but that's..."
00:14:52,00:14:56,Why have you got special circumstances?
00:14:56,00:14:59,"But in the register at school, they just say your name, and you say here."
00:14:59,00:15:00,Yeah.
00:15:00,00:15:01,That's true.
00:15:01,00:15:02,But they don't do that.
00:15:02,00:15:03,That's not a register of pinballers.

00:18:10,00:18:13,I kind of thought that maybe it was a game of luck.
00:18:13,00:18:14,That's absolutely right.
00:18:14,00:18:17,This band was absolutely mad.
00:18:17,00:18:19,"So, Mayor La Guardia, Fiorrello La Guardia,"
00:18:19,00:18:22,who the main airport in New York is named after now.
00:18:22,00:18:24,He said that people who pushed pinball
00:18:24,00:18:27,were slimy crews of tin horns well dressed
00:18:27,00:18:29,and living in luxury on penny thievery.
00:18:29,00:18:31,He was photographed with a sled chair
00:18:31,00:18:33,and a smashing up pinball machines.
00:18:33,00:18:36,He ordered the police to make prohibition-style raids
00:18:36,00:18:39,on pinball machines their top priority.
00:18:39,00:18:41,Top priority. New York.
00:18:41,00:18:44,It was 1942 as well. Total war.
00:18:44,00:18:46,It was the methamphetamine of its day.
00:18:46,00:18:49,"Yeah, but they did ritualistic things to the pinball machines."
00:18:49,00:18:50,So he said...
00:18:50,00:18:56,"Basically, they said it was a waste of metals,"
00:18:56,00:18:58,which could be turned into elements and bullets.
00:18:58,00:19:01,"So, 5,000 machines were confiscated and destroyed."
00:19:01,00:19:03,They were dumped into Long Island Sound.
00:19:03,00:19:05,But the metal in the balls was confiscated
00:19:05,00:19:08,"and supposedly it was enough to build four 2,000 pound bombs."
00:19:08,00:19:13,And the police carved the pinball table legs into cudgles
00:19:13,00:19:15,and presented them to Mayor La Guardia.
00:19:15,00:19:18,"But then they dropped the bomb on some enemies,"
00:19:18,00:19:20,but they just flexed it away.
00:19:20,00:19:23,That's what the damn busters was basically.
00:19:23,00:19:25,And the...
00:19:25,00:19:28,"Basically, even though it was illegal, they still used them."
00:19:28,00:19:30,They just moved them to pornography shops.
00:19:30,00:19:32,Right.
00:19:32,00:19:36,"So, if you wanted to play pinball, you had to go to a pornography shop."
00:19:36,00:19:39,"So you'd send your 7-year-old like, ""Okay, you can play the game."""
00:19:39,00:19:40,But...
00:19:40,00:19:42,"God, that's terrible."
00:19:42,00:19:43,That's very funny idea.
00:19:43,00:19:45,"Yeah, that's amazing."
00:19:45,00:19:46,Very distracting.
00:19:46,00:19:48,"It would be much harder to focus, I think, on your pinball game,"
00:19:48,00:19:50,if you're surrounded by porn.
00:19:50,00:19:51,"Yeah, that's true."
00:19:51,00:19:56,Maybe if I ever join this association and do it professionally.
00:19:56,00:19:58,"Yeah, I can see you doing that."
00:19:58,00:20:01,"Then when the other guys are playing, I'm just going to put porn into it."
00:20:01,00:20:03,I'm trying to make it like the 40s for you.
00:20:03,00:20:05,It's this classic pinball.
00:20:05,00:20:07,I really like La Guardia.
00:20:07,00:20:09,"As in, I've never really..."
00:20:09,00:20:11,I've known his name through the airport.
00:20:11,00:20:12,I didn't know he was the mayor.
00:20:12,00:20:13,I had no idea.
00:20:13,00:20:17,"And I saw photos of him, and he looks like a mafia Batman villain."
00:20:17,00:20:19,"Like, he looks amazing."
00:20:19,00:20:21,"So I thought, ""Okay, I'll just quickly look into him."""
00:20:21,00:20:24,So they're all this stuff of him being against the pinballing
00:20:24,00:20:27,and sledgehammering and the prohibition-style raids.
00:20:27,00:20:30,He was someone who was sort of kind of against the alcoholic prohibition
00:20:30,00:20:33,that was going on and actively protested it.
00:20:33,00:20:35,And so he invited 20 newspaper reporters
00:20:35,00:20:38,"to his congressional office in Washington, DC."
00:20:38,00:20:40,"And there, he drank it in front of them."
00:20:40,00:20:43,"And he had a beer that was admittedly, it had low alcohol."
00:20:43,00:20:45,So I think it was almost on the edge of legality.
00:20:45,00:20:48,And he mixed it with some tonic.
00:20:48,00:20:51,And he drank it in front of the reporters with a straight face
00:20:51,00:20:52,"to say, ""Look at this."""
00:20:52,00:20:54,I just think that's really pathetic.
00:20:54,00:20:56,I think if you're going to make a statement by drinking beer
00:20:56,00:20:59,"during prohibition, don't drink low alcohol beer."
00:20:59,00:21:00,This was tonic.
00:21:00,00:21:01,I just have a proper point.
00:21:01,00:21:04,I can just see you if there's prohibition in this country.
00:21:04,00:21:08,"And you're an MP, drinking a full bottle of gin"
00:21:08,00:21:10,on the steps of the House of Commons.
00:21:10,00:21:13,This is the point I am making.
00:21:13,00:21:14,What was I saying?
00:21:14,00:21:17,Where are my keys?
00:21:17,00:21:19,"Okay, so given that pinball was banned for such a long time,"
00:21:19,00:21:20,this is a nice thing.
00:21:20,00:21:24,"The Museum of Pinball is in a place called ""Banning"" in California."
00:21:24,00:21:25,That's very good.
00:21:25,00:21:26,That's really good.
00:21:26,00:21:29,And I think the guy who won the World Championships last year
00:21:29,00:21:30,was 13 years old.
00:21:30,00:21:33,So this is a guy called Esha Lefkov.
00:21:33,00:21:35,"And he plays it with his dad, I think."
00:21:35,00:21:37,But it really is attracting all ages.
00:21:37,00:21:40,"It's one's just opened up in London, actually."
00:21:40,00:21:44,"In December 2017, we've got our first proper devoted pinball."
00:21:44,00:21:45,Let's go.
00:21:45,00:21:46,I think we definitely should go.
00:21:46,00:21:47,That's cool.
00:21:47,00:21:48,Oh.
00:21:48,00:21:49,Yeah.
00:21:49,00:21:51,We'll put on the back burner.
00:21:51,00:21:53,Do you know what a gobble hole is?
00:21:53,00:21:54,Nope.
00:21:54,00:21:56,I think I do.
00:21:56,00:22:01,It's just a hole in the playing field of a pinball machine
00:22:01,00:22:04,which the ball can fall and ending that hole.
00:22:04,00:22:05,That's rough.
00:22:05,00:22:08,That's a mean move to have in the middle of a pinball.
00:22:08,00:22:10,I think the ball can fall down.
00:22:10,00:22:12,Do you know what a thrust magnet is?
00:22:12,00:22:14,A thrust magnet.
00:22:14,00:22:16,These are all names of magazines
00:22:16,00:22:19,that used to surround the pinball machines in there.
00:22:19,00:22:22,A thrust magnet is just an electromagnet
00:22:22,00:22:25,that accelerates the ball through a tube.
00:22:25,00:22:26,Okay.
00:22:26,00:22:28,Do you know what a drain automatic is?
00:22:28,00:22:29,No.
00:22:29,00:22:31,I've got 300 of these.
00:22:31,00:22:32,"Yeah, yeah."
00:22:32,00:22:33,I'll just keep going until we get one.
00:22:33,00:22:35,"No, a drain automatic is a pinball game"
00:22:35,00:22:37,where the balls are lost too easily.
00:22:37,00:22:39,So it's like you just keep losing all the time
00:22:39,00:22:40,because your money comes.
00:22:40,00:22:41,"Oh, no."
00:22:41,00:22:42,Like when you go on a fruit machine
00:22:42,00:22:44,but someone's already won it loads
00:22:44,00:22:46,and so it just eats up all your money.
00:22:46,00:22:47,"Yeah, mine that."
00:22:47,00:22:48,Because it doesn't have any left.
00:22:48,00:22:50,"Damn, the cheating machines."
00:22:50,00:22:53,"In Japan, arcade games are very much more popular than they are here."
00:22:53,00:22:55,And they've got such a good array of them.
00:22:55,00:22:58,Have you guys come across the tablecloth hour game?
00:22:58,00:22:59,No.
00:22:59,00:23:00,I really like this.
00:23:00,00:23:01,It's an arcade game.
00:23:01,00:23:04,"But instead of coming like a joystick or buttons that you press,"
00:23:04,00:23:07,it's got a sticking out bit that's like the edge of a tablecloth
00:23:07,00:23:09,like something hanging over a table.
00:23:09,00:23:11,And then on the screen there's lots of crockery
00:23:11,00:23:14,and you just pull the tablecloth up.
00:23:14,00:23:15,That sounds really good.
00:23:15,00:23:17,And see if you can avoid breaking the crock.
00:23:17,00:23:18,That's incredible.
00:23:18,00:23:20,And then on that in real life tried to do that in real life.
00:23:20,00:23:21,"No, I didn't get that."
00:23:21,00:23:22,It's really hard.
00:23:22,00:23:23,Yeah.
00:23:23,00:23:24,Because I used to work in a restaurant.
00:23:24,00:23:25,I used to try all the time.
00:23:25,00:23:26,"Not for long, I bet."
00:23:26,00:23:30,Your wages were dogged every week.
00:23:30,00:23:33,Bolton smasher fired from 10th restaurant in a row.
00:23:33,00:23:36,But of course you have lots of crockery
00:23:36,00:23:39,and you have tablecloths of what else you're going to do
00:23:39,00:23:40,if you're a teenager.
00:23:40,00:23:41,You're going to try it.
00:23:41,00:23:42,Can it really be done?
00:23:42,00:23:44,"I guess it can be done if you're really, really fast, right?"
00:23:44,00:23:47,It could be done like for just one object.
00:23:47,00:23:48,You could kind of do it.
00:23:48,00:23:51,"But more often than not, it would just go flying."
00:23:51,00:23:52,So funny.
00:23:52,00:23:55,Have we said before there's a Japanese arcade game
00:23:55,00:23:58,where you have to poke a robot bottom?
00:23:58,00:23:59,"Yes, with your finger."
00:23:59,00:24:00,Yes.
00:24:00,00:24:02,This is a game where it's a sort of prank on your friend
00:24:02,00:24:04,to stick your finger at the bottom.
00:24:04,00:24:05,Yeah.
00:24:05,00:24:07,Because there is a prank in Japan known as the enumer.
00:24:07,00:24:09,I can't remember what their word for it is.
00:24:09,00:24:11,And you go through all the different games
00:24:11,00:24:13,and you have to do it to the teacher
00:24:13,00:24:15,and then to the policeman and then someone else.
00:24:15,00:24:17,And the game is just to poke them in life.
00:24:17,00:24:18,In real life.
00:24:18,00:24:19,"No, it's a game."
00:24:19,00:24:20,"Oh, it's in the game."
00:24:20,00:24:21,But the prank is a real life thing.
00:24:21,00:24:22,Right.
00:24:22,00:24:23,It's like you know like a wet willy way.
00:24:23,00:24:24,You put your finger in someone's ear.
00:24:24,00:24:25,"It's like that, but with an anus."
00:24:25,00:24:26,For the anus.
00:24:26,00:24:29,"It's much harder to shove your finger up someone's anus, I think."
00:24:29,00:24:30,Yeah.
00:24:30,00:24:31,Especially when everyone's wearing clothes.
00:24:31,00:24:32,Also.
00:24:32,00:24:35,You say the words wet willy before you do it as well.
00:24:35,00:24:36,Sounds a bit bad.
00:24:36,00:24:37,Yeah.
00:24:37,00:24:40,I think you're all going to have to sign the register.
00:24:40,00:24:50,"Okay, as time to move on to fact number three."
00:24:50,00:24:51,And that is James.
00:24:51,00:24:53,"Okay, my fact this week is that the Victorians"
00:24:53,00:24:56,had better reaction times than we do today.
00:24:56,00:24:58,Did they?
00:24:58,00:24:59,What?
00:24:59,00:25:02,Did they?
00:25:02,00:25:05,"That's a good question, Ella, because did they?"
00:25:05,00:25:08,"The thing is, some people think they may have done."
00:25:08,00:25:09,Okay.
00:25:09,00:25:13,"And this is because we have, we can work out what people's"
00:25:13,00:25:16,reactions times are now by doing studies and stuff.
00:25:16,00:25:20,"And we have some old results done by friend of the podcast,"
00:25:20,00:25:22,"Francis Goulton, who you talk about lots of times."
00:25:22,00:25:26,"I mean, Major Eugenics is probably an acquaintance of the podcast, I'd say."
00:25:26,00:25:30,"But it was in a time when Eugenics was cool, wasn't it?"
00:25:30,00:25:31,"Yeah, it was."
00:25:31,00:25:33,"Which is not now, of course."
00:25:33,00:25:37,But his statistics show that people who he studied
00:25:37,00:25:40,had quicker reactions than people today.
00:25:40,00:25:44,And so it could be that his data are wrong.
00:25:44,00:25:48,Or it could be that people have gotten less quick.
00:25:48,00:25:49,Yeah.
00:25:49,00:25:51,"And a lot of, which do you think it is?"
00:25:51,00:25:54,I think people have come up with reasons why it might be that we're slower.
00:25:54,00:25:57,Like maybe there's a lot more contaminants in the air
00:25:57,00:26:00,and your brains have got more mercury in them or whatever.
00:26:00,00:26:03,Your brains have got more stuff in them that are making them slower.
00:26:03,00:26:04,"Oh, wow."
00:26:04,00:26:06,There are a lot of serious people who think this is true.
00:26:06,00:26:07,Yeah.
00:26:07,00:26:09,"And my favorite one is in the 20th century,"
00:26:09,00:26:13,"there was a scholar called Erwin W. Silverman, who believed the reason"
00:26:13,00:26:16,that we got slower reactions is because hype has increased.
00:26:16,00:26:20,"Therefore, it's taken longer for things to travel to the brain or from the brain."
00:26:20,00:26:22,So it's that extra bit of time.
00:26:22,00:26:25,Does that not sort of make sense a bit?
00:26:25,00:26:27,I think they found that tall people are just as fast.
00:26:27,00:26:28,"Oh, okay."
00:26:28,00:26:29,Yeah.
00:26:29,00:26:32,"But like from work, as most reactions are based on you seeing something"
00:26:32,00:26:35,and responding to it and your eyes don't get further from your brain
00:26:35,00:26:36,as you get taller.
00:26:36,00:26:37,Yeah.
00:26:37,00:26:38,"No, that's true."
00:26:38,00:26:41,I wonder if someone starts on your foot.
00:26:41,00:26:44,"Maybe it takes you a bit longer now to back away,"
00:26:44,00:26:46,but it doesn't make sense at all.
00:26:46,00:26:48,I will track my earlier comment.
00:26:48,00:26:50,"Actually, I don't think that does make sense."
00:26:50,00:26:55,My favorite guy who studied this was the 93rd most cited psychologist
00:26:55,00:26:56,of the 20th century.
00:26:56,00:26:58,He is called Edwin Boring.
00:26:58,00:27:01,He's my favorite psychologist.
00:27:01,00:27:03,I just love him.
00:27:03,00:27:05,"One day, maybe we'll talk about him."
00:27:05,00:27:09,But his most famous thing that he did was work out one reason
00:27:09,00:27:14,why moons look bigger when they're on the horizon than when they're up in the sky.
00:27:14,00:27:15,"Oh, yeah."
00:27:15,00:27:18,I just like the idea that he was cited in so many papers
00:27:18,00:27:20,because his name was Boring.
00:27:20,00:27:21,I think he must be.
00:27:21,00:27:24,People slagging him off indirectly by just putting a little asterisk
00:27:24,00:27:27,"in at the bottom saying, ""Boring!"""
00:27:27,00:27:30,I read that one of the things to help.
00:27:30,00:27:34,This is done a team of Japanese scientists and researchers
00:27:34,00:27:36,"came out with these results saying,"
00:27:36,00:27:40,"""A way of getting your reactions to be better is to chew gum."""
00:27:40,00:27:42,Which is really interesting.
00:27:42,00:27:44,"Yeah, I'd not heard that before."
00:27:44,00:27:49,They did this experiment where they said that chewing on gum
00:27:49,00:27:52,"improves the participants' reaction time by 7%,"
00:27:52,00:27:55,which is an average of 36 milliseconds.
00:27:55,00:27:57,"It doesn't sound like a lot,"
00:27:57,00:28:01,"but it is made that in, say, like, sport where it takes less than half a second"
00:28:01,00:28:04,for a baseball pitcher to pitch a ball to the mitt.
00:28:04,00:28:07,That's obviously a huge amount of time.
00:28:07,00:28:11,So what they say is that it only takes 10 seconds of chewing
00:28:11,00:28:15,to activate the brain regions that are responsible for improving your reactions.
00:28:15,00:28:17,"And after you've done the 10 seconds,"
00:28:17,00:28:19,it keeps it active for 15 minutes.
00:28:19,00:28:20,Wow.
00:28:20,00:28:23,You buy 15 minutes of extra reaction time of 10 seconds of chewing gum.
00:28:23,00:28:25,You are chewing steroids.
00:28:25,00:28:29,"Congratulations, by the way, on the Tour de France win, Dan."
00:28:29,00:28:31,Do we know what the mechanism is?
00:28:31,00:28:35,Is it that chewing saliva means that you're...
00:28:35,00:28:37,"According to this, it says,"
00:28:37,00:28:41,"""Your jaw muscles, when you chew, stimulate certain regions of your brain,"
00:28:41,00:28:43,"including the pre-mator cortex."""
00:28:43,00:28:45,Mmm. Okay.
00:28:45,00:28:47,What do you mean? That sounds like science.
00:28:47,00:28:51,I got it from science.com.
00:28:51,00:28:57,"So, on reaction times, you know the thing of gum fights in films,"
00:28:57,00:28:59,"where there are two cowboys facing each other,"
00:28:59,00:29:03,and obviously the bad guy draws first because he uses an evil trickster
00:29:03,00:29:06,"and he's trying to legitimately gain an advantage of the gum fight by shooting first,"
00:29:06,00:29:09,and then the good guy draws second but always wins.
00:29:09,00:29:12,"So, Nils Ball, one of the most famous physicists of all time,"
00:29:12,00:29:16,"was obsessed with this, and he theorized that gunslingers who draw second,"
00:29:16,00:29:19,they draw faster because they're not thinking.
00:29:19,00:29:21,"It's just, it's an instinctive reaction."
00:29:21,00:29:23,It's like a separate circuit that works.
00:29:23,00:29:25,It's almost like a reflex reaction.
00:29:25,00:29:29,Interesting. And he staged mock duels with toy guns at his lab
00:29:29,00:29:32,"in between all the other important stuff he was doing,"
00:29:32,00:29:35,"and his partner, George Gamau, drew first and lost every time."
00:29:35,00:29:39,"However, it's recently been proved by a University of Birmingham study"
00:29:39,00:29:43,"that he was partially right, but it wouldn't quite help."
00:29:43,00:29:45,"So, if you draw second, if you draw responding to..."
00:29:45,00:29:49,"If I'm facing you, Anna, and you draw, I see you drawing and I draw first."
00:29:49,00:29:53,You're about 10% faster when you draw second than when you draw first.
00:29:53,00:29:56,But the difference that it would make is only 21 milliseconds.
00:29:56,00:29:57,That's enough.
00:29:57,00:29:58,"And is that not, yeah?"
00:29:58,00:30:01,"If someone's already pulled the gun on you, it's likely that you won't be able to..."
00:30:01,00:30:07,"I will be 21 milliseconds faster, but the gap in time between Anna starting and me starting"
00:30:07,00:30:11,"will still be longer than 21 milliseconds, so I'll still die."
00:30:11,00:30:16,"So, the scientist who studied this, Andrew Welchman, he said, ""You'll die satisfied that you are quicker,"
00:30:16,00:30:17,"but that's not much to you."""
00:30:17,00:30:21,"I don't understand how if you're using fake guns, not real guns,"
00:30:21,00:30:24,you can tell who got hit first.
00:30:24,00:30:25,I think they kind of had a...
00:30:25,00:30:26,It's a paintball.
00:30:26,00:30:27,A paintball or something.
00:30:27,00:30:28,Paintballs.
00:30:28,00:30:30,You know the paintballs are edible.
00:30:30,00:30:34,"So, if you got a shot in the mouth, you're laughing."
00:30:34,00:30:36,"Yeah, and you're pulled."
00:30:36,00:30:37,It's just...
00:30:37,00:30:38,Are they not edible?
00:30:38,00:30:40,"No, they're really not nice."
00:30:40,00:30:46,"They're made of food coloring, and the outer shell is some kind of plant-based material."
00:30:46,00:30:51,"After you were fired from every restaurant in Bolton, James actually went to work at a paintball place"
00:30:51,00:30:54,from when she was sacked by eating the ammo.
00:30:54,00:30:59,You got to get away with it because you just had red stuff on the radio now.
00:30:59,00:31:00,No.
00:31:00,00:31:07,"Well, that by the way, the only two scientists we've cited so far are boring and boring."
00:31:07,00:31:14,"So, other reaction time things in running races."
00:31:14,00:31:20,"If you're doing a sprinting race, then if you move within 0.1 seconds of the starting gun going off,"
00:31:20,00:31:24,"that counts as a full start, so even if you move after the starting gun going off,"
00:31:24,00:31:27,you've made a full start because it's thought that...
00:31:27,00:31:31,"Well, it's known that you can't possibly have reacted that fast to the gun going off."
00:31:31,00:31:34,"So, you must have started before you heard it go off."
00:31:34,00:31:40,But that 0.1 is based on an experiment that was done in 1865 and it still stands today.
00:31:40,00:31:45,"So, it was done in 1865 by a scientist called Franciscus Cornelis Dondas,"
00:31:45,00:31:47,who was actually an ophthalmologist.
00:31:47,00:31:50,"But he also worked out reaction times, he gave electric shocks to people's feet,"
00:31:50,00:31:54,and then he had them squeeze stuff with their hands with the corresponding hand.
00:31:54,00:31:57,"And it was how quick it was for people to go, ""Oh, fuck you!"""
00:31:57,00:31:59,And they took it with my feet!
00:31:59,00:32:06,"The interesting thing about that was really, really short people actually reacted much, much faster than really tall people."
00:32:06,00:32:10,"Which is why the best sprinters are so short. Look at his own boat, he's only three foot nine."
00:32:10,00:32:14,I spent all day on the internet just testing my reaction time.
00:32:14,00:32:18,And I agree that I don't think you can get quicker than 0.1 seconds.
00:32:18,00:32:20,"Right, it's kind of impossible."
00:32:20,00:32:21,Because you can't.
00:32:21,00:32:24,"Well, it's so far away from my best."
00:32:24,00:32:26,It's hard to imagine anyone.
00:32:26,00:32:29,You're on eight or nine seconds.
00:32:29,00:32:32,"Look, we had a very heavy night last night."
00:32:32,00:32:35,"Can I just add a little bit of a trivia about Dondas, which I quite like."
00:32:35,00:32:38,"He's apparently also known very well in the world of dentistry,"
00:32:38,00:32:41,"as well as being an ophthalmologist and a reaction time experimenter,"
00:32:41,00:32:45,"because he named the space between the Dawson, the back of your tongue,"
00:32:45,00:32:49,"and the hard palate, so the gap when you're at rest between the back of your tongue"
00:32:49,00:32:52,and the roof of your mouth is called the space of Dondas.
00:32:52,00:32:53,Cool!
00:32:53,00:32:55,"Wow, that's very cool. That's awesome."
00:32:55,00:32:56,I know.
00:32:56,00:32:59,"Andy, you mentioned Usain Bolt a second ago."
00:32:59,00:33:01,I was looking into Sprinters as well.
00:33:01,00:33:06,And there's an article written by this guy who claims that Usain Bolt could have broken
00:33:06,00:33:11,"his world record speed times for the 100 meters, not by running faster."
00:33:11,00:33:14,He could have run at the consistent time that he was doing and still beat it.
00:33:14,00:33:16,It was his starting point.
00:33:16,00:33:18,It was his reaction to the gun.
00:33:18,00:33:20,"He's famously as a slow start, doesn't he?"
00:33:20,00:33:21,Incredibly slow start.
00:33:21,00:33:27,"So when he was in the Beijing Olympics, he was the slowest of all the finalists to leave."
00:33:27,00:33:29,What do you call it?
00:33:29,00:33:31,The starting blocks.
00:33:31,00:33:36,"So this guy worked out that at Beijing, his starting time, his reaction was 0.165."
00:33:36,00:33:41,"If he was able to bring that down to 0.13, he would have brought his world record"
00:33:41,00:33:46,"from 9.58 to 9.56, so he would have shaved two milliseconds off that."
00:33:46,00:33:48,And that's not even a hard one to get.
00:33:48,00:33:52,That's sort of your average finalist will sprint at that speed off the starting blocks.
00:33:52,00:33:57,"And the reason is, so if you go online now, if you're listening to this and you try these games,"
00:33:57,00:34:02,"where it's like you're looking at it and it changes color and you have to press the button as quickly as you can,"
00:34:02,00:34:05,it's different to seeing things as to hearing things.
00:34:05,00:34:09,"And I think you're quicker at hearing things than you are at seeing things, I believe."
00:34:09,00:34:10,"Yes, you are."
00:34:10,00:34:14,So your audio response time is usually lower than your...
00:34:14,00:34:15,"Yeah, that's true."
00:34:15,00:34:17,I know a really weird thing about audio response times.
00:34:17,00:34:20,So athletes who are closer to the starting gun do better.
00:34:20,00:34:22,"Now, that's partly because you're closer."
00:34:22,00:34:28,"So you get an advantage of about 15 milliseconds in the closest lane compared with all the other lanes on average, right?"
00:34:28,00:34:29,That's quite a lot.
00:34:29,00:34:32,"It is quite a lot, but there's another reason for this."
00:34:32,00:34:36,"Sorry, just to say, I thought they had speakers behind the blocks."
00:34:36,00:34:38,"I think you're right, they now have speakers behind the blocks."
00:34:38,00:34:42,So this was in races where you would have just one gun at the side being fired.
00:34:42,00:34:45,"But the weird thing is, it's not just that you're closer, it's that."
00:34:45,00:34:50,"The louder you hear the gunshot, the faster your reaction time, the volume hasn't effect."
00:34:50,00:34:52,You react to loud noises faster.
00:34:52,00:34:54,"I think you're like scared of it, do you think?"
00:34:54,00:34:57,"I think it must be, because it's like an evolutionary thing."
00:34:57,00:34:58,Yeah.
00:34:58,00:34:59,How cool is that?
00:34:59,00:35:00,That's really cool.
00:35:00,00:35:02,"Otherwise, they wouldn't have to do it nearly as loud."
00:35:02,00:35:05,"So actually, it's an advantage in running a race if you have a big ear trumpet,"
00:35:05,00:35:07,which you carry next to your other starting blocks.
00:35:07,00:35:09,But do you think that's it?
00:35:09,00:35:12,"It's less than, by the fact, you have to carry your ear trumpet."
00:35:12,00:35:17,It never did me any home on school sports day.
00:35:17,00:35:19,"I was actually looking at if sports, because I was thinking,"
00:35:19,00:35:22,this thing about reaction time is sort of based on IQ.
00:35:22,00:35:25,"So a lot of people seem to think, or that's very contentious,"
00:35:25,00:35:28,that reaction time is related to IQ or how smart you are.
00:35:28,00:35:30,So the idea is that the Victorians might have been cleverer than us.
00:35:30,00:35:33,So I was thinking sports people often have very fast reactions
00:35:33,00:35:35,if you're like a table tennis player or something.
00:35:35,00:35:37,So I was wondering if they were cleverer.
00:35:37,00:35:38,"And this is a long window way of saying,"
00:35:38,00:35:42,"I ended up finding out that Marion Bartoli, who was my favorite tennis player for a while,"
00:35:42,00:35:44,has an IQ that is almost off the charts.
00:35:44,00:35:49,"So she has an IQ of 175, which as soon as you're over 140, then you're very bright."
00:35:49,00:35:51,"If you're over 160, you're proper genius."
00:35:51,00:35:53,And she's there.
00:35:53,00:35:57,"And she said, I'm not really someone that's into telling people about how smart I am."
00:35:57,00:35:59,I'm kind of trying to hide it.
00:35:59,00:36:01,And that's what she said to reporters.
00:36:01,00:36:03,When she published her IQ results.
00:36:03,00:36:06,"Not that smart, is she?"
00:36:06,00:36:13,There's a fly which has the fastest reaction time I think of any animal.
00:36:13,00:36:15,So it's called the Condola Stylus fly.
00:36:15,00:36:20,And it's so fast that it's almost impossible to take a photo of it lying still.
00:36:20,00:36:24,So it has a startle reflex of about two milliseconds.
00:36:24,00:36:25,And it's scared of cameras.
00:36:25,00:36:26,It's the flash.
00:36:26,00:36:27,It's scared of the flash.
00:36:27,00:36:29,So just do it without a flash.
00:36:29,00:36:31,"Well, yeah, you're okay."
00:36:31,00:36:32,"Well, that's this bit."
00:36:32,00:36:34,"Yeah, oh my god, fine."
00:36:34,00:36:37,It's got this reflex of about two milliseconds.
00:36:37,00:36:41,"So if you take a photo with a shutter speed of one two hundredth of a second,"
00:36:41,00:36:43,"which is a very fast shutter speed as they go,"
00:36:43,00:36:46,you will almost always capture it in flight because that's five milliseconds.
00:36:46,00:36:48,So nine out of ten times you take the picture.
00:36:48,00:36:50,You just get the flight in movement.
00:36:50,00:36:52,"You know how when you take a photo of a lot of people,"
00:36:52,00:36:55,there's always someone with their eyes kind of half closed.
00:36:55,00:36:56,Yeah.
00:36:56,00:37:00,"These guys, like if they want a family photo of all these flies."
00:37:00,00:37:03,It's just a blur.
00:37:03,00:37:06,The chances of them all be in there is pretty low.
00:37:06,00:37:09,"So there's a possible reason for it, which is that they're so brightly coloured."
00:37:09,00:37:11,They're really brightly coloured flies.
00:37:11,00:37:15,And we think this is because they are trying to teach predators not to bother trying to hunt them.
00:37:15,00:37:17,Because they always get away.
00:37:17,00:37:21,So they're trying to teach the predator to associate that bright colouring on them with...
00:37:21,00:37:23,"No, that doesn't make any sense."
00:37:23,00:37:27,"If you can really get away that fast, then you don't need something that warns them."
00:37:27,00:37:29,That sounds like they're bluffing.
00:37:29,00:37:31,"Like, honestly, don't worry about it."
00:37:31,00:37:32,It would be a waste of effort.
00:37:32,00:37:37,"But then again, like you get these really poisonous frogs, don't you, that are really brightly coloured."
00:37:37,00:37:39,"Yeah, they're all predators."
00:37:39,00:37:42,Why are they all thinking in the best interest of the predators?
00:37:42,00:37:46,"I'm a bit sweet, but..."
00:37:46,00:37:55,"Okay, it is time for our final fact of the show, and that is Andy."
00:37:55,00:37:59,My fact is that the first people to live on the moon might be cavemen.
00:37:59,00:38:00,Might be.
00:38:00,00:38:01,Might be.
00:38:01,00:38:02,Might not be.
00:38:02,00:38:04,"Yeah, my notes actually begin."
00:38:04,00:38:05,"Well, they might."
00:38:05,00:38:07,So why might they?
00:38:07,00:38:12,Because it's obviously going to be very uncomfortable living on the moon.
00:38:12,00:38:16,"No one's going to have a great time, but if we want to get into space and colonise somewhere,"
00:38:16,00:38:18,the moon is not a terrible candidate.
00:38:18,00:38:23,"And a Japanese space probe called Celine has just found a massive cave on the moon,"
00:38:23,00:38:26,which would solve a load of the problems of living on the moon.
00:38:26,00:38:28,It's 31 miles long.
00:38:28,00:38:29,It's 100 metres wide.
00:38:29,00:38:30,It's a huge cave.
00:38:30,00:38:34,We could get loads of lunar cities in there if we wanted to.
00:38:34,00:38:37,It's got a 31 miles by 100 metres.
00:38:37,00:38:38,"What did I say, sorry?"
00:38:38,00:38:39,"Yeah, no, you said that."
00:38:39,00:38:41,I just think you can't get that many cities.
00:38:41,00:38:42,You're still going to be a bit cramped.
00:38:42,00:38:46,"It's going to be small, and London is like what, 40 miles in diameter?"
00:38:46,00:38:47,"I guess, yeah."
00:38:47,00:38:49,But like the M25 is about that.
00:38:49,00:38:53,So just doing a bit of a Sleezier State Agent job here.
00:38:53,00:38:55,"It's very roomy, lovely."
00:38:55,00:39:00,You could put a partition wall in here if you wanted to.
00:39:00,00:39:03,So they think it's a lava tube created during volcanic activity.
00:39:03,00:39:07,"And the problem with living on the moon, one of many problems, is there are so many."
00:39:07,00:39:13,"But the temperature is 107 degrees Celsius in daytime, and minus 153 Celsius at night."
00:39:13,00:39:16,"So any equipment is going to have to deal with that, which is a real pain."
00:39:16,00:39:20,"And all the radiation from space, and all the asteroids hitting you all the time."
00:39:20,00:39:23,So it's not a great place to live.
00:39:23,00:39:26,"But if you're in a cave, you get much less radiation and the temperature."
00:39:26,00:39:30,There is no pinball in these tunnels.
00:39:30,00:39:33,"And until there is, I'm not going."
00:39:33,00:39:35,"Yeah, it's because the moon has no atmosphere, obviously."
00:39:35,00:39:37,So the reason that we're at this point...
00:39:37,00:39:39,Like I don't know.
00:39:39,00:39:41,"No, you drew first days."
00:39:41,00:39:44,All that reaction time practice you put in as paid off James.
00:39:44,00:39:47,You're miles ahead of me.
00:39:47,00:39:49,So the moon has no atmosphere.
00:39:49,00:39:51,It's temperature fluctuates massively.
00:39:51,00:39:57,So Earth's temperature is quite stable because the heat from the sun is dispersed a bit by the air particles.
00:39:57,00:39:59,But don't have it on the moon.
00:39:59,00:40:00,So the sun's not on you.
00:40:00,00:40:01,Then you say your eyes are cold.
00:40:01,00:40:02,It's a nightmare.
00:40:02,00:40:04,But I don't really understand this asteroid thing.
00:40:04,00:40:06,So asteroids hit the moon far more often.
00:40:06,00:40:08,They do make out like that's going to be a big issue.
00:40:08,00:40:09,Just little dies.
00:40:09,00:40:11,Like little asteroids that would kind of burn up.
00:40:11,00:40:14,Burn up in the Earth's atmosphere.
00:40:14,00:40:15,The little pebble.
00:40:15,00:40:17,"That would be quite awkward, wouldn't it?"
00:40:17,00:40:20,"Like I know they're small, but if you came hit by them all the time."
00:40:20,00:40:21,It's so annoying.
00:40:21,00:40:22,"Yeah, imagine."
00:40:22,00:40:25,"And the damage they can do, it's like with the stuff that's going around our planet."
00:40:25,00:40:30,"If it even something the size of a bullet hits the International Space Station,"
00:40:30,00:40:31,it could shatter it.
00:40:31,00:40:32,The speeds that they're going at.
00:40:32,00:40:35,"So yeah, I mean a bullet is traditionally a harmful thing to be hit by as well."
00:40:35,00:40:36,"Yeah, I know."
00:40:36,00:40:38,Even a bullet.
00:40:38,00:40:40,Let's imagine.
00:40:40,00:40:44,"One of the problems though, if you live inside one of these tubes,"
00:40:44,00:40:47,is that the moon constantly suffers from moon quakes.
00:40:47,00:40:52,I think they believe that these lava tubes can suffer a huge internal damage
00:40:52,00:40:54,"off the back of it, collapse and so on."
00:40:54,00:40:58,"Just with my estate agent's hat on, I'd like to say this one's absolutely fine."
00:40:58,00:41:01,"The previous tenants, no complaints."
00:41:01,00:41:04,Screaming from under the rubble.
00:41:04,00:41:07,And cosmic radiation is a problem on the moon.
00:41:07,00:41:09,And that's something that we're trying to deal with.
00:41:09,00:41:12,"So this is kind of, it gets hit by all sorts of stuff that we've talked about before."
00:41:12,00:41:16,"So the moon gets caught in the solar wind, the solar tail sometimes,"
00:41:16,00:41:19,and gets hit by all these damaging particles.
00:41:19,00:41:23,"And I think the lunar reconnaissance orbiter, which went up to the moon from NASA"
00:41:23,00:41:27,"a few years ago, sent a plastic replica of human skin,"
00:41:27,00:41:31,which measured how much damage this kind of radiation will do.
00:41:31,00:41:32,Wow.
00:41:32,00:41:34,And it worked out that it is quite a bit of damage.
00:41:34,00:41:35,So human bodies.
00:41:35,00:41:37,Why would we not just send up human skin?
00:41:37,00:41:40,"Because I think human skin's not alive, I guess."
00:41:40,00:41:41,"Oh, okay."
00:41:41,00:41:42,And maybe it's hard.
00:41:42,00:41:44,Maybe we send up a candle.
00:41:44,00:41:47,"Yes, because that is the perfect replica of the human body."
00:41:47,00:41:49,It's a plastic replica of human skin.
00:41:49,00:41:51,"Yeah, but then you won't see what happens to genitals."
00:41:51,00:41:52,"Oh, that's true."
00:41:52,00:41:57,"Which is important, because it might make you infertile if you have all this radiation"
00:41:57,00:41:58,passing through you.
00:41:58,00:41:59,Yeah.
00:41:59,00:42:03,"But a day on the moon is 14 Earth days and a night is 14 Earth nights,"
00:42:03,00:42:05,if you're on the equator.
00:42:05,00:42:06,"So it's just not going to be fun, isn't it?"
00:42:06,00:42:08,"Well, a nice long line in the morning."
00:42:08,00:42:09,"Yeah, that's true."
00:42:09,00:42:10,But then a long day at work.
00:42:10,00:42:11,"Oh, true."
00:42:11,00:42:14,"There's not that much work to do there, I don't think, yet."
00:42:14,00:42:16,"No, but why would anyone want to live on the moon?"
00:42:16,00:42:17,"Like, what is the point?"
00:42:17,00:42:21,"Well, I've watched some interviews with those people who were sign up for the Mars mission"
00:42:21,00:42:24,to go to Mars and a lot of them say things like
00:42:24,00:42:26,"I haven't really been able to find a girlfriend,"
00:42:26,00:42:27,so I don't really see any point.
00:42:27,00:42:30,I might find one of the Mars.
00:42:30,00:42:33,"Mum, Dad, nice to see you on the video."
00:42:33,00:42:37,"Like, this is Janice, she's a dead microbe, but she's mine and I love her."
00:42:37,00:42:42,She's a plastic replica of human skin.
00:42:42,00:42:44,"I think it would be scientists, right?"
00:42:44,00:42:45,It's like the same as Antarctica.
00:42:45,00:42:47,No one lives in Antarctica apart from scientists.
00:42:47,00:42:48,"So it would be the same, right?"
00:42:48,00:42:49,Yes.
00:42:49,00:42:53,But I read one article that said one of the advantages of going to the moon
00:42:53,00:42:56,is it might be so terrible that it will force us to accept
00:42:56,00:42:58,"that the Earth is the only decent place to live,"
00:42:58,00:43:00,and we'll make us look after the Earth better.
00:43:00,00:43:02,That is a good idea.
00:43:02,00:43:04,"I mean, the Earth is so much better than the moon."
00:43:04,00:43:06,It's better at some things.
00:43:06,00:43:08,"No, one thing the moon's better at."
00:43:08,00:43:12,"It's got better craters, I think."
00:43:12,00:43:14,That's what you're into.
00:43:14,00:43:15,We've got craters.
00:43:15,00:43:16,It's got better ones.
00:43:16,00:43:17,It's got bigger mountains.
00:43:17,00:43:19,"I'm not booking my ticket just yet, guys."
00:43:19,00:43:22,You guys are telling us the travel agents.
00:43:22,00:43:24,"The sky is always black as well,"
00:43:24,00:43:27,"which I don't think I would like, just because I guess I'm not used to it."
00:43:27,00:43:31,"But even in daytime, the 14 day day, the sky is totally black."
00:43:31,00:43:34,"I think that's really creepy, because the only reason the sky is blue"
00:43:34,00:43:39,"is because I can't even conceive of total broad daylight,"
00:43:39,00:43:41,but with the black sky.
00:43:41,00:43:42,"No, that doesn't make any sense."
00:43:42,00:43:43,It doesn't work.
00:43:43,00:43:44,I think that'd be right.
00:43:44,00:43:45,"Because it's bright, but it's dark."
00:43:45,00:43:46,"Bright, but it's black."
00:43:46,00:43:48,I think that can't be true.
00:43:48,00:43:49,That's weird.
00:43:49,00:43:50,It's true.
00:43:50,00:43:52,"You can't compute it, but it's the case."
00:43:52,00:43:53,Because what other...
00:43:53,00:43:55,"I mean, what are the colours that are going to be?"
00:43:55,00:43:57,"I don't believe you, I'm actually."
00:43:57,00:43:59,But it's too much for my brain to manage.
00:43:59,00:44:01,Do you know what the main problem would be if we...
00:44:01,00:44:04,"I mean, sorry, we've just been through about 15 of the main problems."
00:44:04,00:44:08,"But according to Eugene Sernan, who's the last man to walk on the moon,"
00:44:08,00:44:10,the main problem would be the dust.
00:44:10,00:44:14,They spent most of their time dusting on that last mission to the moon.
00:44:14,00:44:19,"Yeah, because they had like a vacuum cleaner to get all the dust off their stuff"
00:44:19,00:44:21,and it clogged up the black vacuum cleaner.
00:44:21,00:44:22,Really?
00:44:22,00:44:25,But you know what the main problem is.
00:44:25,00:44:28,So spots are going to be very difficult.
00:44:28,00:44:32,"And the reason is, you can jump and throw balls much better."
00:44:32,00:44:34,This is according to an article on space.com.
00:44:34,00:44:39,So you can throw a ball maybe like 10 to 6 times higher or 6 times further.
00:44:39,00:44:41,"But that means that your American football field,"
00:44:41,00:44:42,"which is what they were talking about,"
00:44:42,00:44:44,would have to be 600 yards long.
00:44:44,00:44:46,And so you need that space.
00:44:46,00:44:47,"Yeah, that's true."
00:44:47,00:44:49,You don't have the space because it's a small like planet.
00:44:49,00:44:54,"Tennis will be quite crap as well, because top spin doesn't work."
00:44:54,00:44:58,"So all the best, like in a Darls game is going to go completely to pot"
00:44:58,00:45:01,"because the reason top spin works is because of the,"
00:45:01,00:45:03,it's the Bernouille effect that I think we've mentioned before.
00:45:03,00:45:07,It's about how air pressure acts differently on one side of a spinning ball to the other.
00:45:07,00:45:12,And so that means that top spin brings the ball down into the court faster than it would otherwise go.
00:45:12,00:45:13,Because of this effect.
00:45:13,00:45:15,"And with no atmosphere on the moon, again,"
00:45:15,00:45:17,you're not having top spin working.
00:45:17,00:45:19,So all of them Darls shots go out.
00:45:19,00:45:20,What about cricket?
00:45:20,00:45:24,Is this possibly the one place where we can have a time we're going to have a fair cricket match?
00:45:24,00:45:26,Because there's no Australians.
00:45:26,00:45:32,And by the way guys our Brisbane date has really not so far.
00:45:32,00:45:34,We don't know why.
00:45:34,00:45:38,But Marion Bartoli might be able to work it out before anyone else.
00:45:38,00:45:40,That's why I'm thinking because she's so smart.
00:45:40,00:45:41,You're right.
00:45:41,00:45:44,Like she would be able to work out the trajectories and stuff.
00:45:44,00:45:45,The perfect way to hit it.
00:45:45,00:45:49,I'm actually interested in going to the moon a bit more now that we know that top spin doesn't work.
00:45:49,00:45:52,Because it just levels that playing field when I'm playing a little bit.
00:45:52,00:45:58,So there wasn't going in 1964 who made a bet.
00:45:58,00:46:00,He was a British man called David Thrillfall.
00:46:00,00:46:05,And you remember President Kennedy promised in about 1961 we're going to get to the moon by the end of the decade.
00:46:05,00:46:06,Yes.
00:46:06,00:46:08,And they squeaked in in 1969.
00:46:08,00:46:14,He bet in 1964 that a man would get to the moon before the end of the decade.
00:46:14,00:46:16,And William Hill gave mods of a thousand to one.
00:46:16,00:46:18,But they did take the bet.
00:46:18,00:46:23,And when they landed on the moon he was taken to a TV studio and he became a minor celebrity.
00:46:23,00:46:26,"He was presented with a check for £1,000 which was a lot of money at the time."
00:46:26,00:46:28,"It was about £180,000 in today's money."
00:46:28,00:46:34,And the really tragic thing was he died the next year in a crash of the car that he bought with the winnings.
00:46:34,00:46:35,No.
00:46:35,00:46:37,"Oh, that's awful."
00:46:37,00:46:38,It's just that story.
00:46:38,00:46:40,"Oh, thank you for telling us."
00:46:40,00:46:43,Should we end on that?
00:46:43,00:46:45,I looked into if you moved to the moon.
00:46:45,00:46:52,There's a lot of stuff that is left there by previous missions that you can collect to make your house a bit more interesting.
00:46:52,00:46:57,It's not interesting enough that you're the only person living on the moon.
00:46:57,00:46:58,"Oh, yeah."
00:46:58,00:46:59,I need to have a space.
00:46:59,00:47:00,Some boots.
00:47:00,00:47:02,Some bagged up pieces.
00:47:02,00:47:05,"Well, come around to my house town."
00:47:05,00:47:07,You can have bagged up pieces in your own home.
00:47:07,00:47:08,Very easy.
00:47:08,00:47:09,You've got a baby.
00:47:09,00:47:11,You should know all about that.
00:47:11,00:47:14,My house is bagged up pieces of the moon.
00:47:14,00:47:17,There's some Andy Wool warhol art up on the moon.
00:47:17,00:47:18,"Oh, wow."
00:47:18,00:47:19,Yeah.
00:47:19,00:47:20,There's a cock and balls that he drew.
00:47:20,00:47:21,He drew a cock and balls.
00:47:21,00:47:24,He paraded it as his initials and A and a W.
00:47:24,00:47:25,It artistically done.
00:47:25,00:47:28,The W was upside down and the A.
00:47:28,00:47:30,"Well, that sounds like an M and an A."
00:47:30,00:47:31,And it's what it looks like as well.
00:47:31,00:47:32,Yeah.
00:47:32,00:47:33,Yeah.
00:47:33,00:47:34,"Excuse me, confusing."
00:47:34,00:47:35,Andy Murray's painting.
00:47:35,00:47:38,Yeah.
00:47:38,00:47:41,If you do it like that.
00:47:41,00:47:42,Andy Wool.
00:47:42,00:47:43,Yes.
00:47:43,00:47:44,You're right.
00:47:44,00:47:45,Yeah.
00:47:45,00:47:46,So that's how it comes.
00:47:46,00:47:47,And that's why I thought it looked like an M.
00:47:47,00:47:48,But he's right.
00:47:48,00:47:51,"No, you've just been having that work of our upside down."
00:47:51,00:47:52,I've been looking at an upside down.
00:47:52,00:47:53,You've hung it wrong.
00:47:53,00:47:54,It's badly hung.
00:47:54,00:48:00,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:00,00:48:01,Yeah.
00:48:01,00:48:04,"So this was a kind of, it was a mini little piece of art"
00:48:04,00:48:07,where six different artists contributed to it.
00:48:07,00:48:08,Andy Warhol was one of them.
00:48:08,00:48:11,And it was put on this way for a small size little thing
00:48:11,00:48:13,that was meant to be taken up.
00:48:13,00:48:14,But NASA disagreed for it.
00:48:14,00:48:15,So what's happening?
00:48:15,00:48:16,Let's just try.
00:48:16,00:48:17,Why are you drawing more cock and balls?
00:48:17,00:48:18,"Well, I've just worked out."
00:48:18,00:48:19,My name is Andrew Murray.
00:48:19,00:48:20,And look at that.
00:48:20,00:48:21,That's an A and an M.
00:48:21,00:48:23,And it also looks like it.
00:48:23,00:48:26,I think I've got a new signature for the next book.
00:48:26,00:48:27,My driving license.
00:48:27,00:48:29,People are going to be so happy.
00:48:29,00:48:32,[LAUGHTER]
00:48:32,00:48:33,"Put that down, Andy."
00:48:33,00:48:34,Go on down.
00:48:34,00:48:41,"Yeah, so they submitted it as wanting to take it to the moon."
00:48:41,00:48:42,But it was rejected.
00:48:42,00:48:44,But it was actually smuggled up there.
00:48:44,00:48:46,"A lot of smuggling happened, yeah."
00:48:46,00:48:49,"In the early days, like Buzz Aldrin, I think,"
00:48:49,00:48:52,smuggled up the communion that he brought up to the moon
00:48:52,00:48:53,and so on.
00:48:53,00:48:54,People did like to smuggle stuff.
00:48:54,00:48:55,So you can get a communion.
00:48:55,00:48:56,How do you communion?
00:48:56,00:48:57,He's called it.
00:48:57,00:48:58,How do you communion?
00:48:58,00:48:59,You're right.
00:48:59,00:49:00,Very nice.
00:49:00,00:49:01,So Andy Warhol art is up there.
00:49:01,00:49:05,There's also a feather from a falcon up there.
00:49:05,00:49:08,"Just a single feather, which is really cool."
00:49:08,00:49:10,It was done as part of an experiment.
00:49:10,00:49:11,"Oh, yeah, I remember that."
00:49:11,00:49:12,"Yeah, the Apollo 12 experiment."
00:49:12,00:49:15,What they wanted to do was recreate the idea of seeing
00:49:15,00:49:17,whether or not the idea of a bowling ball.
00:49:17,00:49:18,And what was it?
00:49:18,00:49:22,So Galileo supposedly dropped two balls
00:49:22,00:49:26,from the leaning tower of pizza.
00:49:26,00:49:27,Yeah.
00:49:27,00:49:30,And they landed at the same time because it's independent of mass.
00:49:30,00:49:33,And they tried it with the bowling ball and the feather.
00:49:33,00:49:34,He proved that it was true.
00:49:34,00:49:36,"Yeah, a hammer and a feather on the moon."
00:49:36,00:49:37,Yeah.
00:49:37,00:49:39,"I mean, to take it, yeah, if the most powerful rocket"
00:49:39,00:49:41,"can only take three men and a bit of a kit to the moon,"
00:49:41,00:49:44,taking a bowling ball seems like it needed to be fabulous.
00:49:44,00:49:48,"But yeah, it was the Air Force Academy's falcon mascot."
00:49:48,00:49:51,They have the mascots and they plucked off one of its feathers.
00:49:51,00:49:52,And that still lives on the moon.
00:49:52,00:49:53,So I could be part of your house.
00:49:53,00:49:56,"So just to be clear, is that because there's no air resistance?"
00:49:56,00:49:57,"Because obviously if you drop hammer and a feather,"
00:49:57,00:49:59,the feather will float down because of air resistance.
00:49:59,00:50:00,"It's on Earth, it would, yeah."
00:50:00,00:50:02,"But on the moon, they drop at the same."
00:50:02,00:50:03,That's cool.
00:50:03,00:50:04,Yeah.
00:50:04,00:50:07,I was just looking at things that we'd have to train to learn
00:50:07,00:50:09,to do when we get to the moon.
00:50:09,00:50:11,And I don't think we've mentioned before that all astronauts
00:50:11,00:50:14,at the moment who go into space have to do toilet training.
00:50:14,00:50:16,So you have to be read toilet trained.
00:50:16,00:50:17,Really?
00:50:17,00:50:18,Have we talked about this?
00:50:18,00:50:19,No.
00:50:19,00:50:20,Because I didn't know that.
00:50:20,00:50:22,So they've forgotten how to do it.
00:50:22,00:50:24,It makes you forget how to urinate.
00:50:24,00:50:25,Yeah.
00:50:25,00:50:29,So you can't have the same design lose in space because stuff
00:50:29,00:50:30,might kind of get out of them.
00:50:30,00:50:33,"So when you sit on the loo, it's a very, very small aperture"
00:50:33,00:50:35,that you have to aim your stuff into.
00:50:35,00:50:39,So the opening of a toilet in space is four inches wide.
00:50:39,00:50:43,"And usually I lose 18 inches wide, like 15 to 18 inches wide."
00:50:43,00:50:45,"That's not four inches, Andy."
00:50:45,00:50:46,No.
00:50:46,00:50:48,"Oh, I thought it was."
00:50:48,00:50:52,Disappointing the ale around.
00:50:52,00:50:58,So NASA has specially designed toilet training room
00:50:58,00:51:00,is at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston.
00:51:00,00:51:03,And it's actually got two different toilets in it.
00:51:03,00:51:05,So in this room it's got a positional toilet.
00:51:05,00:51:06,And that's not functional.
00:51:06,00:51:09,That's just so you learn how to position yourself properly on the toilet.
00:51:09,00:51:10,And actually that's--
00:51:10,00:51:11,"Oh, no."
00:51:11,00:51:14,I'm sure some training astronauts have mistaken the position
00:51:14,00:51:17,of one way or just practicing for the function of life
00:51:17,00:51:20,"when you go at the showroom, at the bathroom showroom."
00:51:20,00:51:22,I don't know.
00:51:22,00:51:23,Is that a thing?
00:51:23,00:51:24,And I just try this one out.
00:51:24,00:51:26,"That's a comedy trope, isn't it?"
00:51:26,00:51:27,Is it?
00:51:27,00:51:29,That's where you've got kicked out of IKEA that time.
00:51:29,00:51:30,It's true.
00:51:30,00:51:33,"So yeah, you've got the show toilet and that tests your aim"
00:51:33,00:51:35,and it's got a little camera inside it that looks up at you.
00:51:35,00:51:38,So you can then review the footage afterwards to check
00:51:38,00:51:39,that you've aimed right.
00:51:39,00:51:41,"And then when you're ready for it, you can turn this on"
00:51:41,00:51:44,"to the actual function on toilet, which is also in the training room"
00:51:44,00:51:46,where you can practice how to flash and stuff.
00:51:46,00:51:47,"Okay, I have a question."
00:51:47,00:51:51,Are there any astronauts who have aced every single other metric
00:51:51,00:51:53,but just haven't been allowed to go to space for the toilet?
00:51:53,00:51:54,That's not.
00:51:54,00:51:55,That's not.
00:51:55,00:51:57,Always ends up on the floor.
00:51:57,00:51:58,I don't know.
00:51:58,00:51:59,That must be right.
00:51:59,00:52:00,Like if you can't do that.
00:52:00,00:52:01,That's true.
00:52:01,00:52:02,You have to pass.
00:52:02,00:52:03,You have to-- that's one of them.
00:52:03,00:52:05,"Actually, that's probably one of the more important things"
00:52:05,00:52:07,to get right in a spaceship.
00:52:07,00:52:09,"Well, flying the rocket is quite important."
00:52:09,00:52:10,Come on.
00:52:10,00:52:12,They've probably got autopilot stuff today.
00:52:12,00:52:15,"But if you've got a cabin full of poo floating around,"
00:52:15,00:52:18,that is a hooster and we have a big problem.
00:52:18,00:52:23,"Okay, that's it."
00:52:23,00:52:24,That is all of our facts.
